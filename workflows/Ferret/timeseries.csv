In recent decades, there has been an evidence that it can infect humans. Highly pathogenic coronavirus, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), are fatal zoonotic viruses, which have posed a major threat to public health. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19) has also seriously endangered the health and safety of the human beings. These coronaviruses transmit through close contact between people, resulting in the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure (MOF) and having a higher morbidity and mortality. This article reviews the structure, epidemiology, immunology and treatment of the coronavirus, hoping to provide reference for the prevention, control and treatment of the disease.

On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century. As of 1 March 2020, a total of 87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of China, with 2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO. Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to ?-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host. The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract. Importantly, increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the globe. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms. The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation. In this review, we summarized the latest research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.","The origin, transmission and clinical therapies on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak – an update on the status","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/about /license ","2054-9369","BMC","EN","Military Medical Research","2020-03-15T12:19:41","Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging and Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imaging",,

The virus spread rapidly and public health authorities in China initiated a containment effort. However, by that time, travelers had carried the virus to many countries, sparking memories of the previous coronavirus epidemics, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and causing widespread media attention and panic. Based on clinical criteria and available serological and molecular information, the new disease was called coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), and the novel coronavirus was called SARS Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), emphasizing its close relationship to the 2002 SARS virus (SARS-CoV). The scientific community raced to uncover the origin of the virus, understand the pathogenesis of the disease, develop treatment options, define the risk factors, and work on vaccine development.

These three structures and the coronavirus particles were shown to be positive for viral proteins and RNA by using ultrastructural immunogold and in situ hybridization assays. In addition, ultrastructural examination of a bronchiolar lavage specimen from a SARS patient showed numerous coronavirus-infected cells with features similar to those in infected culture cells.

Methods: Based on recently published literature, official documents and selected up-to-date preprint studies, we reviewed the virology and origin, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathology and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection, in comparison with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Results: The genome of 2019-nCoV partially resembled SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and indicated a bat origin. The COVID-19 generally had a high reproductive number, a long incubation period, a short serial interval and a low case fatality rate (much higher in patients with comorbidities) than SARS and MERS. Clinical presentation and pathology of COVID-19 greatly resembled SARS and MERS, with less upper respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, and more exudative lesions in post-mortems. Potential treatments included remdesivir, chloroquine, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma and vaccine immunization (when possible). Conclusion: The initial experience from the current pandemic and lessons from the previous two pandemics can help improve future preparedness plans and combat disease progression.","Insight into 2019 novel coronavirus — An updated interim review and lessons from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV","NL",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","http://www.elsevier.com/journals/international-journal-of-infectious-diseases/1201-9712/open-access-journal","1201-9712","Elsevier","EN","International Journal of Infectious Diseases","2020-04-25T05:14:18","Department of Geriatrics / Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China; National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China",,

First, PLP is one of the two viral cysteine proteases, along with 3-chymotripsin-like protease, that is responsible for the production of the replicase proteins required for viral replication. Second, its intrinsic deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities serve to antagonize the host’s immune response that would otherwise hinder infection. Both deubiquitinating and deISGylating functions involve the removal of the small regulatory polypeptides, ubiquitin and ISG15, respectively, from target proteins. Ubiquitin modifications can regulate the innate immune response by affecting regulatory proteins, either by altering their stability via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway or by directly regulating their activity. ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like modifier with pleiotropic effects, typically expressed during the host cell immune response. PLP inhibitors have been evaluated during past coronavirus epidemics, and have showed promising results as an antiviral therapy in vitro. In this review, we recapitulate the roles of PLPs in coronavirus infections, report a list of PLP inhibitors and suggest possible therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 treatment, using both clinical and preclinical drugs.","Deubiquitinating Enzymes in Coronaviruses and Possible Therapeutic Opportunities for COVID-19","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms/about under Copyright/Open Access section","1422-0067","MDPI AG","EN","International Journal of Molecular Sciences","2020-05-16T00:01:03","Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, University of Bologna, 40138 Bologna, Italy",1,

The first coronaviruses – members of the Coronaviridae family belonging to the order Nidovirales — were discovered in the first half of the last century. The first human coronavirus, HCoV-B814, was isolated in 1965 that was not preserved in available virological collections. Over the last time, old-fashioned names and terms have been overlapped. By the beginning of the XXI century coronaviruses posed a serious veterinary problem but it was believed that epidemic coronaviruses were not among highly dangerous viruses. Scientific community had to revise such views first in 2002 when SARS-CoV (Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus) was transferred to human population in the Southeast Asia from bats, and then in 2012 when natural foci of the MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus) were found on the territory of the Arabian Peninsula. Due to an increased interest in coronaviruses, a large number of new Coronaviridae members was discovered in the first two decades of the XXI century, which required to revise its taxonomic structure several times. This review is aimed at outlining a history of investigating coronaviruses and their current classification that was shaped in early 2020 in accordance to the last recommendations of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.","History of investigation and current classification of coronaviruses (<i>Nidovirales: Coronaviridae</i>)","RU",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://iimmun.ru/index.php/iimm/about/submissions#copyrightNotice","2220-7619","Sankt-Peterburg : NIIÈM imeni Pastera","RU","Infekciâ i Immunitet","2020-05-18T16:28:55","International Scientific and Educational Center for Biological Security of Rospotrebnadzor; Federal Scientific Center of East Asia Terrestrial Biodiversity, Far Eastern Branch of RAS; Center of Hygiene and Epidemiology in the Primorsky Territory",,

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the newly evolving human coronavirus infection that causes COVID-19, and it first appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread rapidly all over the world. COVID-19 is being increasingly investigated through virology, epidemiology, and clinical management strategies. There is currently no established consensus on the standard of care in the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 patients. However, certain medications suggested for other diseases have been shown to be potentially effective for treating this infection, though there has yet to be clear evidence. Therapies include new agents that are currently tested in several clinical trials, in addition to other medications that have been repurposed as antiviral and immune-modulating therapies. Previous high-morbidity human coronavirus epidemics such as the 2003 SARS-CoV and the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) prompted the identification of compounds that could theoretically be active against the emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, advances in molecular biology techniques and computational analysis have allowed for the better recognition of the virus structure and the quicker screening of chemical libraries to suggest potential therapies. This review aims to summarize rationalized pharmacotherapy considerations in COVID-19 patients in order to serve as a tool for health care professionals at the forefront of clinical care during this pandemic. All the reviewed therapies require either additional drug development or randomized large-scale clinical trials to be justified for clinical use.","The Rationale for Potential Pharmacotherapy of COVID-19","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceuticals/about","1424-8247","MDPI AG","EN","Pharmaceuticals","2020-05-15T00:01:58","Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Medicine, University of Sharjah, Sharjah 27272, UAE",1,

After extensive speculation, eventually a new species of coronavirus introduced as the causative pathogen of the disease. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a name for the disease, and the virus that causes it is known SARS-CoV-2. The very rapid spread of the COVID-19 in China and in many other countries has caused fear among people across the world. The novel coronavirus outbreak declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020.
Materials and Methods: Several databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Google scholar, and BioRxiv were searched for publications reporting on the novel coronavirus up to 29 February 2020. Literature searches were performed using keywords including “Coronavirus 2019”, “2019-nCoV”, “COVID-19”, and
“SARS-CoV-2”. Moreover, websites such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were searched to retrieve updated data and statistics regarding the novel coronavirus. We extracted data on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, virology, clinical manifestations, transmission routes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention measures.
Results: From the 1416 articles identified in the initial search, 53 were remained after title and abstract screening. After full-text review, 37 articles were eligible to include in our study. Incubation period for
COVID-19 is between 2-10 days, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The case fatality rate in patients infected with SARC-CoV-2 is 4.3%, and the results indicate that the mortality is higher in elderly individuals and patients with chronic conditions including patients with coronary artery disease, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, and hypertension. The mortality rate in healthy subjects is less than 1%.
Conclusion: The outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus is larger than the previous human coronaviruses, showing that the SARS-CoV-2 is an extremely contagious virus. However, the mortality rate of COVID-19 is lower than that of other coronaviruses diseases such as SARS or MERS and other viruses like HIV and Ebola. Currently, due to the lack of an effective treatment and vaccine, the best way to deal with the
COVID-19 disease is to prevent transmission and spread of the virus and to execute personal protective measures.","Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): An Emerging Infectious Disease in the 21st Century","IR",1,"CC BY-NC","CC BY-NC","http://ismj.bpums.ac.ir/find.php?item=1.70.25.en","1735-4374","Bushehr University of Medical Sciences","EN","Iranian South Medical Journal ","2020-03-05T11:15:23","

From the analysis of distribution data, the endemic presence of malaria seems to protect some populations from COVID-19 outbreak, particularly in the least developed countries. In this sense, molecular and genetic variations associated with malaria (e.g., in ACE2) might play a protective role against coronavirus infection. Moreover, the mechanism of action of some antimalarial drugs, e.g., the antiviral function, suggests their potential role in the chemoprophylaxis of coronavirus epidemics, despite possible adverse effects (e.g., retinal toxicity). All these data provide important insights to understand the spreading mechanisms of COVID-19, and to direct scientific research toward the study of some currently available medications.","Global Spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Malaria: An Epidemiological Paradox in the Early Stage of A Pandemic","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcm/about","2077-0383","MDPI AG","EN","Journal of Clinical Medicine","2020-04-17T00:00:31","Department of Surgical Science, Eye Clinic, University of Cagliari, 09124 Cagliari, Italy",1,

The virus started to expand rapidly so that doctors in Wuhan Hospital reported the phenomenon to China’s CDC and WHO. The research articles began to publish online from the first of January.  The Coronavirus news spread out as quickly as the virus. The virus was named new coronavirus 2019 (nCoV 2019). In January 7, 2020 the disease caused by the virus was identified as CoVID 19 (1). The altmetrics database indicates the first mentions to the peer reviewed articles about coronavirus has been tracked in social media like Twitter and Facebook since January 16,2020. The majority of mentions aggregated from the public profiles. The scientists, practitioners (like doctors) and science communicators (like journalists) were the other group of people who mentioned the scientific articles. This could be a dangerous sign for risk communication, at the same time. The public are the main group who follow the news and information on the social media but not all of the public know how to distinguish misinformation from the truth.&nbsp;  In January 30, the coronavirus was identified as a global health threat requiring collaboration of all countries (2). In February, the virus spread out of the China and immediately became the headline of news media. In Mach 8,2020 the China health department claimed that the outbreak has been controlled and Wuhan closed makeshift hospitals(4,5) but the disease surges in Iran. The first cases of coronavirus were formally reported in 19 February 2020 in Qum city of Iran (3). At the moment, the highest rank of mortality caused by the pandemic relates to Italy, Iran, and South Korea (6). People surf the web and social media impatiently for information on cause, transmission, control and prevention of coronavirus disease (CoViD 19).&nbsp; They often use and re-publish the information they find online before recognizing their trustworthiness and the evidence behind them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The open access and democratic nature of health communication in social media and the Internet provide opportunity for distribution of myths and truths about coronavirus. Distribution of misinformation among public, damages public health and creates distrust to authorized sources of information. Therefore, misinformation epidemic is more dangerous than the crises.  Goffman in 1964 (13) and then Eysenbach recognized and introduced the prevalence of misinformation epidemic through online health information seeking in 2002 (7). He found that most of health information that disseminate during epidemic in social media and internet disagree the evidence (8,9). He called the methods of identifying, studying and management of misinformation as infodemiology. Infodemiology progresses in crises, specially the public health crises, in which abundant of misinformation becomes accessible for public and creates complexity instead of solving the problem.  WHO director in the Munich Security Conference held in 15 February doubted about distribution of misinformation about the epidemic of coronavirus and called it the infodemic by declaring that we are not fighting an epidemic, we are fighting infodemic and this requires global collaboration (10,11).  In crises, public informing of the methods of evaluation of information resources is not a right strategy for tackling with dissemination of misinformation. Novel strategies are needed to tackle with new infodemic crises and to assure that right information disseminated from the trusted sources to people at the right time. We also need to guarantee that people take the right action by receiving the right information in coronavirus epidemic. Hence, the WHO’s Risk Communication Team launched a new information platform called WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) (2). One of the methods that this team follows is identifying misinformation in social media, searching and finding related scientific evidence with them from sources such as scientific papers and publishing them on EPIWIN website to provide accurate information for information hunger of the people. Today, infodemic crises have become one of the priorities of health decision making authorities in the world.

Several non-feline coronaviruses have been reported to infect feline cells as well as cats after experimental infection, supported by their ability to engage the feline receptor ortholog for cell entry. However, whether cats might become naturally infected with CoVs of other species is unknown. We analyzed coronavirus infections in cats by serological monitoring. In total 137 cat serum samples and 25 FCoV type 1 or type 2-specific antisera were screened for the presence of antibodies against the S1 receptor binding subunit of the CoV spike protein, which is immunogenic and possesses low amino acid sequence identity among coronavirus species. Seventy-eight sera were positive for antibodies that recognized one or more coronavirus S1s whereas 1 serum exclusively reacted with human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and two sera exclusively reacted with porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV). We observed antigenic cross-reactivity between S1s of type 1 and type 2 FCoVs, and between FCoV type 1 and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Domain mapping of antibody epitopes indicated the presence of conserved epitope(s) particularly in the CD domains of S1. The cross-reactivity of FCoV type 1 and PEDV was also observed at the level of virus neutralization. To conclude, we provide the first evidence of antigenic cross-reactivity among S1 proteins of coronaviruses, which should be considered in the development of serological diagnoses. In addition, the potential role of cats in cross-species transmission of coronaviruses cannot be excluded.","Serological Screening for Coronavirus Infections in Cats","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses/about","1999-4915","MDPI AG","EN","Viruses","2019-08-15T10:17:13","Virology Division, Department of Infectious Diseases &amp; Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, Yalelaan 1, 3584CL Utrecht, The Netherlands",1,

At the end of 2019, a new type of virus was detected in China. The virus has been spread by humantohuman transmission and has caused a viral pneumonia outbreak. The emergence of a new coronavirus proves that the diseases caused by this group of viruses pose a threat to global health due to the potential for a pandemic, and, therefore, need careful monitoring. The objective of the study was to analyse the current epidemic situation for the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, taking into account previous outbreaks of infections caused by MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV ?-coronaviruses which pose the greatest threat to human health. The review briefly describes two epidemic outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV (2002–2004) and MERS-CoV (2012–present), summarises the current epidemic situation for the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, describes the main restrictive measures undertaken to prevent the spread of infection in Russia. The paper considers aspects of potential specific therapy and the development of prophylactic vaccines against the new coronavirus infection. The review concludes that SARS-CoV-2 has pandemic potential and that new strains of ?-coronaviruses are likely to cause outbreaks in the future. The paper points to the need for careful monitoring of the disease and conducting preventive anti-epidemic measures to curb the spread of infection.","An Outbreak of a New Infectious Disease COVID-19: ?-coronaviruses as a Threat to Global Healthcare","RU",1,"CC BY","CC BY","https://www.biopreparations.ru/jour/about/submissions#copyrightNotice","2221-996X","Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation.

Under some common assumptions and justifiable simplifications, a few simple equations incorporating the evolution rate (K) and time of the last common ancestor of the strains (T<sub>0</sub>) can be deduced. We then implemented the least square method to estimate K and T<sub>0 </sub>from the dataset of sequences and corresponding times. Monte Carlo stimulation was employed to discuss the results.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>Based on 6 strains with accurate dates of host death, we estimated the time of the last common ancestor to be about August or September 2002, and the evolution rate to be about 0.16 base/day, that is, the SARS coronavirus would on average change a base every seven days. We validated our method by dividing the strains into two groups, which coincided with the results from comparative genomics.</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>The applied method is simple to implement and avoid the difficulty and subjectivity of choosing the root of phylogenetic tree. Based on 6 strains with accurate date of host death, we estimated a time of the last common ancestor, which is coincident with epidemic investigations, and an evolution rate in the same range as that reported for the HIV-1 virus.</p> ","Date of origin of the SARS coronavirus strains","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/about","1471-2334","BMC","EN","BMC Infectious Diseases","2004-06-03T00:00:00",,1,

Several coronaviruses, such as Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), are of medical importance, with high mortality rates and, in the case of SARS-CoV, significant pandemic potential. Other coronaviruses, such as Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and Avian coronavirus, are important livestock pathogens. Ribosome profiling is a technique which exploits the capacity of the translating ribosome to protect around 30 nucleotides of mRNA from ribonuclease digestion. Ribosome-protected mRNA fragments are purified, subjected to deep sequencing and mapped back to the transcriptome to give a global snap-shot of translation. Parallel RNA sequencing allows normalization by transcript abundance. Here we apply ribosome profiling to cells infected with Murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus, strain A59 (MHV-A59), a model coronavirus in the same genus as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The data obtained allowed us to study the kinetics of virus transcription and translation with exquisite precision. We studied the timecourse of positive and negative-sense genomic and subgenomic viral RNA production and the relative translation efficiencies of the different virus ORFs. Virus mRNAs were not found to be translated more efficiently than host mRNAs; rather, virus translation dominates host translation at later time points due to high levels of virus transcripts. Triplet phasing of the profiling data allowed precise determination of translated reading frames and revealed several translated short open reading frames upstream of, or embedded within, known virus protein-coding regions. Ribosome pause sites were identified in the virus replicase polyprotein pp1a ORF and investigated experimentally. Contrary to expectations, ribosomes were not found to pause at the ribosomal frameshift site. To our knowledge this is the first application of ribosome profiling to an RNA virus.","High-Resolution Analysis of Coronavirus Gene Expression by RNA Sequencing and Ribosome Profiling.","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/s/content-license","1553-7366","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","EN","PLoS Pathogens","2016-06-14T16:03:59",,1,

Among 1779 bat samples collected in China, diverse coronaviruses were detected in 32 samples from five different bat species by RT-PCR. Two novel alphacoronaviruses, <i>Rhinolophus sinicus</i> bat coronavirus HKU32 (Rs-BatCoV HKU32) and <i>Tylonycteris robustula</i> bat coronavirus HKU33 (Tr-BatCoV HKU33), were discovered from Chinese horseshoe bats in Hong Kong and greater bamboo bats in Guizhou Province, respectively.

The close relatedness of Rs-BatCoV HKU32 to BatCoV HKU10 which was also detected in Pomona roundleaf bats from the same country park suggests that these viruses may have the tendency of infecting genetically distant bat populations of close geographical proximity with subsequent genetic divergence. Moreover, the presence of SARSr-CoV ORF7a-like protein in Rs-BatCoV HKU32 suggests a common evolutionary origin of this accessory protein with SARS-CoV, also from Chinese horseshoe bats, an apparent reservoir for coronavirus epidemics.

Further investigation revealed these cases to result from infection with a newly identified coronavirus, initially termed 2019-nCoV and subsequently SARS-CoV-2. The infection moved rapidly through China, spread to Thailand and Japan, extended into adjacent countries through infected persons travelling by air, eventually reaching multiple countries and continents. Similar to such other coronaviruses as those causing the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the new coronavirus was reported to spread via natural aerosols from human-to-human. In the early stages of this epidemic the case fatality rate is estimated to be approximately 2%, with the majority of deaths occurring in special populations. Unfortunately, there is limited experience with coronavirus infections during pregnancy, and it now appears certain that pregnant women have become infected during the present 2019-nCoV epidemic.

Respiratory physiotherapy in patients with COVID-19 infection in acute setting: a Position Paper of the Italian Association of Respiratory Physiotherapists (ARIR)


On February 2020, Italy, especially the northern regions, was hit by an epidemic of the new SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus that spread from China between December 2019 and January 2020. The entire healthcare system had to respond promptly in a very short time to an exponential growth of the number of subjects affected by COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) with the need of semi-intensive and intensive care units.

Methods In this study, we used a second derivative model to characterize the coronavirus epidemic in China with cumulatively diagnosed cases during the first 2 months. The analysis was further enhanced by an exponential model with a close-population assumption. This model was built with the data and used to assess the detection rate during the study period, considering the differences between the true infections, detectable and detected cases. Results Results from the second derivative modeling suggest the coronavirus epidemic as nonlinear and chaotic in nature. Although it emerged gradually, the epidemic was highly responsive to massive interventions initiated on January 21, 2020, as indicated by results from both second derivative and exponential modeling analyses. The epidemic started to decelerate immediately after the massive actions. The results derived from our analysis signaled the decline of the epidemic 14?days before it eventually occurred on February 4, 2020. Study findings further signaled an accelerated decline in the epidemic starting in 14?days on February 18, 2020. Conclusions The coronavirus epidemic appeared to be nonlinear and chaotic, and was responsive to effective interventions. The methods used in this study can be applied in surveillance to inform and encourage the general public, public health professionals, clinicians and decision-makers to take coordinative and collaborative efforts to control the epidemic.","First two months of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) epidemic in China: real-time surveillance and evaluation with a second derivative model","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://ghrp.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/copyright","2397-0642","BMC","EN","Global Health Research and Policy","2020-03-08T12:27:51","Department of Epidemiology, University of Florida",1,

There is no valid information available on pregnant women and their complications. But given previous epidemics (SARS and MERS), as well as mental and physical changes during pregnancy (2), pregnant women are more likely to be exposed.

On the other hand, the Coronavirus epidemic has created stress and anxiety for pregnant women in different parts of the world. Concern and stress in pregnancy are associated with side effects such as preeclampsia, preterm labor, depression, low birth weight, increased nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, preterm labor, low birth weight, low APGAR (3-5).

In the Coronavirus pandemic, pregnant women cited the following causes of their concerns:

- Many pregnant women have had a birth plan before pandemic, but are currently worried about how their families (mothers) will be present, given the urban and quarantine constraints, moreover, even if there is no inter-urban restriction, they may be worried about their families being transferred in transit.

- Many pregnant women do not go to work due to concerns that they may be exposed to Coronavirus due to the hospital environment or the route of the hospital and may be postterm. Or even vice versa, because of stress and worry they want an early termination and elective cesarean section.
- Many pregnant mothers are employed, constantly using sodium hypochlorite and alcohol detergents to control and prevent the virus, which can lead to poisoning. Some other pregnant mothers, on the other hand, become obsessed with stress and anxiety and are more likely to use these detergents.

Some mothers are worried about their fetal or their neonate being born. Also, some mothers worry about postpartum such as breastfeeding, neonatal care (postpartum vaccination, screening).
Increasing mothers 'awareness about the transmission of Coronavirus, risk factors, red flags , as well as providing tele counselling for pregnancy care and tele-triage help reduce anxiety and worry. It is also recommended that in cities where home birth and home services are available after birth and home care services, the medical team should provide these services at home while maintaining safety.","Coronavirus Pandemic and Worries during Pregnancy; a Letter to Editor","IR",1,"CC BY-NC","CC BY-NC","http://journals.sbmu.ac.ir/aaem/index.php/AAEM/about/submissions#copyrightNotice","2645-4904","Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences","EN","Archives of Academic Emergency Medicine","2020-04-21T06:50:25","Student Research Committee, Department of Midwifery and Reproductive Health, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.",,

It is well-known that the estimation of this number may vary due to several methodological issues, including different assumptions and choice of parameters, utilized models, used datasets and estimation period. With the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019-nCoV need to be revised. By using time-dependent contact and diagnose rates, we refit our previously proposed dynamics transmission model to the data available until January 29th, 2020 and re-estimated the effective daily reproduction ratio that better quantifies the evolution of the interventions. We estimated when the effective daily reproduction ratio has fallen below 1 and when the epidemics will peak. Our updated findings suggest that the best measure is persistent and strict self-isolation. The epidemics will continue to grow, and can peak soon with the peak time depending highly on the public health interventions practically implemented.

Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO)  expressed its concerns about the Coronavirus crisis (2). This crisis caused production and publication of large amounts of valid and invalid information, eventually leading to information obesity phenomenon. Information obesity can have many negative consequences on the general population, causing major problems for governments, especially if the amount of invalid information is too large. It is worth to mention that however almost impossible, controlling and monitoring media is a massive challenge for different governments. Hence, individuals should protect themselves against unreliable information, and pursue an authentic “information diet”. In the present study, authors have explained and interpreted the concept of the information diet, proposed by Johnson, based on scientific evidence, observation of media news and the social media environment, to help maintain the use of valid information in facing the new Coronavirus crisis.","Information Diet in Covid-19 Crisis; a Commentary","IR",1,"CC BY-NC","CC BY-NC","http://journals.sbmu.ac.ir/aaem/index.php/AAEM/about/submissions#copyrightNotice","2645-4904","Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences","EN","Archives of Academic Emergency Medicine","2020-04-21T06:50:25","Associate Professor, Medical Library and Information Science Department, Health Information Technology Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.",,

Los autores revisan los datos de la literatura sobre los hallazgos de coronavirus en el SNC asociado a enfermedades neurológicas. Desarrollo: En las distintas epidemias con SARS-CoV y MERS-CoV la presencia de cuadros neurológicos es baja, pero se describen cuadros aislados de pacientes. También existen casos asociados a OC43-CoV y 229E-CoV. La existencia de lesiones neurológicas, especialmente desmielinizantes en el modelo MHV-CoV pueden explicar mecanismos de penetración de los CoV en el SNC y especialmente aquellos relacionados con la respuesta inmune, que puede justificar la existencia de CoV en pacientes con esclerosis múltiple. Los autores revisan aspectos diferenciales de SARS-CoV-2 y se plantean si debido al alto número de infectados, el virus puede afectar de forma mayor al SNC. Conclusión: Aunque la presencia de síntomas neurológicos en las epidemias de CoV es baja, la mayor frecuencia de infectados por SARS-CoV-2 podría justificar el paso del virus y la posibilidad de clínica neurológica precoz o tardía con mayor incidencia.

Abstract:  Introduction: There is growing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can gain access to the central nervous system (CNS). We revise the literature on coronavirus infection of the CNS associated with neurological diseases. Development: Neurological symptoms were rarely reported in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, although isolated cases were described. There are also reports of cases of neurological symptoms associated with CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E infection. The presence of neurological lesions, especially demyelinating lesions in the mouse hepatitis virus model, may explain the mechanisms by which coronaviruses enter the CNS, particularly those related with the immune response. This may explain the presence of coronavirus in patients with multiple sclerosis. We review the specific characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and address the question of whether the high number of cases may be associated with greater CNS involvement. Conclusion: Although neurological symptoms are not frequent in coronavirus epidemics, the high number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain the presence of the virus in the CNS and increase the likelihood of early- or delayed-onset neurological symptoms. Follow-up of patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic should include careful assessment of the CNS.

This study aimed to measure the level of knowledge, attitude and practice about Coronavirus, to correlate the sociodemographic characteristics to the level of knowledge, attitude and practice about Coronavirus, and to explore awareness and health behaviors related to the prevention of Coronavirus.


Method: A national adaptive cross-sectional survey conducted on 714 Saudi Arabian population aged from twenty to above sixty years old in period from March to April 2017. A standardized, confidential, Internet questionnaire used for a large randomly selected population in all regions of Saudi Arabia.


Results: Out of 714 participants, women demonstrated a greater level of knowledge of MERS-CoV risk and prevention than men. Social media was the main source for providing information about MERS-CoV with (9.7%) excellent, (72.4%) fair and (17.9%) poor knowledge. Most participants had a good attitude toward privation of camel’s milk and meat if they are source of transmission of MERS-CoV. However, females had better attitude toward the privation of camel’s milk and meat (81.6%, p ? 0.001) than males (66.7%). Regarding safety precautions, the data suggested that males were significantly less than females in taking safety precautions and prevention by 0.563 time (OR: 0.563 (0.341-0.94), p? 0.05).


Conclusion: Generally, participants have a high level of knowledge, positive attitude, and prevention practice toward MERS-CoV. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in knowledge level in different regions in Saudi Arabia. The females have better attitude toward MERS-CoV than males. The present study highlights the need to create wide-spread awareness about MERS-CoV infection among individuals who do not have access to the internet and social media through posters, television, and dissemination of information by healthcare professionals.","Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) Study about Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) among Population in Saudi Arabia","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://imedicalsociety.org/ojs/index.php/iam/copyright","1755-7682","International Medical Society","EN","International Archives of Medicine","2018-01-10T11:40:48",,1,

This study is aimed at investigating the biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality due to outbreaks of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections. The data on the global outbreak of COVID-19, were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO), Worldometer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and research institutes. The information was also recorded from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in Pub Med and Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science on the trends in the prevalence and mortality due to COVID-19 infection outbreaks. The results show rising trends in the transmission, prevalence and mortality rate due to coronavirus COVID-19. During the period of December 29, 2019 through March 31, 2020, it has infected 750,890 people worldwide, resulting in 36,405 deaths with a mortality rate of 4.84%. The infections were more frequent among male gender over 60?years of age. The mean growth rate index for total number of cases from January 23 to March 31, 2020 was 1.20 and growth rate index for mortality rate was 1.12. There was a positive association between the prevalence and mortality rate (R2?=?0.996). The novel coronavirus COVID-19 is highly contagious and has affected a large number of people worldwide. It is still spreading with mutable prevalence and mortality outbreak trends. The global health officials have taken priority measures to prevent further outbreaks of this emerging pathogen across the globe. However, the rising number of cases and mortality risk estimates are demonstrating that enhanced public health mediations, good hygienic conditions, social distancing, and movement limitations may control the COVID-19 epidemics.","Biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality due to outbreaks of novel coronavirus COVID-19","SA",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","http://www.elsevier.com/journals/journal-of-king-saud-university-science/1018-3647/guide-for-authors#13361","1018-3647","Elsevier","EN","Journal of King Saud University: Science","2020-05-25T05:13:18","Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Corresponding author at: Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, King Saud University, PO Box 2925, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.",,

BACKGROUND: In the wake of the adverse situation we are currently facing globally due to the coronavirus pandemic outbreak, it is normal to feel stressed, confused, and scared but what is abnormal is to turn this to panic. Phobias are more pronounced than fears. They develop when a person has an exaggerated or unrealistic sense of danger that may be evolved to experience panic attacks.


AIM: Our objective was to identify the prevalence of most common phobias as well as panic disorder (PD) due to the coronavirus pandemic among Egyptian primary schoolchildren and their determinants.


METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 2015 schoolchildren from 3 to 6 grades in three governorates of Egypt. Seven types of phobias were investigated: Agoraphobia, phobias from darkness, animal, untreatable illness (mainly coronavirus), insects, height, and social phobia. The child’s self-reported PD symptoms were assessed using DSM-IV with psychiatric diagnoses.


RESULTS: Almost two-thirds of the surveyed primary schoolchildren have phobias of the low score (<9) versus one-third who had high phobias score (61.% vs. 35%, respectively) with highly significant difference (p < 0.001). The most prevalent phobias were from heights (66.5%) followed by darkness (60.0%). The important predictors of phobias were: Being a male child, living in an urban area, and studying at governmental school at fifth or sixth-grade residence. The prevalence of PD due to the corona epidemic is very high, it is reported by almost half of the surveyed primary schoolchildren. Fear of losing any of their family members, especially grandparents, was reported to be the highest PD symptom (97%).


CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: Phobia from heights and darkness was the most common. The prevalence of PD due to the coronavirus epidemic is reported to be very high. Calming down children who might be experienced with a phobia that is triggering their PD is recommended.

Coronaviruses are also a threat for humans, as evidenced in 2002/2003 with infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which caused more than 8000 human infections with 10% fatality rate in 37 countries. Ten years later, a novel human coronavirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV), associated with severe pneumonia, arose in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Until December 2016, MERS has accounted for more than 1800 cases and 35% fatality rate. Finding an animal model of disease is key to develop vaccines or antivirals against such emerging pathogens and to understand its pathogenesis. Knowledge of the potential role of domestic livestock and other animal species in the transmission of pathogens is of importance to understand the epidemiology of the disease. Little is known about MERS-CoV animal host range. In this paper, experimental data on potential hosts for MERS-CoV is reviewed. Advantages and limitations of different animal models are evaluated in relation to viral pathogenesis and transmission studies.

With almost 65,000 infected, a worldwide death toll of at least 1370 (as of 14 February 2020), and with the potential to affect up to two-thirds of the world population, COVID-19 is considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be a global health emergency. The speed of spread and infectivity of COVID-19 (also known as Wuhan-2019-nCoV) are dramatically exceeding those of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In fact, since September 2012, the WHO has been notified of 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, whereas the 2002&#8722;2003 epidemic of SARS affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8000 cases. Therefore, although SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are all the result of coronaviral infections, the causes of the coronaviruses differ dramatically in their transmissibility. It is likely that these differences in infectivity of coronaviruses can be attributed to the differences in the rigidity of their shells which can be evaluated using computational tools for predicting intrinsic disorder predisposition of the corresponding viral proteins.","Rigidity of the Outer Shell Predicted by a Protein Intrinsic Disorder Model Sheds Light on the COVID-19 (Wuhan-2019-nCoV) Infectivity","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomolecules/about","2218-273X","MDPI AG","EN","Biomolecules","2020-03-02T13:40:23","Goh’s BioComputing, Singapore 548957, Singapore",1,

We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak. Methods: Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (?), we estimated R0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI. Findings: The early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96–2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89–4.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. We demonstrated that changes in reporting rate substantially affect estimates of R0. Conclusion: The mean estimate of R0 for the 2019-nCoV ranges from 2.24 to 3.58, and is significantly larger than 1. Our findings indicate the potential of 2019-nCoV to cause outbreaks.

Currently, the World Health Organization has confirmed that COVID-19 is a global infectious disease pandemic. This is the third acute infectious disease caused by coronavirus infection in this century, after sudden acute respirator syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome. The damage mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear. It is possible that protein S binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors and invades alveolar epithelial cells, causing direct toxic effects and an excessive immune response. This stimulates a systemic inflammatory response, thus forming a cytokine storm, which leads to lung tissue injury. In severe cases, the disease can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Patients with severe COVID-19 have a relatively high mortality rate. Currently, there are no specific antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. Most patients need to be admitted to the intensive care unit for intensive monitoring and supportive organ function treatments.

The coronavirus epidemic, which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has spread to affect all countries throughout the world, including the countries of the former Soviet Union. Its influence has already affected the economic and social development of the countries in the post-Soviet space. Closing borders, stopping tourism, and imposing severe restrictions on transport services were the first measures that contributed to reducing the incidence rates. At the same time, these measures affected bilateral and multilateral trade and economic relations among the countries of the post-Soviet space.All countries of the post-Soviet space have taken steps to allocate additional funds to combat coronavirus. Ad hoc funds were formed, the review of budget expenditures and revenues began. However, in fact in the first few months the countries faced economic distress, the overcoming of which could take considerable time.The coronavirus epidemic is taking place against the backdrop of global economic crisis and a sharp drop in oil prices. Economic development models based on increasing consumption without economic growth, increasing the level of external and internal debt have shown their insolvency. In these conditions, the countries of the post-Soviet space, which are highly dependent on the external factor, have also experienced significant economic hardships.Finally, the «price warfare» in the oil market has a strong influence. The United States and Saudi Arabia’s attempts to achieve dominance in the oil market, by displacing Russia from it, as well, have had a destabilizing impact on the world oil market. This factor has had a direct impact on those former-Soviet countries that produce and export hydrocarbon resources.In general, the coronavirus epidemic, taking place against the backdrop of global economic challenges and oil competition, will have a negative impact on the economic and political development of former-Soviet countries. The impact of the epidemic, its consequences, will affect the former-Soviet countries for many years to come.","Coronavirus hits former-Soviet countries","RU",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.postsovietarea.com/jour/about/submissions#copyrightNotice","2313-8920","Centre of Regional Research","RU","Problemy Postsovetskogo Prostranstva","2020-05-18T16:43:22","Diplomatic Academy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia",,

In this sense, the objective of the present article was to review studies on the role of wild animals as reservoirs and/or dispersers of etiological agents of human infectious diseases in order to compile data on the main wild animals and etiological agents involved in zoonotic outbreaks. A systematic review was carried out using PRISMA guidelines, using the PubMed, Scopus and SciELO platforms as data banks. The descriptors used were “zoonosis”, “human infectious diseases” and “wild animals”. The results show that wild animals (mainly bats, birds and primates) play an important role in the dissemination of etiological agents (mainly viruses, as a new coronavirus called 2019 Novel Coronavirus) in extensive geographic regions. Moreover, these wild animal organisms can act as the site for essential biotic synergy among several pathogenic microorganisms, promoting a higher rate of adaptation, mutation and even genetic recombination, with consequent stimulation of new strains and subtypes, inducing new infectious agents with unknown virulent potential. In conclusion, the monitoring of these diseases and adequate preparation for possible epidemics and pandemics are fundamental conditions for the mitigation of their future impact. The zoonotic threat of these etiological agents and the impact on public health can be enormous as shown by the ongoing epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019- nCoV) infections.","Emerging and re-emerging human infectious diseases: A systematic review of the role of wild animals with a focus on public health impact","IN",1,"CC BY-NC-SA","CC BY-NC-SA","http://www.apjtm.org/aboutus.asp","2352-4146","Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications","EN","Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Medicine","2020-02-27T12:17:10",,,

The enduring epidemic outbreak which started in Wuhan city of China, in December 2019 caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID- 19) or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has created a dangerous and deadly Public Health disaster of International apprehension, with cases confirmed in several countries. This novel community health trouble is frightening the universe with clinical, psychological, emotional, collapse of health system and economical slowdown in each and every part of the world infecting nearly 200 countries. A highly virulent and pathogenic COVID-19 viral infection with incubation period ranging from two to fourteen days, transmitted by breathing of infected droplets or contact with infected droplets, belongs to the genus Coronavirus with its high mutation rate in the Coronaviridae. The likely probable primary reservoir could be bats, because genomic analysis discovered that SARSCoV-2 is phylogenetically interrelated to SARS-like bat viruses. The transitional resource of origin and transfer to humans is not known, however, the rapidly developing pandemic has confirmed human to human transfer. Approximately 1,016,128 reported cases, 211,615 recovered cases and 53,069 deaths of COVID-2019 have been reported to date (April 2, 2020). The symptoms vary from asymptomatic, low grade pyrexia, dry cough, sore throat, breathlessness, tiredness, body aches, fatigue, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, to severe consolidation and pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction leading to death with case fatality rate ranging from 2 to 3%.

Although PEDV induced cell apoptosis has been established in vitro and in vivo, the functional protein that contributes to this event remains unclear. Methods The activation or cleavage of main apoptosis-associated molecular such as AIFM1, caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9 and PARP in PEDV infected host cells were analyzed by western blotting. The nuclear change of infected cell was monitored by confocal immunofluorescence assay. The overexpressing plasmids of 16 non-structural proteins (Nsp1–16) and 6 structural proteins (M, N, E, ORF3, S1 and S2) were constructed by cloning. Cell apoptosis induced by PEDV or overexpression non-structural or structural proteins was measured by the flow cytometry assay. Results PEDV could infect various host cells including Vero, Vero-E6 and Marc-145 and cause obvious cytopathic effects, including roundup, cell fusion, cell membrane vacuolation, syncytium formation and cause apparent apoptosis. In infected cells, PEDV-induced apoptosis is accompanied by nuclear concentration and fragmentation as a result of caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation and AIFM1 and PARP cleavage. Overexpression of S1 Spike protein of PEDV SM98 strain effectively induced host cell apoptosis, while the expression of the other non-structure proteins (Nsp1–16) and structural proteins (M, N, E, S2 and ORF3) has no or less effect on cell apoptosis. Similarly, expression of S1 protein from wild-type strain BJ2011 or cell-adapted strain CV777, also induce apoptosis in transfected cells. Finally, we demonstrated that the S1 proteins from various coronavirus family members such as TGEV, IBV, CCoV, SARS and MERS could also induce Vero-E6 cells apoptosis. Conclusion S1 Spike protein is one of the most critical functional proteins that contribute to cell apoptosis. Expression of S1 proteins of the coronavirus tested in this study could all induce cell apoptosis suggesting S1 maybe is an effective inducer in Coronavirus-induced cell apoptosis and targeting S1 protein expression probably is a promising strategy to inhibit coronavirus infection and thus mediated apoptosis on host cells.","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus S1 protein is the critical inducer of apoptosis","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/about/policies/license-agreement","1743-422X","BMC","EN","Virology Journal","2018-11-11T12:33:00","Key Laboratory of Animal Epidemiology of the Ministry of Agriculture, College of Veterinary Medicine and State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology, China Agricultural University",1,

This deadly virus caused the world to be in high alert as the death toll and the number of confirmed cases is continuously rising since the first case was reported. The Chinese government warned that the transmission ability of the virus is increasing, and international efforts are needed to overcome this outbreak. The purpose of this review is to focus on the published articles about the new virus, which will give an insight into the current state of research and data available, as well as recommending future studies. Methods: For this narrative review, more than 20 relevant scientific articles and reports were considered from various databases (e.g., Google Scholar, PubMed and Science Direct) using keywords such as Coronavirus Outbreak, COVID-19, Emerging Epidemics, Emerging Infections, and Novel Coronavirus. Results: The results from this review show that the situation is rapidly evolving, as human-to-human transmission is occurring, and the number of new cases and mortalities is increasing by the day and on a global level. There is still ambiguity about mutation risks and how the virus spreads as the source was not yet identified. Major gaps in knowledge about the origin of the virus, epidemiology and transmission impose a great challenge, which emphasizes the need for further studies in the future.","Emergence of COVID-19 Infection: What Is Known and What Is to Be Expected – Narrative Review Article","CH",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","https://www.karger.com/Journal/Guidelines/231997#sec72","2571-726X","Karger Publishers","EN","Dubai Medical Journal","2020-03-16T08:17:02",,,

With each passing day, more cases of Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) are being detected and unfortunately the fear of novel corona virus 2019 (2019-nCoV) becoming a pandemic disease has come true. Constant efforts at individual, national, and international level are being made in order to understand the genomics, hosts, modes of transmission and epidemiological link of nCoV-2019. As of now, whole genome sequence of the newly discovered coronavirus has already been decoded. Genomic characterization nCoV-2019 have shown close homology with bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Structural analysis of the receptor binding site has confirmed that 2019-nCoV binds with the same ACE 2 receptor protein as human SARS virus. Compared to the previous coronavirus outbreaks, the overall mortality rate is relatively low for COVID-2019 (2-3%). Suspected cases must be quarantined till their test comes positive or they clear infection. At present, treatment of COVID-2019 is mostly based on the knowledge gained from the SARS and MERS outbreaks. Remdesivir, originally develop as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections, is being studied for it effectiveness against 2019-nCoV infection. Many other antiviral agents and vaccines are being tested but most of them are in phase I or II and hence unlikely to be of any benefit immediately with regards to current outbreak. Hence, the standard infection control techniques and preventive steps for healthy individuals and supportive care for the confirmed cases is the best available strategy to deal with current viral outbreak.?

We inoculated 3 adult camels with a human isolate of MERS-CoV and a transient, primarily upper respiratory tract infection developed in each of the 3 animals. Clinical signs of the MERS-CoV infection were benign, but each of the camels shed large quantities of virus from the upper respiratory tract. We detected infectious virus in nasal secretions through 7 days postinoculation, and viral RNA up to 35 days postinoculation. The pattern of shedding and propensity for the upper respiratory tract infection in dromedary camels may help explain the lack of systemic illness among naturally infected camels and the means of efficient camel-to-camel and camel-to-human transmission.","Replication and Shedding of MERS-CoV in Upper Respiratory Tract of Inoculated Dromedary Camels","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/page/copyright-and-disclaimers","1080-6040","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","EN","Emerging Infectious Diseases","2019-04-19T00:51:17",,,

We revise the literature on coronavirus infection of the CNS associated with neurological diseases. Development: Neurological symptoms were rarely reported in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, although isolated cases were described. There are also reports of cases of neurological symptoms associated with CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E infection. The presence of neurological lesions, especially demyelinating lesions in the mouse hepatitis virus model, may explain the mechanisms by which coronaviruses enter the CNS, particularly those related with the immune response. This may explain the presence of coronavirus in patients with multiple sclerosis. We review the specific characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and address the question of whether the high number of cases may be associated with greater CNS involvement. Conclusion: Although neurological symptoms are not frequent in coronavirus epidemics, the high number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain the presence of the virus in the CNS and increase the likelihood of early- or delayed-onset neurological symptoms. Follow-up of patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic should include careful assessment of the CNS. Resumen:  Introducción: Diversas evidencias sugieren que el SARS-CoV-2 puede penetrar en el sistema nervioso central (SNC). Los autores revisan los datos de la literatura sobre los hallazgos de coronavirus en el SNC asociado a enfermedades neurológicas. Desarrollo: En las distintas epidemias con SARS-CoV y MERS-CoV la presencia de cuadros neurológicos es baja, pero se describen cuadros aislados de pacientes. También existen casos asociados a OC43-CoV y 229E-CoV. La existencia de lesiones neurológicas, especialmente desmielinizantes en el modelo MHV-CoV pueden explicar mecanismos de penetración de los CoV en el SNC y especialmente aquellos relacionados con la respuesta inmune, que puede justificar la existencia de CoV en pacientes con esclerosis múltiple. Los autores revisan aspectos diferenciales de SARS-CoV-2 y se plantean si debido al alto número de infectados, el virus puede afectar de forma mayor al SNC. Conclusión: Aunque la presencia de síntomas neurológicos en las epidemias de CoV es baja, la mayor frecuencia de infectados por SARS-CoV-2 podría justificar el paso del virus y la posibilidad de clínica neurológica precoz o tardía con mayor incidencia. El seguimiento de los pacientes de la epidemia debe atender con cuidado a la evaluación del SNC.","Should we expect neurological symptoms in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic?","ES",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","https://www.elsevier.com/journals/neurologia-english-edition/2173-5808/open-access-journal","2173-5808","Elsevier España","EN","Neurología (English Edition)","2020-05-13T05:10:00","Corresponding author.; Servicio de Neurología, Instituto de Neurociencias, Hospital Clínico San Carlos, San Carlos, IdISSC, Madrid, Spain",,

Health Care Personnel (HCP) are at high risk of acquiring MERS-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections, similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections first identified in 2003. This study described the similarities and differences in epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 183 confirmed global MERS cases and 98 SARS cases in Taiwan associated with HCP. The epidemiological findings showed that the mean age of MERS-HCP and total MERS cases were 40 (24~74) and 49 (2~90) years, respectively, much older than those in SARS [SARS-HCP: 35 (21~68) years, p = 0.006; total SARS: 42 (0~94) years, p = 0.0002]. The case fatality rates (CFR) was much lower in MERS-HCP [7.03% (9/128)] or SARS-HCP [12.24% (12/98)] than the MERS-non-HCP [36.96% (34/92), p<0.001] or SARS-non-HCP [24.50% (61/249), p<0.001], however, no difference was found between MERS-HCP and SARS-HCP [p = 0.181]. In terms of clinical period, the days from onset to death [13 (4~17) vs 14.5 (0~52), p = 0.045] and to discharge [11 (5~24) vs 24 (0~74), p = 0.010] and be hospitalized days [9.5 (3~22) vs 22 (0~69), p = 0.040] were much shorter in MERS-HCP than SARS-HCP. Similarly, days from onset to confirmation were shorter in MERS-HCP than MERS-non-HCP [6 (1~14) vs 10 (1~21), p = 0.044]. In conclusion, the severity of MERS-HCP and SARS-HCP was lower than that of MERS-non-HCP and SARS-non-HCP due to younger age and early confirmation in HCP groups. However, no statistical difference was found in MERS-HCP and SARS-HCP. Thus, prevention of nosocomial infections involving both novel Coronavirus is crucially important to protect HCP.","Comparative Epidemiology of Human Infections with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronaviruses among Healthcare Personnel.","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license","1932-6203","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","EN","PLoS ONE","2016-06-15T05:32:07",,1,

Lithium chloride (LiCl) has been found to be effective against several DNA viruses, such as Herpes simplex virus and vaccinia virus. Recently, we and others have reported the inhibitory effect of LiCl on avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) infection, an RNA virus. In the current study, the action mechanism of LiCl on cell infection by TGEV was investigated. Plaque assays and 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo(-z-y1)-3,5-di-phenyl tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assays showed that the cell infection by TGEV was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, when LiCl was added to virus-infected cells; the cell infection was not affected when either cells or viruses were pretreated with the drug. The inhibition of TGEV infection in vitro by LiCl was observed at different virus doses and with different cell lines. The inhibitory effect of LiCl against TGEV infection and transcription was confirmed by RT-PCR and real-time PCR targeting viral S and 3CL-protease genes. The time-of-addition effect of the drug on TGEV infection indicated that LiCl acted on the initial and late stage of TGEV infection. The production of virus was not detected at 36 h post-infection due to the drug treatment. Moreover, immunofluorescence (IF) and flow cytometry analyses based on staining of Annexin V and propidium iodide staining of nuclei indicated that early and late cell apoptosis induced by TGEV was inhibited efficiently. The ability of LiCl to inhibit apoptosis was investigated by IF analysis of caspase-3 expression. Our data indicate that LiCl inhibits TGEV infection by exerting an anti-apoptotic effect. The inhibitory effect of LiCl was also observed with porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus. Together with other reports concerning the inhibitory effect of lithium salts on IBV in cell culture, our results indicate that LiCl may be a potent agent against porcine and avian coronaviruses.","Action mechanisms of lithium chloride on cell infection by transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus.","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license","1932-6203","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","EN","PLoS ONE","2016-06-14T20:30:15",,1,

To elucidate the evolution of MERS-CoV-related viruses and their interspecies transmission pathway, samples were collected from different mammals in China. A novel coronavirus related to MERS-CoV, <i>Erinaceus amurensis</i> hedgehog coronavirus HKU31 (<i>Ea</i>-HedCoV HKU31), was identified from two Amur hedgehogs. Genome analysis supported that <i>Ea</i>-HedCoV HKU31 represents a novel species under <i>Merbecovirus</i>, being most closely related to <i>Erinaceus</i> CoV from European hedgehogs in Germany, with 79.6% genome sequence identity. Compared to other members of <i>Merbecovirus</i>, <i>Ea</i>-HedCoV HKU31 possessed unique non-structural proteins and putative cleavage sites at ORF1ab. Phylogenetic analysis showed that <i>Ea</i>-HedCoV HKU31 and BetaCoV Erinaceus/VMC/DEU/2012 were closely related to NeoCoV and BatCoV PREDICT from African bats in the spike region, suggesting that the latter bat viruses have arisen from recombination between CoVs from hedgehogs and bats. The predicted HKU31 receptor-binding domain (RBD) possessed only one out of 12 critical amino acid residues for binding to human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), the MERS-CoV receptor. The structural modeling of the HKU31-RBD-hDPP4 binding interphase compared to that of MERS-CoV and <i>Tylonycteris</i> bat CoV HKU4 (<i>Ty</i>-BatCoV HKU4) suggested that HKU31-RBD is unlikely to bind to hDPP4. Our findings support that hedgehogs are an important reservoir of <i>Merbecovirus</i>, with evidence of recombination with viruses from bats. Further investigations in bats, hedgehogs and related animals are warranted to understand the evolution of MERS-CoV-related viruses.","Identification of a Novel Betacoronavirus (<i>Merbecovirus</i>) in Amur Hedgehogs from China","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses/about","1999-4915","MDPI AG","EN","Viruses","2019-11-12T08:42:59","Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong 999077, China",1,

A detailed scientific analysis of the phenomenon is yet to come, but the public is already interested in the questions of the epidemic duration, the expected number of patients and deaths. Long-time predictions require complicated mathematical models that need a lot of effort to identify and calculate unknown parameters. This article will present some preliminary estimates.

Objective. Since the long-time data are available only for mainland China, we will try to predict the epidemic characteristics only in this area. We will estimate some of the epidemic characteristics and present the dependen­cies for victim numbers, infected and removed persons versus time.

Methods. In this study we use the known SIR model for the dynamics of an epidemic, the known exact solution of the linear differential equations and statistical approach developed before for investigation of the children disease, which occurred in Chernivtsi (Ukraine) in 1988–1989. 

Results. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were identified with the use of statistical approach. The numbers of infected, susceptible and removed persons versus time were predicted and compared with the new data obtained after February 10, 2020, when the calculations were completed.

Conclusions. The simple mathematical model was used to predict the characteristics of the epidemic caused by coronavirus in mainland China. Unfortunately, the number of coronavirus victims is expected to be much higher than that predicted on February 10, 2020, since 12289 new cases (not previously included in official counts) have been added two days later. Further research should focus on updating the predictions with the use of up-to-date data and using more complicated mathematical models.","Statistics-Based Predictions of Coronavirus Epidemic Spreading in Mainland China","UA",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://ibb.kpi.ua/about/submissions#copyrightNotice","2616-177X","National Technical University of Ukraine Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute ","EN","Innovative Biosystems and Bioengineering","2020-02-18T14:18:47","Institute of Hydromechanics, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine;

On return to their home countries, such travellers may require intensive care. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and more recently Ebola haemorrhagic fever, has highlighted the risks. Other well-known communicable pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae have been described previously. However, malaria remains by far the most important cause of death. The issues related to imported antibiotic resistance and protection from highly contagious diseases are reviewed here. Surveillance strategies based on epidemiological data (country visited, duration of travel, and time elapsed since return) and clinical syndromes, together with systematic search policies, are usually mandatory to limit the risk of an outbreak. Single-bed hospital rooms and isolation according to symptoms should be the rule while awaiting laboratory test results. Because person-to-person contact is the main route of transmission, healthcare workers should implement specific prevention strategies.","Management of infections in critically ill returning travellers in the intensive care unit—I: considerations on infection control and transmission of resistance","NL",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","http://www.elsevier.com/journals/international-journal-of-infectious-diseases/1201-9712/open-access-journal","1201-9712","Elsevier","EN","International Journal of Infectious Diseases","2016-08-22T11:30:11","Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Ondokuz Mayis University Medical School, Samsun, Turkey",,

The field immuno-chromatography test «Tetra-Kit BioX K156» was used to screen faecal samples for the above mentioned pathogens from 1932 calves from 78 farms distributed across four cattle breedingregions of Morocco. Overall, 196 calves (10 %), between 1 and 60 days old, were found to experience diarrhoea. Individual prevalence of diarrhoeic calves in farms that undertake vaccination was found to be equivalent to those that do not vaccinate against Escherichia coli, Coronavirus et Rotavirus. Significant differences in prevalence of the aetiological agents of interest are however noted between farms that vaccinate and those that do not. Thus, Cryptosporidiosis prevalence is found to be higher in vaccinated herds. Neonatal diarrhoea in calves remains a major problem at the national level and control programs should be implemented in order to decrease its economic losses.

MERS-CoV infection had previously caused multiple health-care-associated outbreaks and resulted in transmission of the virus within families. Community onset MERS-CoV cases continue to occur. Dromedary camels are currently the most likely animal to be linked to human MERS-CoV cases. Serologic tests showed significant infection in adult camels compared to juvenile camels. The control of MERS-CoV infection relies on prompt identification of cases within health care facilities, with institutions applying appropriate infection control measures. In addition, determining the exact route of transmission from camels to humans would further add to the control measures of MERS-CoV infection.

The goal of this work is to systematically review and compare between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the context of their virus incubation, originations, diagnosis and treatment methods, genomic and proteomic sequences, and pathogenic mechanisms.","Systematic Comparison of Two Animal-to-Human Transmitted Human Coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses/about","1999-4915","MDPI AG","EN","Viruses","2020-03-02T13:40:51","Department of Preventive Medicine, Institute of Biomedical Informatics, Bioinformatics Center, Henan Provincial Engineering Center for Tumor Molecular Medicine, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Henan University, Kaifeng 475004, China",1,

During the Taiwan epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), many health care workers were infected. In an effort to establish a screening program for high risk personal, the distribution of HLA class I and II alleles in case and control groups was examined for the presence of an association to a genetic susceptibly or resistance to SARS coronavirus infection.</p> <p>Methods</p> <p>HLA-class I and II allele typing by PCR-SSOP was performed on 37 cases of probable SARS, 28 fever patients excluded later as probable SARS, and 101 non-infected health care workers who were exposed or possibly exposed to SARS coronavirus.

At first, when analyzing infected SARS patients and high risk health care workers groups, HLA-B*4601 (OR = 2.08, <it>P </it>= 0.04, <it>Pc </it>= n.s.) and HLA-B*5401 (OR = 5.44, <it>P </it>= 0.02, <it>Pc </it>= n.s.) appeared as the most probable elements that may be favoring SARS coronavirus infection. After selecting only a severe cases patient group from the infected probable SARS patient group and comparing them with the high risk health care workers group, the severity of SARS was shown to be significantly associated with HLA-B*4601 (<it>P </it>= 0.0008 or <it>Pc </it>= 0.0279).</p> <p>Conclusions</p> <p>Densely populated regions with genetically related southern Asian populations appear to be more affected by the spreading of SARS infection. Up until recently, no probable SARS patients were reported among Taiwan indigenous peoples who are genetically distinct from the Taiwanese general population, have no HLA-B* 4601 and have high frequency of HLA-B* 1301. While increase of HLA-B* 4601 allele frequency was observed in the Probable SARS infected patient group, a further significant increase of the allele was seen in the Severe cases patient group. These results appeared to indicate association of HLA-B* 4601 with the severity of SARS infection in Asian populations.

We reviewed mathematical models for contact tracing and follow-up control measures of SARS and MERS transmission. Model characteristics, epidemiological parameters and intervention parameters used in the mathematical models from seven studies were summarized. A major concern identified in future epidemics is whether public health administrators can collect all the required data for building epidemiological models in a short period of time during the early phase of an outbreak. Also, currently available models do not explicitly model constrained resources. We urge for closed-loop communication between public health administrators and modelling researchers to come up with guidelines to delineate the collection of the required data in the midst of an outbreak and the inclusion of additional logistical details in future similar models.

Currently, more information is needed so as to further understand the transmission and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection and the infection control procedures required. Recently, the role of the eye in transmitting 2019-nCoV has been intensively discussed. Previous investigations of other highly infectious human CoVs, that is, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), may provide useful information. In this review, we describe the genomics and morphology of human CoVs, the epidemiology, systemic and ophthalmic manifestations, and mechanisms of human CoV infection, and recommendations for infection control procedures. The role of the eye in the transmission of 2019-nCoV is discussed in detail. Although the conjunctiva is directly exposed to extraocular pathogens, and the mucosa of the ocular surface and upper respiratory tract are connected by the nasolacrimal duct and share the same entry receptors for some respiratory viruses, the eye is rarely involved in human CoV infection, conjunctivitis is quite rare in patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and the CoV RNA positive rate by RT-PCR test in tears and conjunctival secretions from patients with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV infection is also extremely low. This suggests that the eye is neither a preferred organ of human CoV infection nor a preferred gateway of entry for human CoVs for infecting the respiratory tract. However, pathogens that the ocular surface is exposed to might be transported to nasal and nasopharyngeal mucosa by constant tear rinsing through the lacrimal duct system and then cause respiratory tract infection. Considering that close doctor-patient contact is quite common in ophthalmic practice and is apt to transmit human CoVs by droplets and fomites, strict hand hygiene and proper personal protection are highly recommended for health care workers to avoid hospital-related viral transmission during ophthalmic practice.","Role of the Eye in Transmitting Human Coronavirus: What We Know and What We Do Not Know","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/public-health#about","2296-2565","Frontiers Media S.A.","EN","Frontiers in Public Health","2020-04-24T05:13:26","Eye Center, Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China",1,

Although our understanding of coronaviruses has undergone a huge leap after two precedents, the effective approaches to treatment and epidemiological control are still lacking. In this article, we present a succinct overview of the epidemiology, clinical features, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. We summarize the current epidemiological and clinical data from the initial Wuhan studies, and emphasize several features of SARS-CoV-2, which differentiate it from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), such as high variability of disease presentation. We systematize the current clinical trials that have been rapidly initiated after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas the trials on SARS-CoV-2 genome-based specific vaccines and therapeutic antibodies are currently being tested, this solution is more long-term, as they require thorough testing of their safety. On the other hand, the repurposing of the existing therapeutic agents previously designed for other virus infections and pathologies happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response measure to the emergent pandemic, as most of these agents have already been tested for their safety. These agents can be divided into two broad categories, those that can directly target the virus replication cycle, and those based on immunotherapy approaches either aimed to boost innate antiviral immune responses or alleviate damage induced by dysregulated inflammatory responses. The initial clinical studies revealed the promising therapeutic potential of several of such drugs, including <i>favipiravir</i>, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that interferes with the viral replication, and <i>hydroxychloroquine</i>, the repurposed antimalarial drug that interferes with the virus endosomal entry pathway. We speculate that the current pandemic emergency will be a trigger for more systematic drug repurposing design approaches based on big data analysis.","A Review of SARS-CoV-2 and the Ongoing Clinical Trials","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms/about under Copyright/Open Access section","1422-0067","MDPI AG","EN","International Journal of Molecular Sciences","2020-04-14T13:20:51","Department of Medical Research, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei 11217, Taiwan",1,

The main problems of comorbidity are described and recommendations for the treatment of patients with myocardial infarction and COVID-19 are generalized, the features of the appointment of certain groups of drugs are emphasized.

The aim of the research. To study the effect of coronavirus on the cardiovascular system to understand the correct algorithm for providing medical care for cardiovascular diseases.

Methods. As a methodological basis, the article uses the existing data about the epidemiological characteristics of coronavirus infections SARS, MERS, COVID-19 and damage of the cardiovascular system in existing heart diseases and viral pathologies. A new cardiac lesion in the form of acute heart injury is also described, confirmed by an increase in troponin.

Results. As a result of the high contagiousness of the COVID-19 viral infection, treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction or other cardiovascular pathology in patients with undetermined SARS COV-2 status, it is performed as if he is positive, according to current guidelines. It is advisable for all patients to evaluate the systolic function of the left ventricle during angiography in order to reduce the need for echocardiography and decline the risk of staff infection. Combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has the proarrhythmogenic effect.

Conclusions. In the context of a global pandemic of coronavirus infection, existing data on the possible risks and lesions of the cardiovascular system in patients with COVID-19 should be taken into account. The treatment and prevention of the spread of infection is based on the assumption that all patients can be potentially infected. It is advisable to use thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19, especially those who have activation of the coagulation system. Treatment of severe COVID-19-pneumonia also requires the appointment of anticoagulants.

In this study, we examined whether the variations of the <i>cis</i>-acting elements between the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) Taiwan (TW) strain and the prototype strain CV777 alter gene expression. For this aim, we analyzed the variations of the <i>cis</i>-acting elements in the 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; untranslated regions (UTRs) between the PEDV TW, CV777, and other reference strains. We also determined the previously unidentified transcription regulatory sequence (TRS), a sequence motif required for coronavirus transcription, and found that a nucleotide deletion in the TW strain, in comparison with CV777 strain, immediately downstream of the leader core sequence alters the identity between the leader TRS and the body TRS. Functional analyses using coronavirus defective interfering (DI) RNA revealed that such variations in <i>cis</i>-acting elements for the TW strain compared with the CV777 strain have an influence on the efficiency of gene expression. The current data show for the first time the evolution of PEDV in terms of <i>cis</i>-acting elements and their effects on gene expression, and thus may contribute to our understanding of recent PED outbreaks worldwide.","Gene Variations in <i>Cis</i>-Acting Elements between the Taiwan and Prototype Strains of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Alter Viral Gene Expression","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/genes/about","2073-4425","MDPI AG","EN","Genes","2018-11-30T08:19:56","Graduate Institute of Veterinary Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 40227, Taiwan",1,

CoV trigger a drastic reorganization of host cell membranes to promote their replication and egression, but a detailed description of the intracellular remodeling induced by PEDV is still missing. In this study, we examined qualitatively and quantitatively, using electron microscopy, the intracellular membrane reorganization induced by PEDV over the course of an infection. With our ultrastructural approach, we reveal that, as most of CoV, PEDV initially forms double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CMs), which probably serve as replication/transcription platforms. Interestingly, we also found that viral particles start to form almost simultaneously in both the endoplasmic reticulum and the large virion-containing vacuoles (LVCVs), which are compartments originating from the Golgi, confirming that ?-CoV assemble indistinguishably in two different organelles of the secretory pathway. Moreover, PEDV virons appear to have an immature and a mature form, similar to another ?-CoV the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). Altogether, our study underlies the similarities and differences between the lifecycle of ?-CoV and that of viruses belonging to other CoV subfamilies.","Ultrastructural Characterization of Membrane Rearrangements Induced by Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Infection","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses/about","1999-4915","MDPI AG","EN","Viruses","2018-10-26T08:01:30","Department of Preventive Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China",1,

This risk has been recently reinforced by human epidemics in Singapore of SARS coronavirus, 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus, and enterovirus 71. Other major threats to Singapore include MERS-coronavirus and various avian and swine influenza viruses. The ability to quickly identify and robustly track such threats to initiate an early emergency response remains a significant challenge. In an effort to enhance respiratory virus surveillance in Singapore, our team conducted a pilot study employing a noninvasive bioaerosol sampling method to detect respiratory viruses in Singapore’s Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) network. Over a period of 52 weeks, 89 aerosol samples were collected during peak MRT ridership hours. Nine (10%) tested positive for adenovirus, four (4.5%) tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus type A, and one (1%) tested positive for influenza A virus using real-time RT-PCR/PCR. To our knowledge, this is the first time molecular evidence for any infectious respiratory agent has been collected from Singapore’s MRT. Our pilot study data support the possibility of employing bioaerosol samplers in crowded public spaces to noninvasively monitor for respiratory viruses circulating in communities.","Bioaerosol Sampling for Respiratory Viruses in Singapore’s Mass Rapid Transit Network","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","https://www.nature.com/srep/about/open-access","2045-2322","Nature Publishing Group","EN","Scientific Reports","2018-12-02T12:36:55","Emerging Infectious Diseases Programme, Duke-NUS Medical School",1,

Methods: We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n = 28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n = 18). In addition, we adjust for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase. Results: Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9). Conclusions: The serial interval of COVID-19 is close to or shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias.

Results: Of ten patients, secondary, tertiary and quartus patients emerged; the incubation period was 3–7 days. Mainly initial symptoms were cough and low fever (37.3–38.0 °C). An asymptomatic case presented normal radiography, the others had ground glass opacities. All cases (three transferred, seven discharged) were exposed to lopinavir on initial hospitalization. Three patients stopped lopinavir because of adverse effects, two of them deteriorated, one was hospitalized longer than others who with sustained lopinavir use.

In the process, we find a great diversity of tests operating in multiple registers, themselves not clearly demarcated, often combining and sometimes conflating, for example, scientific and public discourse. The study opens by identifying three aspects of testing, drawn from the sociology of testing. First, tests are frequently proxies (or projections) that stand for something. Second, a test is a critical moment that stands out – whether because it is a moment deliberately separated out or because it is a puzzling or troublesome “situation” that disrupts the flow of social life. Third, when someone or something is put to the test, of interest is whether it stands up to the challenge. These insights serve as the building blocks for addressing three major issues – representation, selection, and accountability – regarding testing in the time of the coronavirus crisis.","Testing and Being Tested in Pandemic Times","IT",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://sociologica.unibo.it/about/submissions#copyrightNotice","1971-8853","University of Bologna","EN","Sociologica","2020-05-21T09:06:36","Department of Sociology, Columbia University; Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodology, University of Warwick (United Kingdom)",,

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still progressing and has been recorded in more than 210 countries and territories worldwide. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the first cases of COVID-19 were detected on 5th of March 2020 in the entity of Republic of Srpska and 9th of March 2020 in the entity of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Up until the 16th of May 2020, more than 2,200 COVID-19 cases were recorded in both entities, with a mortality rate of 5.8% (131 out of 2231 cases). The aim of this ongoing study is to present the current epidemiological and sociodemographic parameters of 380 COVID-19 patients diagnosed at the University Clinical Hospital Mostar (UCH Mostar) during the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Out of 380 patients, 60 (15.8%) of them required hospitalization. The mortality rate was 5% (19/380). The highest mortality rate of 15.2% (12/79) was recorded in the patients age ?65 years. In addition to this single-centre experience of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we discuss the epidemiological measures imposed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with emphasis on the restrictive ones. The COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

In the event of epidemic outbreak, a series of actions have been taken by the Chinese government to control the pandemic of the virus, and effective medical methods are in urgent need to prevent COVID-19 infection and cure the disease, especially a drug that can suppress COVID-19 is urgently needed. However, there are no specific drugs and vaccine that can prevent coronavirus infection. Some research works on the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with this virus are ongoing. Some works about new drug against COVID-19 are carried out; more time is required to develop an effective drug against pneumonia caused by COVID-19. Now, to develop broad-spectrum antiviral agents, there is a quick method to identify drugs with high binding capacity with COVID-19 by virtual screening based on the clinical drug libraries; all these drugs have been widely used in clinical applications with guaranteed safety, which may serve as promising candidates to treat the infection of COVID-19. In this article, we summarize the discovery and clinical application of specific drugs against COVID-19 as potential inhibitors to alleviate the current epidemic.","Potential inhibitor for 2019-novel coronaviruses in drug development","IN",1,"CC BY-NC-SA","CC BY-NC-SA","http://www.cancertm.com/contributors.asp","2395-3012","Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications","EN","Cancer Translational Medicine","2020-04-01T13:52:06",,,

Recently, the crystal structure of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) PL1 has been solved, which was similar to that of SARS-CoV PL2pro, which may antagonize host innate immunity. However, very little is known about whether TGEV PL1 can antagonize host innate immune response. Here, we presented evidence that TGEV PL1 encoded by the replicase gene could suppress the IFN-? expression and inhibit the nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). The ability to antagonize IFN-? production was dependent on the intact catalytic activity of PL1. Furthermore, TGEV PL1 exerted deubiquitinase (DUB) activity which strongly inhibited the retinoic acid-induced gene I- (RIG-1-) and stimulator of interferon gene- (STING-) dependent IFN expression. Our data collectively suggest that TGEV PL1 can inhibit the IFN-? expression and interfere with RIG-1- and STING-mediated signaling through a viral DUB activity. Our study has yielded strong evidence for the TGEV PL1 mechanisms that counteract the host innate immunity.","Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus Papain-Like Protease 1 Antagonizes Production of Interferon-? through Its Deubiquitinase Activity","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/guidelines/","2314-6133","Hindawi Limited","EN","BioMed Research International","2017-11-06T15:30:39","State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150001, China",1,

As opposed to all other SARS-Coronavirus strains, Frankfurt-1 has a 45-nucleotide deletion in the transmembrane domain of its ORF 7b protein. When over-expressed in HEK 293 cells, the full-length protein but not the variant with the deletion caused interferon beta induction and cleavage of procaspase 3. To study the role of ORF 7b in the context of virus replication, we cloned a full genome cDNA copy of Frankfurt-1 in a bacterial artificial chromosome downstream of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Transfection of capped RNA transcribed from this construct yielded infectious virus that was indistinguishable from the original virus isolate. The presumed Frankfurt-1 ancestor with an intact ORF 7b was reconstructed. In CaCo-2 and HUH7 cells, but not in Vero cells, the variant carrying the ORF 7b deletion had a replicative advantage against the parental virus (4- and 6-fold increase of virus RNA in supernatant, respectively). This effect was neither associated with changes in the induction or secretion of type I interferon, nor with altered induction of apoptosis in cell culture.

This difference could explain earlier observations of enhanced virulence of Frankfurt-1 in Hamsters as compared to other SARS-Coronavirus reference strains and identifies the SARS-CoV 7b protein as an attenuating factor with the SARS-Coronavirus genome. Because attenuation was focused on the early phase of infection <it>in-vivo</it>, ORF 7b might have contributed to the delayed accumulation of virus in patients that was suggested to have limited the spread of the SARS epidemic.</p> ","Reverse genetic characterization of the natural genomic deletion in SARS-Coronavirus strain Frankfurt-1 open reading frame 7b reveals an attenuating function of the 7b protein <it>in-vitro </it>and <it>in-vivo</it>","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/about/policies/license-agreement","1743-422X","BMC","EN","Virology Journal","2009-10-17T00:00:00",,1,

The first suspected case in the Philippines was investigated on January 22, 2020, and 633 suspected cases were reported as of March 1. We describe the clinical and epidemiological aspects of the first two confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines, both admitted to the national infectious disease referral hospital in Manila. Case presentation Both patients were previously healthy Chinese nationals on vacation in the Philippines travelling as a couple during January 2020. Patient 1, a 39-year-old female, had symptoms of cough and sore throat and was admitted to San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on January 25. Physical examination was unremarkable. Influenza B, human coronavirus 229E, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were detected by PCR on initial nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NPS/OPS) swabs. On January 30, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs and she was identified as the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the Philippines. Her symptoms resolved, and she was discharged. Patient 2, a 44-year-old male, had symptoms of fever, cough, and chills. Influenza B and Streptococcus pneumoniae were detected by PCR on initial NPS/OPS swabs. He was treated for community-acquired pneumonia with intravenous antibiotics, but his condition deteriorated and he required intubation. On January 31, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs, and he was identified as the 2nd confirmed COVID-19 infection in the Philippines. On February 1, the patient’s condition deteriorated, and following a cardiac arrest, it was not possible to revive him. He was thus confirmed as the first COVID-19 death outside of China. Conclusions This case report highlights several important clinical and public health issues. Despite both patients being young adults with no significant past medical history, they had very different clinical courses, illustrating how COVID-19 can present with a wide spectrum of disease. As of March 1, there have been three confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines. Continued vigilance is required to identify new cases.","First COVID-19 infections in the Philippines: a case report","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/copyright-and-license","1348-8945","BMC","EN","Tropical Medicine and Health","2020-04-19T12:21:58","San Lazaro Hospital",1,

Most cases have been reported from Saudi Arabia, and the disease epidemic potential is considered to be limited. However, human–human transmission has occurred, usually in the context of healthcare facility-associated outbreaks. The scientific and medical community depends on timely publication of epidemiological information on emerging diseases during outbreaks to appropriately target public health responses. In this review, we considered the academic response to four MERS CoV outbreaks that occurred in Al-Hasa in 2013, Jeddah in 2014 and Riyadh in 2014 and 2015. We analysed 68 relevant epidemiology articles. For articles for which submission dates were available, six articles were submitted during the course of an outbreak. One article was published within a month of the Al-Hasa outbreak, and one each was accepted during the Jeddah and Riyadh outbreaks. MERS-CoV epidemiology articles were cited more frequently than articles on other subjects in the same journal issues. Thus, most epidemiology articles on MERS-CoV were published with no preferential advantage over other articles. Collaboration of the research community and the scientific publishing industry is needed to facilitate timely publication of emerging infectious diseases.

Beyond the clinical scope of SRH, we should not neglect the impacts at the health system level and disruptions or interruptions in regular provision of SRH services, such as pre- and postnatal checks, safe abortion, contraception, HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections. Furthermore, other aspects merit attention such as the potential increase of gender-based violence and domestic abuse, and effects of stigma and discrimination associated with COVID-19 and their effects on SRH clients and health care providers. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the scientific community to generate sound clinical, epidemiological, and psycho-social behavioral links between COVID-19 and SRH and rights outcomes.","Sexual and reproductive health (SRH): a key issue in the emergency response to the coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) outbreak","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/copyright-and-license","1742-4755","BMC","EN","Reproductive Health","2020-04-26T12:18:16","School of Medicine, Tsinghua University",1,

This review describes the latest MERS-CoV clusters and the first cases of nosocomial transmission within health care facilities in Oman. We have highlighted lessons learned and proposed steps to prevent healthcare-associated infections. Methods: A descriptive analysis of MERS-CoV cases was conducted between January 23 and February 16, 2019. The data from officials and other published sources used. Results: Thirteen laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV were reported from three simultaneous clusters from two governorates without an epidemiological link between the clusters. Two clusters were reported from North Al Batinah Governorate, with nine cases (69%) and 1 cluster from South Ash Sharqiyah Governorate with four cases (31%). In total, four deaths were reported (case fatality rate 31%). Four cases (31%) reported were household contacts from the first cluster, 3 (23%) were nosocomial transmission in health care facilities (two for first and one from the second cluster) and 7 (54%) were community-acquired cases. Conclusions: The first local clusters of MERS-CoV reported with evidence suggestive of healthcare and household-associated transmission. Early diagnosis and strict implementation of infection control measures remain fundamental in preventing and managing MERS-CoV infection.

The World Health Organization (WHO) officially named it New Coronavirus Disease or COVID-19: COVI comes from coronavirus. The D stands for the disease. Chinese ministry of Health categorized it as a quarantined disease, and took strict preventive and control measures for this infectious disease. In Iran, the first cases of COVID-19 were reported from Qom on February 19, 2020, and spread to the other 31 provinces in 15 days. This study conducted to investigate some epidemiological features of the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran.

Methods: This study was conducted as a narrative review from February 19 to March 15, 2020. In this study, the most recent documentation published in pieces of literature, especially in China, has been reviewed. Moreover, mortality and morbidity of definite cases in Iran were summarized and reported.

Findings: The COVID-19 epidemic officially confirmed with two deaths in the city of Qom, Iran, on February 30, 2020, and spread rapidly throughout the 31 provinces in the country. During this period, 13938 cases and 724 deaths due to COVID-19 were reported by the Ministry of Health in Iran.

In Hong Kong, clinicians and other healthcare personnel collaborated closely to combat the outbreak of COVID-19 and minimize the cross-transmission of disease among hospital staff members. In the field of otorhinolaryngology—head and neck surgery (OHNS) and its various subspecialties, contingency plans were required for patient bookings in outpatient clinics, surgeries in operating rooms, protocols in wards and other services. Infected patients may shed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) particles into their environments via body secretions. Therefore, otolaryngologists and other healthcare personnel in this specialty face a high risk of contracting COVID-19 and must remain vigilant when performing examinations and procedures involving the nose and throat. In this article, we share our experiences of the planning and logistics undertaken to provide safe and efficient OHNS practices over the last 2?months, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope that our experiences will serve as pearls for otolaryngologists and other healthcare personnel working in institutes that serve large numbers of patients every day, particularly with regard to the sharing of clinical and administrative tasks during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pearls of experience for safe and efficient hospital practices in otorhinolaryngology—head and neck surgery in Hong Kong during the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/copyright-and-license","1916-0216","BMC","EN","Journal of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery","2020-05-17T12:41:47","Department of Otorhinolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery, United Christian Hospital and Tseung Kwan O Hospital",1,

Public Health England (PHE) Manchester is one of the two PHE centres in the UK that perform testing for MERS-CoV. The results of the PHE Manchester MERS surveillance from 2012 to 2019 are presented in this report. Methods: Retrospective data were collected for returning travellers from the Middle East fitting the PHE MERS case definition. Respiratory samples were tested for respiratory viruses and MERS-CoV using an in-house RT-PCR assay. Results: Four hundred and twenty-six (426) samples from 264 patients were tested for MERS Co-V and respiratory viruses. No MERS-CoV infections were identified by PCR. Fifty-six percent of samples were PCR positive for viral or bacterial pathogen with Influenza A as the predominant virus (44%). Sixty-two percent of all patients had a pathogen identified with the highest positivity from sputum samples. Patients with multiple samples demonstrated a 100% diagnostic yield. Conclusions: Although no cases of MERS were identified, the majority of patients had Influenza infection for which oseltamivir treatment was indicated and isolation warranted. Sputum samples were the most useful in diagnosing respiratory viruses with a 100% diagnostic yield from patients with multiple samples.

Within few weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a novel coronavirus designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of a “public-health emergency of international concern” due to the rapid and increasing spread of the disease worldwide. Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; thus, the objective of this study is to design a multiepitope peptide vaccine against COVID-19 using an immunoinformatics approach. Method. Several techniques facilitating the combination of the immunoinformatics approach and comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for designing the T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target. Results. Extensive mutations, insertion, and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in the COVID-19 strain. Additionally, ten peptides binding to MHC class I and MHC class II were found to be promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99%, respectively. Conclusion. The T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using the envelope protein as an immunogenic target. Nevertheless, the proposed vaccine rapidly needs to be validated clinically in order to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile to help stop this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.","Design of a Multiepitope-Based Peptide Vaccine against the E Protein of Human COVID-19: An Immunoinformatics Approach","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/guidelines/","2314-6133","Hindawi Limited","EN","BioMed Research International","2020-05-25T13:45:28","Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan",1,

RESUMEN

Objetivo. Determinar los agentes infecciosos asociados causalmente a la presentación de Diarrea Neonatal Bovina (DNB) en terneros menores de 5 semanas de vida, procedentes de fincas lecheras y de producción mixta de la Sabana de Bogotá. Materiales y métodos. Se seleccionaron por conveniencia 21 fincas, se realizó seguimiento de 620 terneros desde el nacimiento hasta las 5 semanas de edad, se tomaron muestras de materia fecal de los animales que presentaron cuadro clínico de diarrea y de terneros clínicamente sanos como controles pareados. Se realizaron pruebas de ELISA para diagnóstico de E.coli F5, Rotavirus, Coronavirus, Cryptosporidium sp., y Salmonella sp., prueba de Ritchie para diagnóstico de Giardia sp., y tinción de Ziehl Neelsen modificada para Cryptosporidium sp. Se evaluó la asociación epidemiológica entre los agentes y la presentación de diarrea usando prueba de c2, seguido de un modelo de regresión logística (p<0.05). Resultados. Se encontró en la prueba de ELISA que de la totalidad de las muestras, 51 (38.3%), 26 (19.7%), 10 (7.5%) y 1 (0.75%) fueron positivas a Cryptosporidium sp., rotavirus, E coli F5 y coronavirus, respectivamente. Los animales positivos a Rotavirus por la prueba de ELISA y a Cryptosporidium sp., por la técnica de Ziehl Neelsen modificada tuvieron 2.6 y 7.0 veces mayor probabilidad que los demás animales de presentar DNB, respectivamente. Conclusiones. Los resultados presentados son los primeros que muestran el papel y la importancia del Cryptosporidium sp., y del Rotavirus en la DNB en las explotaciones ganaderas de la Sabana de Bogotá y en Colombia.

Public health measures implemented by the two countries were reviewed. 

Results: The epidemiology of the 2015 MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea remained similar to the MERS outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. In addition, strong infection control and response measures were effective in controlling the outbreak. In view of the air traffic between Singapore and MERS-affected areas, importation of MERS cases into Singapore is possible. Nonetheless, the risk of a serious public health impact to Singapore in the event of an imported case of MERS would be mitigated by its strong health-care system and established infection control practices. 

Discussion: The MERS outbreak was sparked by an exported case from the Middle East, which remains a concern as the reservoir of infection (thought to be camels) continues to exist in the Middle East, and sporadic cases in the community and outbreaks in health-care settings continue to occur there. This risk assessment highlights the need for Singapore to stay vigilant and to continue enhancing core public health capacities to detect and respond to MERS coronavirus.","Assessment of the risk posed to Singapore by the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in the Republic of Korea","PH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://ojs.wpro.who.int/ojs/index.php/wpsar/about/submissions#copyrightNotice","2094-7313","World Health Organization","EN","Western Pacific Surveillance and Response","2016-07-14T20:29:09","Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, Public Health Group, Ministry of Health, Singapore",,

While assays detecting nucleic acids were implemented quickly, assays to detect anti-PDCoV antibodies have not been available. In this study, an indirect anti-PDCoV IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the putative S1 portion of the spike protein was developed and utilized to determine the prevalence of anti-PDCoV IgG in U.S. pigs. The diagnostic sensitivity of the PDCoV ELISA was 91% with a diagnostic specificity of 95%. A total of 968 serum samples were tested including samples with confirmed infection with PDCoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus or porcine respiratory coronavirus. There was no cross-reactivity with any of the other coronaviruses. Among 355 arbitrarily selected serum samples collected in 2014 and originating from 51 farms across 18 U.S. states, anti-PDCoV IgG antibodies were detected in 8.7% of the samples and in 25.5% of the farms whereas anti-PEDV IgG was detected in 22.8% of the samples and in 54.9% of the farms. In addition, anti-PDCoV IgG antibodies were detected in archived samples collected in 2010, perhaps indicating an earlier undetected introduction into the U.S. pig population. Overall, the obtained data suggest that PDCoV seroprevalence in U.S. pigs is lower compared to PEDV and PDCoV may have been introduced to the U.S. prior to PEDV.","Development and application of an ELISA for the detection of porcine deltacoronavirus IgG antibodies.","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license","1932-6203","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","EN","PLoS ONE","2016-06-10T12:02:26",,1,

The world is currently witnessing a dramatic disruption of everyday life owing to the rapid progression of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As the pandemic evolves, there is an urgent need to better understand its epidemiology, characterize its potential impact, and identify mitigatory strategies to avert pandemic-related mortality. There is a need for a tool or algorithm to evaluate the extent to which public health policy and/or economic preparedness measures are effectively averting COVID-19 related mortality. We present a simple and yet practical epidemiological tool, the Pandemic Efficiency Index (PEI), that can be utilized globally to test the relative efficiency of measures put in place to avert death resulting from COVID-19 infection. Using the PEI and current COVID-19-related mortality, we determined that so far Germany demonstrates the highest PEI (5.1) among countries with more than 5,000 recorded cases of the infection, indicating high quality measures instituted by the country to avert death during the pandemic. Italy and France currently have the lowest COVID-19-related PEIs. Epidemics and pandemics come and go, but local, national, and global abilities to determine the efficiency of their efforts in averting deaths is critical.

This article discusses mortality patterns of the deadliest epidemic in the last 120 years – the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918. Statistical sources from Italy and the USA, published shortly after the pandemic, were analyzed. The analysis was carried out for mortality from all causes, since in this case inaccuracies associated with establishing the causes of death are minimized. Despite the fact that the first cases of the Spanish flu appeared in the United States as early as March 1918, this first wave of epidemic practically did not affect the total mortality rate. The main peak of mortality in 1918 occurred in October 1918 both in the USA and Italy, with a gradual decrease in mortality over several months. Analysis of age-specific mortality demonstrates a significant increase in mortality at middle ages (20-50 years) in 1918 compared with 1917. Analysis of mortality trends using the method of latent variables shows a significant increase in the background mortality factor in 1918, which turned out to be higher for Italy than the mortality losses during the Second World War. The Spanish flu pandemic differs from the current coronavirus pandemic, because of significant increase in mortality of middle-aged people, while the COVID-19 pandemic causes a more marked increase in mortality among the elderly. With this, the COVID-19 pandemic is more like the recent flu epidemics than the earlier Spanish flu pandemic.

Since the disease does not currently have a particular treatment, there is a compelling need to find substitute means to dominate its expansion. In this rapid review, we aimed to determine some countries’ public responses to the COVID-19 epidemic.<br />Methods: In this study, academic databases, including MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase, were investigated. The keywords applied in the search strategy besides the names of each country were: “Public Health,” “Public Response”, “Health Policy”, “COVID-19”, “Novel Coronavirus,” “2019-nCoV”, and “SARS-COV-2”. The countries included China, Italy, Iran, Spain, South Korea, Germany, France, United States, Australia, Canada, Japan, and Singapore.<br />Results: The total number of retrieved articles in MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase in April 2020 was 594, and after removing 259 duplicate articles, 335 papers were screened by the experts. After this investigation, 50 articles, in addition to 12 webpages, were extensively reviewed for the results section. Public health strategies and responses can be divided into four main areas, including monitoring, public education, crowd controlling, and care facilities.<br />Conclusion: According to the results of the management decisions of some governments on quarantining, social isolation, screening methods, and flight suspensions due to the severity and anonymity of COVID-19, it is highly assured that these strategies would be the most successful approaches to confront the present pandemic. Governments should put in place timely and strict measures to halt the spread and diminish its unintended deadly consequences.","International Public Health Responses to COVID-19 Outbreak: A Rapid Review","IR",1,"CC BY-ND","CC BY-ND","http://ijms.sums.ac.ir/journal/authors.note","0253-0716","Shiraz University of Medical Sciences","EN","Iranian Journal of Medical Sciences","2020-06-06T06:09:19","Clinical Education Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran",,

Since infected patients transported out of China, the outbreak status was quickly changed into pandemic. Comparison of available genome sequences of the virus strains enlightened most questions as the cell receptors (ACE2) responsible for the virus tropism which determines possible organs and tissues to be affected by the virus as well as possible involvement of the age groups and host diversity. SARS-Cov-2, new member of Coronaviridae shares some clinical and epidemiological aspects similar to previous high pathogenic human coronavirus, SARS-CoV, existed in 2002. The most outstanding property of SARS-CoV-2 is high transmission rate (reproduction number, R0=?3.58) between suspected and susceptible people. While bats are pointed as the original host and pangolins as an intermediate host, possibility of other species contribution is still unknown. According to recent data, reptiles i.e. snakes seem to be out of the group for possible intermediate hosts. Also there is no data supporting involvement of domestic animals even pets or food producing in the infection spectrum. This review summarizes the key findings of ongoing pandemia since the day disease existed. Molecular divergences now show that disease agent evolved into two types (S and L). Mutations and natural selections besides recombination will still continue to be the common feature of coronaviruses. Though implementation of common global measures and treatments other than rapid sharing the information will contribute prevention efforts and reducing the number of losses.","Coronavirus host divergence and novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak","TR",1,"CC BY-NC-SA","CC BY-NC-SA","https://dergipark.org.tr/ceoti","2667-8462","Clinical and Experimental Ocular Trauma and Infection","EN","Clinical and Experimental Ocular Trauma and Infection","2020-05-20T08:56:53","VETER?NER FAKÜLTES?",,

Despite the wide outbreak of the infection, a remarkable asymmetry is observed in the number of cases and in the distribution of the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms in patients with respect to the countries/regions. In the early stages of a new pathogen outbreak, it is critical to understand the dynamics of the infection transmission, in order to follow contagion over time and project the epidemiological situation in the near future. While it is possible to reason that observed variation in the number and severity of cases stems from the initial number of infected individuals, the difference in the testing policies and social aspects of community transmissions, the factors that could explain high discrepancy in areas with a similar level of healthcare still remain unknown. Here, we introduce a binary classifier based on an artificial neural network that can help in explaining those differences and that can be used to support the design of containment policies. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection frequency positively correlates with particulate air pollutants, and specifically with particulate matter 2.5 (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), while ozone gas is oppositely related with the number of infected individuals. We propose that atmospheric air pollutants could thus serve as surrogate markers to complement the infection outbreak anticipation.","Spatial–Temporal Variations in Atmospheric Factors Contribute to SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses/about","1999-4915","MDPI AG","EN","Viruses","2020-05-28T00:03:55","Genewerk GmbH, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany",1,

Whereas the variability of virulence among reservoir-borne viruses is unknown, it is generally assumed that the emergence of epidemic viruses from animal reservoirs requires human adaptation. To understand the influence of a viral factor in relation to interspecies spillover, we studied the papain-like protease (PLP) of SARS-CoV. This key enzyme drives the early stages of infection as it cleaves the viral polyprotein, deubiquitinates viral and cellular proteins, and antagonizes the interferon (IFN) response. We identified a bat SARS-CoV PLP, which shared 86% amino acid identity with SARS-CoV PLP, and used reverse genetics to insert it into the SARS-CoV genome. The resulting virus replicated like SARS-CoV in Vero cells but was suppressed in IFN competent MA-104 (3.7-fold), Calu-3 (2.6-fold) and human airway epithelial cells (10.3-fold). Using ectopically-expressed PLP variants as well as full SARS-CoV infectious clones chimerized for PLP, we found that a protease-independent, anti-IFN function exists in SARS-CoV, but not in a SARS-related, bat-borne virus. This PLP-mediated anti-IFN difference was seen in primate, human as well as bat cells, thus independent of the host context. The results of this study revealed that coronavirus PLP confers a variable virulence trait among members of the species SARS-CoV, and that a SARS-CoV lineage with virulent PLPs may have pre-existed in the reservoir before onset of the epidemic.","The papain-like protease determines a virulence trait that varies among members of the SARS-coronavirus species.","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/s/content-license","1553-7366","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","EN","PLoS Pathogens","2018-10-24T05:31:50",,1,

Further, sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 in several European countries show a similar number of cases between the sexes, but more severe outcomes in aged men. Case fatality is highest in men with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. The mechanisms accounting for the reduced case fatality rate in women are currently unclear but may offer potential to develop novel risk stratification tools and therapeutic options for women and men. Content The present review summarizes latest clinical and epidemiological evidence for gender and sex differences in COVID-19 from Europe and China. We discuss potential sex-specific mechanisms modulating the course of disease, such as hormone-regulated expression of genes encoding for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) entry receptors angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptor and TMPRSS2 as well as sex hormone-driven innate and adaptive immune responses and immunoaging. Finally, we elucidate the impact of gender-specific lifestyle, health behavior, psychological stress, and socioeconomic conditions on COVID-19 and discuss sex specific aspects of antiviral therapies. Conclusion The sex and gender disparities observed in COVID-19 vulnerability emphasize the need to better understand the impact of sex and gender on incidence and case fatality of the disease and to tailor treatment according to sex and gender.

Understanding the dynamics of the epidemic is essential for decision making, and to reduce the health, economic, and social impacts of the pandemic. The present study aimed to estimate the effective reproductive number (Rt) of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) infection during the first 10 days of the outbreak in seven Latin American countries with the highest incidence of cases as of March 23, 2020. Furthermore, we chose to compare the seven countries with Spain and Italy given their history with the virus. Methods: Incidence data retrieved from the COVID-19 data repository by Johns Hopkins University were analyzed. The Rt was calculated for the first 10 days of the epidemic in Brazil, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Panama, Mexico, and Peru. Rt estimations were compared with Spain and Italy values for the same interval. Results: The median Rt for the first 10 days of the COVID-19 epidemic were 2.90 (2.67-3.14) for Spain and 2.83 (2.7-2.96) for Italy. Latin American Rt estimations were higher in Ecuador (3.95(3.7-4.21)), Panama (3.95(3.7-4.21)), and Brazil (3.95(3.7-4.21)). The smallest one was observed in Peru (2.36(2.11-2.63)). All Latin American countries had Rt greater than 2. Conclusions: The initial stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in Latin America suggested a high Rt. Interventions such as domestic and international travel restrictions, educational institutions closure, social distancing, and intensified case surveillance should be adopted to prevent the collapse of the health systems.","Effective Reproductive Number estimation for initial stage of COVID-19 pandemic in Latin American Countries","NL",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","http://www.elsevier.com/journals/international-journal-of-infectious-diseases/1201-9712/open-access-journal","1201-9712","Elsevier","EN","International Journal of Infectious Diseases","2020-05-07T05:17:54","Escuela de Medicina.

Aims: The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the prevalence of comorbidities in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients and the risk of underlying diseases in severe patients compared to non-severe patients. Methods: A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science through February 25, 2020. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models. Results: Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, including 1 576 infected patients. The results showed the most prevalent clinical symptom was fever (91.3%, 95% CI: 86–97%), followed by cough (67.7%, 95% CI: 59–76%), fatigue (51.0%, 95% CI: 34–68%) and dyspnea (30.4%, 95% CI: 21–40%). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (21.1%, 95% CI: 13.0–27.2%) and diabetes (9.7%, 95% CI: 7.2–12.2%), followed by cardiovascular disease (8.4%, 95% CI: 3.8–13.8%) and respiratory system disease (1.5%, 95% CI: 0.9–2.1%).

In December 2019 a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China causing many cases of severe pneumonia. World Health Organization (WHO) named this disease Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The infection has rapidly spread across China to many other countries, and on March 12, 2020 the WHO declared pandemic outbreak of COVID-19. As of May 16, 2020, COVID-19 has been diagnosed in more than 4,490,000 patients, associated to 305,976 deaths worldwide; in Italy 224,760 COVID-19 cases have been reported with 31,763 deaths. The main routes of transmission are respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people, so numerous prevention strategies are employed to mitigate the spread of disease, including social distancing and isolation. The aim of this narrative review is to underline gender differences in epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, prognosis and mortality of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Currently data on the sex indicators for admitted or deceased patients are only available, but there is no analysis about other gender indicators. The data considered in our study are the only currently available in the literature, but it is appropriate to implement a specific analysis with all gender indicators to identify appropriate strategies. Moreover, the evaluation of a health service efficiency is a key element to define gender outcomes. Knowing the gender differences in COVID-19 outbreak would be a fundamental tool to understand the effects of a health emergency on individuals and communities as well as to carry out effective and equitable policies, public health measures and targeted solutions.

This study described the epidemiological pattern of viral and atypical bacteria as causes for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in hospitalized patients in Egypt.
Patients and methods SARI surveillance was carried out at a Teaching University Hospital during the period 2010–2014. All hospitalized adults and pediatric patients meeting the WHO case definition criteria for SARI were enrolled. Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs were collected and samples were tested using reverse transcription-PCR for influenza A, B, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, 4, adenovirus, human bocavirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, and atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma spp., Chlamydia spp., and Legionella spp.).
Results Overall, 1075/3207 (33.5%) cases had a viral etiology, and included 912 (84.4%) women and 163 (15.6%) men, with a mean age of 5.74±13.87 years. The highest rates were reported for respiratory syncytial virus (485 cases, 45.2%), parainfluenza virus (125, 11.6%), and adenovirus (105, 9.8%). Single viral etiology was reported in 901 (83.3%), while 174 (16.7%) cases had multiple etiologies. Children had a higher rate (981, 91.2%) compared with 94 (8.8%) cases in adults. Only three and one cases were positive for Mycoplasma spp. and Chlamydia spp. infections, respectively. Neither coronavirus nor Legionella spp. were detected.
Conclusion Viral infections were encountered in one-third of hospitalized Egyptian adult and pediatric patients with SARI. Atypical bacteria had a minor role in SARI in our locality. Ongoing surveillance programs will better describe the epidemiology of SARI and will provide specific data to enable decision makers to take appropriate prevention measures.","Viral and atypical bacterial etiologies of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in Egyptian patients: epidemiological patterns and results from the sentinel surveillance study 2010–2014","IN",1,"CC BY-NC-SA","CC BY-NC-SA","http://www.ejcdt.eg.net/aboutus.asp","0422-7638","Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications","EN","Egyptian Journal of Chest Disease and Tuberculosis","2019-03-25T08:29:15",,,

In addition, clinical trials on the efficacy of antiviral therapies in the management of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have also been reviewed, in order to identify potential treatment options for COVID-19.

Method: An extensive search was performed in Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and CENTRAL databases until the end of March 15, 2020. Two independent researchers performed the screening, and finally the related studies were included.

Results: Only one clinical trial on the efficacy of antiviral therapy in management of COVID-19 was found. The results depicted that adding Lopinavir-Ritonavir to the standard treatment regimen of patients with severe COVID-19 has no benefits. Moreover, 21 case-series and case-report studies reported the prescription of antiviral agents in COVID-19, none of which can be used to determine the efficacy of antiviral therapies in confronting COVID-19. In addition, no clinical trials were found to be performed on the efficacy of antiviral agents in the management of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

Conclusion: The current evidence impede researchers from proposing an appropriate antiviral therapy against COVID-19, making the current situation a serious concern for international organizations such as World Health Organization (WHO). In the time of the current pandemic and future epidemics, organizations such as WHO should pursue more proactive actions and plan well-designed clinical trials so that their results can be used in managing future epidemics.","Antiviral therapy in management of COVID-19: a systematic review on current evidence","IR",1,"CC BY-NC","CC BY-NC","http://journals.sbmu.ac.ir/aaem/index.php/AAEM/about/submissions#copyrightNotice","2645-4904","Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences","EN","Archives of Academic Emergency Medicine","2020-04-21T06:50:26","Journal Manager",,

Over the past few decades new zoonotic infectious diseases of humans caused by pathogens arising from animal reservoirs have included West Nile virus, Yellow fever virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, Lassa Fever virus, Hanta virus, Dengue fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, and Zika virus. The recent Ebola Virus Disease epidemic in West Africa and the ongoing Zika Virus outbreak in South America highlight the urgent need for local, regional and international public health systems to be be more coordinated and better prepared. The One Health concept focuses on the relationship and interconnectedness between Humans, Animals and the Environment, and recognizes that the health and wellbeing of humans is intimately connected to the health of animals and their environment (and vice versa). Critical to the establishment of a One Health platform is the creation of a multidisciplinary team with a range of expertise including public health officers, physicians, veterinarians, animal husbandry specialists, agriculturalists, ecologists, vector biologists, viral phylogeneticists, and researchers to co-operate, collaborate to learn more about zoonotic spread between animals, humans and the environment and to monitor, respond to and prevent major outbreaks. We discuss the unique opportunities for Middle Eastern and African stakeholders to take leadership in building equitable and effective partnerships with all stakeholders involved in human and health systems to take forward a ‘One Health’ approach to control such zoonotic pathogens with epidemic potential.","Taking forward a ‘One Health’ approach for turning the tide against the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and other zoonotic pathogens with epidemic potential","NL",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","http://www.elsevier.com/journals/international-journal-of-infectious-diseases/1201-9712/open-access-journal","1201-9712","Elsevier","EN","International Journal of Infectious Diseases","2016-08-03T13:00:48","Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London and NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK",,

The epidemiological profiles of the MERS-CoV infections suggest zoonotic transmission from an animal reservoir to humans. Methods: This study was designed to investigate animal herds associated with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-infected patients in Saudi Arabia, during the last three years (2014–2016). Nasal swabs and serum samples from 584 dromedary camels, 39 sheep, 51 goats, and 2 cattle were collected. Nasal samples from camels, sheep, goats, and cattle were examined by real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to detect MERS-CoV RNA, and the Anti-MERS ELISA assay was performed to detect camel humeral immune response (IgG) to MERS-CoV S1 antigen infection. The complete genome sequencing of ten MERS-CoV camel isolates and phylogenetic analysis was performed. Results: The data indicated that seventy-five dromedary camels were positive for MERS-CoV RNA; the virus was not detected in sheep, goats, and cattle. MERS-CoV RNA from infected camels was not detected beyond 2 weeks after the first positive result was detected in nasal swabs obtained from infected camels. Anti-MERS ELISA assays showed that 70.9% of camels related to human cases had antibodies to MERS-CoV. The full genome sequences of the ten MERS-CoV camel isolates were identical to their corresponding patients and were grouped together within the larger MERS-CoV sequences cluster for human and camel isolates reported form the Arabian Peninsula. Conclusions: These findings indicate that camels are a significant reservoir for the maintenance of MERS-CoVs, and they are an important source of human infection with MERS.

This study surveyed the prevalence of HCoV-NL63 and influenza viruses in patients with influenza-like illness in Taiwan during 2010â??2011. Methods: Throat samples from 107 hospitalized patients with pneumonia and 175 outpatients with influenza-like illness were examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction assays with virus-specific primers, and then virus-positive specimens were confirmed by sequencing the polymerase chain reaction products. Results: HCoV-NL63 infection was identified in 8.4% (9/107) of hospitalized patients with pneumonia, but not found in outpatients with influenza-like illness. Age distribution of HCoV-NL63 infection in hospitalized patients with pneumonia indicated that the group aged 16â??25Â years (20%) had the highest positive rate compared with the other groups, and exhibited a similar age-specific pattern to influenza A/H1N1 infection, but not influenza A/H3N2 and B infections in hospitalized patients. Seasonal prevalence of HCoV-NL63 infection was late winter, overlapping the highest peak of the influenza A/H1N1 epidemic during December 2010 to March 2011 in Taiwan. Co-infection of HCoV-NL63 and influenza A/H1N1 was detected in three hospitalized patients. Clinical manifestation analysis indicated that the main symptoms for HCoV-NL63 infection included fever (88.9%), cough (77.8%), and pneumonia (100%). Co-infection caused significantly higher rates of breathing difficulties, cough, and sore throat than those of single infection with HCoV-NL63 and influenza A/H1N1. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a low level of heterogeneity between Taiwan and global HCoV-NL63 strains. Conclusion: Understanding epidemiology of HCoV-NL63 in Taiwan provides an insight for worldwide surveillance of HCoV-NL63 infection.

Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R 0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of R t . In the first assumption, R t was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with R t ?=?1.9, 2.6, or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258, and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, R t was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (R t ?=?3.1, 2.6, and 1.9) to below 1 (R t ?=?0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public health intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077–84,520 or 55,869–81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce R t to an ideal level and control the infection.","Phase-adjusted estimation of the number of Coronavirus Disease 2019 cases in Wuhan, China","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.nature.com/openresearch/naturejournal/celldisc/","2056-5968","Nature Publishing Group","EN","Cell Discovery","2020-03-01T12:22:48","School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine",1,

However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Drug repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV–host interactome and drug targets in the human protein–protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%). Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and HCoV–host interactions in the human interactome, we prioritize 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (e.g., melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that are further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. We further identify three potential drug combinations (e.g., sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the “Complementary Exposure” pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV–host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2.","Network-based drug repurposing for novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.nature.com/openresearch/naturejournal/celldisc/","2056-5968","Nature Publishing Group","EN","Cell Discovery","2020-03-20T18:08:34","Genomic Medicine Institute, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic",1,

The aims were to investigate medical needs of lung cancer patients and their mental health status during the epidemic periods, so as to provide rational recommendations for subsequent diagnosis and treatment. Methods The questionnaire was sent in the form of an electronic questionnaire at 7am on 4th, March, 2020, until 7am 6th, March, 2020, 368 questionnaires were recollected from 25 provinces (autonomous regions/municipalities) in 48 h. Results Of the 368 patients, 18 patients were excluded as they didn’t receive anti-tumor treatment, and 350 patients were included in the final analysis. 229 cases were treated with oral targeted drugs, and 121 cases were treated with chemotherapy or immunotherapy. 41.3% of patients treated with intravenous chemotherapy or immunotherapy experienced treatment discontinuation, and the proportion of treatment discontinuation in chemotherapy or immunotherapy was higher than those treated with oral targeted drugs (21.0%). Whether oral targeted drugs or intravenous chemotherapy or immunotherapy, more than 60% of patients experienced delays in imaging examinations. Nearly one third of patients developed new symptoms or exacerbation of existing symptoms. 26.6%-28.9% of patients have changed their treatment plans through online consultation. During novel coronavirus pneumonia, 40%-75% of lung cancer patients have mental health problems, and more than 95% of patients support government’s prevention and control measures. Conclusions During the emergence of NCP, the medical needs of patients with lung cancer have not been enough, especially those who discontinued chemotherapy or immunotherapy. When medical institution resumes work, priority should be given to them. At the same time, mental health problems of patients should be valued and resolved timely.","Explore the Optimal Resolvent of Medical Needs and Mental Health for Patients with Lung Cancer during Epidemic Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia","CN",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.lungca.org/index.php?journal=01&page=about&op=submissions#copyrightNotice","1009-3419","Chinese Anti-Cancer Association; Chinese Antituberculosis Association","ZH","Chinese Journal of Lung Cancer","2020-04-22T06:14:13","Department of Comprehensive Oncology, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100021, China",,

Overall, the results confirm the existence of multifractality in European stock markets during the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, based on multifractal properties, efficiency varies among these markets. The Spanish stock market remains most efficient while the least efficient is that of Austria. Belgium, Italy and Germany remain somewhere in the middle.

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic in 2002-2003, and the recent emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in April 2012, emphasize the high probability of future zoonotic HCoV emergence causing severe and lethal human disease. Additionally, the resistance of SARS-CoV to ribavirin (RBV) demonstrates the need to define new targets for inhibition of CoV replication. CoVs express a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is required for high-fidelity replication and is conserved across the CoV family. All genetic and biochemical data support the hypothesis that nsp14-ExoN has an RNA proofreading function. Thus, we hypothesized that ExoN is responsible for CoV resistance to RNA mutagens. We demonstrate that while wild-type (ExoN+) CoVs were resistant to RBV and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), CoVs lacking ExoN activity (ExoN-) were up to 300-fold more sensitive. While the primary antiviral activity of RBV against CoVs was not mutagenesis, ExoN- CoVs treated with 5-FU demonstrated both enhanced sensitivity during multi-cycle replication, as well as decreased specific infectivity, consistent with 5-FU functioning as a mutagen. Comparison of full-genome next-generation sequencing of 5-FU treated SARS-CoV populations revealed a 16-fold increase in the number of mutations within the ExoN- population as compared to ExoN+. Ninety percent of these mutations represented A:G and U:C transitions, consistent with 5-FU incorporation during RNA synthesis. Together our results constitute direct evidence that CoV ExoN activity provides a critical proofreading function during virus replication. Furthermore, these studies identify ExoN as the first viral protein distinct from the RdRp that determines the sensitivity of RNA viruses to mutagens. Finally, our results show the importance of ExoN as a target for inhibition, and suggest that small-molecule inhibitors of ExoN activity could be potential pan-CoV therapeutics in combination with RBV or RNA mutagens.","Coronaviruses lacking exoribonuclease activity are susceptible to lethal mutagenesis: evidence for proofreading and potential therapeutics.","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/s/content-license","1553-7366","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","EN","PLoS Pathogens","2016-06-14T16:00:54",,1,

Therefore, the prevalence of MERS-CoV infections in the general population could be underestimated, which necessitates active surveillance to determine the epidemiological importance of asymptomatic cases. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of various serological assays and to estimate the seroprevalence of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in high- and low-risk groups in Qatar. A total of 4858 samples were screened, including 4719 samples collected from healthy blood donors (BD) over a period of five years (2012-2016), 135 samples from baseline case contacts (CC) collected from individuals in close contact with three positive PCR-confirmed patients (CP), and four samples from MERS-CoV CP. Initial screening using anti-MERS-CoV IgG (IgG rS1-ELISA kit) revealed ten reactive samples from BD (10/4719, 0.21%), one from CC (1/135, 0.74%), and three from CP (3/4, 75%). Samples from CP but not from BD were also reactive by whole-virus anti-MERS-CoV IgG (n=3/4) and IgM (n=1/4) indirect immunefluorescent tests (IIFT) and pseudoparticle neutralization test (ppNT). The reactive sample from CC was also confirmed by ppNT. Surprisingly, one out of thirteen (7.7%) randomly selected IgG rS1-ELISA-negative BD samples from the initial screening was reactive by the IgM-IIFT (but not by the IgG-IIFT) and was subsequently confirmed by ppNT. All IgG rS1-ELISA-reactive samples from BD exhibited considerable reactivity to the four circulating human coronaviruses (HKU1, OC43, 229E, and NL63). Cross-reactivity with SARS was only reported for samples from CP using IgG and IgM-IIFT. In conclusion, we report a low prevalence of anti-MERS antibodies in the general population, which coincides with the low number of all reported cases by the time of our study (2017) in Qatar (n=21). The false-positive results and the observed cross-reactivity between MERS-CoV and other circulating human coronavirus necessitate more detailed evaluation of available serological assays.","Comparative Serological Study for the Prevalence of Anti-MERS Coronavirus Antibodies in High- and Low-Risk Groups in Qatar","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jir/guidelines/","2314-7156","Hindawi Limited","EN","Journal of Immunology Research","2019-03-05T13:44:02","Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Health Sciences, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar",1,

The literature review details the processes of SARS-CoV-2 binding to a human cell receptor that express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as well as the internalization, replication of the virus, and the release of new virions from an infected cell, which affect target organs (lungs, digestive tract, heart, central nervous system and kidneys) and induce the development of local and systemic inflammatory respon­ses. Existing methods of drug exposure that prevent human infection with SARS-CoV-2 are described. The main epidemiological moments of infection with SARS-CoV-2 were identified, indica­ting a predominant damage in the elderly and more often males due to the higher level of expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, mostly in alveolocytes, than in females. The mechanisms of the development of the response of the innate and adaptive immune systems of a macroorganism to infection with SARS-CoV-2 are demonstrated. Therapeutic strategies are presented that are related to the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on various stages of vital activity: internalization — the use of soluble S-protein domains, antibodies against S-protein, single-chain variable fragment of antibodies to ACE2 or inhibition of glycosylation of cell receptors, blocking the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein with ACE2 protein and suppression of internalization of the virus by administration of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; replication — inhibition of a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the use of favipiravir, a non-nucleoside antiviral drug triazavirin, antiretroviral drugs (lopinavir in combination with ritonavir), nelfinavir, ribavirin, halidesivir, umifenovir, inhibitors of chymotrypsin-like protease (cinancerin, flavonoids) and papain-like protease. The above therapeutic me­thods in the near future will be aimed at preventing the development and treatment of both acute respiratory distress syndrome and conditions caused by damage to other targeted organs with COVID-19.","Pathogenesis of COVID-19","UA",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://childshealth.zaslavsky.com.ua/about/submissions#copyrightNotice","2224-0551","Publishing House Zaslavsky","EN","Zdorov?e Rebenka","2020-04-23T19:46:07","State Institution “Dnipropetrovsk Medical Academy of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine”, Dnipro, Ukraine",,

However, the impact of the MERS epidemic on the Saudi economy is unknown.Purpose: The present study aimed to evaluate the direct medical costs associated with the management of MERS cases at a tertiary referral hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Methods: The study involved a retrospective chart review of confirmed cases of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections in a tertiary care referral center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from January 2015 to October 2018. The collected data included sociodemographic characteristics, medical information, and the cost of hospitalization of each patient as estimated by micro-costing.Results: A complete set of relevant information was available only for 24 of 44 identified MERS-CoV cases. Patients were mostly females, and the mean age was 52 years. Diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease were the most frequent comorbidities. The length of hospital stay varied from 1 to 31 days, averaging 4.96 &plusmn; 7.29 days. Two of the 24 patients died. The total cost of managing a MERS case at the hospital ranged from $1278.41 to $75,987.95 with a mean cost of $12,947.03 &plusmn; $19,923.14.Conclusion: The findings of this study highlight the enormous expenses incurred by the Saudi health care system due to the MERS-CoV outbreak and the importance of developing an enforceable nationwide policy to control MERS-CoV transmission and infection.Keywords: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, costs and cost analysis, Saudi Arabia","Estimation Of Direct Medical Costs Of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection: A Single-Center Retrospective Chart Review Study","GB",1,"CC BY-NC","CC BY-NC","http://www.dovepress.com/why_publish_with_dove.php?content_id=3045","1178-6973","Dove Medical Press","EN","Infection and Drug Resistance","2019-11-07T19:01:51",,,

Most of nurses’ work involves direct contact with patients. As nurses have high vulnerability to COVID-19, it is necessary to establish hospital-specific protocols to reduce the risk of nurses’ infection in interactions with COVID-19 patients. Our hospital has maintained a “zero nurse infection” rate while battling SARS in 2003 and during the present COVID-19 epidemic.

When a viral epidemic breaks out, assessing its pandemic risk is an important part of the process that characterizes genomic property, viral pathogenicity, transmission in animal model, and so forth. In this review, we intend to figure out how a pandemic may occur by looking into the past influenza pandemic events. We discuss interpretations of the experimental evidences resulted from animal model studies and extend implications of viral pandemic potentials and ingredients to emerging viral epidemics. Focusing on the pandemic potential of viral infectious diseases, we suggest what should be assessed to prevent global catastrophes from influenza virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, dengue and Zika viruses.","Animal models for the risk assessment of viral pandemic potential","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","https://labanimres.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/copyright","1738-6055","BMC","EN","Laboratory Animal Research","2020-04-26T12:18:59","Department of Microbiology, Institute for Viral Diseases, College of Medicine, Korea University",,

HCoV infections can be associated with respiratory and extrarespiratory manifestations, including central nervous system involvement. Furthermore, unlike other RNA viruses, HCoVs can easily mutate and recombine when different strains infect the same cells and give rise to a novel virus with unpredictable host ranges and pathogenicity.

The recent discovery of equine-related infections and deaths in addition to a canine infection demonstrates the inadequacy of the current equine vaccine developed in 2012. Traditional models for controlling the spread of the vector are futile given the rapid pace at which bats' habitats are eroded. Recent ongoing zoonotic epidemics, for example, Ebola and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, demonstrate that human-to-human transmission is a distinct reality rather than an obscure possibility.

Related details of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV were extracted and analyzed by standard statistical methods.Results: A total of 107 cases of MERS-CoV, including 18 deaths (overall case fatality rate (CFR), 16.8%; male-specific CFR was 17.5% [14/80] and female-specific CFR was 14.8% [4/27]) were reported to WHO from the National International Health Regulation Focal Points of Saudi Arabia and Oman. The overall mean age was 50&plusmn;17 years and 80 patients (74.8%) were male. The average time from the onset of the symptoms to the first hospitalization was 3&plusmn;3.3 days; from the first hospitalization to laboratory confirmation was 3.6&plusmn;6.5 days; from the onset of symptom to death was 17.5&plusmn;11.7 days; and the mean length of hospitalization for&nbsp;patients with MERS-CoV was 3.5&plusmn;3.9 days. Males in comparison to females had a 1.5-fold increased chance (adjusted OR =1.5 [95% CI: 1.3&ndash;1.8]) of death related to MERS-CoV infection; 1.05 [95% CI: 1.1&ndash;3.3], 1.05 [95% CI: 1.2&ndash;2.8] and 1.06 [95% CI: 1.2&ndash;2.0] for those who had exposure to camels, camel milk consumption, and close contact with MERS-CoV cases, respectively. Health care workers had 2.4 fold [95% CI: 1.2&ndash;3.1] greater odds of death compared to other people.Conclusion: The knowledge obtained from this study can contribute to the development of a prevention program and early system warning against MERS-CoV infection.Keywords: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, emerging infectious disease, disease outbreaks","Epidemiological status of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2019: an update from January 1 to March 31, 2019","GB",1,"CC BY-NC","CC BY-NC","http://www.dovepress.com/why_publish_with_dove.php?content_id=3045","1178-7074","Dove Medical Press","EN","International Journal of General Medicine","2019-08-27T19:48:13",,,

The morbidity of the disease is high, that results in a significant decrease in milk production and consequently, economic losses. In the present study, we report on a classical outbreak of WD that affected a high-production Holstein dairy herd raised in a tropical country. The lactating batch included 154 cows, and 138 (90%) presented diarrhea in a short (nine days) period of time. Three (2%) cows died. The other batches of animals did not become ill. The evolution of the disease in the herd, including the clinical signs and epidemiological features, strongly suggested a WD case. Semi-nested PCR and RFLP confirmed that BCoV was the cause of the infection. Samples tested negative for all other enteric pathogens. This case report highlights the importance of BCoV in WD even in tropical countries such as Brazil.<br>O coronavirus bovino (BCoV) pode causar a diarreia de inverno (WD - Winter Dysentery) ao infectar bovinos adultos, particularmente em regiões de clima temperado ou frio. A morbidade da doença é alta, resultando em queda na produção de leite e, consequentemente, perdas econômicas. No presente estudo, é descrito um surto clássico de WD acometendo um rebanho de bovinos leiteiros da raça Holandesa PB, de alta produção, proveniente do estado do Paraná. O lote afetado era composto por 154 vacas em lactação, sendo que 138 (90%) apresentaram diarreia em um curto (nove dias) período de tempo e 3 (2%) vacas morreram em consequência da diarreia, desidratação e desequilíbrio eletrolítico. As outras categorias de animais do rebanho (bezerras, novilhas e vacas secas) não apresentaram sinal clínico. A evolução da doença clínica, assim como a epidemiologia da infecção sugeriu um quadro clássico de WD. O diagnóstico foi realizado por meio da identificação do BCoV, pela técnica de semi-nested PCR e confirmação por RFLP, em amostra fecal de uma vaca que veio a óbito. A presença de outros patógenos entéricos também foi avaliada e apresentou resultados negativos. O surto de WD descrito na região sul do Brasil alerta para a possibilidade da ocorrência dessa virose também em países situados em regiões de clima tropical.","An outbreak of winter dysentery caused by bovine coronavirus in a high-production dairy cattle herd from a tropical country","BR",1,"CC BY-NC","CC BY-NC","http://www.scielo.br/revistas/babt/iaboutj.htm","1516-8913","Instituto de Tecnologia do Paraná (Tecpar)","EN","Brazilian Archives of Biology and Technology","2013-09-04T13:02:40",,,

While early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The Chinese government has implemented containment strategies of city-wide lockdowns, screening at airports and train stations, and isolation of suspected patients; however, the cumulative case count keeps growing every day. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated.We use phenomenological models that have been validated during previous outbreaks to generate and assess short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the province of Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative confirmed cases for the 2019-nCoV outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China. Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model.Our most recent forecasts reported here, based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7409–7496 additional confirmed cases in Hubei and 1128–1929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days. Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 and 38,028 in Hubei and 11,588–13,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020.Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th – 9th). We also observe that each of the models predicts that the epidemic has reached saturation in both Hubei and other provinces. Our findings suggest that the containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has slowed in recent days.

As the number of coronavirus infections has exceeded 100,000 with toll deaths of about 5000 worldwide as of early March, 2020, scientists and researchers are racing to investigate the nature of this virus and evaluate the short and long term effects of this disease. Despite its negative impacts that obliged the World Health Organization to declare COVID-19 epidemic as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, the rate of mortality of this infection has not exceeded 3.4% globally. On the other hand, the mortality rate caused by ambient air pollution has contributed to 7.6% of all deaths in 2016 worldwide. The outbreak of COVID-19 has forced China to lockdown its industrial activities and hence dropped its NO<sub>2</sub> and carbon emissions by 30 and 25%, respectively. This work reports on the first case study that compares the air quality status before and after the crisis. It sheds light on the facts related to the demographics of deaths by gender, age and health status before infection. The historical data on air quality, estimates of annual deaths and its economic burden have been presented and analyzed. The actual daily deaths due to COVID-19 have been obtained from the official records of the daily Situation Reports published by World Health Organization as of March 11<sup>th</sup>. The rate of mortality due to COVID-19 was impacted by two factors: age and health status. Results show that 75% of deaths were related to cases that had underlying present diseases with the majority aged of 80+ years. The reported figures were compared with the average daily mortality due to poor air quality which reached up to 3287 deaths due to high levels of NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> and PM. The air quality status before the crisis was compared with the current situation showing that COVID-19 forced-industrial and anthropogenic activities lockdown may have saved more lives by preventing ambient air pollution than by preventing infection.","The dramatic impact of Coronavirus outbreak on air quality: Has it saved as much as it has killed so far?","IR",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.gjesm.net/","2383-3572","Global Journal of Environmental Science and Management ","EN","Global Journal of Environmental Science and Management ","2020-04-02T13:50:09","Division of Sustainable Development, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Qatar Foundation, Education City, P.O.

As of 31 January 2020, this epidemic had spread to 19 countries with 11?791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths. The World Health Organization has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Methods A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O’Malley. In this scoping review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus. The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors’ affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included in the analysis. All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in the references. Results Most of the publications were written using the English language (89.2%). The largest proportion of published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a majority (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars. Research articles initially focused on causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to prevention and control. Studies thus far have shown that the virus’ origination is in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal associations have not been confirmed. Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Preventive measures such as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection, contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective; hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care. Conclusions There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. During this early period, published research primarily explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus. Although these studies are relevant to control the current public emergency, more high-quality research is needed to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health emergency in both the short- and long-term.","Epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, prevention and control of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) during the early outbreak period: a scoping review","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/copyright-and-license","2049-9957","BMC","EN","Infectious Diseases of Poverty","2020-03-20T18:36:26","West China School of Public Health and West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University",1,

The coronavirus disease 2019 has not hit Nepal as hard as it has the rest of the world (as of 4th April
2020). Countries are reporting a saturation in healthcare facilities and facing a rise in demand for
human resources for health. It is difficult to predict the extent of the disease transmission in Nepal in
the absence of epidemiologic and statistical analysis in our context. But based on calculations made
by epidemiologists in other countries, there seems to be a significant possibility of an outbreak in our
communities too. Medical students can be a valuable human resource in a variety of ways to aid in
the country’s response to a possible outbreak. However, their involvement in the pandemic comes
with its own challenges. Thorough planning and preparation must be done before allowing medical
students to take part in the battle against the pandemic.

To date, there have been more than 1,260,000 COVID-19 patients, with a mortality rate of approximately 5.44%. Studies have shown that coagulation dysfunction is a major cause of death in patients with severe COVID-19. Therefore, the People’s Liberation Army Professional Committee of Critical Care Medicine and Chinese Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis grouped experts from the frontline of the Wuhan epidemic to come together and develop an expert consensus on diagnosis and treatment of coagulation dysfunction associated with a severe COVID-19 infection. This consensus includes an overview of COVID-19-related coagulation dysfunction, tests for coagulation, anticoagulation therapy, replacement therapy, supportive therapy and prevention. The consensus produced 18 recommendations which are being used to guide clinical work.","Chinese expert consensus on diagnosis and treatment of coagulation dysfunction in COVID-19","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/about /license ","2054-9369","BMC","EN","Military Medical Research","2020-04-26T12:18:12","Department of Critical Care Medicine, the 908th Hospital of Joint Logistics Support Forces of Chinese PLA",,

Several countries in the Middle East and around 22 countries worldwide have reported cases of human infection with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The exceptionally high fatality rate resulting from MERS-CoV infection in conjunction with the paucity of knowledge about this emerging virus has led to major public and international concern. Within the framework of the national acute respiratory illness surveillance, the Ministry of Health in the Sultanate of Oman has announced two confirmed cases of MERS-CoV to date. The aim of this report is to describe the epidemiological aspects of these two cases and to highlight the importance of public health preparedness and response. The absence of secondary cases among contacts of the reported cases can be seen as evidence of the effectiveness of infection prevention and control precautions as an important pillar of the national preparedness and response plan applied in the health care institutions in Oman.

The breeding success of the colony was significantly better in 2010 than in 2008, in spite of stronger amplification of coronaviruses and astroviruses in 2010, suggesting that these viruses had little pathogenic influence on bats. However, the general correlation of virus and bat population dynamics suggests that bats control infections similar to other mammals and that they may well experience epidemics of viruses under certain circumstances.","Amplification of Emerging Viruses in a Bat Colony","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/page/copyright-and-disclaimers","1080-6040","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","EN","Emerging Infectious Diseases","2019-04-19T00:15:55",,,

We identified 110 healthcare workers with exposure within droplet range (i.e., 3 feet) to six SARS-CoV–positive patients. Forty-five healthcare workers had exposure without any mask use, 72 had exposure without eye protection, and 40 reported direct skin-to-skin contact. Potential droplet- and aerosol-generating procedures were infrequent: 5% of healthcare workers manipulated a patient’s airway, and 4% administered aerosolized medication. Despite numerous unprotected exposures, there was no serologic evidence of healthcare-related SARS-CoV transmission. Lack of transmission in the United States may be related to the relative absence of high-risk procedures or patients, factors that may place healthcare workers at higher risk for infection.

Material and Methods: This review is based on a comprehensive search of three databases (Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane) and WHO reports. The searched keywords were new coronavirus, Middle East, acute respieratory distress syndrom & Saudi Arabia. Results: Due to novelty of virus only limited papers exist on searched databases, so only 50 papers were identified which after omitting repeated case reports, papers related to SARS and updated WHO reports, 30 papers were finally reviewed.

As a consequence of the relatively high mutation frequency of RNA-positive stranded viruses, CCoV has evolved and, with the biomolecular techniques developed over the last two decades, new virus strains, serotypes, and subtypes have been identified in infected dogs. Considering the widespread nature of CCoV infections among dog populations, several studies have been carried out, focusing upon the epidemiological relevance of these viruses and underlining the need for further investigation into the biology of CCoVs and into the pathogenetic role of the infections.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are also caused by coronaviruses that have jumped from animals to humans like 2019-nCoV. It should be remembered that there are only 12 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in the US and the mortality rate appears to be only about 3% which is lower than SARS or MERS (2,3). This could be offset by a greater infectiousness of 2019-nCoV resulting in more aggregate infectious, and hence, deaths.

Wastewater based epidemiology studies are a complementary approach used to measure and monitor the presence and prevalence of infectious diseases when clinical testing capacity is limited. It can also help with the detection of coronaviruses in wastewater and how they spread in the society. In the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is excreted with the feces of infected people and mixed with wastewater. Most people infected with viruses that infect enterically spread their feces and virus into their sewage systems both for the days or weeks before and after symptoms begin to appear. Through the detection of Covid-19 in wastewater, the number of asymptomatic people who do not represent any indication related to diseases but are carriers can be determined, and the total number of people infected in that society can be estimated. Therefore, an early warning system can be created, and it will be possible to take the necessary precautions before the second or third wave occurs.

The authors explore the possibility, recently aired in some studies, of extensive intergenerational contact as a possible determinant of the severity of the pandemic among the older Italian adults. We analyzed several variables to test this hypothesis, such as the percentage of infected patients aged >80 years, available nursing home beds, COVID-19 incidence rate, and the number of days from when the number of positive tests exceeded 50 (epidemic maturity). We also included in the analysis mean household size and percentage of households comprising one person, in the region. Paradoxically, the results are opposite of what was previously reported.

A transcritical bifurcation is shown to exist among them, preventing bistability. The disease basic reproduction number is calculated. Simulations show that contact restrictive measures are able to delay the epidemic’s outbreak, if taken at a very early stage. However, if lifted too early, they could become ineffective.

Second, the infrastructure needs to be augmented to meet the potential epidemic surge of cases. Third, economic welfare and household income need to be guaranteed. All of these have complicated the routine ways in which the governments have dealt with various trade-offs to determine the health and public policies. In this paper, we outline key economic principles for the government to consider for policymaking, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

The causative agent, 2019 novel CoV (2019-nCoV), has spread rapidly to more than 25 countries worldwide. Human-to-human transmission has accounted for most of the infections outside Wuhan. Most studies to date on COVID-19 have focused on disease etiology and the genomics of 2019-nCoV, with few reports on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of infected patients.Methods: We report early clinical features of 26 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to Liaocheng Infectious Disease Hospital in Shandong Province.Results: The median age of the 26 patients with COVID-19 in this study was 42 years. The most common occupation was retail staff (16 patients, 61.54%), with 11 patients or their family members working at the same supermarket. Only 2 patients had visited Wuhan since December 2019; the other cases of 2019-nCoV infection arose from patient-to-patient transmission. Twelve patients had more than one sign or symptom; however, seven patients had no sign or symptom. The average time from symptom onset to admission was 4.5 days. CT revealed signs of bronchitis in 2 patients and unilateral and bilateral pneumonia in 9 and 15 patients, respectively. The patients received the following treatments: antiviral therapy (100%), Chinese medicine (76.92%), antibiotics (50%), gastric mucosal protection (19.23%), immunotherapy (7.69%), and glucocorticoids (3.85%). Most patients (25/26) required &ge; 1 treatment.Discussion: In contrast to previous reports, most patients (24/26) had not been in close contact with individuals from Wuhan. Additionally, 11 patients or their family members worked at the same supermarket, suggesting active viral transmission in a location frequented by a large number of people. Close monitoring is essential for preventing the large-scale spread of the virus in such places.Keywords: coronavirus disease 2019, human-to-human transmission, epidemiologic characteristics, clinical characteristics","Epidemiologic and Clinical Characteristics of 26 Cases of COVID-19 Arising from Patient-to-Patient Transmission in Liaocheng, China","GB",1,"CC BY-NC","CC BY-NC","http://www.dovepress.com/why_publish_with_dove.php?content_id=3045","1179-1349","Dove Medical Press","EN","Clinical Epidemiology","2020-04-15T02:35:22",,,

Medical staff of dialysis facilities without sufficient biosecurity protection are susceptible once exposed to asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. This study evaluated the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in all MHD patients and medical staff of dialysis facilities in Wuhan, China. Methods: We collected COVID-19 morbidity and mortality data from MHD patients and medical staff from 52 hemodialysis centers in Wuhan. Then, we analyzed the symptoms and signs of patients and staff in our hospital (Tongji Hospital in Wuhan), and chest CT, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection and laboratory tests were performed. After aggressive quarantine of the COVID-19 patients, we followed up on the prognosis of them. Results: We analyzed the hemodialysis data from Wuhan and found that 10% of MHD patients and 6.0% of medical staff were suspected of COVID-19. Further detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid showed that 1.7% of MHD patients and 2.9% of medical staff were confirmed as having COVID-19. In our facility, 18.9% (46/244) of patients and 9.5% (6/63) of medical staff were suspected of COVID-19. Among them, 2.9% (7/244) of MHD patients and 4.8% (3/63) of medical staff tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were confirmed as having COVID-19. Interestingly, 87.0% of MHD patients suspected of COVID-19 did not have obvious symptoms, but the CT screening showed features of viral pneumonia. There were no significant differences in symptoms, CT findings, comorbidity and laboratory findings of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic-acid-positive and -negative patients. We followed up these patients and found that 57 patients with COVID-19 died (COVID-19 mortality 8.9%). Two patients from our dialysis center with COVID-19 (mortality 4.3%) died. No new infections occurred in our dialysis center after aggressive quarantine was initiated. Conclusions: The SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in MHD patients and medical staff in dialysis facilities were both high in Wuhan. Frequent chest CT and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection were needed to screen COVID-19 patients in dialysis facilities. Through the lessons of this experience on the aggressive diagnosis and quarantine measures of COVID-19 patients, we hope medical staff avoid more infections in serious epidemic areas.","Aggressive Quarantine Measures Reduce the High Morbidity of COVID-19 in Patients on Maintenance Hemodialysis and Medical Staff of Hemodialysis Facilities in Wuhan, China","CH",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","https://www.karger.com/Journal/Guidelines/261893#sec72","2296-9381","Karger Publishers","EN","Kidney Diseases","2020-05-27T09:57:33",,,

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all cases of MERS-CoV reported in four cities of the Makkah Region from March to June 2014. Exposure factors and comorbid conditions were analyzed using Epi Info. RESULTS: Analysis of the 261 cases revealed that the incidence peaked in mid-April 2014 and the fatality rate was 42%. Cough, fever, radiological evidence of pneumonia, and shortness of breath were identified as significant risk factors for a diagnosis of MER-CoV infection. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at a higher risk of acquiring MERS-CoV than non-HCWs. Males in Jeddah are at higher risk due to greater outdoor exposure while females in Taif are at higher risk due to domestic caregiving. Filipino nurses are at highest risk among all HCWs. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate the need to screen all contacts of HCWs to improve MERS control and form public–private partnerships to investigate the true burden of MERS.","Descriptive epidemiology and characteristics of confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in the Makkah Region of Saudi Arabia, March to June 2014","SA",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","http://www.annsaudimed.net/index.php/about_journal.html","0256-4947","King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre","EN","Annals of Saudi Medicine","2019-08-06T07:17:03","From the Directorate General of Health Affairs, Public Health, Makkah, Saudi Arabia",,

MERS-CoV possesses a unique positive-sense single-stranded RNA and can undergo rapid mutation in the viral genome. This results in antigenic switching and genetic variation, finally leading to the emergence of novel and new MERS-CoV subtypes which are uncontrollable by vaccines. Researchers are also finding difficulties to sort out therapeutic intervention strategies for MERS-CoV. This virus can spread from human to human, but transmission from dromedary camels to humans plays a crucial epidemiological significance. Dromedary camel acts as “gene mixing vessels” for MERS-CoV and these virus particles undergo rapid change in them. Viral receptors called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 are important receptors for attachment and spread of MERS-CoV in humans. The current method of laboratory confirmation is through real-time polymerase chain reaction on bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum and tracheal aspirates.

Children appear to develop moderate-mild or silent forms of the disease; to our knowledge, only two cases of death (a 14-year-old and a 16-year-old teenagers) have been reported. Arguably, the number of pediatric cases may be underestimated, since presumably cases with mild or no symptoms are not brought to the doctor’s attention.

COVID-19 is an acute infectious disease, primarily affecting the respiratory system. Currently, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed on respiratory specimens is considered the reference by which to diagnose COVID-19. However, the limitations of RT-PCR, specifically, the fact that it is time-consuming and inadequate for the assessment of disease severity, have affected the process of epidemiological disease containment and has taken a toll on the healthcare management chain. As the risk of infection for other patients and personnel must be kept to a minimum, the indications for imaging have to be carefully considered. Imaging is primarily performed in patients with a negative RT-PCR, but a high clinical suspicion of COVID-19, or, in patients with diagnosed COVID-19 who are suffering from moderate to severe symptoms. In this article, we review the typical imaging findings in COVID-19, the differential diagnoses, and common complications.","Imaging in corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19)—A Scoping review","NL",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","http://www.elsevier.com/journals/european-journal-of-radiology-open/2352-0477/open-access-journal","2352-0477","Elsevier","EN","European Journal of Radiology Open","2020-05-15T05:24:40","Dep. of Radiology, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre -Delhi, India",,

Highly pathogenic H7N9 cases with severe disease were reported recently, indicating the continuing public health threat and the need for a prophylactic vaccine. Here we review the development of recombinant influenza virus-like particles (VLPs) as vaccines against H7N9 virus. Several approaches to vaccine development are reviewed including the expression of VLPs in mammalian, plant and insect cell expression systems. Although considerable progress has been achieved, including demonstration of safety and immunogenicity of H7N9 VLPs in the human clinical trials, the remaining challenges need to be addressed. These challenges include improvements to the manufacturing processes, as well as enhancements to immunogenicity in order to elicit protective immunity to multiple variants and subtypes of influenza virus.","Influenza Virus Like Particles (VLPs): Opportunities for H7N9 Vaccine Development","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses/about","1999-4915","MDPI AG","EN","Viruses","2020-05-09T00:01:21","Medigen, Inc., 8420 Gas House Pike, Suite S, Frederick, MD 21701, USA",1,

With the spread of the new coronavirus accelerating, person-to-person transmission in family homes or hospitals, and intercity spread of 2019-nCoV occurred. At least 40,261 cases confirmed, 23,589 cases suspected, 909 cases death and 3444 cases cured in China and worldwide 24 countries confirmed 383 cases being diagnosed, 1 case death in February 10th, 2020. At present, the mortality of 2019-nCoV in China is 2.3%, compared with 9.6% of SARS and 34.4% of MERS reported by WHO. It seems the new virus is not as fatal as many people thought. Chinese authorities improved surveillance network, made the laboratory be able to recognize the outbreak within a few weeks and announced the virus genome that provide efficient epidemiological control. More comprehensive information is required to understand 2019-nCoV feature, the epidemiology of origin and spreading, and the clinical phenomina.

From 28 January to 7 February 2020, we estimated that 226 exported cases (95% confidence interval: 86,449) were prevented, corresponding to a 70.4% reduction in incidence compared to the counterfactual scenario. The reduced probability of a major epidemic ranged from 7% to 20% in Japan, which resulted in a median time delay to a major epidemic of two days. Depending on the scenario, the estimated delay may be less than one day.

Therefore, it is challenging to efficiently schedule the vehicles to transfer the individuals to isolated regions to control the spread of the epidemic. In this paper, we formulate such a quarantine vehicle scheduling problem for high-risk individual transfer, which is more difficult than most well-known vehicle routing problems. To efficiently solve this problem, we propose a hybrid algorithm based on the water wave optimization (WWO) metaheuristic and neighborhood search. The metaheuristic uses a small population to rapidly explore the solution space, and the neighborhood search uses a gradual strategy to improve the solution accuracy. Computational results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms several existing algorithms and obtains high-quality solutions on real-world problem instances for high-risk individual transfer in Hangzhou, China, during the peak period of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19).","Quarantine Vehicle Scheduling for Transferring High-Risk Individuals in Epidemic Areas","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph/about","1660-4601","MDPI AG","EN","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","2020-04-14T10:05:03","College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310023, China",1,

PED causes lethal watery diarrhea in piglets, which has led to substantial economic losses in many countries and is a great threat to the global swine industry. Interferons (IFNs) are major cytokines involved in host innate immune defense, which induce the expression of a broad range of antiviral effectors that help host to control and antagonize viral infections. PEDV infection does not elicit a robust IFN response, and some of the mechanisms used by the virus to counteract the host innate immune response have been unraveled. PEDV evades the host innate immune response by two main strategies including: (1) encoding IFN antagonists to disrupt innate immune pathway, and (2) hiding its viral RNA to avoid the exposure of viral RNA to immune sensors. This review highlights the immune evasion mechanisms employed by PEDV, which provides insights for the better understanding of PEDV-host interactions and developing effective vaccines and antivirals against CoVs.","Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus and the Host Innate Immune Response","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/pathogens/about","2076-0817","MDPI AG","EN","Pathogens","2020-05-12T00:01:17","State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Etiological Biology, National Foot and Mouth Diseases Reference Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Animal Virology of Ministry of Agriculture, Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Lanzhou 730046, China",1,

The objectives of the current study were to detect genetically distinct genotypes and eventually recombinant genotypes in samples collected in Lower Normandy between 2001 and 2013. To this end, we sequenced complete nsp12, S, and N genes of 15 molecular isolates of HCoV-OC43 from clinical samples and compared them to available data from the USA, Belgium, and Hong-Kong.  A new cluster E was invariably detected from nsp12, S, and N data while the analysis of nsp12 and N genes revealed the existence of new F and G clusters respectively.  The association of these different clusters of genes in our specimens led to the description of thirteen genetically distinct genotypes, among which eight recombinant viruses were discovered. Identification of these recombinant viruses, together with temporal analysis and tMRCA estimation, provides important information for understanding the dynamics of the evolution of these epidemic coronaviruses.","Genomic Analysis of 15 Human Coronaviruses OC43  (HCoV-OC43s) Circulating in France from 2001 to 2013  Reveals a High Intra-Specific Diversity with New  Recombinant Genotypes","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses/about","1999-4915","MDPI AG","EN","Viruses","2015-05-07T16:00:15","Normandie Université, 14032 Caen, France",1,

Virus transmission occurs within health care settings, but cases also appear sporadically in the community. Camels are believed to be the source for community-acquired cases, but most patients do not have camel exposure. Here, we assessed whether camel workers (CWs) with high rates of exposure to camel nasal and oral secretions had evidence of MERS-CoV infection. The results indicate that a high percentage of CWs were positive for virus-specific immune responses but had no history of significant respiratory disease. Thus, a possible explanation for repeated MERS outbreaks is that CWs develop mild or subclinical disease. These CWs then transmit the virus to uninfected individuals, some of whom are highly susceptible, develop severe disease, and are detected as primary MERS cases in the community.Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), a highly lethal respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is an emerging disease with high potential for epidemic spread. It has been listed by the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) as an important target for vaccine development. While initially the majority of MERS cases were hospital acquired, continued emergence of MERS is attributed to community acquisition, with camels likely being the direct or indirect source. However, the majority of patients do not describe camel exposure, making the route of transmission unclear. Here, using sensitive immunological assays and a cohort of camel workers (CWs) with well-documented camel exposure, we show that approximately 50% of camel workers (CWs) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and 0% of controls were previously infected. We obtained blood samples from 30 camel herders, truck drivers, and handlers with well-documented camel exposure and from healthy donors, and measured MERS-CoV-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and neutralizing antibody titers, as well as T cell responses. Totals of 16/30 CWs and 0/30 healthy control donors were seropositive by MERS-CoV-specific ELISA and/or neutralizing antibody titer, and an additional four CWs were seronegative but contained virus-specific T cells in their blood. Although virus transmission from CWs has not been formally demonstrated, a possible explanation for repeated MERS outbreaks is that CWs develop mild disease and then transmit the virus to uninfected individuals. Infection of some of these individuals, such as those with comorbidities, results in severe disease and in the episodic appearance of patients with MERS.","High Prevalence of MERS-CoV Infection in Camel Workers in Saudi Arabia","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://mbio.asm.org/site/misc/authors.xhtml","2150-7511","American Society for Microbiology","EN","mBio","2019-01-08T19:38:54",,1,

Rapidly, it became an epidemic in China and has now spread throughout the world reaching pandemic proportions. High mortality rates characterize SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19), which mainly affects the elderly, causing unrestrained cytokines-storm and subsequent pulmonary shutdown, also suspected micro thromboembolism events. At the present time, no specific and dedicated treatments, nor approved vaccines, are available, though very promising data come from the use of anti-inflammatory, anti-malaria, and anti-coagulant drugs. In addition, it seems that males are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than females, with males 65% more likely to die from the infection than females. Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Chinese scientists show that of all cases about 1.7% of women who contract the virus will die compared with 2.8% of men, and data from Hong Kong hospitals state that 32% of male and 15% of female COVID-19 patients required intensive care or died. On the other hand, the long-term fallout of coronavirus may be worse for women than for men due to social and psychosocial reasons. Regardless of sex- or gender-biased data obtained from WHO and those gathered from sometimes controversial scientific journals, some central points should be considered. Firstly, SARS-CoV-2 has a strong interaction with the human ACE2 receptor, which plays an essential role in cell entry together with transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2); it is interesting to note that the <i>ACE2</i> gene lays on the X-chromosome, thus allowing females to be potentially heterozygous and differently assorted compared to men who are definitely hemizygous. Secondly, the higher <i>ACE2</i> expression rate in females, though controversial, might ascribe them the worst prognosis, in contrast with worldwide epidemiological data. Finally, several genes involved in inflammation are located on the X-chromosome, which also contains high number of immune-related genes responsible for innate and adaptive immune responses to infection. Other genes, out from the RAS-pathway, might directly or indirectly impact on the ACE1/ACE2 balance by influencing its main actors (e.g., <i>ABO</i> locus, <i>SRY</i>, <i>SOX3, ADAM17</i>). Unexpectedly, the higher levels of ACE2 or ACE1/ACE2 rebalancing might improve the outcome of COVID-19 in both sexes by reducing inflammation, thrombosis, and death. Moreover, X-heterozygous females might also activate a mosaic advantage and show more pronounced sex-related differences resulting in a sex dimorphism, further favoring them in counteracting the progression of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","COVID-19 and Individual Genetic Susceptibility/Receptivity: Role of ACE1/ACE2 Genes, Immunity, Inflammation and Coagulation.

To develop more specific and effective control strategies, we conducted a detailed mechanism-based investigation that explored the role of fomite transmission in the well-known Ward 8A outbreak. We considered three hypothetical transmission routes, i.e., the long-range airborne, fomite and combined routes, in 1,744 scenarios with combinations of some important parameters. A multi-agent model was used to predict the infection risk distributions of the three hypothetical routes. Model selection was carried out for different scenarios to compare the distributions of infection risk with that of the reported attack rates and select the hypotheses with the best fitness. Our results reveal that under the assumed conditions, the SARS coronavirus was most possible to have spread via the combined long-range airborne and fomite routes, and that the fomite route played a non-negligible role in the transmission.","Role of fomites in SARS transmission during the largest hospital outbreak in Hong Kong.","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license","1932-6203","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","EN","PLoS ONE","2017-11-12T02:15:54",,1,

Here we describe the current epidemiological picture of MERS-CoV, focusing on humans and animals affected by this virus and propose specific intervention strategies that would be appropriate to control MERS-CoV. One-third of MERS-CoV patients develop severe lower respiratory tract infection and succumb to a fatal outcome; these patients would require effective therapeutic antiviral therapy. Because of the lack of such intervention strategies, supportive care is the best that can be offered at the moment. Limiting viral spread from symptomatic human cases to health care workers and family members, on the other hand, could be achieved through prophylactic administration of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies and vaccines. To ultimately prevent spread of the virus into the human population, however, vaccination of dromedary camels – currently the only confirmed animal host for MERS-CoV – may be the best option to achieve a sustained drop in human MERS cases in time.

Methods: We reviewed the outbreak investigation reports and medical records of 1 index case and 25 additional MERS cases in hospitals A (14 cases) and B (11 cases), and conducted an in-depth interview with the index case.
Results: The CFR in hospital B was higher than that in hospital A (63.6% vs. 28.6%, respectively). Higher MERS-CoV exposure conditions were also found in hospital B, including aggravated pneumonia in the index case and nebulizer use in a six-bed admission room. The host factors associated with high CFR were pre-existing pneumonia, smoking history, an incubation period of less than 5 days, leukocytosis, abnormal renal function at diagnosis, and respiratory symptoms such as sputum and dyspnea.
Conclusions: The conditions surrounding MERS-CoV exposure and the underlying poor pulmonary function due to a smoking history or pre-existing pneumonia may explain the high CFR in hospital B.

Prevalence of TGEV ranged between 3.8–6.8% and peaked during cold months until March 2013, in which prevalence decreased to?<?0.1%. Nineteen complete TGEV genomes and a single strain of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) from the US were generated and compared to historical strains to investigate the evolution of these endemic coronaviruses. Sixteen of our TGEV strains share 8 unique deletions and 119 distinct amino acid changes, which might greatly affect the biological characteristics of the variant TGEV, and resulted in a “variant” genotype of TGEV. The “variant” genotype shared similar unique deletions and amino acid changes with the recent PRCV strain identified in this study, suggesting a recombination event occurred between the ‘‘variant’’ TGEV and PRCV. Moreover, the results indicate the “variant” genotype is the dominant genotype circulating in the US. Therefore, this study provides insight into the occurrence, origin, genetic characteristics, and evolution of TGEV and PRCV circulating in the US.","Decline of transmissible gastroenteritis virus and its complex evolutionary relationship with porcine respiratory coronavirus in the United States","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","https://www.nature.com/srep/about/open-access","2045-2322","Nature Publishing Group","EN","Scientific Reports","2019-03-10T12:57:25","Department of Veterinary Population Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota",1,

The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the S1 domain is bound to pAPN. The prototype strain demonstrated similar receptor-binding activity compared with the variant field isolate. Three loops at the tips of the ?-barrel domains did not play crucial roles in the PEDV S-pAPN association, indicating that PEDV conforms to a different receptor recognition model compared with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory CoV (PRCV), and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63). The N-terminal domain (NTD) of the PEDV S1 domain could bind sugar, a possible co-receptor for PEDV. The prototype strain exhibited weaker sugar-binding activity compared with the variant field isolate. Strategies targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) may be helpful for developing vaccines or antiviral drugs for PEDV. Understanding the differences in receptor binding between the prototype and the variant strains may provide insight into PEDV pathogenesis.","Identification and Comparison of Receptor Binding Characteristics of the Spike Protein of Two Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Strains","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses/about","1999-4915","MDPI AG","EN","Viruses","2016-02-25T10:11:43","State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China",1,

The ability to evade, circumvent or subvert the host’s first line of defense, namely the innate immune system, is the key determinant for pathogen virulence, survival, and the establishment of successful infection. Unfortunately, we have only started to unravel the underlying viral mechanisms used to manipulate host innate immune responses. In this review, we gather current knowledge concerning the interplay between these viruses and components of host innate immunity, focusing on type I interferon induction and signaling in particular, and the mechanisms by which virus-encoded gene products antagonize and subvert host innate immune responses. Finally, we provide some perspectives on the advantages gained from a better understanding of host-pathogen interactions. This includes their implications for the future development of PEDV and PDCoV vaccines and how we can further our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying virus pathogenesis, virulence, and host coevolution.","PEDV and PDCoV Pathogenesis: The Interplay Between Host Innate Immune Responses and Porcine Enteric Coronaviruses","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/veterinary-science#about","2297-1769","Frontiers Media S.A.","EN","Frontiers in Veterinary Science","2019-02-22T04:26:56",,1,

Since its identification in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People’s Republic of China, the number of cases imported into other countries is increasing, and the epidemiological map is changing rapidly. On the other hand, body temperature screening (fever) is the major test performed at points of entry, i.e., airports, in the returning travelers in most of the countries with limited resources. However, the recent report on asymptomatic contact transmission of COVID-19 and travelers who passed the symptoms-based screening and tested positive for COVID-19 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) challenges this approach as body temperature screening may miss travelers incubating the disease or travelers concealing fever during travel. On this note, travel restrictions to and from high risk areas and/or 14 days quarantine of travelers coming from high risk areas are recommended to prevent possible importation of COVID-19. Currently, RT-PCR is a reliable test in detecting both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19.","Coronavirus disease-2019: is fever an adequate screening for the returning travelers?","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/copyright-and-license","1348-8945","BMC","EN","Tropical Medicine and Health","2020-03-15T12:29:12","School of Pharmacy, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences",1,

Recent epidemiological reports on Chinese population affected by novel coronavirus showed a wide spread of clinical and biochemical alterations, suggesting a relationship between progression of lung damage to acute respiratory distress syndrome and the systemic inflammatory response, triggering an irreversible multiple organ damage and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Bedside ultrasound assessment provides integrated information, describing a multisystemic and dynamic clinical scenario for every patient. Furthermore, this approach allows to concentrate multiple information in the hands of a single operator, also limiting the risk of exposure to infection for healthcare professionals. As per our experience, herewith reported, we described the characteristics of 10 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ultrasound findings were related to clinical information, blood test analysis, and results of instrumental tests, such as chest X-ray and chest CT. According to our ultrasound data, COVID-19 appears to be a systemic pathology even in those cases of mild to moderate disease. By this multisystem ultrasound approach, we could immediately recognize patients with a diffuse organ involvement and a more severe clinical pattern; moreover, we can protect healthcare workers and limit infection within health facilities.

Despite this, a safe and effective PEDV vaccine against highly virulent strains is unavailable, making PEDV prevention and control challenging. Lactogenic immunity induced via the gut-mammary gland-secretory IgA (sIgA) axis, remains the most promising and effective way to protect suckling piglets from PEDV. Therefore, a successful PEDV vaccine must induce protective maternal IgA antibodies that passively transfer into colostrum and milk. Identifying variables that influence lymphocyte migration and IgA secretion during gestation and lactation is imperative for designing maternal immunization strategies that generate the highest amount of lactogenic immune protection against PEDV in suckling piglets. Because pregnancy-associated immune alterations influence viral pathogenesis and adaptive immune responses in many different species, a better understanding of host immune responses to PEDV in pregnant swine may translate into improved maternal immunization strategies against enteric pathogens for multiple species. In this review, we discuss the role of host factors during pregnancy on antiviral immunity and their implications for generating protective lactogenic immunity in suckling neonates.","Host Factors Affecting Generation of Immunity Against Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus in Pregnant and Lactating Swine and Passive Protection of Neonates","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/pathogens/about","2076-0817","MDPI AG","EN","Pathogens","2020-03-02T13:40:13","Duke Human Vaccine Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA",1,

As October 2014, a totally 855 confirmed cases with 333 related deaths were reported to WHO. All cases occurred in or epidemiologically linked to affected countries. The virus ability to induce a pandemic attack is limited. The clinical presentations vary and range from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory disease and death. However, most severe disease occurs in elderly and in those with underlying conditions. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV infection is health care facilities and in the community. The WHO encourages all member states to perform surveillance of patients with acute severe respiratory infection and to carefully monitor any unusual patterns.

The purpose of our study was to survey the prevalence of the SARS coronavirus (CoV) in a community adjacent to Kaohsiung CGMH and collect demographic data, including basic information about health status, household, and possible risk factors for SARS-CoV infection.
Methods: We randomly recruited 1030 persons living in three precincts adjacent to Kaohsiung CGMH. For all subjects, we collected demographic data and measured the seroprevalence of the SARS-CoV with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an immunofluorescence assay (IFA).
Results: The ELISA was seropositive for 124 of 1030 participants (12%). The more sensitive and specific IFA confirmed SARS in only two cases (0.19%). Both confirmed cases were under 19 years of age and had no known SARS-related risk factors.
Conclusion: There was low post-epidemic seroprevalence of SARS-CoV in a community adjacent to a hospital which had a nosocomial SARS outbreak.

Students from different majors cluster together, but gateway courses and distributional requirements create cross-major integration. Connectivity declines when large courses of 100 students or more are removed from the network, as might be the case if some courses are taught online, but moderately sized courses must also be removed before less than half of student-pairs are connected in three steps and less than two-thirds in four steps.

Methods: MERS-CoV data were obtained from the Saudi Ministry of Health for the period 2012 to July 2015. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the results regarding the risk factors and mortality of MERS-CoV infection.
Results: In this series, the risk factors and outcomes of 939 cases of MERS-CoV occurring in the last 3 years are described. The majority of the affected patients were aged ?40 years (n = 657; 70%). Of the 657 patients aged ?40 years, 377 (57.3%) died.
Conclusions: The case-fatality ratio was found to increase significantly with age. It ranged from 12.5% in those aged ?19 years to 86.2% in those aged ?80 years. The results confirmed the association between severe MERS-CoV illness and patients with a pre-existing health morbidity. The duration from symptom onset to admission was not statistically associated with the disease outcome.","The epidemiology of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 2012–2015","NL",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","http://www.elsevier.com/journals/international-journal-of-infectious-diseases/1201-9712/open-access-journal","1201-9712","Elsevier","EN","International Journal of Infectious Diseases","2016-04-28T06:05:22","Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Alfred Centre, 99 Commercial Rd, Melbourne, VIC 3004, Australia",,

Recently, a large-scale novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) outbreak swept China. As of Feb. 9, 2020, a total of 40,260 patients have been diagnosed with NCP, and 23,589 patients were suspected to have infected by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which puts forward a great challenge for public health and clinical treatment in China. Until now, we are in the high-incidence season of NCP. Thus, the analysis of the transmissibility change of NCP and its potential factors may provide a reliable reference for establishing effective prevention and control strategies. Method. By means of the method of calculating the instantaneous basic reproduction number R0t proposed by Cori et al. (2013), we use R0t to describe the transmissibility change of COVID-19 in China, 2019-2020. In addition, the Baidu Index (BDI) and Baidu Migration Scale (BMS) were selected to measure the public awareness and the effect of Wuhan lockdown (restricted persons in Wuhan outflow from the epidemic area) strategy, respectively. The Granger causality test (GCT) was carried out to explore the association between public awareness, the effect of the Wuhan lockdown strategy, and the transmissibility of COVID-19. Results. The estimated averaged basic reproduction number of NCP in China was 3.44 with 95% CI (2.87, 4.0) during Dec. 8, 2019, to Feb. 9, 2020. The instantaneous basic reproduction numbers (R0t) have two waves and reaching peaks on Jan. 8 and Jan. 27, respectively. After reaching a peak on Jan. 27, R0t showed a continuous decline trend. On Feb. 9, R0t has fallen to 1.68 (95% CI: 1.66, 1.7), but it is still larger than 1. We find a significantly negative association between public awareness and the transmissibility change of COVID-19, with one unit increase in cumulative BDI leading to a decrease of 0.0295% (95% CI: 0.0077, 0.051) R0t. We also find a significantly negative association between the effect of the Wuhan lockdown strategy and the transmissibility change of COVID-19, and a one unit decrease in BMS may lead to a drop of 2.7% (95% CI: 0.382, 4.97) R0t. Conclusion. The current prevention and control measures have effectively reduced the transmissibility of COVID-19; however, R0t is still larger than the threshold 1. The results show that the government adopting the Wuhan lockdown strategy plays an important role in restricting the potential infected persons in Wuhan outflow from the epidemic area and avoiding a nationwide spread by quickly controlling the potential infection in Wuhan. Meanwhile, since Jan. 18, 2020, the people successively accessed COVID-19-related information via the Internet, which may help to effectively implement the government’s prevention and control strategy and contribute to reducing the transmissibility of NCP. Therefore, ongoing travel restriction and public health awareness remain essential to provide a foundation for controlling the outbreak of COVID-19.","Analysis of the Transmissibility Change of 2019-Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia and Its Potential Factors in China from 2019 to 2020","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/guidelines/","2314-6133","Hindawi Limited","EN","BioMed Research International","2020-06-01T15:15:25","School of Public Health and Management, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan Ningxia, 750004, China",1,

The modeling of the epidemics was based on the extended SEIR model proposed lately in the group of Prof. R. Neher and realized as a freely available software program. The authors based the choice of the parameters of modeling on published data on the epidemiological properties of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and open access data on the registered cases of COVID-19 in Moscow for 8-27 March 2020.Results. Five potential scenarios of the development of COVID-19 epidemics are studied. The scenarios are differed by the levels of the control measures: Null Scenario corresponded to the lack of protective measures, Scenario A – mild measures of the epidemic control (closing of schools and universities, recommendations for senior citizens to stay inside), Scenario B – medium level of control (closing of all public places, recommendation for the citizens to stay inside), Scenarios C and D – complete lockdown (from the beginning of May 2020 within Scenario C and from the beginning of April 2020 within Scenario D). It was shown that within the Null Scenario, the lethality from the novel coronavirus in Moscow will exceed 100 thousand people, and the number of critically ill patients on the peak of the epidemics will exceed the capacities of the system of healthcare. Scenarios A and B did not provide for a radical decrease in the fatality rate, and the number of critically ill patients at the peak of epidemics will still exceed the capacities of the system of healthcare. Besides, within Scenario B, the epidemics will last for more than a year. Scenarios C and D will allow for the control of epidemics and a significant decrease in the rate of letha lity (by 30 and 400 times, respectively). At the same time, these two scenarios prevent the population from developing herd immunity, which would result in the population susceptibility to repeated epidemics outbreaks. Conclusion. The scenarios intended for the slow development of herd immunity in the conditions of epidemic control would not bring sufficient results: the lethality would remain unacceptably high, the capacities of the system of healthcare would be overloaded, and the time of limiting measures would be unacceptably long. Such measures as complete lockdown would stop the present epidemics. The earlier they are introduced, the more efficient will be the results. To prevent further repeated outbreaks of the epidemics, it is necessary to establish a system of available, quick, and efficient testing in combination with point isolation of the infected patients and their contacts.","COVID-19 in Moscow: prognoses and scenarios","RU",1,"CC BY-NC-SA","CC BY-NC-SA","https://www.pharmacoeconomics.ru/jour/about/submissions#copyrightNotice","2070-4909","IRBIS LLC","RU","????????????????","2020-05-18T16:26:16","Moscow State University ; HSE Tikhonov Moscow Institute of Electronics and Mathematics (MIEM NRU HSE)",,

RVD has been reported from several countries worldwide, and to date, only one complete genome sequence for RVD is available. Neither an immunodiagnostic nor a vaccine is available for the detection and prevention of RVD infection. Despite our growing understanding about this particular group, questions remain regarding its exact prevalence and pathogenecity, and the disease-associated annual losses for the poultry industry.

A serologic study was conducted to determine the asymptomatic MERS infection rate in healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers by exposure status. METHODS Study participants were selected from contacts of MERS patients based on a priority system in 4 regions strongly affected by the 2015 MERS outbreak. A sero-epidemiological survey was performed in 1,610 contacts (average duration from exposure to test, 4.8 months), and the collected sera were tested using an enzyme-linked immunespecific assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and plaque reduction neutralization antibody test (PRNT). Among the 1,610 contacts, there were 7 ELISA-positive cases, of which 1 exhibited positive IFA and PRNT results. RESULTS The asymptomatic infection rate was 0.060% (95% confidence interval, 0.002 to 0.346). The asymptomatic MERS case was a patient who had been hospitalized with patient zero on the same floor of the hospital at the same time. The case was quarantined at home for 2 weeks after discharge, and had underlying diseases, including hypertension, angina, and degenerative arthritis. CONCLUSIONS The asymptomatic infection was acquired via healthcare-associated transmission. Thus, it is necessary to extend serologic studies to include inpatient contacts who have no symptoms.","Asymptomatic Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus infection using a serologic survey in Korea","KR",1,"CC BY","CC BY","https://www.e-epih.org/authors/authors.php","2092-7193","Korean Society of Epidemiology  ","EN","Epidemiology and Health","2018-07-25T04:35:43","

However, many aspects of CoV behavior, including modes of its transmission, are yet to be fully understood. We show that the amount and the peculiarities of distribution of the protein intrinsic disorder in the viral shell can be used for the efficient analysis of the behavior and transmission modes of CoV. The proposed model allows categorization of the various CoVs by the peculiarities of disorder distribution in their membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). This categorization enables quick identification of viruses with similar behaviors in transmission, regardless of genetic proximity. Based on this analysis, an empirical model for predicting the viral transmission behavior is developed. This model is able to explain some behavioral aspects of important coronaviruses that previously were not fully understood. The new predictor can be a useful tool for better epidemiological, clinical, and structural understanding of behavior of both newly emerging viruses and viruses that have been known for a long time. A potentially new vaccine strategy could involve searches for viral strains that are characterized by the evolutionary misfit between the peculiarities of the disorder distribution in their shells and their behavior.","Understanding Viral Transmission Behavior via Protein Intrinsic Disorder Prediction: Coronaviruses","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jpath/guidelines/","2090-3057","Hindawi Limited","EN","Journal of Pathogens","2012-11-13T13:45:53","Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA",1,

In spite of intense study, it remains unclear whether the deletion actually reflects adaptation to humans. Here we engineered full, partially deleted (?29?nt), and fully deleted ORF8 into a SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone, strain Frankfurt-1. Replication of the resulting viruses was compared in primate cell cultures as well as Rhinolophus bat cells made permissive for SARS-CoV replication by lentiviral transduction of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Cells from cotton rat, goat, and sheep provided control scenarios that represent host systems in which SARS-CoV is neither endemic nor epidemic. Independent of the cell system, the truncation of ORF8 (29?nt deletion) decreased replication up to 23-fold. The effect was independent of the type I interferon response. The 29?nt deletion in SARS-CoV is a deleterious mutation acquired along the initial human-to-human transmission chain. The resulting loss of fitness may be due to a founder effect, which has rarely been documented in processes of viral emergence. These results have important implications for the retrospective assessment of the threat posed by SARS.","Attenuation of replication by a 29 nucleotide deletion in SARS-coronavirus acquired during the early stages of human-to-human transmission","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","https://www.nature.com/srep/about/open-access","2045-2322","Nature Publishing Group","EN","Scientific Reports","2018-10-14T12:45:13","Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Institute of Virology",1,

To determine the variability between different stocks of the PEDV strain CV777, sequencing of the full-length genome (ca. 28kb) has been performed in 6 different laboratories, using different protocols. Not surprisingly, each of the different full genome sequences were distinct from each other and from the reference sequence (Accession number AF353511) but they are >99% identical. Unique and shared differences between sequences were identified. The coding region for the surface-exposed spike protein showed the highest proportion of variability including both point mutations and small deletions. The predicted expression of the ORF3 gene product was more dramatically affected in three different variants of this virus through either loss of the initiation codon or gain of a premature termination codon. The genome of one isolate had a substantially rearranged 5´-terminal sequence. This rearrangement was validated through the analysis of sub-genomic mRNAs from infected cells.

This suggests that the country is at continuous risk. The epidemic level of MERS-CoV infection was examined in Saudi Arabia by the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model using a Bayesian approach for estimation of time dependent reproduction number (R) across a two-year interval (May, 2013-May, 2015) in five defined clusters, followed by sensitivity analysis of the most significant clusters. Significant MERS-CoV peaks were detected in the period between March and May of each year. Moreover, MERS-CoV infection was highlighted in western (40.8%) and central (31.9%) regions, followed by eastern region (20%). The temporal-based Bayesian approach indicated a sub-critical epidemic in all regions in the baseline scenario (R: 0.85–0.97). However, R potential limit was exceeded in the sensitivity analysis scenario in only central and western regions (R: 1.08–1.12) that denoted epidemic level in those regions. The impact of sporadic cases was found relatively insignificant and pinpointed to the lack of zoonotic influence on MERS-CoV transmission dynamics.

This has been driven by fears arising from the rapid emergence, spread and the public health impact of a number of recent outbreaks, such as the international spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)  (2003), the potential of avian influenza H5N1 to emerge as a highly lethal pandemic as increasing numbers of human cases are reported (2003 and continuing), and the very rapid global spread of pandemic H1N1 influenza in 2009-10. The emergence of SARS-CoV, in particular, demonstrated the considerable economic, political and psychological effects – in addition to the impact on public health – of an unexpected epidemic of a highly infectious, previously unknown agent in a highly connected and interdependent world. These examples clearly highlight the necessity and importance of global outbreak surveillance for the early detection and response to new potential threats. They also demonstrate clearly that these emergent diseases can move rapidly between countries and continents through infected travellers, so that surveillance needs to be transparent and authorities aware of international disease events elsewhere around the globe.

CoVs harboured by avian species are classified to the genera gamma- and deltacoronaviruses. Within the gamma-CoVs the main representative is avian coronavirus, a taxonomic name which includes the highly contagious infectious bronchitis viruses (IBVs) in chickens and similar viruses infecting other domestic birds such as turkeys, guinea fowls, or quails. Additionally, IBVs have been detected in healthy wild birds, demonstrating that they may act as the vector between domestic and free-living birds. Moreover, CoVs other than IBVs, are identified in wild birds, which suggests that wild birds play a key role in the epidemiology of other gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs. Development of molecular techniques has significantly improved knowledge of the prevalence of CoVs in avian species. The methods adopted in monitoring studies of CoVs in different avian species are mainly based on detection of conservative regions within the viral replicase, nucleocapsid genes, and 3’UTR or 5’UTR. The purpose of this review is to summarise recent discoveries in the areas of epidemiology and diagnosis of CoVs in avian species and to understand the role of wild birds in the virus distribution.","Coronaviruses in avian species – review with focus on epidemiology and diagnosis in wild birds","PL",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","https://www.degruyter.com/view/supplement/s24508608_Open_Access_License.pdf","2450-8608","Sciendo","EN","Journal of Veterinary Research","2018-11-03T05:42:01","Department of Poultry Diseases, National Veterinary Research Institute, 24-100Pu?awy, Poland",,

However, its pharmacokinetic profile remains largely undefined. Here, Sprague Dawley rats were administered a single dose of GRFT at 10 or 20 mg/kg by intravenous, oral, and subcutaneous routes, respectively, and serum GRFT levels were measured at select time points. In addition, the potential for systemic accumulation after oral dosing was assessed in rats after 10 daily treatments with GRFT (20 or 40 mg/kg). We found that parenterally-administered GRFT in rats displayed a complex elimination profile, which varied according to administration routes. However, GRFT was not orally bioavailable, even after chronic treatment. Nonetheless, active GRFT capable of neutralizing HIV-Env pseudoviruses was detected in rat fecal extracts after chronic oral dosing. These findings support further evaluation of GRFT for pre-exposure prophylaxis against emerging epidemics for which specific therapeutics are not available, including systemic and enteric infections caused by susceptible enveloped viruses. In addition, GRFT should be considered for antiviral therapy and the prevention of rectal transmission of HIV-1 and other susceptible viruses.","Pharmacokinetics of the Antiviral Lectin Griffithsin Administered by Different Routes Indicates Multiple Potential Uses","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses/about","1999-4915","MDPI AG","EN","Viruses","2016-12-23T21:06:41","Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY 40202, USA",1,

This virus evades the host innate immune response in part through the expression of its non-structural protein (nsp) 1, which inhibits both host gene expression and virus- and interferon (IFN)-dependent signaling. Thus, nsp1 is a promising target for drugs, as inhibition of nsp1 would make SARS-CoV more susceptible to the host antiviral defenses. To gain a better understanding of nsp1 mode of action, we generated and analyzed 38 mutants of the SARS-CoV nsp1, targeting 62 solvent exposed residues out of the 180 amino acid protein. From this work, we identified six classes of mutants that abolished, attenuated or increased nsp1 inhibition of host gene expression and/or antiviral signaling. Each class of mutants clustered on SARS-CoV nsp1 surface and suggested nsp1 interacts with distinct host factors to exert its inhibitory activities. Identification of the nsp1 residues critical for its activities and the pathways involved in these activities should help in the design of drugs targeting nsp1. Significantly, several point mutants increased the inhibitory activity of nsp1, suggesting that coronaviruses could evolve a greater ability to evade the host response through mutations of such residues.","Identification of residues of SARS-CoV nsp1 that differentially affect inhibition of gene expression and antiviral signaling.","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license","1932-6203","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","EN","PLoS ONE","2016-06-15T02:22:21",,1,

We used a publically available case line list to explore the effect of relevant factors, notably underlying comorbidities, on fatal outcome of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) cases up to the end of October 2016. A Bayesian Weibull proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the effect of comorbidity, age, epidemic period and sex on the fatality rate of MERS cases and its variation across countries. The crude fatality rate of MERS cases was 32.1% (95% credibility interval (CI): 29.9%, 34.3%). Notably, the incremental change of daily death rate was most prominent during the first week since disease onset with an average increase of 13%, but then stabilized in the remaining two weeks when it only increased 3% on average. Neither sex, nor country of infection were found to have a significant impact on fatality rates after taking into account the age and comorbidity status of patients. After adjusting for age, epidemic period, MERS patients with comorbidity had around 4 times the risk for fatal infection than those without (adjusted hazard ratio of 3.74 (95% CI: 2.57, 5.67)).","Impact of Comorbidity on Fatality Rate of Patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","https://www.nature.com/srep/about/open-access","2045-2322","Nature Publishing Group","EN","Scientific Reports","2018-09-20T14:29:04","Division of Biostatistics, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University",1,

Due to its high morbidity and mortality and widespread occurrence, SARS has evolved as an important respiratory disease which may be encountered everywhere in the world. The virus was identified as the causative agent of SARS due to the efforts of a WHO-led laboratory network. The potential mutability of the SARS-CoV genome may lead to new SARS outbreaks and several regions of the viral genomes open reading frames have been identified which may contribute to the severe virulence of the virus. With regard to the pathogenesis of SARS, several mechanisms involving both direct effects on target cells and indirect effects via the immune system may exist. Vaccination would offer the most attractive approach to prevent new epidemics of SARS, but the development of vaccines is difficult due to missing data on the role of immune system-virus interactions and the potential mutability of the virus. Even in a situation of no new infections, SARS remains a major health hazard, as new epidemics may arise.

The detection and diagnosis have been improved as well. However, the daily reported cases staying in a high level make the epidemics trend prediction difficult. Methods: Since the traditional SEIR model does not evaluate the effectiveness of control strategies, a novel model in line with the current epidemics process and control measures was proposed, utilizing multisource datasets including cumulative number of reported, death, quarantined and suspected cases. Results: Results show that the trend of the epidemics mainly depends on quarantined and suspected cases. The predicted cumulative numbers of quarantined and suspected cases nearly reached static states and their inflection points have already been achieved, with the epidemics peak coming soon. The estimated effective reproduction numbers using model-free and model-based methods are decreasing, as well as new infections, while new reported cases are increasing. Most infected cases have been quarantined or put in suspected class, which has been ignored in existing models. Conclusions: The uncertainty analyses reveal that the epidemics is still uncertain and it is important to continue enhancing the quarantine and isolation strategy and improving the detection rate in mainland China.","The effectiveness of quarantine and isolation determine the trend of the COVID-19 epidemics in the final phase of the current outbreak in China","NL",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","http://www.elsevier.com/journals/international-journal-of-infectious-diseases/1201-9712/open-access-journal","1201-9712","Elsevier","EN","International Journal of Infectious Diseases","2020-05-07T05:17:49","The Interdisplinary Research Center for Mathematics and Life Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710049, People’s Republic of China; Laboratory for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, York University, Toronto, Ontario, M3J 1P3, Canada",,

Recently, the role of APN as a receptor for PEDV has been questioned. In our study, the role of APN in PEDV and TGEV infections was studied in primary porcine enterocytes. After seven days of cultivation, 89% of enterocytes presented microvilli and showed a two- to five-fold higher susceptibility to PEDV and TGEV. A significant increase of PEDV and TGEV infection was correlated with a higher expression of APN, which was indicative that APN plays an important role in porcine coronavirus infections. However, PEDV and TGEV infected both APN positive and negative enterocytes. PEDV and TGEV Miller showed a higher infectivity in APN positive cells than in APN negative cells. In contrast, TGEV Purdue replicated better in APN negative cells. These results show that an additional receptor exists, different from APN for porcine coronaviruses. Subsequently, treatment of enterocytes with neuraminidase (NA) had no effect on infection efficiency of TGEV, implying that terminal cellular sialic acids (SAs) are no receptor determinants for TGEV. Treatment of TGEV with NA significantly enhanced the infection which shows that TGEV is masked by SAs.","Role of Porcine Aminopeptidase N and Sialic Acids in Porcine Coronavirus Infections in Primary Porcine Enterocytes","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses/about","1999-4915","MDPI AG","EN","Viruses","2020-04-14T13:01:57","Laboratory of Virology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Salisburylaan 133, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium",1,

The present report uses the informational spectrum methodology to identify the possible origin and natural host of the new virus, as well as putative therapeutic and vaccine targets. The performed in silico analysis indicates that the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and, to a lesser degree, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. Moreover, the well-known SARS-CoV receptor (ACE2) might be a putative receptor for the novel virus as well. Actin protein was also suggested as a host factor that participates in cell entry and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2; therefore, drugs modulating biological activity of this protein (e.g. ibuprofen) were suggested as potential candidates for treatment of this viral infection. Additional results indicated that civets and poultry are potential candidates for the natural reservoir of the SARS-CoV-2, and that domain 288-330 of S1 protein from the SARS-CoV-2 represents promising therapeutic and/or vaccine target.","Use of the informational spectrum methodology for rapid biological analysis of the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV: prediction of potential receptor, natural reservoir, tropism and therapeutic/vaccine target [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://f1000research.com/about","2046-1402","F1000 Research Ltd","EN","F1000Research","2020-05-11T08:35:32","Biomed Protection, Galveston, TX, 77550, USA",,

The simulated peak value of the confirmed cases is 1002 at Feb 10, 2020 which is mostly close to the reported number of 1007 at Feb 9, 2020. The disease will become extinction with peak value of 1397 at May 11, 2020. Moreover, the increased numbers of the input population can mainly shorten the disease extinction days and the increased percentages of the exposed individuals of the input population increase the number of cumulative confirmed cases at a small percentage. Increasing the input population and decreasing the quarantine strategy together around the time point of the peak value of the confirmed cases, may lead to the second outbreak.

Lymphoma patients need to be distinguished from the general population because of their deficient immune status and intensive anti-tumor treatment. The impacts of cancer subtypes and treatment on COVID-19 infection are unclear.Case Presentation: We here report the case of a primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma patient who was infected with COVID-19 after intensive immunochemotherapy (DA-EPOCH-R). The patient developed a neutropenic fever during chemotherapy, and fever was persistent, although antibiotics were used. Initial chest CT was negative, and the patient received a throat swab test since the second CT showed evidence of pneumonia. With treatment with Arbidol Hydrochloride and LianHuaQingWen capsule, his COVID-19 was cured.Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report focusing on COVID-19 infection in a lymphoma patient undergoing intensive immunochemotherapy. For those patients being treated with immunochemotherapy in epidemic areas, a reduced dose intensity of intensive chemotherapy should be considered, and the effect of immunotherapies such as rituximab on COVID-19 infection should be considered.

Most cases were due to transmission in healthcare settings, sometimes causing large outbreaks. We analyzed epidemiologic and clinical data of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases from eleven healthcare-associated outbreaks in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Republic of Korea between 2015–2017. We quantified key epidemiological differences between outbreaks. Twenty-five percent (n?=?105/422) of MERS cases who acquired infection in a hospital setting were healthcare personnel. In multivariate analyses, age ?65 (OR 4.8, 95%CI: 2.6–8.7) and the presence of underlying comorbidities (OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.3–5.7) were associated with increased mortality whereas working as healthcare personnel was protective (OR 0.07, 95% CI: 0.01–0.34). At the start of these outbreaks, the reproduction number ranged from 1.0 to 5.7; it dropped below 1 within 2 to 6 weeks. This study provides a comprehensive characterization of MERS HCA-outbreaks. Our results highlight heterogeneities in the epidemiological profile of healthcare-associated outbreaks. The limitations of our study stress the urgent need for standardized data collection for high-threat respiratory pathogens, such as MERS-CoV.","Comparative Analysis of Eleven Healthcare-Associated Outbreaks of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (Mers-Cov) from 2015 to 2017","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","https://www.nature.com/srep/about/open-access","2045-2322","Nature Publishing Group","EN","Scientific Reports","2020-05-17T12:34:44","Formerly Outbreak Investigation Task Force, Centre for Global Health, Institut Pasteur",1,

Therefore, an effective assessment strategy is vital to maximize tested population in a short amount of time. This article proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven mobilization strategy for mobile assessment agents for epidemics/pandemics. To this end, a self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is trained by using data acquired from past mobile crowdsensing (MCS) campaigns to model mobility patterns of individuals in multiple districts of a city so to maximize the assessed population with minimum agents in the shortest possible time. Through simulation results for a real street map on a mobile crowdsensing simulator and considering the worst case analysis, it is shown that on the 15th day following the first confirmed case in the city under the risk of community spread, AI-enabled mobilization of assessment centers can reduce the unassessed population size down to one fourth of the unassessed population under the case when assessment agents are randomly deployed over the entire city.","Artificial Intelligence-Empowered Mobilization of Assessments in COVID-19-Like Pandemics: A Case Study for Early Flattening of the Curve","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph/about","1660-4601","MDPI AG","EN","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","2020-05-15T00:03:10","School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",1,

Three-quarters of the cases had respiratory symptoms, 44.9% had fever, 13.1% lost smell or taste, and 7.2% had diarrhoea. Body temperature and symptom screening at airports identified 32.7% of the cases. Of the remainder, 27.7% were identified during home quarantining, 16.2% were identified via contact tracing, and 23.4% were reported by hospitals.

At present, COVID-19 has no specific therapeutic drugs, and the main clinical treatment is symptomatic treatment and control of complications. On March 5, 2020, the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China issued the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection (Trial Version 7), which integrated traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) into the treatment of COVID-19. The purpose of this study is to summarize recent studies on the clinic application, pharmacological action, chemical substances and mechanism of Qingwen Baidu Decoction (QBD) on the treatment of various diseases. The results suggested that QBD has multiple pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammation, antiviral, antibacterial, immunomodulatory, antipyretic and so on. It has been used in the treatment of sepsis, epidemic hemorrhagic fever, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, infantile pneumonia, sepsis-related encephalopathy, epidemic encephalitis B and other diseases. In addition, this study attempts to explore the possible mechanism of QBD in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Through the analysis of the chemical substances, pharmacological action and mechanism of QBD, this paper will provide a reference theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 by QBD.","Potential therapeutic effect of Qingwen Baidu Decoction against Corona Virus Disease 2019: a mini review","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/about","1749-8546","BMC","EN","Chinese Medicine","2020-05-24T12:25:55","Department of Pharmacy, Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital",1,

However, the mechanism by which MERS-CoV infects humans remains unclear. To date, there is no effective vaccine or antibody for human immunity and treatment, other than the safety and tolerability of the fully human polyclonal Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody (SAB-301) as a putative therapeutic agent specific for MERS. Although rapid diagnostic and public health measures are currently being implemented, new cases of MERS-CoV infection are still being reported. Therefore, various effective measures should be taken to prevent the serious impact of similar epidemics in the future. Further investigation of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of the virus, as well as the development of effective therapeutic and prophylactic anti-MERS-CoV infections, is necessary. For this purpose, detailed information on MERS-CoV proteins is needed. In this review, we describe the major structural and nonstructural proteins of MERS-CoV and summarize different potential strategies for limiting the outbreak of MERS-CoV. The combination of computational biology and virology can accelerate the advanced design and development of effective peptide therapeutics against MERS-CoV. In summary, this review provides important information about the progress of the elimination of MERS, from prevention to treatment.

Objectives: To report the experience with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection at a single center in Saudi Arabia.
Methods: Cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV occurring from October 1, 2012 to May 31, 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. Information sources included medical files, infection control outbreak investigations, and the preventive medicine database of MERS-CoV-infected patients. Data were collected on clinical and epidemiological aspects and outcomes.
Results: Seventy consecutive patients were included. Patients were mostly of older age (median 62 years), male (46, 65.7%), and had healthcare acquisition of infection (39, 55.7%). Fever (43, 61.4%), dyspnea (42, 60%), and cough (38, 54.3%) were the most common symptoms. The majority developed pneumonia (63, 90%) and required intensive care (49, 70%). Infection commonly occurred in clusters. Independent risk factors for severe infection requiring intensive care included concomitant infections (odds ratio (OR) 14.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.58–126.09; p = 0.018) and low albumin (OR 6.31, 95% CI 1.24–31.90; p = 0.026). Mortality was high (42, 60%), and age ?65 years was associated with increased mortality (OR 4.39, 95% CI 2.13–9.05; p < 0.001).
Conclusions: MERS-CoV can cause severe infection requiring intensive care and has a high mortality. Concomitant infections and low albumin were found to be predictors of severe infection, while age ?65 years was the only predictor of increased mortality.

An emergent human coronavirus was identified as the causal agent of an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during 2002-2003. The severity of the disease combined with its rapid spread requires the continuous surveillance of coronaviruses in worldwide populations. Epidemiological and clinical data of HCoVs infectious in the Brazilian population are scarce and restricted to one or two groups of patients. Our study aimed to investigate retrospectively the presence of HCoVs in different populations of São Paulo presenting acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) during the years of 2001-2010. A pancoronavirus RT-PCR was performed in this study. Coronaviruses were detected in 126 (11.5%) of 1,087 specimens. Peaks detection frequency was observed during 2002-2004 and 2008-2009, with the highest detection in 2008. The prevalence of HCoVs was higher among children with heart diseases (24.6%), patients under stem cell transplantation program (24.3%) and renal transplanted patients (20.2%). Coryza, cough and fever were the most common symptoms at presentation of positive cases and wheezing, a lower respiratory tract infection symptom was reported by 12% of the total, and 27% of high at-risk patients. HCoVs may have an important role among patients with underlying conditions and transplanted ones.","Human coronavirus ocurrence in different populations of Sao Paulo: a comprehensive nine-year study using a pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay","BR",1,"CC BY-NC","CC BY-NC","http://www.scielo.br/revistas/bjm/iaboutj.htm","1517-8382","Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia","EN","Brazilian Journal of Microbiology","2013-09-03T02:36:40",,,

To verify the precise route of infection for the case, we conducted an in-depth epidemiological investigation in cooperation with the KCDC. METHODS We reviewed the MERS outbreak investigation report of the KCDC, and interviewed the healthcare worker who had recovered from MERS. Using the media interview data, we reaffirmed and supplemented the nature of the exposure. RESULTS The healthcare worker, a nurse, was infected while performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for a MERS patient in an isolation room. During the CPR which lasted for an hour, a large amount of body fluid was splashed. The nurse was presumed to have touched the mask to adjust its position during the CPR. She suggested that she was contaminated with the MERS patient’s body fluids by wiping away the sweat from her face during the CPR. CONCLUSIONS The possible routes of infection may include the following: respiratory invasion of aerosols contaminated with MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) through a gap between the face and mask; mucosal exposure to sweat contaminated with MERS-CoV; and contamination during doffing of personal protective equipment. The MERS guidelines should reflect this case to decrease the risk of infection during CPR.","Healthcare worker infected with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in Korea, 2015","KR",1,"CC BY","CC BY","https://www.e-epih.org/authors/authors.php","2092-7193","Korean Society of Epidemiology  ","EN","Epidemiology and Health","2018-02-12T06:20:54","

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belongs to gamma-coronaviruses and causes a costly respiratory viral disease in chickens. The role of wild birds in the epidemiology of IBV is poorly understood. In the present study, we examined 1,002 cloacal and faecal samples collected from 26 wild bird species in the Beringia area for the presence of CoVs, and then we performed statistical and phylogenetic analyses. We detected diverse CoVs by RT-PCR in wild birds in the Beringia area. Sequence analysis showed that the detected viruses are gamma-coronaviruses related to IBV. These findings suggest that wild birds are able to carry gamma-coronaviruses asymptomatically. We concluded that CoVs are widespread among wild birds in Beringia, and their geographic spread and frequency is higher than previously realised. Thus, Avian CoV can be efficiently disseminated over large distances and could be a genetic reservoir for future emerging pathogenic CoVs. Considering the great animal health and economic impact of IBV as well as the recent emergence of novel coronaviruses such as SARS-coronavirus, it is important to investigate the role of wildlife reservoirs in CoV infection biology and epidemiology.","Prevalence and phylogeny of coronaviruses in wild birds from the Bering Strait area (Beringia).","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license","1932-6203","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","EN","PLoS ONE","2016-06-14T20:55:34",,1,

Interaction of the viral spike (S) surface glycoprotein with the host cell receptor is recognized as the first step of infection and is the main determinant of virus tropism. The mechanisms by which neutralizing antibodies inhibit PEDV have not been defined. Isolating PEDV neutralizing antibodies are crucial to identifying the receptor-binding domains of the viral spike and elucidating the mechanism of protection against PEDV infection. Methods B cell hybridoma technique was used to generate hybridoma cells that secrete specific antibodies. E.coli prokaryotic expression system and Bac-to-Bac expression system were used to identify the target protein of each monoclonal antibody. qPCR was performed to analyze PEDV binding to Vero E6 cells with neutralizing antibody. Results We identified 10 monoclonal antibodies using hybridoma technology. Remarkably, 4 mAbs (designed 2G8, 2B11, 3D9, 1E3) neutralized virus infection potently, of which 2B11 and 1E3 targeted the conformational epitope of the PEDV S protein. qPCR results showed that both 2B11 and 2G8 blocked virus entry into Vero cells. Conclusion The data suggested that PEDV neutralizing antibody inhibited virus infection by binding to infectious virions, which could work as a tool to find the receptor-binding domains.","Neutralizing antibodies against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus block virus attachment and internalization","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/about/policies/license-agreement","1743-422X","BMC","EN","Virology Journal","2018-09-02T12:24:20","State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University",1,

FCoV is highly contagious, and infection is common in domestic feline populations worldwide. The present study aimed to determine the seropositivity of FCoV infection and its associated epidemiological variables (risk factors) in domiciled cats in Botucatu, São Paulo, Brazil. Whole blood samples (0.5-1mL) were collected from 151 cats, and sera were extracted by centrifugation. These sera were tested by an commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of IgG anti-FCoV antibodies. The assessed risk factors were age range, breed, gender, reproductive status, outdoor access and rearing mode (living alone or in a group). The seropositivity was 64.2% (97/151). There was no statistical significance for risk factors related to breed, gender or rearing mode. There were significant differences in seropositivity (p-values ?0.05) for age range (p=0.0157), reproductive status (p=0.0074) and outdoor access (p=0.0001). This study verified a wide dissemination of FCoV in the studied population, with a higher than expected seropositivity for indoor cats. Among the risk factors, age range, reproductive status and outdoor access presented statistically significant differences, thus helping to establish an epidemiological profile of this population.","Seroepidemiological study of feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection in domiciled cats from Botucatu, São Paulo, Brazil","BR",1,"CC BY-NC","CC BY-NC","http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php/script_sci_serial/pid_0100-736X/lng_pt/nrm_iso","0100-736X","Colégio Brasileiro de Patologia Animal (CBPA)","EN","Pesquisa Veterinária Brasileira","2019-04-09T21:41:48",,,

Here, we report the anti-PEDV effect of the broad-spectrum inhibitor GC376 (targeting 3Cpro or 3CL<sup>pro</sup> of viruses in the picornavirus-like supercluster). GC376 was highly effective against the PEDV 3CL<sup>pro</sup> and exerted similar inhibitory effects on two PEDV strains. Furthermore, the structure of the PEDV 3CL<sup>pro</sup> in complex with GC376 was determined at 1.65 Å. We elucidated structural details and analyzed the differences between GC376 binding with the PEDV 3CL<sup>pro</sup> and GC376 binding with the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) 3CL<sup>pro</sup>. Finally, we explored the substrate specificity of PEDV 3CL<sup>pro</sup> at the P2 site and analyzed the effects of Leu group modification in GC376 on inhibiting PEDV infection. This study helps us to understand better the PEDV 3CL<sup>pro</sup> substrate specificity, providing information on the optimization of GC376 for development as an antiviral therapeutic against coronaviruses.","Structural Basis for Inhibiting Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Replication with the 3C-Like Protease Inhibitor GC376","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses/about","1999-4915","MDPI AG","EN","Viruses","2020-03-02T13:40:41","State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China",1,

With the recent emergence of novel virulent strains, these viruses can have a large impact on human and animal health. Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is considered to be a reemerging pig disease caused by the enteropathogenic <i>alphacoronavirus</i> PED virus (PEDV). In the absence of effective vaccines, infection prevention and control through diagnostic testing and quarantine are critical. Early detection and differential diagnosis of PEDV infections increase the chance of successful control of the disease. Therefore, there is a continuous need for development of reduced assay-step protocols, no-wash, high-throughput immunoassays. This study described the characterization of the humoral immune response against PEDV under experimental and field conditions using a rapid, sensitive, luminescent proximity homogenous assay (AlphaLISA). PEDV IgG and IgA antibodies were developed toward the beginning of the second week of infection. PEDV IgG antibodies were detected for at least 16 weeks post-exposure. Remarkably, the serum IgA levels remained high and relatively stable throughout the study, lasting longer than the serum IgG response. Overall, AlphaLISA allows the detection and characterization of pathogen-specific antibodies with new speed, sensitivity, and simplicity of use. Particularly, the bridge assay constitutes a rapid diagnostic that substantially improves upon the &#8220;time to result&#8221; metric of currently available immunoassays.","Characterization of the Humoral Immune Response to Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Infection under Experimental and Field Conditions Using an AlphaLISA Platform","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/pathogens/about","2076-0817","MDPI AG","EN","Pathogens","2020-03-27T13:46:58","Veterinary Diagnostic and Production Animal Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50010, USA",1,

The emergent coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic posed and still poses serious issues in the management of the inpatients and in the resource allocation, in particular for those patients requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) management. Epidemiological data clearly suggest that multimorbid older patients have the poorest prognosis. However, it is conceivable that age and number of comorbidities alone do not reflect the real condition and the expected prognosis of the patients affected by COVID-19. A different approach based on comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) could help to better identify older patients more at risk of dismal outcomes and who, at some point of their clinical course, will need the ICU admission. The Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) is a well-accepted tool derived from a standard CGA which allows to measure prognosis of older patients in different clinical settings including hospital. Therefore, we designed a multicenter, prospective, observational study to evaluate the role of MPI in predicting risk of ICU admission and in-hospital mortality among 500 COVID-19-positive older subjects admitted to geriatric and internal medicine wards. In addition, risk of re-hospitalization, institutionalization and death after 3 months from discharge will be assessed. The MPI yields a straightforward value from 0 to 1 and might be able to adequately stratify complex, vulnerable COVID-19 patients for best possible decision-making and treatment allocation.

The government’s decision to repatriate stranded citizens back to Kuwait from various COVID-19 epicenters has generated a great concern.

Mathematical modeling plays a pivotal role in predicting the spread of infectious diseases to enable policymakers to implement various health and safety measures to contain the spread. This research presents a forecast of the COVID-19 epidemic size in Kuwait based on the confirmed data. Deterministic and stochastic modeling approaches were used to estimate the size of COVID-19 spread in Kuwait and determine its ending phase. In addition, various simulation scenarios were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical intervention measures, particularly with time-varying infection rates and individual contact numbers. Results indicate that, with data until 19 April 2020 and before the repatriation plan, the estimated reproduction number in Kuwait is 2.2. It also confirms the efficiency of the containment measures of the state of Kuwait to control the spread even after the repatriation plan.

Although community ecology approaches have been used to identify pathogen interactions at the within-host scale, methodologies enabling robust identification of interactions from population-scale data such as that available from health authorities are lacking. To address this gap, we developed a statistical framework that jointly identifies interactions between multiple viruses from contemporaneous non-stationary infection time series. Our conceptual approach is derived from a Bayesian multivariate disease mapping framework. Importantly, our approach captures within- and between-year dependencies in infection risk while controlling for confounding factors such as seasonality, demographics and infection frequencies, allowing genuine pathogen interactions to be distinguished from simple correlations. We validated our framework using a broad range of synthetic data. We then applied it to diagnostic data available for five respiratory viruses co-circulating in a major urban population between 2005 and 2013: adenovirus, human coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus. We found positive and negative covariances indicative of epidemiological interactions among specific virus pairs.

Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that the exacerbation of asthma, namely virus-induced asthma, may be associated with a wide variety of respiratory viruses.COPD and asthma have different underlying pathophysiological processes and thus require individual therapies. Exacerbation of both COPD and asthma, which are basically defined and diagnosed by clinical symptoms, is associated with a rapid decline in lung function and increased mortality. Similar pathogens, including human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and coronavirus, are also frequently detected during exacerbation of asthma and/or COPD. Immune response to respiratory viral infections, which may be related to the severity of exacerbation in each disease, varies in patients with both COPD and asthma. In this regard, it is crucial to recognize and understand both the similarities and differences of clinical features in patients with COPD and/or asthma associated with respiratory viral infections, especially in the exacerbative stage.In relation to definition, epidemiology, and pathophysiology, this review aims to summarize current knowledge concerning exacerbation of both COPD and asthma by focusing on the clinical significance of associated respiratory virus infections.","Virus-induced exacerbations in asthma and COPD","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/microbiology#about","1664-302X","Frontiers Media S.A.","EN","Frontiers in Microbiology","2014-05-22T09:43:09","Kyorin University",1,

The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002/2003 has demonstrated human vulnerability to (Coronavirus) CoV epidemics. Neither vaccines nor therapeutics are available against human and animal CoVs. Knowledge of host cell proteins that take part in pivotal virus-host interactions could define broad-spectrum antiviral targets. In this study, we used a systems biology approach employing a genome-wide yeast-two hybrid interaction screen to identify immunopilins (PPIA, PPIB, PPIH, PPIG, FKBP1A, FKBP1B) as interaction partners of the CoV non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1). These molecules modulate the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway that plays an important role in immune cell activation. Overexpression of NSP1 and infection with live SARS-CoV strongly increased signalling through the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway and enhanced the induction of interleukin 2, compatible with late-stage immunopathogenicity and long-term cytokine dysregulation as observed in severe SARS cases. Conversely, inhibition of cyclophilins by cyclosporine A (CspA) blocked the replication of CoVs of all genera, including SARS-CoV, human CoV-229E and -NL-63, feline CoV, as well as avian infectious bronchitis virus.

In the presence of secondary infections, an understanding of the transmission dynamics of the virus is crucial. The aim of this study was to characterize the transmission chains of MERS-CoV infection in the current South Korean outbreak.
Methods: Individual-level data from multiple sources were collected and used for epidemiological analyses.
Results: As of July 14, 2015, 185 confirmed cases of MERS have been reported in the Korean outbreak. Three generations of secondary infection, with over half belonging to the second generation, could be delineated. Hospital infection was found to be the most important cause of virus transmission, affecting largely non-healthcare workers (154/184). Healthcare switching has probably accounted for the emergence of multiple generations of secondary infection. Fomite transmission may explain a significant proportion of the infections occurring in the absence of direct contact with infected cases.
Conclusions: Publicly available data from multiple sources, including the media, are useful to describe the epidemic history of an outbreak. The effective control of MERS-CoV hinges on the upholding of infection control standards and an understanding of health-seeking behaviours in the community.","Probable transmission chains of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the multiple generations of secondary infection in South Korea","NL",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","http://www.elsevier.com/journals/international-journal-of-infectious-diseases/1201-9712/open-access-journal","1201-9712","Elsevier","EN","International Journal of Infectious Diseases","2015-09-21T07:31:26",,,

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a widespread avian coronavirus, whose control relies mainly on extensive vaccine administration. Unfortunately, the continuous emergence of new vaccine-immunity escaping variants prompts the development of new vaccines. In the present work, a molecular epidemiology study was performed to evaluate the potential role of homologous vaccination in driving IBV evolution. This was undertaken by assessing IBV viral RNA sequences from the ORF encoding the S1 portion of viral surface glycoprotein (S) before and after the introduction of a new live vaccine on broiler farms in northern-Italy. The results of several biostatistics analyses consistently demonstrate the presence of a higher pressure in the post-vaccination period. Natural selection was detected essentially on sites located on the protein surface, within or nearby domains involved in viral attachment or related functions. This evidence strongly supports the action of vaccine-induced immunity in conditioning viral evolution, potentially leading to the emergence of new vaccine-escape variants. The great plasticity of rapidly-evolving RNA-viruses in response to human intervention, which extends beyond the poultry industry, is demonstrated, claiming further attention due to their relevance for animal and especially human health.","Evolution of infectious bronchitis virus in the field after homologous vaccination introduction","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/copyright-and-license","0928-4249","BMC","EN","Veterinary Research","2019-11-10T12:55:13","Department of Animal Medicine, Production and Health (MAPS), University of Padua",1,

In poultry, the genetic diversity, evolution, distribution and taxonomy of some coronaviruses have been well described, but little is known about the features of CoVs in wild birds. In this study we screened 764 samples from 22 avian species of the orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes in Sweden collected in 2006/2007 for CoV, with an overall CoV prevalence of 18.7%, which is higher than many other wild bird surveys. The highest prevalence was found in the diving ducks--mainly Greater Scaup (Aythya marila; 51.5%)--and the dabbling duck Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos; 19.2%). Sequences from two of the Greater Scaup CoV fell into an infrequently detected lineage, shared only with a Tufted Duck (Aythya fuligula) CoV. Coronavirus sequences from Mallards in this study were highly similar to CoV sequences from the sample species and location in 2011, suggesting long-term maintenance in this population. A single Black-headed Gull represented the only positive sample from the order Charadriiformes. Globally, Anas species represent the largest fraction of avian CoV sequences, and there seems to be no host species, geographical or temporal structure. To better understand the eitiology, epidemiology and ecology of these viruses more systematic surveillance of wild birds and subsequent sequencing of detected CoV is imperative.","High Prevalence and Putative Lineage Maintenance of Avian Coronaviruses in Scandinavian Waterfowl.","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license","1932-6203","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","EN","PLoS ONE","2016-06-15T05:37:14",,1,

Reflejar nuestra frustración al perder un paciente, no porque su infrecuente patología sea de por sí muy grave, sino por el acumulo sobreañadido de otros motivos diagnósticos, y terapéuticos en un entorno  hospitalario de epidemia Covid-19.


Método. Primero describimos el proceso diagnóstico, terapéutico y evolutivo (27 febrero al 25 marzo 2020)  de un varón de 73 años portador de una fístula aorto-entérica secundaria a un bypass aortobifemoral, implantado doce años antes en otro hospital. Después presentamos nuestra experiencia (1978-2020) en este  tipo de situaciones, y finalmente realizamos una revisión de la literatura (1953-2020) al respecto.


Resultados. A) Caso clínico: ausencia de diagnóstico precoz, fracaso de la técnica operatoria elegida, importantes complicaciones postoperatorias (hemorragia, infarto cerebral y neumonía bilateral por coronavirus) que finalizo en exitus. B) Experiencia personal: cuatro casos (incluido el referido). C) Revisión de  la literatura: tres revisiones sistemáticas: 564 casos (1953-1993); 386 casos en 58 publicaciones (1991-2006),  823 pacientes en 216 publicaciones (1995-2015) y 20 casos en 14 publicaciones (2016-2020).


Conclusión. Si en situaciones normales una fístula aorto-entérica es una condición que amenaza seriamente  la vida del paciente (hemorragia y/o infección), no debe extrañar que en situaciones excepcionales esa  situación de gravedad se incremente. No obstante, de estas malas experiencias estamos obligados a sacar  enseñanzas que beneficien a otros en el futuro.","Fístula aorto-entérica y ley de Murphy","ES",1,"CC BY-NC-SA","CC BY-NC-SA","http://revistas.proeditio.com/jonnpr/index","2529-850X","Asociación Para el Progreso de la Biomedicina","EN","Jounal of Negative and No Positive Results","2020-05-16T10:43:15","MD, PhD, FACS, FACA.

Arising in Wuhan China December 2019, the current COVID-19 epidemic has rapidly grown with person-to-person infection expanding to become a global health emergency now on pandemic scale.Governments will not be able to minimise both deaths from COVID-19 and the economic impact of viral spread in mitigation of this current COVID-19 pandemic, according to Anderson et al. 2020 [1], Keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals; hence governments must put in place measures to ameliorate the inevitable economic downturn. The current global picture shows small chains of transmission in many countries and large chains resulting in extensive spread in a few countries, such as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan. Most countries are likely to have spread of COVID-19, at least in the early stages, before any mitigation measures have an impact. The scale of the problem is massive.

For this propose, some important climate parameters, including daily average temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed, in addition to urban parameters such as population density, were considered, and their impacts on confirmed cases of COVID-19 were analyzed. The analysis was performed for three case studies in Italy, and the application of the proposed method has been investigated. The impacts of parameters have been considered with a delay time from one to nine days to find out the most suitable combination. The result of the analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model and the impact of climate parameters on the trend of confirmed cases. The research hypothesis approved by the MLR model and the present assessment method could be applied by considering several variables that exhibit the exact delay of them to new confirmed cases of COVID-19.","Development of an Assessment Method for Investigating the Impact of Climate and Urban Parameters in Confirmed Cases of COVID-19: A New Challenge in Sustainable Development","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph/about","1660-4601","MDPI AG","EN","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","2020-04-19T00:01:36","Department of Mechanical, Energy and Management Engineering, University of Calabria, 87036 Rende, Italy",1,

The MERS-CoV outbreak can be considered a typical public health crisis in that the public was not only greatly terrorized by the actual fear of the disease, but also experienced a great impact to their daily lives, all in a short period of time. Preparedness for and an appropriate response to a public health crisis require comprehensive systematic public healthcare measures to address risks comprehensively with an all-hazards approach. Consequently, discussion regarding establishment of post-MERS-CoV improvement measures must focus on the total reform of the national quarantine system and strengthening of the public health infrastructure. In addition, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must implement specific strategies of action including taking on the role of “control tower” in a public health emergency, training of Field Epidemic Intelligence Service officers, establishment of collaborative governance between central and local governments for infection prevention and control, strengthening the roles and capabilities of community-based public hospitals, and development of nationwide crisis communication methods.","Structural Factors of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Outbreak as a Public Health Crisis in Korea and Future Response Strategies","KR",1,"CC BY-NC","CC BY-NC","https://www.jpmph.org/authors/authors.php","1975-8375","Korean Society for Preventive Medicine","EN","Journal of Preventive Medicine and Public Health","2018-01-09T03:29:29",,,

Methods: We performed a systematic review in PubMed and Embase to find relevant case series. Because some reports were published in Chinese journals, the journals and publications of the Chinese Medical Association related to COVID-19 were completely reviewed. A random effects model was used to pool clinical data in the meta-analysis. Results: Nine case series were included. In the pooled data, most of patients (75%) had a household contact history. The disease severity was mainly mild to moderate (98%). Only 2 children (2%) received intensive care. Fever occurred in 59% of the patients, while cough in 46%. Gastrointestinal symptoms (12%) were uncommon. There are 26% children are asymptomatic. The most common radiographic finding was ground glass opacities (48%). Currently, there is no evidence of vertical transmission to neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. Compared with the most relevant virus, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe disease. Conclusion: COVID-19 has distinct features in children. The disease severity is mild. Current diagnosis is based mainly on typical ground glass opacities on chest CT, epidemiological suspicion and contact tracing.","Clinical characteristics and diagnostic challenges of pediatric COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis","NL",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","https://www.elsevier.com/journals/journal-of-the-formosan-medical-association/0929-6646/open-access-journal","0929-6646","Elsevier","EN","Journal of the Formosan Medical Association","2020-05-11T08:11:38","Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan",,

While olfactory alterations may be observed in patients with rhinovirus, influenza virus, or parainfluenza virus infection, they are typically explained by nasal obstruction with mucus or direct epithelial damage; in the case of SARS-CoV-2, olfactory alterations may present without nasal congestion with mucus. We performed a study of patients presenting olfactory/gustatory alterations in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to contribute to the understanding of this phenomenon.Material and Methods: We performed a descriptive, cross-sectional, observational study of the clinical characteristics of olfactory/gustatory alterations using a self-administered, anonymous online questionnaire.Results: A total of 909 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and olfactory/gustatory alterations responded to the questionnaire in the 4-day data collection period; 824 cases (90.65%) reported simultaneous olfactory and gustatory involvement. Patients' responses to the questionnaire revealed ageusia (581, 64.1% of respondents), hypogeusia (256, 28.2%), dysgeusia (22, 2.4%), anosmia (752 82.8%), hyposmia (142, 15.6%), and dysosmia (8, 0.9%).

Objectives: The objective was to understand the spatial distribution and trends of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Mumbai during the lockdown period and draw insights for effective actions. Methods: Spatial and trend analysis was conducted to trace the spread of the virus during the lockdown period in April 2020. The administrative divisions of Mumbai, in the form of wards and zones, have been used as units of analysis. Results: Greater Mumbai area occupies only 0.015% of the landmass of India, but is contributing to over 20% of the SARS-CoV-2 cases in India. Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections have increased over 375 times within 50 days of the lockdown. An analysis of trends across the wards during the 3-week period (April 4 to April 25) shows a skewed pattern, with three zones out of six contributing to the vast majority of cases in Mumbai. The wards with higher formal economic activity are relatively less affected than the other wards. The test positivity rate in Mumbai is much higher than the rest of India.

By performing target-based virtual ligand screening, a total of 21 targets (including two human targets) were screened against compound libraries including ZINC drug database and our own database of natural products. Structure and screening results of important targets such as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), Spike, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and papain like protease (PLpro) were discussed in detail.

According to existing data, questionnaires, and check results, the diagnosis is automatically generated as confirmed, suspected, or suspicious of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. It classifies patients into mild, moderate, severe or critical pneumonia. nCapp can also establish an online COVID-19 real-time update database, and it updates the model of diagnosis in real time based on the latest real-world case data to improve diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, nCapp can guide treatment. Front-line physicians, experts, and managers are linked to perform consultation and prevention. nCapp also contributes to the long-term follow-up of patients with COVID-19. The ultimate goal is to enable different levels of COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment among different doctors from different hospitals to upgrade to the national and international through the intelligent assistance of the nCapp system.

The latter suggests the presence of a possible sex-dependent susceptibility. An enzymatic system involved in this different predisposition could be represented by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is activated and down-regulated by the spike protein of the virus and allows the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into epithelial cells and myocardium. Data on the experimental animal have shown that 17ß-estradiol increases the expression and activity of ACE2 in both adipose tissue and kidney. Spontaneously hypertensive male mice have a higher myocardial ACE2 expression than females and its levels decrease after orchiectomy. In addition to this first aspect, the recent evidence of an increased frequency of venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 (a clinical element associated with a worse prognosis) calls the attention on the safety of treatment with testosterone, in particular in hypogonadal men with greater genetic predisposition. Evidence that sex hormones are able to modulate the expression of ACE2 could help in interpreting epidemiological results and in designing more appropriate intervention strategies. Moreover, the vitamin D deficiency in elderly men may be worthy of further study regarding the epidemiological aspects of this different susceptibility and lethality between sexes.","Sex-Specific SARS-CoV-2 Mortality: Among Hormone-Modulated ACE2 Expression, Risk of Venous Thromboembolism and Hypovitaminosis D","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms/about under Copyright/Open Access section","1422-0067","MDPI AG","EN","International Journal of Molecular Sciences","2020-04-23T00:01:23","Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, 95123 Catania, Italy",1,

Indeed, estimation of unreported infections is crucial for a better understanding of the current emergency in China and in other countries. In this study, we aimed to estimate the unreported number of infections in China prior to the 23 January 2020 restrictions. To do this, we developed a Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Recovered–Dead (SEIRD) model that estimated unreported infections from the reported number of deaths. Our approach relied on the fact that observed deaths were less likely to be affected by ascertainment biases than reported infections. Interestingly, we estimated that the basic reproductive number (<i>R<sub>0</sub></i>) was 2.43 (95%CI = 2.42–2.44) at the beginning of the epidemic and that 92.9% (95%CI = 92.5%–93.1%) of total cases were not reported. Similarly, the proportion of unreported new infections by day ranged from 52.1% to 100%, with a total of 91.8% (95%CI = 91.6%–92.1%) of infections going unreported. Agreement between our estimates and those from previous studies proves that our approach is reliable for estimating the prevalence and incidence of undocumented SARS-CoV-2 infections. Once it has been tested on Chinese data, our model could be applied to other countries with different surveillance and testing policies.","Estimation of Unreported Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Infections from Reported Deaths: A Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Recovered–Dead Model","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcm/about","2077-0383","MDPI AG","EN","Journal of Clinical Medicine","2020-05-06T00:00:53","Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences and Advanced Technologies “GF Ingrassia”, University of Catania, 95123 Catania, Italy",1,

Most infected individuals are asymptomatic or only exhibit mild symptoms. After the incubation period, the most common symptoms are fever, cough and fatigue. Asymptomatic carrier state is of paramount importance because of carriers' ability to spread the infection and to shed the virus into the air and surroundings. Although much is still unknown about SARS-CoV-2, the scientific research is moving at an unprecedented pace towards understanding the nature, effective control, prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Various reports have suggested an in vivo evolution of the virus, which may explain the rapid spread and changing epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, but further evidence is needed.

It has resulted in a difficult situation for cancer patients owing to the risks of the epidemic situation outbreak as well as cancer. Patients with cancer are more likely than the general population to contract COVID?19 because of the systemic immunosuppressive status caused by malignant diseases or anticancer treatment. Lung cancer has the highest morbidity and mortality in China and the world. Most patients with lung cancer are smokers with poor underlying lung conditions and low immunity, thus it is vital to protect them from epidemic diseases during cancer treatment. It is necessary to provide individualized medical treatment and management of treatment?related adverse events for patients with lung cancer based on patients' conditions and regional epidemic patterns. Key points Significant findings of the study During the outbreak of COVID?19, taking patients' conditions and regional epidemic patterns into consideration, providing appropriate individualized treatment strategies for lung cancer patients with different stages is an urgent requirement. What this study adds Based on the characteristics of lung cancer, this article aims to provide recommendations and suggestions of individualized treatment strategies and management of common adverse events for patients with lung cancer during the epidemic period of COVID?19.","Recommendations of individualized medical treatment and common adverse events management for lung cancer patients during the outbreak of COVID?19 epidemic","GB",1,"CC BY-NC","CC BY-NC","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1759-7714/homepage/open_access_license_and_copyright.htm","1759-7706","Wiley","EN","Thoracic Cancer","2020-06-01T13:10:45","Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing China",,

However, no research analyzed the spatial dependency and temporal dynamics of 2019-nCoV. Consequently, this research aims to detect the spatio-temporal patterns of the 2019-nCoV epidemic using spatio-temporal analysis methods at the county level in Hubei province. The Mann–Kendall and Pettitt methods were used to identify the temporal trends and abrupt changes in the time series of daily new confirmed cases, respectively. The local Moran’s I index was applied to uncover the spatial patterns of the incidence rate, including spatial clusters and outliers. On the basis of the data from January 26 to February 11, 2020, we found that there were 11 areas with different types of temporal patterns of daily new confirmed cases. The pattern characterized by an increasing trend and abrupt change is mainly attributed to the improvement in the ability to diagnose the disease. Spatial clusters with high incidence rates during the period were concentrated in Wuhan Metropolitan Area due to the high intensity of spatial interaction of the population. Therefore, enhancing the ability to diagnose the disease and controlling the movement of the population can be confirmed as effective measures to prevent and control the regional outbreak of the epidemic.","Spatio-Temporal Patterns of the 2019-nCoV Epidemic at the County Level in Hubei Province, China","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph/about","1660-4601","MDPI AG","EN","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","2020-04-14T13:11:55","National-local Joint Engineering Laboratory of Geospatial Information Technology, Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan 411100, China",1,

In the Northern hemisphere, where the disease is classically recognized, bovine coronavirus (BCoV) has been assigned as a major etiologic agent of the disease. Nonetheless, in the Southern hemisphere, an in-deep etiological survey on WD cases had not been carried out. This study aimed to survey for BCoV by nested-RT-PCR, rotavirus by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and ELISA, bacteria by classical bacteriological methods and PCR for virulence factors and parasites by sugar flotation test on fecal samples of 21 cows from a farm during an outbreak of WD in São Paulo state, Southeastern Brazil. BCoV was detected in all 21 samples, while rotavirus was detected in two symptomatic cows. Escherichia coli, Yersinia intermedia, Providencia rustigianii Proteus penneri, Klebsiella terrigena and Enterobacter aglomerans were detected in samples from both asymptomatic and healthy cows in different associations. The study of E. coli virulence factors revealed that the strains isolated were all apathogenic. Cysts of Eimeria sp. and eggs of Strongyloidea were detected at low numbers in four of the symptomatic cows, with one co-infestation. These results suggest BCoV as the main etiologic agent of the cases of WD in Brazil, a conclusion that, with the clinical and epidemiological patterns of the disease studied herein, match those already described elsewhere. These findings give basis to the development of preventive measures and contribute to the understanding of the etiology of WD.<br>Em vacas leiteiras, a disenteria de inverno (DI) é uma doença infecciosa sazonal mundialmente relatada que ocasiona uma marcada queda na produção de leite; no hemisfério Norte, onde a doença é classicamente reconhecida, o coronavirus bovino (BCoV) tem um importante papel como agente etiológico. Entretanto, no hemisfério Sul, pesquisas etiológicas aprofundadas em casos de DI nunca forma realizadas. Este estudo objetivou a pesquisa de BCoV utilizando nested-RT-PCR, rotavírus utilizando eletroforese em gel de poliacrilamida (PAGE) e ELISA, bactérias com métodos bacteriológicos clássicos e PCR para fatores de virulência e parasitas pela técnica de flutuação em açúcar em 21 amostras fecais de vacas de uma fazenda durante um surto de DI no estado de São Paulo, Sudeste do Brasil. BCoV foi encontrado em todas as 21 amostras, enquanto que rotavírus foi encontrado em duas vacas sintomáticas. Escherichia coli, Yersinia intermedia, Providencia rustigiani, Proteus penneri, Klebsiella terrigena e Enterobacter aglomerans foram encontradas tanto em amostras de vacas sintomáticas quanto assintomáticas. O estudo de fatores de virulência para E. coli revelou que as amostras isoladas eram todas apatogênicas. Cistos de Eimeria sp. e ovos de Strongyloidea foram encontrados em baixos números em quatro animais sintomáticos, com uma co-infestação. Tais resultados sugerem o BCoV como o principal agente etiológico em casos de DI no Brasil, uma conclusão que, somada aos padrões clínicos e epidemiológicos da doença aqui estudada, concordam com aqueles descritos em outras regiões.

This provoked the Korean government and the general public to recognize the importance of having a well-established system against infectious diseases. Although epidemiologic investigation is one of the most important aspects of prevention, it has been pointed out that much needs to be improved in Korea. We review here the current status of the Korean epidemiologic service and suggest possible supplementation measures. We examine the current national preventive infrastructure, including human resources such as Epidemic Intelligence Service officers, its governmental management, and related policies. In addition, we describe the practical application of these resources to the recent MERS outbreak and the progress in preventive measures. The spread of MERS demonstrated that the general readiness for emerging infectious diseases in Korea is considerably low. We believe that it is essential to increase society’s investment in disease prevention. Fostering public health personnel, legislating management policies, and establishing research centers for emerging infectious diseases are potential solutions. Evaluating international preventive systems, developing cooperative measures, and initiating improvements are necessary. We evaluated the Korean epidemiologic investigation system and the public preventive measures against infectious diseases in light of the recent MERS outbreak. We suggest that governmental authorities in Korea enforce preventive policies, foster the development of highly qualified personnel, and increase investment in the public health domain of infectious disease prevention.","Strengthening epidemiologic investigation of infectious diseases in Korea: lessons from the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak","KR",1,"CC BY","CC BY","https://www.e-epih.org/authors/authors.php","2092-7193","Korean Society of Epidemiology  ","EN","Epidemiology and Health","2018-02-12T06:34:48","

Herein, PEDV isolate 85-7 could proliferate and induce cell–cell fusion in a trypsin independent manner on Vero cells, and eight homologous mutation strains were screened by continuous proliferation in the absence of trypsin on Vero cells. According to the whole genome sequence comparative analysis, we identified four major variations located in nonstructural protein 2, S, open reading frame 3, and envelope (E) genes, respectively. Comparative analyses of their genomic variations and proliferation characteristics identified a single mutation within the S2? cleavage site between C30 and C40 mutants: the substitution of conserved arginine (R) by a glycine (G) (R895G). This change resulted in weaker cell–cell fusion, smaller plaque morphology, higher virus titer and serious microfilament condensation. Further analysis confirmed that this mutation was responsible for optimal cell-adaptation, but not the determinant for trypsin-dependent entry of PEDV. Otherwise, a novel variation (16–20 aa deletion and an L25P mutation) in the transmembrane domain of the E protein affected multiple infection processes, including up-regulation of the production of the ER stress indicator GRP78, improving the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, and promoting apoptosis. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the potential mechanisms of viral functional proteins in PEDV replication, infection, and fitness.","Identification of two mutation sites in spike and envelope proteins mediating optimal cellular infection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus from different pathways","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/copyright-and-license","0928-4249","BMC","EN","Veterinary Research","2018-09-02T12:49:13","College of Veterinary Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University",1,

We have created a generic protocol for detection of pathogen RNA and/or DNA using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and reverse dot-blot for detection (RDB) and processed automatically in a microfluidic device. In particular, we describe how a microfluidic assay to detect HIV viral RNA was converted to detect Zika virus (ZIKV) RNA. We first optimized the RT-LAMP assay to detect ZIKV RNA using a benchtop isothermal amplification device. Then we implemented the assay in a microfluidic device that will allow analyzing 24 samples simultaneously and automatically from sample introduction to detection by RDB technique. Preliminary data using saliva samples spiked with ZIKV showed that our diagnostic system detects ZIKV RNA in saliva. These results will be validated in further experiments with well-characterized ZIKV human specimens of saliva. The described strategy and methodology to convert the HIV diagnostic assay and platform to a ZIKV RNA detection assay provides a model that can be readily utilized for detection of the next emerging or re-emerging infectious disease.","Detection of Zika virus using reverse-transcription LAMP coupled with reverse dot blot analysis in saliva.","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license","1932-6203","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","EN","PLoS ONE","2018-03-28T05:33:58",,1,

Engineering of genetically defined live attenuated vaccines is a rational approach for novel vaccine development. In this line, we engineered an attenuated virus based on the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) genome, expressing a chimeric spike protein from a virulent United States (US) PEDV strain. This virus (rTGEV-RS-SPEDV) was attenuated in highly-sensitive five-day-old piglets, as infected animals did not lose weight and none of them died. In addition, the virus caused very minor tissue damage compared with a virulent virus. The rTGEV-RS-SPEDV vaccine candidate was also attenuated in three-week-old animals that were used to evaluate the protection conferred by this virus, compared with the protection induced by infection with a virulent PEDV US strain (PEDV-NVSL). The rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus protected against challenge with a virulent PEDV strain, reducing challenge virus titers in jejunum and leading to undetectable challenge virus RNA levels in feces. The rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus induced a humoral immune response specific for PEDV, including neutralizing antibodies. Altogether, the data indicated that rTGEV-RS-SPEDV is a promising vaccine candidate against virulent PEDV infection.","Recombinant Chimeric Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV)—Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) Virus Provides Protection against Virulent PEDV","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses/about","1999-4915","MDPI AG","EN","Viruses","2019-07-25T18:08:02","Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, National Center of Biotechnology (CNB-CSIC), Campus Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Darwin 3, 28049 Madrid, Spain",1,

Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on epidemiological data of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to the World Health Organization from September 2012 to 2 June 2018. We compared all secondary cases among healthcare workers with secondary cases among non-healthcare workers. Multivariable logistic regression identified risk factors for death. Results: Of the 2223 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO, 415 were healthcare workers and 1783 were non-healthcare workers. Compared with non-healthcare workers cases, healthcare workers cases were younger (P?<?0.001), more likely to be female (P?<?0.001), non-nationals (P?<?0.001) and asymptomatic (P?<?0.001), and have fewer comorbidities (P?<?0.001) and higher rates of survival (P?<?0.001). Year of infection (2013–2018) and having no comorbidities were independent protective factors against death among secondary healthcare workers cases. Conclusion: Being able to protect healthcare workers from high threat respiratory pathogens, such as MERS-CoV is important for being able to reduce secondary transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare-associated outbreaks. By extension, reducing infection in healthcare workers improves continuity of care for all patients within healthcare facilities.

While the hypothesis that dromedary camels are the likely major source of MERS-CoV infection in humans is gaining acceptance, conjecture continues over the original natural reservoir host(s) and specifically the role of bats in the emergence of the virus. Dromedary camels were imported to Australia, principally between 1880 and 1907 and have since become a large feral population inhabiting extensive parts of the continent. Here we report that during a focussed surveillance study, no serological evidence was found for the presence of MERS-CoV in the camels in the Australian population. This finding presents various hypotheses about the timing of the emergence and spread of MERS-CoV throughout populations of camels in Africa and Asia, which can be partially resolved by testing sera from camels from the original source region, which we have inferred was mainly northwestern Pakistan. In addition, we identify bat species which overlap (or neighbour) the range of the Australian camel population with a higher likelihood of carrying CoVs of the same lineage as MERS-CoV. Both of these proposed follow-on studies are examples of “proactive surveillance”, a concept that has particular relevance to a One Health approach to emerging zoonotic diseases with a complex epidemiology and aetiology.","Absence of MERS-CoV antibodies in feral camels in Australia: Implications for the pathogen's origin and spread","NL",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","https://www.elsevier.com/journals/one-health/2352-7714/open-access-journal","2352-7714","Elsevier","EN","One Health","2017-06-27T11:54:47","CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong, Australia",,

Hence, in this research work, a serious challenge in the sustainable development process was investigated using the classification of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (new version of Coronavirus) as one of the epidemic diseases. Hence, binary classification modeling was used by the group method of data handling (GMDH) type of neural network as one of the artificial intelligence methods. For this purpose, the Hubei province in China was selected as a case study to construct the proposed model, and some important factors, namely maximum, minimum, and average daily temperature, the density of a city, relative humidity, and wind speed, were considered as the input dataset, and the number of confirmed cases was selected as the output dataset for 30 days. The proposed binary classification model provides higher performance capacity in predicting the confirmed cases. In addition, regression analysis has been done and the trend of confirmed cases compared with the fluctuations of daily weather parameters (wind, humidity, and average temperature). The results demonstrated that the relative humidity and maximum daily temperature had the highest impact on the confirmed cases. The relative humidity in the main case study, with an average of 77.9%, affected positively, and maximum daily temperature, with an average of 15.4 &#176;C, affected negatively, the confirmed cases.","Investigating a Serious Challenge in the Sustainable Development Process: Analysis of Confirmed cases of COVID-19 (New Type of Coronavirus) Through a Binary Classification Using Artificial Intelligence and Regression Analysis","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability/about","2071-1050","MDPI AG","EN","Sustainability","2020-03-27T13:46:51","Department of Mechanical, Energy and Management Engineering, University of Calabria, 87036 Rende, Italy",1,

Socially vulnerable groups of the population did not apply for medical care in a timely manner due to a lack of hospital facilities as well as trained personnel. At the second stage of the epidemic's development, along with the restrictive measures imposed by the state, the epidemic continued to grow. Anti-epidemic restrictive measures were introduced late and at different times in neighboring regions, while there was still insufficient control over the implementation of them on the ground. The delayed introduction of measures aimed at fighting the epidemic has led to a significant increase in morbidity and mortality among vulnerable groups of the population and slowed the speed of flattening the COVID-19 epidemic curve.

We consider vulnerable employment, which includes workers with increased risks of job loss, wage cuts and other negative events that reduce labor incomes.        The analysis shows that every second Russian worker can be classified as vulnerable employee. The highest risks for reducing labor incomes as a result of the epidemic are faced by young people, workers with a low level of education, as well as residents of regional centers. About a third of vulnerable employees experience complex vulnerability, i.e. meet several criteria of vulnerability.        A decrease in labor incomes could also affect the wealth of about 40% of Russian households. The worst situation is for younger families, whose incomes are much more dependent on the labor market. Most of the households in which vulnerable workers live do not receive social benefits, and therefore it would be rather difficult for them to count on prompt assistance from the social protection system.        Currently Russia is actively developing a set of measures to support employment. In particular, government decided to provide support for the most affected by COVID sectors, the size of unemployment benefits has been increased for citizens who have lost their jobs due to the epidemic. However, it is obvious that this list should be extended and account for various forms of deterioration of employment.

","In early December, pneumonia cases of unknown origin started to appear and, on the 7th of January 2020, these cases were declared to be caused by a novel beta-coronavirus according to viral genome sequencing on the 11th of February, 2020. Coronaviruses are enveloped, single strand RNA viruses that have been known to have the ability to mutate rapidly, alter tissue tropism and adjust to different epidemiological situations. As of the end of April 2020, 122,392 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been detected in Turkey, of whom 3,258 died. From the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, children seem to be less affected than adults. Therefore, there are limited data regarding the clinical features of COVID-19 in children. The majority of children with confirmed COVID-19 had a history of household contact. The most common symptoms were fever and cough. Previous data suggest that nearly half of patients are afebrile at the onset of the disease. Hospitalization and PICU admission rates for children were lower than for adults. However, PICU admission can be necessitated in children with severe disease. Infants, particularly under the age of 12 months, were more likely to develop severe disease. In children, milder and asymptomatic cases can be challenging and can play a role in transmission. In particular, clinicians should test those children who have a history of family cluster even though they are asymptomatic or present with mild symptoms.","Clinical Features of COVID-19 in Children","TR",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","http://www.jpedres.org/home/","2147-9445","Galenos Yayinevi","EN","Journal of Pediatric Research","2020-05-14T08:19:48","

The type I interferon (IFN-I or IFN ?/?) is a key mediator of innate antiviral response during virus infection. Different antagonistic strategies have been identified and determined as to how PEDV infection inhibits the host’s IFN responses to escape the host innate immune pathway, but the pathogenic mechanisms of PEDV infection are not fully elucidated. Our preliminary results revealed that endogenous TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), the key components in the IFN signaling pathway were downregulated in PEDV infected IPEC-J2 cells by iTRAQ analysis. In this study, we screened nsp15 as the most important viral encoded protein involved in TBK1 and IRF3 reduction. Endoribonuclease (EndoU) activity has been well determined for coronavirus nsp15. Three residues (H226, H241, and K282) of PEDV nsp15 were identified as critical amino acids for PEDV EndoU but not D265, which was not well correlated with published results of other coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV). Moreover, PEDV nsp15 can directly degrade the RNA levels of TBK1 and IRF3 dependent on its EndoU activity to suppress IFN production and constrain the induction of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs), by which PEDV antagonizes the host innate response to facilitate its replication. Collectively, these results have confirmed that PEDV nsp15 was capable of subverting the IFN response by the RNA degradation of TBK1 and IRF3.","Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus nsp15 Antagonizes Interferon Signaling by RNA Degradation of TBK1 and IRF3","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses/about","1999-4915","MDPI AG","EN","Viruses","2020-06-01T00:00:06","State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150069, China",1,

Severe trauma may still occur during the outbreak of the COVID-19. In order to protect the medical personnel involved in emergency treatment and ensuring the timeliness of treatment for trauma patients, The Trauma Surgery Branch of Chinese Medical Doctors' Association (CMDA) organized the drafting of the present expert consensus. This paper interprets the main views of the expert consensus, emphasizes that the safety of health care staff and patients are equally important, and that the treatment strategies and procedures for severe trauma need to be adjusted during the COVID-19 outbreak. The consensus also recommends the use of CT scan, which plays both the role of screening COVID-19 and accurate assessment of trauma, and strengthening the protection of medical staff. The consensus states that medical personnel can be exempted from isolation if they wear standard three-level protective equipment and are not accidentally exposed during the operation. This expert consensus is the first one to systematically review, summarize and analyze the progress of COVID-19 from a surgeon's perspective. It may be used as a reference for medical institutions at all levels to treat patients with severe trauma and perform other kinds of operations during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Los casos aparentemente se iniciaron en el sur de China y se han diseminado a otras regiones en Asia, Europa, Sudáfrica, Norte América y Sur América. La causa de este síndrome es una nueva variedad de Coronavirus, aislado en secreciones respiratorias y en otras. El síndrome ha sido definido en inglés como SARS (Severe acute respiratory syndrome) por la Organización Mundial de la Salud y se caracteriza por un periodo de incubación de 1 a 10 días (promedio de cinco días), una fase febril prodrómica que aparece entre los días 1 a 3. Posteriormente, aparecen síntomas respiratorios como tos, disnea, y signos como hipoxemia, que en 10 a 40% de los casos requieren de ventilación mecánica. La tasa de letalidad ha variado de 3% hasta 16%. Los hallazgos de laboratorio incluyen trombocitopenia, leucopenia, elevación de creatinin-fosfokinasa, y, en ocasiones, de transaminasas hepáticas y deshidrogenasa láctica. El tratamiento incluye medidas de apoyo; la utilización empírica del antiviral ribavirina es controvertida, debido a que hasta el momento no existe un tratamiento específico. Se recomienda el aislamiento respiratorio de los pacientes, la utilización de máscaras protectoras y el lavado estricto de manos como principales medidas de prevención. Desde el inicio de esta epidemia México estableció un sistema de vigilancia, así como recomendaciones al personal de salud para la identificación, prevención de casos secundarios y manejo clínico de casos sospechosos.<br>In early February 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) began receiving reports of patients with a syndrome characterized by an atypical pneumonia with rapid progression to respiratory failure without an identified cause despite extensive diagnostic workups. Most of these reports pointed out that the outbreak started in Southern China, specifically in the Guandong Province. The initial outbreak in South East Asia has already spread to other Regions in Asia, Europe, North and South America, and South Africa. Many of these cases can be linked through chains of transmission to an index case from the Guandong Province who visited Hong Kong. Although the exact mode of transmission has not been clearly established, the etiology of this syndrome has already been identified. A novel Coronavirus has been identified by electron microscopy and molecular assays in multiple laboratories from respiratory specimens throughout the world. The syndrome has been defined as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) by WHO, and is characterized by an incubation period between 1 and 10 days (average 5 days) and by a febrile phase that usually lasts approximately 3 days. During the respiratory phase that begins around day 3, patients start developing a dry cough, shortness of breath and hypoxemia. Mechanical ventilatory support is required in about 10 to 40% of cases and the case-fatality rate ranges between 3 and 16%. The laboratory findings in SARS cases include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and a rise in transaminases and lactic dehydrogenase levels. Treatment of SARS includes supportive measures and the empiric use of ribavirin. Respiratory isolation, use of respiratory masks, and compulsory hand hygiene constitute the principal preventive measures. The confirmation of a case can be performed at reference laboratories by serologic and molecular assays. From the onset of this epidemic Mexico established a surveillance system as well as clinical guidelines and recommendations for the identification, prevention of secondary spread, and medical management of suspicious and probable cases by health care personnel.","Síndrome agudo respiratorio severo: un panorama mundial de la epidemia Severe acute respiratory syndrome: a global view of the epidemic","MX",1,"CC BY-NC-SA","CC BY-NC-SA","http://saludpublica.mx/index.php/spm/about/editorialPolicies#custom-2","0036-3634","Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública","EN","Salud Pública de México","2013-09-04T06:51:09",,,

The notification was based on a serological diagnosis in a small farm with a morbidity rate of 2.3% without enteric clinical signs. In order to determine if TGEV was circulating before the official report, a retrospective study on cases of neonatal diarrhea was performed. The selection criteria was a sudden increase in mortality in 1- to 21-day-old piglets with watery diarrhea that did not respond to antibiotics. Based on these criteria, three clinical cases were identified during 2010–2015. Results All animals that were evaluated presented histological lesions consistent with enteric viral infection. The feces and ultrathin sections of intestine that were evaluated by electron microscopy confirmed the presence of round particles of approximately 80 nm in size and characterized by finely granular electrodense nucleoids consistent with complete particles of coronavirus. The presence of the TGEV antigen was confirmed by monoclonal specific immunohistochemistry, and final confirmation of a metabolically-active virus was performed by in situ hybridization to detect a TGE mRNA encoding spike protein. All sections evaluated in this case were negative for PEDV and rotavirus A. Conclusions This is the first case series describing neonatal mortality with etiological confirmation of TGEV in Argentina.

PDCoV has spread to many countries around the world, leading to significant economic losses in the pork industry. Therefore, a rapid and sensitive method for detection of PDCoV in clinical samples is urgently needed. Results In this study, we developed a single-tube one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay specific for nucleocapsid gene to diagnose and monitor PDCoV infections. The detection limit of RT-LAMP assay was 1 × 101 copies of PDCoV, which was approximately 100-fold more sensitive than gel-based one-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This assay could specifically amplify PDCoV and had no cross amplification with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine kobuvirus (PKoV), porcine astrovirus (PAstV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), classic swine fever virus (CSFV), and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). By screening a panel of clinical specimens (N = 192), this method presented a similar sensitivity with nested RT-PCR and was 1–2 log more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR in detection of PDCoV. Conclusions The RT-LAMP assay established in this study is a potentially valuable tool, especially in low-resource laboratories and filed settings, for a rapid diagnosis, surveillance, and molecular epidemiology investigation of PDCoV infections. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work for detection of newly emerged PDCoV with LAMP technology.","A simple and rapid identification method for newly emerged porcine Deltacoronavirus with loop-mediated isothermal amplification","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/copyright-and-license","0716-9760","BMC","EN","Biological Research","2017-12-11T02:10:29","Department of Veterinary Preventive Medicine, College of Animal Science and Technology, Jiangxi Agricultural University",1,

Although immunopathological damages may account for the severity of respiratory distress, little is known about how the genome-wide gene expression of the host changes under the attack of SARS-CoV.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>Based on changes in gene expression of peripheral blood, we identified 52 signature genes that accurately discriminated acute SARS patients from non-SARS controls. While a general suppression of gene expression predominated in SARS-infected blood, several genes including those involved in innate immunity, such as defensins and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, were upregulated. Instead of employing clustering methods, we ranked the severity of recovering SARS patients by generalized associate plots (GAP) according to the expression profiles of 52 signature genes. Through this method, we discovered a smooth transition pattern of severity from normal controls to acute SARS patients. The rank of SARS severity was significantly correlated with the recovery period (in days) and with the clinical pulmonary infection score.</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>The use of the GAP approach has proved useful in analyzing the complexity and continuity of biological systems. The severity rank derived from the global expression profile of significantly regulated genes in patients may be useful for further elucidating the pathophysiology of their disease.</p> ","Molecular signature of clinical severity in recovering patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/about","1471-2164","BMC","EN","BMC Genomics","2005-11-12T00:00:00",,1,

This study was conducted to evaluate the distribution of respiratory viruses in patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) through the first teaching hospital-based surveillance scheme for ILI in South Korea. METHODS: Respiratory specimens were obtained from adult patients (?18 years) who visited the emergency department (ED) with ILI from week 40, 2011 to week 22, 2012. Multiplex PCR was performed to detect respiratory viruses: influenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, bocavirus, and enterovirus. RESULTS: Among 1,983 patients who visited the ED with ILI, 811 (40.9%) were male. The median age of patients was 43 years. Influenza vaccination rate was 21.7% (430/1,983) during the 2011-2012 season. At least one comorbidity was found in 18% of patients. The positive rate of respiratory viruses was 52.1% (1,033/1,983) and the total number of detected viruses was 1,100. Influenza A virus was the dominant agent (677, 61.5%) in all age groups. The prevalence of human metapneumovirus was higher in patients more than 50 years old, while adenovirus was detected only in younger adults. In 58 (5.6%) cases, two or more respiratory viruses were detected. The co-incidence case was identified more frequently in patients with hematologic malignancy or organ transplantation recipients, however it was not related to clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: This study is valuable as the first extensive laboratory surveillance of the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in ILI patients through a teaching hospital-based influenza surveillance system in South Korea.","Laboratory surveillance of influenza-like illness in seven teaching hospitals, South Korea: 2011-2012 season.","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license","1932-6203","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","EN","PLoS ONE","2016-06-14T22:55:46",,1,

The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of all 28 cases were analyzed in response to this disease. Methods The epidemiological characteristics and early clinical features of the 28 patients from Korea with confirmed COVID-19 were analyzed using COVID-19 reporting and surveillance data and the epidemiological investigation reports prepared by the rapid response team. Results There were 16 patients that entered Korea from foreign countries: Wuhan, China (11 patients), Zhuhai, China, (1 patient), Singapore (2 patients), Japan (1 patient), and Thailand (1 patient). The early symptoms were fever, sore throat, cough or sputum production, chills, and muscle ache. Three patients were asymptomatic, however, 18 developed pneumonia. Of the 28 cases, 16 were index cases imported from abroad, with 10 cases of secondary infection originating in Korea, and the route of transmission still under investigation for 2 patients. The 10 patients with secondary infection were infected from contact with family members or acquaintances of primary patients, and the suspected sites of transmission were mostly at home. Conclusion COVID-19 in Korea was spread by 16 infected individuals traveling from other countries, leading to second-generation cases. The initial symptoms were mostly minor, but the disease was infectious at this stage, resulting from close contact, particularly at home. Establishing an early detection strategy for COVID-19 is crucial for managing the transmission of the disease.","Early Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics of 28 Cases of Coronavirus Disease in South Korea","KR",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","https://ophrp.org/about/open_access.html","2210-9099","Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention","EN","Osong Public Health and Research Perspectives","2020-02-28T05:07:45",,,

The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, <i>R</i><sub>0</sub>, of 2019-nCoV. Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth. The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation. We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate <i>R</i><sub>0</sub>. Results: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern. The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403&#8722;540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 18&#8722;25) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average. We estimated the <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> of 2019-nCoV at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49&#8722;2.63). Conclusion: The under-reporting was likely to have occurred during the first half of January 2020 and should be considered in future investigation.","Estimating the Unreported Number of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Cases in China in the First Half of January 2020: A Data-Driven Modelling Analysis of the Early Outbreak","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcm/about","2077-0383","MDPI AG","EN","Journal of Clinical Medicine","2020-03-02T12:59:14","JC School of Public Health and Primary Care, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong 999077, China",1,

The virus emerged in the US in 2013, resulting in severe production losses. Effective vaccine development against PEDV is a challenge. Inactivated vaccines are of questionable efficacy. Attenuated vaccines, while more effective, require a relatively long lead development time, are associated with safety concerns and are also unable to prevent new field outbreaks. To combine the safety and efficacy advantages of inactivated and attenuated PEDV vaccines, respectively, in this study, we tested the hypothesis that subjecting PEDV virions to heat treatment at 44°C for 10 min to reversibly unfold structural proteins, followed by exposure to RNAse to fragment the genome, would result in a vaccine preparation with intact viral structure/antigenicity but highly diminished replicative abilities. We expected the vaccine to be both safe and effective in a piglet challenge model. Following the heat and RNAse treatment, PEDV virions had an intact electron microscopic ultrastructure and were amplified only in the 3rd passage in Vero cells, indicating that diminished replication was achieved in vitro. Strong PEDV spike-protein specific and virus neutralizing antibody responses were elicited in vaccinated piglets. Upon challenge, all vaccinated pigs were protected against fecal viral shedding and intestinal pathology, while the unvaccinated controls were not. The vaccine virus was not detected in the fecal matter of vaccinated pigs prior to challenge; nor did they develop intestinal lesions. Thus, the described approach has significant promise in improving current approaches for PEDV immunization.","A Minimally Replicative Vaccine Protects Vaccinated Piglets Against Challenge With the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/veterinary-science#about","2297-1769","Frontiers Media S.A.","EN","Frontiers in Veterinary Science","2019-10-22T05:31:52","Department of Microbiological Sciences, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND, United States",1,

We summarized the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory findings of the first Korean case of MERS-CoV and analyzed whole-genome sequences of MERS-CoV derived from the patient. Case presentation A 68-year-old man developed fever and myalgia 7 days after returning to Korea, following a 10-day trip to the Middle East. Before diagnosis, he visited 4 hospitals, potentially resulting in secondary transmission to 28 patients. On admission to the National Medical Center (day 9, post-onset of clinical illness), he presented with drowsiness, hypoxia, and multiple patchy infiltrations on the chest radiograph. He was intubated (day 12) because of progressive acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and INF-?2a and ribavirin treatment was commenced. The treatment course was prolonged by superimposed ventilator associated pneumonia. MERS-CoV PCR results converted to negative from day 47 and the patient was discharged (day 137), following rehabilitation therapy. The complete genome sequence obtained from a sputum sample (taken on day 11) showed the highest sequence similarity (99.59%) with the virus from an outbreak in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in February 2015. Conclusions The first case of MERS-CoV infection had high transmissibility and was associated with a severe clinical course. The patient made a successful recovery after early treatment with antiviral agents and adequate supportive care. This first case in South Korea became a super-spreader because of improper infection control measures, rather than variations of the virus.","The clinical and virological features of the first imported case causing MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea, 2015","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/about","1471-2334","BMC","EN","BMC Infectious Diseases","2018-08-14T11:14:54","Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, National Medical Center",1,

We aimed to conduct a comprehensive etiologic and epidemiologic study of multiple CIRD agents in a diverse dog population using molecular methods and statistical modeling analyses. In addition, a novel probe-based multiplex real-time PCR was developed to simultaneously detect and differentiate two species of Mycoplasma (M. canis and M. cynos). Canine adenovirus, canine distemper virus, canine parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, influenza A virus (H3N2 and H3N8), Bordetella bronchiseptica, M. canis, M. cynos and Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus were investigated in specimens from clinically ill and asymptomatic dogs received at the Athens Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Results showed low occurrence of classical CIRD agents such as B. bronchiseptica, canine adenovirus and distemper virus, while highlighting the potential role of emerging bacteria such as M. canis and M. cynos. Statistical modeling analyses of CIRD pathogens emphasized the impact of co-infections on the severity of clinical presentation, and showed that host factors, such as animal age, are the most important predictors of disease severity. This study provides new insights into the current understanding of the prevalence and role of co-infections with selected viruses and bacteria in the etiology of CIRD, while underscoring the importance of molecular diagnosis and vaccination against this disease.","Canine infectious respiratory disease: New insights into the etiology and epidemiology of associated pathogens.","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license","1932-6203","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","EN","PLoS ONE","2019-10-05T10:46:15",,1,

Using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR and the basic reproduction number&#8212;the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a na&#239;ve population. We modeled epidemic growth either from a single index case with illness onset on 8 December 2019 (Scenario 1), or using the growth rate fitted along with the other parameters (Scenario 2) based on data from 20 exported cases reported by 24 January 2020. The cumulative incidence in China by 24 January was estimated at 6924 cases (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4885, 9211) and 19,289 cases (95% CI: 10,901, 30,158), respectively. The latest estimated values of the cCFR were 5.3% (95% CI: 3.5%, 7.5%) for Scenario 1 and 8.4% (95% CI: 5.3%, 12.3%) for Scenario 2. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.1 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.2) and 3.2 (95% CI: 2.7, 3.7) for Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Based on these results, we argued that the current COVID-19 epidemic has a substantial potential for causing a pandemic.

Globally, at least four billion people were under lockdown, working remotely, homeschooling children, and facing challenges coping with quarantine and the stressful events. The present cross-sectional online survey of adult Poles (<i>n</i> = 1097), conducted during a nationwide quarantine, aimed to assess whether nutritional and consumer habits have been affected under these conditions. Over 43.0% and nearly 52% reported eating and snacking more, respectively, and these tendencies were more frequent in overweight and obese individuals. Almost 30% and over 18% experienced weight gain (mean ± SD 3.0 ± 1.6 kg) and loss (?2.9 ± 1.5 kg), respectively. Overweight, obese, and older subjects (aged 36–45 and >45) tended to gain weight more frequently, whereas those with underweight tended to lose it further. Increased BMI was associated with less frequent consumption of vegetables, fruit, and legumes during quarantine, and higher adherence to meat, dairy, and fast-foods. An increase in alcohol consumption was seen in 14.6%, with a higher tendency to drink more found among alcohol addicts. Over 45% of smokers experienced a rise in smoking frequency during the quarantine. The study highlights that lockdown imposed to contain an infectious agent may affect eating behaviors and dietary habits, and advocates for organized nutritional support during future epidemic-related quarantines, particularly for the most vulnerable groups, including overweight and obese subjects.","Dietary Choices and Habits during COVID-19 Lockdown: Experience from Poland","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients/about","2072-6643","MDPI AG","EN","Nutrients","2020-06-04T00:01:22","Faculty of Medicine, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, 60-812 Pozna?, Poland",1,

Variables such as comorbidities and exposure to MERS-CoV cases were significantly associated with mortality in people affected with MERS-CoV infections, and adjusted odds ratio estimates were 2.2 (95% CI: 1.16, 7.03) and 2.3 (95% CI: 1.35, 8.20), respectively. All age groups had an equal chance of mortality. Conclusions In today’s “global village”, there is probability of MERS-CoV epidemic at any time and in any place without prior notice. Thus, health systems in all countries should implement better triage systems for potentially imported cases of MERS-CoV to prevent large epidemics.","Current epidemiological status of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in the world from 1.1.2017 to 17.1.2018: a cross-sectional study","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/about","1471-2334","BMC","EN","BMC Infectious Diseases","2019-04-28T12:09:20","Epidemiologist in Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Urmia University of Medical Sciences",1,

Social distancing (SD) interventions applied so far have included school closures, remote working and quarantine. These measures have been shown to have large impacts on pandemic influenza transmission. However, there has been comparatively little examination of such measures for COVID-19. Methods: We examined the existing literature, and collated data, on implementation of NPIs to examine their effects on the COVID-19 pandemic so far. Data on NPIs were collected from official government websites as well as from media sources. Results: Measures such as travel restrictions have been implemented in multiple countries and appears to have slowed the geographic spread of COVID-19 and reduced initial case numbers. We find that, due to the relatively sparse information on the differences with and without interventions, it is difficult to quantitatively assess the efficacy of many interventions. Similarly, whilst the comparison to other pandemic diseases such as influenza can be helpful, there are key differences that could affect the efficacy of similar NPIs. Conclusions: The timely implementation of control measures is key to their success and must strike a balance between early enough application to reduce the peak of the epidemic and ensuring that they can be feasibly maintained for an appropriate duration. Such measures can have large societal impacts and they need to be appropriately justified to the population. As the pandemic of COVID-19 progresses, quantifying the impact of interventions will be a vital consideration for the appropriate use of mitigation strategies.","Adoption and impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19 [version 1; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/about/policies#licenses","2398-502X","Wellcome","EN","Wellcome Open Research","2020-06-01T15:09:08","MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Imperial College London, London, UK",1,

Prior to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, stable patients with chronic conditions attended the facility or support groups to obtain their medication. During the COVID-19 epidemic, these patients would be put at risk if they had to travel and gather in groups to receive medication. The Metropolitan Health Services, therefore, decided to offer home delivery of medication. A system of home delivery was rapidly established by linking the existing chronic dispensing unit system with the emerging approach to community-orientated primary care in the Metro. Medication was delivered as usual to primary care pharmacies, but then a variety of means were used to disseminate the parcels to local non-profit organisations, where they could be delivered by a city-wide network of community health workers (CHWs). Innovations included various ways of delivering the parcels, including via Uber, bicycles and electric scooters, as well as Google forms to monitor the success of the initiative. It was estimated that up to 200 000 parcels per month could be delivered in this way via 2500 CHWs. The new system was established throughout the Metropole, and its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats are further discussed. The initiative may prevent COVID-19 amongst people with comorbidities who would be at risk of more severe diseases. It may also have de-congested primary care facilities ahead of the expected surge in COVID-19 cases.","Home delivery of medication during Coronavirus disease 2019, Cape Town, South Africa: Short report","ZA",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://aosis.co.za/publishing/about-scholarly-journals#publishing_tab_nav_1","2071-2928","AOSIS","EN","African Journal of Primary Health Care & Family Medicine","2020-06-05T11:50:37","Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Cape Town",1,

Because of its high transmissibility, COVID-19 has already caused extensive morbidity and mortality in many countries throughout the world. An accurate estimation of the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 would be beneficial for prevention programs. In light of discrepancies in original research on this issue, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled R0 for COVID-19 in the current outbreak. Methods International databases (including Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, and Scopus) were searched to identify studies conducted regarding the R0 of COVID-19. Articles were searched using the following keywords: “COVID-19” and “basic reproduction number” or “R0.” The heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the I2 index, the Cochran Q test, and T2. A random-effects model was used to estimate R0 in this study. Results The mean reported R0 in the identified articles was 3.38±1.40, with a range of 1.90 to 6.49. According to the results of the random-effects model, the pooled R0 for COVID-19 was estimated as 3.32 (95% confidence interval, 2.81 to 3.82). According to the results of the meta-regression analysis, the type of model used to estimate R0 did not have a significant effect on heterogeneity among studies (p=0.81). Conclusions Considering the estimated R0 for COVID-19, reducing the number of contacts within the population is a necessary step to control the epidemic. The estimated overall R0 was higher than the World Health Organization estimate.","Estimate of the Basic Reproduction Number for COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","KR",1,"CC BY-NC","CC BY-NC","https://www.jpmph.org/authors/authors.php","1975-8375","Korean Society for Preventive Medicine","EN","Journal of Preventive Medicine and Public Health","2020-06-05T04:46:19","

Objectives: To understand the effectiveness of NPIs reported in the contemporary literatures describing prediction models for prevention of the ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 specifically in Indian population. Methods: Original research articles in English obtained through keyword search in PubMed, WHO Global Database for COVID19, and pre-print servers were included in the review. Thematic synthesis of extracted data from articles were done. Results: Twenty-four articles were found eligible for the review - four published articles and twenty pre-print articles. Compartmental model was found to be the most commonly used mathematical model; along with exponential, time varying, neural network and cluster kinetic models. Social distancing, specifically lockdown, was the most commonly modelled intervention strategy. Additionally, contact tracing using smartphone application, international travel restriction, increasing hospital/ICU beds, changes in testing strategy were also dealt with. Social distancing along with increasing testing seemed to be effective in delaying the peak of the epidemic and reducing the peak prevalence. Conclusion: Although there is mathematical rationality behind implementation of social distancing measures including lockdown, this study also emphasised the importance of other associated measures like increasing tests and increasing the number of hospital and ICU beds. The later components are particularly important during the social mixing period to be observed after lifting of lockdown.","Effectiveness of preventive measures against COVID-19: A systematic review of In Silico modeling studies in indian context","IN",1,"CC BY-NC-SA","CC BY-NC-SA","http://www.ijph.in/aboutus.asp","0019-557X","Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications","EN","Indian Journal of Public Health","2020-06-05T03:19:38",,,

Objective: The objective of this study was to identify knowledge, attitudes and practices of homoeopathic physicians about COVID-19. Methodology: An online cross-sectional survey was undertaken in the midst of the epidemic in India when services of homoeopathic doctors were under consideration. The ten knowledge questions were scored and analysed to identify differences with sociodemographic variables. Responses to the ten questions on attitudes and practices were analysed to identify differences in the domains, differing significantly in knowledge scores. Results: Out of 3901 responses received over 2 days, 3595 were included for analysis. Knowledge scores significantly differed with qualification (graduates – 8.60 ± 1.38, post-graduates – 8.84 ± 1.29 and other qualifications – 8.56 ± 1.31) and years of practice (<10 years – 8.57 ± 1.38 and >10 years – 8.84 ± 1.30). Gender was not identified as a variable to affect knowledge scores significantly. Attitudes and practices were also identified to be more favourable in participants with more than 10 years' experience. Conclusion: Homoeopathic physicians have largely been able to maintain a high level of currency of knowledge, purely on their own accord. Specific aspects related to patient care and practices need to be further enhanced. Practitioners affirmed that homoeopathic medicines need to be validated on a group of patients before mass treatment/prevention can be identified for which immediate access to patients is required.","An online cross-sectional survey on knowledge, attitudes, practices and perspectives of homoeopathic practitioners towards COVID-19","IN",1,"CC BY-NC-SA","CC BY-NC-SA","http://www.ijrh.org/contributors.asp#Copyrights","0974-7168","Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications","EN","Indian Journal of Research in Homoeopathy","2020-06-05T03:19:49",,,

So far, however, limited data are available for children. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the clinical and chest CT imaging characteristics of COVID-19 in preschool children. Methods From January 26, 2020 to February 20, 2020, the clinical and initial chest CT imaging data of eight preschool children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from two hospitals were retrospectively collected. The chest CT imaging characteristics, including the distribution, shape, and density of lesions, and the pleural effusion, pleural changes, and enlarged lymph nodes were evaluated. Results Two cases (25%) were classified as mild type, and they showed no obvious abnormal CT findings or minimal pleural thickening on the right side. Five cases (62.5%) were classified as moderate type. Among these patients, one case showed consolidation located in the subpleural region of the right upper lobe, with thickening in the adjacent pleura; one case showed multiple consolidation and ground-glass opacities with blurry margins; one case displayed bronchial pneumonia-like changes in the left upper lobe; and two cases displayed asthmatic bronchitis-like changes. One case (12.5%) was classified as critical type and showed bronchial pneumonia-like changes in the bilateral lungs, presenting blurred and messy bilateral lung markings and multiple patchy shadows scattered along the lung markings with blurry margins. Conclusions The chest CT findings of COVID-19 in preschool children are atypical and various. Accurate diagnosis requires a comprehensive evaluation of epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and CT imaging data.","Chest CT imaging characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in preschool children: a retrospective study","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/about","1471-2431","BMC","EN","BMC Pediatrics","2020-05-24T12:15:06","Department of Radiology, Xiangyang No. 1 People’s Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine",1,

Data of all 131 confirmed cases in Tianjin before February 20 were collected. By February 20, a total of 14/16 districts reported COVID-19 cases, with Baodi district reporting the most cases (n = 56). A total of 22 (16.8%) cases had a Wuhan-related exposure. Fever was the most common symptom (82.4%). The median duration of symptom onset to treatment was [1.0 (0.0–4.0) days], the duration of symptom onset to isolation [2.0 (0.0–6.0) days], and the duration of symptom onset to diagnosis [5.0 (2.0–8.0) days]. The analysis of the transmission chain showed two cluster infections with 62 cases infected. Transmission from a family member constituted 42%, usually at the end of transmission chain. Compared with patients with non-severe infections, patients with severe infections were more likely to be male (46.2 vs. 77.3%, P = 0.009) and had a Wuhan-related exposure (14.0 vs. 40.9%, P = 0.004). Multivariate logistic regression showed that male (OR 3.913, 95% CI 1.206, 12.696; P = 0.023) was an independent risk factor for severe infection. This study provides evidence on the epidemic of COVID-19 by analyzing the epidemiological characteristics of confirmed cases in Tianjin. Self-quarantine at an outbreak's early stage, especially for those with high-risk exposures, is conducive to prevent the transmission of infection. Further investigation is needed to confirm the risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection and investigate the mechanisms involved.","Epidemiologic Characteristics, Transmission Chain, and Risk Factors of Severe Infection of COVID-19 in Tianjin, a Representative Municipality City of China","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/public-health#about","2296-2565","Frontiers Media S.A.","EN","Frontiers in Public Health","2020-05-20T05:23:38",,1,

Since January 23, 2020, China has launched a series of unusual and strict measures, including the lockdown of Wuhan city to contain this highly contagious disease. We collected the epidemiological data to analyze the trend of this epidemic in China.Methods: We closely tracked the Chinese and global official websites to collect the epidemiological information about COVID-19. The number of total and daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China was presented to illustrate the trend of this epidemic.Results: On January 23, 2020, 835 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in China. On February 6, 2020, there were 31,211 cases. By February 20, 2020, the number reached as high as 75,993. Most cases were distributed in and around Wuhan, Hubei province. Since January 23, 2020, the number of daily new cases in China except Hubei province reached a peak of 890 on the eleventh day and then it declined to a low level of 34 within two full-length incubation periods (28 days), and the number of daily new cases in Hubei also started to decrease on the twelfth day, from 3,156 on February 4, 2020 to 955 on February 15, 2020.Conclusion: The COVID-19 epidemic has been primarily contained in China.

Outside of China, Italy is one of the countries suffering the most with the COVID-19 epidemic. It is important to predict the epidemic trend of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy to help develop public health strategies.Methods: We used time-series data of COVID-19 from Jan 22 2020 to Apr 02 2020. An infectious disease dynamic extended susceptible-infected-removed (eSIR) model, which covers the effects of different intervention measures in dissimilar periods, was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Italy. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credible interval (CI). Hunan, with a similar total population number to Italy, was used as a comparative item.Results: In the eSIR model, we estimated that the mean of basic reproductive number for COVID-19 was 4.34 (95% CI, 3.04–6.00) in Italy and 3.16 (95% CI, 1.73–5.25) in Hunan. There would be a total of 182 051 infected cases (95%CI:116 114–274 378) under the current country blockade and the endpoint would be Aug 05 in Italy.Conclusion: Italy's current strict measures can efficaciously prevent the further spread of COVID-19 and should be maintained. Necessary strict public health measures should be implemented as soon as possible in other European countries with a high number of COVID-19 cases. The most effective strategy needs to be confirmed in further studies.","Extended SIR Prediction of the Epidemics Trend of COVID-19 in Italy and Compared With Hunan, China","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/medicine#about","2296-858X","Frontiers Media S.A.","EN","Frontiers in Medicine","2020-05-06T07:26:24","Beijing Key Laboratory of Aging and Geriatrics, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics Diseases, Second Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Institute of Geriatrics, Beijing, China",1,

Here, we summarized the composition of pathogens in fever clinic patients and analyzed the characteristics of different respiratory viral infections. Methods: Retrospectively collected patients with definite etiological results using nasal and pharyngeal swabs in a fever clinic. Results: Overall, 1860 patients were screened, and 136 patients were enrolled. 72 (52.94%) of them were diagnosed as influenza (Flu) A virus infection. 32 (23.53%) of them were diagnosed as Flu B virus infection. 18 (13.24%) and 14 (10.29%) of them were diagnosed as COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections, respectively. The COVID-19 group had a higher rate of contact with the epidemic area within 14 days and of clustering onset than other groups. Fever was the most common symptom in these patients. The ratio of fever to the highest temperature was higher in Flu A virus infection patients than in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients had a lower white blood cell count and neutrophil count than Flu A virus and RSV infection groups, but higher lymphocyte count than Flu A and B virus infection groups. The COVID-19 group (83.33%) had a higher rate of pneumonia in chest CT scans than Flu A and B virus infection groups. Conclusions: Influenza viruses accounted for a large proportion of respiratory virus infection even during the epidemic of COVID-19 in Beijing. No single symptom or laboratory finding was suggestive of a specific respiratory virus; however, epidemic history was significant for the screening of COVID-19.","Characteristics of respiratory virus infection during the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus in Beijing","NL",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","http://www.elsevier.com/journals/international-journal-of-infectious-diseases/1201-9712/open-access-journal","1201-9712","Elsevier","EN","International Journal of Infectious Diseases","2020-05-23T05:26:56","Department of Emergency Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China",,

The highest number of MERS-CoV cases are from Saudi-Arabia, the major worldwide hotspot for this disease. In the absence of neither effective treatment nor a ready-to-use vaccine and with yet an incomplete understanding of its epidemiological cycle, prevention and containment measures can be derived from mathematical models of disease epidemiology. We constructed 2-strain models to predict past outbreaks in the interval 2012-2016 and derive key epidemiological information for Macca, Madina and Riyadh. We approached variability in infection through three different disease incidence functions capturing social behavior in response to an epidemic (e.g. Bilinear, BL; Non-monotone, NM; and Saturated, SAT models). The best model combination successfully anticipated the total number of MERS-CoV clinical cases for the 2015-2016 season and accurately predicted both the number of cases at the peak of seasonal incidence and the overall shape of the epidemic cycle. The evolution in the basic reproduction number (R0) warns that MERS-CoV may easily take an epidemic form. The best model correctly captures this feature, indicating a high epidemic risk (1?R0?2,5) in Riyadh and Macca and confirming the alleged co-circulation of more than one strain. Accurate predictions of the future MERS-CoV peak week, as well as the number of cases at the peak are now possible.

METHODS:A retrospective analysis on daily viral positive tests and daily ED visits and hospitalizations between 01/01/2003 to 31/12/2013 in Ontario, Canada. Viral data was collected from the Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Infectious Diseases (CIRID). The Canadian Institute for Health Information reports daily ED visits and hospitalizations for RTIs, COPD and asthma as a primary diagnosis. RESULTS:There were 4,365,578 ED visits with RTIs of which 321,719 (7.4%) were admitted to hospital; 817,141 ED visits for COPD of which 260,665 (31.9%) were admitted and 649,666 ED visits with asthma of which 68,626 (10.6%) were admitted. The percentage of positive tests to influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza and adenovirus prevalence explained 57.4% of ED visits and 63.8% of hospitalizations for RTI, 41.4% of ED visits and 39.2% of hospitalizations with COPD but only 1.5% of ED visits and 2.7% of hospitalizations for asthma. The further addition of human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus and coronavirus over the final 3 years accounted for 66.7% of ED visits and 74.4% of hospitalizations for RTI, 52.5% of visits and 48.2% of hospitalizations for COPD, and only 13.3% of visits and 10.4% of hospitalizations for asthma.

Detailed clinical data, chest HRCT basic performances and certain signs were recorded Ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping were quantified. Both clinical types and CT stages were evaluated. Results: Most patients (approximately 90%) were classified as common type and with epidemiologic history. Fever and cough were main symptoms. Chest CT showed abnormal attenuation in bilateral multiple lung lobes, distributed in the lower and/or periphery of the lungs (94.98%), with multiple shapes. GGO and vascular enhancement sign were most frequent seen, followed by interlobular septal thickening and air bronchus sign as well as consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping. There were significant differences in most of CT signs between different stage groups. The SpO2 and OI were decreased in stage IV, and the CT score of consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping was significantly lower in stage I (P < 0.05). A weak relevance was between the fibrosis score and the value of PaO2 and SpO2 (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Clinical performances of patients with COVID-19, mostly with epidemiologic history and typical symptoms, were critical valuable in the diagnosis of the COVID-19. While chest HRCT provided the distribution, shape, attenuation and extent of lung lesions, as well as some typical CT signs of COVID-19 pneumonia.

Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity. A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71&#8722;7.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-nCoV infection, and how long they should be maintained. Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020) with a significant low peak value. With travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to Beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14% in Beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction.","Estimation of the Transmission Risk of the 2019-nCoV and Its Implication for Public Health Interventions","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcm/about","2077-0383","MDPI AG","EN","Journal of Clinical Medicine","2020-03-02T12:59:57","The Interdisciplinary Research Center for Mathematics and Life Sciences, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an 710049, China",1,

We simulated the future trajectory of the epidemic under current conditions, projected the impact of policy interventions, and analyzed the implications for healthcare capacity. Methods Our study was based on the first month of publicly accessible data on new confirmed daily cases. A susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered (SEIR) model for COVID-19 was employed to compare the current dynamics of the disease with those predicted under various scenarios. Results The fitted model for the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Bali indicated an effective reproduction number of 1.4. Interventions have decreased the possible maximum number of cases from 71 125 on day 86 to 22 340 on day 119, and have prolonged the doubling time from about 9 days to 21 days. This corresponds to an approximately 30% reduction in transmissions from cases of mild infections. There will be 2780 available hospital beds, and at the peak (on day 132), the number of severe cases is estimated to be roughly 6105. Of these cases, 1831 will need intensive care unit (ICU) beds, whereas the number of currently available ICU beds is roughly 446.

Methods: Network centrality metrics were used to characterize hospital-acquired Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (HA-MERS) outbreaks in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between 2012 and 2016. Covariate-adjusted multivariable logistic regression models were applied to assess the effect of individual level risk factors and network level metrics associated with increase in length of hospital stay and risk of deaths from MERS. Results: About 27% of MERS cases were hospital acquired during the study period. The median age of healthcare workers and hospitalized patients were 35 years and 63 years, respectively, Although HA-MERS were more connected, we found no significant difference in degree centrality metrics between HA-MERS and non-HA-MERS cases. Pre-existing medical conditions (adjusted Odds ratio (aOR) = 2.43, 95% confidence interval: (CI) [1.11–5.33]) and hospitalized patients (aOR = 29.99, 95% CI [1.80–48.65]) were the strongest risk predictors of death from MERS. The risk of death associated with 1-day increased length of stay was significantly higher for patients with comorbidities. Conclusion: Our investigation also revealed that patients with an HA-MERS infection experienced a significantly longer hospital stay and were more likely to die from the disease. Healthcare worker should be reminded of their potential role as hubs for pathogens because of their proximity to and regular interaction with infected patients. On the other hand, this study has shown that while healthcare workers acted as epidemic attenuators, hospitalized patients played the role of an epidemic amplifier.

(MERS-CoV) first reported in Saudi Arabia in September 2012. MERS later spread to other countries
in the Arabian Peninsula, followed by an outbreak in South Korea in 2015. At least 26 countries
have reported MERS cases, and these numbers may increase over time. Due to international
travel opportunities, all countries are at risk of imported cases of MERS, even if outbreaks do not
spread globally. Therefore, it is essential for emergency department (ED) personnel to be able to
rapidly assess MERS risk and take immediate actions if indicated. The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I)
tool, originally conceived for initial detection and management of Ebola virus disease patients in the
ED and later adjusted for measles, can be adapted for real-time use for any emerging infectious
disease. This paper reports a modification of the 3I tool for use in initial detection and management
of patients under investigation for MERS. Following an assessment of epidemiologic risk factors,
including travel to countries with current MERS transmission and contact with patients with confirmed
MERS within 14 days, patients are risk stratified by type of exposure coupled with symptoms of fever
and respiratory illness. If criteria are met, patients must be immediately placed into airborne infection
isolation (or a private room until this type of isolation is available) and the emergency practitioner
must alert the hospital infection prevention and control team and the local public health department.
The 3I tool will facilitate rapid categorization and triggering of appropriate time-sensitive actions for

PED is not notifiable to the EU or World Organisation for Animal Health listed but it is notifiable at the national level in Finland, France, Ireland and Sweden. PED case reports from seven countries and PED surveillance and monitoring activities in thirteen countries were reported. This information was combined with an extensive literature review to provide an update on global PED occurrence, circulating strains and impact in 2014–2015. PED confirmed cases have been reported in North America, South America, Asia and Europe. PED virus (PEDV) sequences originating from EU pig herds indicate that the strains currently in circulation share nearly 100% sequence identity and have greater than 99% sequence identity with the reference INDEL (insertion/deletion) strain USA/OH851/2014. In 2014–2015, greater genetic variability has been reported in strains circulating in Asia compared with EU Member States and a non?INDEL strain has been detected in the Ukraine in 2014. Data on impact confirms that mortality is higher in suckling piglets and diarrhoea is observed in all age groups. The reported impact is in agreement with that reported in EFSA AHAW Panel (2014) indicating that the impact of recently reported PED outbreaks in Asia and the USA seems to be more severe than that described in EU countries, although the impact of different PEDV strains is difficult to compare between one country and another, as impact is dependent not only on pathogenicity but also on factors such as biosecurity, herd size, farm management, sanitary status or herd immune status.","Collection and review of updated scientific epidemiological data on porcine epidemic diarrhoea","IT",1,"CC BY-ND","CC BY-ND","https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/18314732/aims-and-scope/read-full-aims-and-scope","1831-4732","Wiley","EN","EFSA Journal ","2019-08-19T11:35:27",,,

In the US, the first PEDV outbreaks occurred in 2013 and since then US PEDV strains have quickly spread throughout the US and worldwide, causing significant economic and public health concerns. Currently two conditionally approved vaccines exist in the US, but there is no live attenuated vaccine, which is considered the best option in controlling PEDV by inducing transferrable mucosal immunity to susceptible neonatal piglets. In this study, we passaged an US PEDV isolate under various conditions to generate three strains and characterized their growth and antigenicity in cell culture using various assays including Western blot analysis, serum neutralization assay, sequencing analysis and confocal microscopy. Finally, these strains were evaluated for pathogenicity in nursing piglets (1–4 days old). Results One of the PEDV strains generated in this study (designated as PEDV 8aa) is able to replicate in cells without any protease and grows to a high titer of >8 log10 TCID50/ml in cell culture. Interestingly, replication of PEDV 8aa was severely reduced by trypsin and this correlated with the inhibition of virus attachment and entry into the cells. In neonatal nursing piglets, PEDV 8aa (passage number 70 or 105) was found to be fully attenuated with limited virus shedding. Conclusions These results suggest that applying selective pressure during viral passages can facilitate attainment of viral attenuation and that PEDV 8aa warrants further investigation as an attenuated vaccine.","Trypsin-independent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus US strain with altered virus entry mechanism","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/about","1746-6148","BMC","EN","BMC Veterinary Research","2018-11-26T10:53:49","Diagnostic Medicine and pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State University",1,

Methods: A self-administered questionnaire was designed based on modifications of related questionnaires, and used to assess levels of stress, professionalism, and nursing intention according to participants' experiences during the outbreak. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between the outbreak nursing experience and nursing intention considering stress and nursing professionalism. Results: The overall stress, professionalism, and nursing intention scores for the firsthand experience group were 33.72, 103.00, and 16.92, respectively, whereas those of the secondhand experience group were 32.25, 98.99, and 15.60, respectively. There were significant differences in professionalism and nursing intention scores between the groups (p?=?.001 and p?<?.001, respectively). The regression analysis revealed that the regression estimate between stress and nursing intention was B(SE) = ?0.08(0.02), beta = ?0.21, p < .001 and the regression estimate between professionalism in nursing and nursing intention was B(SE) = 0.05(0.01), beta = 0.23, p < .001. Conclusion: Prior outbreak nursing experience was importantly associated with intention to provide care for patients with a newly emerging infectious disease in the future considering stress and professionalism. Gathering information about nurses' experience of epidemics and regular assessment of job stress and professionalism are required.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was first recognized in September 2012 in Saudi Arabia. The clinical presentations of MERS and non-MERS SARI are often similar. Therefore, the identification of suspected cases that may have higher chances of being diagnosed as cases of MERS-CoV is essential. However, the real challenge is to flag these patients through some demographic markers. The nature of these markers has not previously been investigated in Saudi Arabia, and hence, this study aims to identify them. Methods. It was a surveillance system-based study, for which data from a total of 23,646 suspected patients in Riyadh and Al Qassim regions were analyzed from January 2017 until December 2017 to estimate the prevalence of MERS-CoV among suspected cases and to determine potential demographic risk factors related to the confirmation of the diagnosis. Results. Of 23,646 suspected cases, 119 (0.5%) were confirmed by laboratory results. These confirmed cases (67.2% of which were males) had a mean age of 43.23 years (SD?±?22.8). Around 42.2% of the confirmed cases were aged between 41 and 60 years and about 47% of confirmed cases had their suspected specimen tested in the summer. The study identified three significant and independent predictors for confirmation of the disease: an age between 41 and 60 years, male gender, and summer season admission. Conclusion. The study provides evidence that the MERS-CoV epidemic in the subject regions has specific characteristics that might help future plans for the prevention and management of such a contagious disease. Future studies should aim to confirm such findings in other regions of Saudi Arabia as well and explore potential preventable risk factors.","Demographic Variations of MERS-CoV Infection among Suspected and Confirmed Cases: An Epidemiological Analysis of Laboratory-Based Data from Riyadh Regional Laboratory","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/guidelines/","2314-6133","Hindawi Limited","EN","BioMed Research International","2020-03-01T07:32:56","College of Public Health and Health Informatics, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",1,

In order to control the spread of an epidemic, the effective management of rapidly increased medical waste through establishing a temporary reverse logistics system is of vital importance. However, no research has been conducted with the focus on the design of an epidemic reverse logistics network for dealing with medical waste during epidemic outbreaks, which, if improperly treated, may accelerate disease spread and pose a significant risk for both medical staffs and patients. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel multi-objective multi-period mixed integer program for reverse logistics network design in epidemic outbreaks, which aims at determining the best locations of temporary facilities and the transportation strategies for effective management of the exponentially increased medical waste within a very short period. The application of the model is illustrated with a case study based on the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. Even though the uncertainty of the future COVID-19 spread tendency is very high at the time of this research, several general policy recommendations can still be obtained based on computational experiments and quantitative analyses. Among other insights, the results suggest installing temporary incinerators may be an effective solution for managing the tremendous increase of medical waste during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, but the location selection of these temporary incinerators is of significant importance. Due to the limitation on available data and knowledge at present stage, more real-world information are needed to assess the effectiveness of the current solution.","Reverse Logistics Network Design for Effective Management of Medical Waste in Epidemic Outbreaks: Insights from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in Wuhan (China)","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph/about","1661-7827","MDPI AG","EN","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","2020-03-13T14:14:33","Department of Industrial Engineering, UiT The Arctic University of Norway, Lodve Langesgate 2, 8514 Narvik, Norway",1,

Methods : Nasopharyngeal aspirates were prospectively obtained from 325 children aged 15 years or less from May 2008 to April 2009 and were tested for the presence of 13 respiratory viruses by multiplex real-time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results : Viruses were identified in 270 children (83.1&#37;). Co-infections with ?#242; viruses were observed in 71 patients (26.3 &#37;). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common virus detected (33.2&#37;), followed by human rhinovirus (hRV) (19.1&#37;), influenza virus (Flu A) (16.9&#37;), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (15.4&#37;), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) (8.3&#37;), human bocavirus (hBoV) (8.0&#37;), adenovirus (ADV) (5.8&#37;), and human coronavirus (hCoV) (2.2&#37;). Clinical diagnoses of viral ALRIs were bronchiolitis (37.5&#37;), pneumonia (34.5&#37;), asthma exacerbation (20.9&#37;), and croup (7.1&#37;). Clinical diagnoses of viral bronchiolitis and pneumonia were frequently demonstrated in patients who tested positive for RSV, hRV, hMPV, or Flu A. Flu A and hRV were most commonly identified in children older than 3 years and were the 2 leading causes of asthma exacerbation. hRV C was detected in 14 (4.3&#37;) children, who were significantly older than those infected with hRV A (mean±SD, 4.1±3.5 years vs. 1.7±2.3 years&#59; P&#61;0.009). hBoV was usually detected in young children (2.3±3.4 years) with bronchiolitis and pneumonia.

Four human CoVs (HCoVs), the non-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like HCoVs (namely HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1), are globally endemic and account for a substantial fraction of upper respiratory tract infections. Non-SARS-like CoV can occasionally produce severe diseases in frail subjects but do not cause any major (fatal) epidemics. In contrast, SARS like CoVs (namely SARS-CoV and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV) can cause intense short-lived fatal outbreaks. The current epidemic caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 and its rapid spread globally is of major concern. There is scanty knowledge on the actual pandemic potential of this new SARS-like virus. It might be speculated that SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is grossly underdiagnosed and that the infection is silently spreading across the globe with two consequences: (i) clusters of severe infections among frail subjects could haphazardly occur linked to unrecognized index cases; (ii) the current epidemic could naturally fall into a low-level endemic phase when a significant number of subjects will have developed immunity. Understanding the role of paucisymptomatic subjects and stratifying patients according to the risk of developing severe clinical presentations is pivotal for implementing reasonable measures to contain the infection and to reduce its mortality. Whilst the future evolution of this epidemic remains unpredictable, classic public health strategies must follow rational patterns. The emergence of yet another global epidemic underscores the permanent challenges that infectious diseases pose and underscores the need for global cooperation and preparedness, even during inter-epidemic periods.","Coronavirus infections: Epidemiological, clinical and immunological features and hypotheses","AT",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.cell-stress.com/for-authors/editorial-policies/#copyright","2523-0204","Shared Science Publishers OG","EN","Cell Stress","2020-04-10T07:26:06","Aix-Marseille Univ., Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD), Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Marseille (AP-HM), ME-PHI, 27 boulevard Jean Moulin, 13005 Marseille, France; IHU Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France.",1,

En Argentina, los programas de vigilancia epidemiológica se basan en la detección de antígenos virales por inmunofluorescencia (IF), aunque es bien conocido que los métodos moleculares son más sensibles. El panel respiratorio (PR) FilmArray (PR-FilmArray) es un equipo comercial automatizado de PCR múltiples que detecta 17 virus respiratorios y 3 bacterias, en un sistema cerrado que requiere 5 min de procesamiento y una 1 h de instrumentación. Se evaluó un total de 315 muestras respiratorias de niños menores de 6 años con infecciones respiratorias agudas por IF para 8 virus respiratorios y por RT-PCR para rinovirus. Posteriormente, estas muestras se estudiaron con el PR-FilmArray. La frecuencia de positividad al considerar los 9 virus estudiados por IF y RT-PCR fue del 75 %; por PR-FilmArray fue del 92 %. El porcentaje de acuerdo positivo entre ambas metodologías fue del 70,5 % y el de acuerdo negativo fue del 99,6 % (intervalo de confianza 95 %: 65,5-75,1 y 99,2-99,8, respectivamente). El PR-FilmArray permitió obtener un mayor diagnóstico positivo (97 %) y detectó otros virus, como los coronavirus NL63, 229E, OC43 y HKU1 (10 %) y los bocavirus (18 %). Además, permitió identificar coinfecciones múltiples (39 %) con 2, 3, 4 y hasta 5 virus. Actualmente, la IF continúa siendo el método más utilizado en los países latinoamericanos para el diagnóstico de virus respiratorios por su bajo costo, por su capacidad para procesar un alto número de muestras simultáneamente y porque los resultados de los virus más frecuentes están disponibles en 5 h.

The usefulness of existing approaches for re-purposing range from computational modeling to clinical trials. These are often time-consuming, resource intensive, and prone to failure. Proposed here is a new but simple concept that would capitalize on the opportunity presented by the on-going natural experiment involving the collection of data from epidemiological surveillance screening and diagnostic testing for clinical treatment. The objective would be to also collect for each Covid-19 case the patient's prior usage of existing therapeutic drugs. These drug usage data would be collected for several major test groups - those who test positive for active SARS-CoV-2 infection (using molecular methods) and those who test negative for current infection but also test positive for past infection (using serologic antibody tests). Patients from each of these groups would also be categorized with respect to where they resided on the spectrum of morbidities (from no or mild symptomology to severe). By comparing the distribution of normalized usage data for each drug within each group, drugs that are more associated with particular test groups could be revealed as having potential prophylactic, therapeutic, or contraindicated effects with respect to disease progression. These drugs could then be selected as candidates for further evaluation in fighting Covid-19. Also summarized are some of the numerous attributes, advantages, and limitations of the proposed concept, all pointing to the need for further discussion and evaluation.","Natural experiment concept to accelerate the Re-purposing of existing therapeutics for Covid-19","US",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","https://www.elsevier.com/journals/global-epidemiology/2590-1133/open-access-journal","2590-1133","Elsevier","EN","Global Epidemiology","2020-05-17T05:12:04","Corresponding author.; 1944 Spyglass Dr., Henderson, Nevada, USA",,

The initial outbreak of the pandemic began in December 2019, and it is affecting the human health of the global community. In common with previous pandemics (Influenza H1N1 and SARS-CoV) and the epidemics of Middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, CoVs target bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells. Virus protein ligands (e.g., haemagglutinin or trimeric spike glycoprotein for Influenza and CoV, respectively) interact with cellular receptors, such as (depending on the virus) either sialic acids, Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), or angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Host proteases, e.g., cathepsins, furin, or members of the type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSP) family, such as Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), are involved in virus entry by proteolytically activating virus ligands. Also involved are Toll Like Receptor (TLR) family members, which upregulate anti-viral and pro-inflammatory mediators [interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 and type I and type III Interferons among others], through the activation of Nuclear Factor (NF)-kB. When these events (virus cellular entry and innate immune responses) are uncontrolled, a deleterious systemic response is sometimes encountered in infected patients, leading to the well-described “cytokine storm” and an ensuing multiple organ failure promoted by a downregulation of dendritic cell, macrophage, and T-cell function. We aim to describe how the lung and systemic host innate immune responses affect survival either positively, through downregulating initial viral load, or negatively, by triggering uncontrolled inflammation. An emphasis will be put on host cellular signaling pathways and proteases involved with a view on tackling these therapeutically.","Innate Immune Signaling and Proteolytic Pathways in the Resolution or Exacerbation of SARS-CoV-2 in Covid-19: Key Therapeutic Targets?","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/immunology#about","1664-3224","Frontiers Media S.A.","EN","Frontiers in Immunology","2020-05-28T06:41:08","INSERM UMR1152, Laboratoire d'Excellence Inflamex, Faculté de Médecine, Hôpital Bichat, Université de Paris, Paris, France",1,

Information on the clinical course and prognosis of COVID-19 was not thoroughly described. We described the clinical courses and prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Methods Retrospective case series of COVID-19 patients from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan and Xishui Hospital, Hubei Province, China, up to February 10, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data were collected. The clinical course of survivors and non-survivors were compared. Risk factors for death were analyzed. Results A total of 107 discharged patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The clinical course of COVID-19 presented as a tri-phasic pattern. Week 1 after illness onset was characterized by fever, cough, dyspnea, lymphopenia, and radiological multi-lobar pulmonary infiltrates. In severe cases, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, acute myocardial injury, and adult respiratory distress syndrome were observed. During week 2, in mild cases, fever, cough, and systemic symptoms began to resolve and platelet count rose to normal range, but lymphopenia persisted. In severe cases, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and deteriorating multi-organ dysfunction were dominant. By week 3, mild cases had clinically resolved except for lymphopenia. However, severe cases showed persistent lymphopenia, severe acute respiratory dyspnea syndrome, refractory shock, anuric acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and death. Older age and male sex were independent risk factors for poor outcome of the illness. Conclusions A period of 7–13?days after illness onset is the critical stage in the COVID-19 course. Age and male gender were independent risk factors for death of COVID-19.","Clinical course and outcome of 107 patients infected with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, discharged from two hospitals in Wuhan, China","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/copyright","1364-8535","BMC","EN","Critical Care","2020-05-03T12:17:55","Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University",1,

As of January 2020, cases of 2019-nCoV are continuing to be reported in other Eastern Asian countries as well as in the United States, Europe, Australia, and numerous other countries. An unusually high volume of domestic and international travel corresponding to the beginning of the 2020 Chinese New Year complicated initial identification and containment of infected persons. Due to the rapidly rising number of cases and reported deaths, all countries should be considered at risk of imported 2019-nCoV. Therefore, it is essential for prehospital, clinic, and emergency department personnel to be able to rapidly assess 2019-nCoV risk and take immediate actions if indicated. The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool, originally conceived for the initial detection and management of Ebola virus and later adjusted for other infectious agents, can be adapted for any emerging infectious disease. This paper reports a modification of the 3I Tool for use in the initial detection and management of patients under investigation for 2019-nCoV. After initial assessment for symptoms and epidemiological risk factors, including travel to affected areas and exposure to confirmed 2019-nCoV patients within 14 days, patients are classified in a risk-stratified system. Upon confirmation of a suspected 2019-nCoV case, affected persons must immediately be placed in airborne infection isolation and the appropriate public health agencies notified. This modified 3I Tool will assist emergency and primary care clinicians, as well as out-of-hospital providers, in effectively managing persons with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV.","2019-nCoV: The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool Applied to a Novel Emerging Coronavirus","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://westjem.com/copyright","1936-900X","eScholarship Publishing, University of California","EN","Western Journal of Emergency Medicine","2020-03-25T12:54:57","County of San Diego, Health & Human Services Agency, Emergency Medical Services, San Diego, California",,

As of 12 April 2020, this outbreak has spread to more than 210 countries and territories and caused 108,837 deaths. The development of this outbreak has resulted in the closure of several major cities in the world (such as Wuhan, Daegu, and Manila) to country-wide lockdowns as observed in Italy and Malaysia. This also affects the construction sector as a labor-intensive industry. Force majeure has become one of the critical points of discussion, considering that this provision allows a contract party to hinder from fulfilling its obligations on the grounds that events are beyond a party’s control. Nevertheless, the application of this provision often faces challenges considering that in prior legal cases, the Courts tend to interpret this clause narrowly. Thus, it would be problematic when the force majeure clause does not include an epidemic outbreak as a force majeure event in the contract. This paper aims to explore the potential of the COVID-19 outbreak as a force majeure event in construction contracts. A qualitative approach consisting of two-step interdependent methods was done to highlight the fundamental elements of force majeure and to analyze whether the COVID-19 outbreak constitutes a force majeure event or not. Finally, a decision model was developed to assist the contracting parties in determining the COVID-19 outbreak potential as a force majeure event. This paper contributes since research related to the impacts of epidemic or pandemic outbreaks on the construction industry has not been intensified.","Does the COVID-19 Outbreak Constitute a Force Majeure Event?

The association of the virus spread from the market is supported by the close relation of genome sequences of environmental surface samples with virus samples from earliest patients by phylogenetic analysis. Objectives: To have an insight into the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences reported from India for better understanding on their epidemiology and virulence. Methods: Genome sequences of Indian isolates of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed to understand their phylogeny and divergence with respect to other isolates reported from other countries. Amino acid sequences of individual open reading frames (ORFs) from SARS-CoV-2 Indian isolates were aligned with sequences of isolates reported from other countries to identify the mutations occurred in Indian isolates. Results: Our analysis suggests that Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates are closely related to isolates reported from other parts of the world. Most ORFs are highly conserved; mutations were also detected in some ORFs. We found that most isolates reported from India have key mutations at 614th position of the S protein and 84th position of the ORF 8, which has been reported to be associated with high virulence and high transmission rate. Conclusion: An attempt was made to understand the SARS-CoV-2 virus reported from India. SARS-CoV-2 reported from India was closely similar to other SARS-CoV-2 reported from other parts of the world, which suggests that vaccines and other therapeutic methods generated from other countries might work well in India. In addition, available sequence data suggest that majority of Indian isolates are capable of high transmission and virulence.","Genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates occurring in India: Present scenario","IN",1,"CC BY-NC-SA","CC BY-NC-SA","http://www.ijph.in/aboutus.asp","0019-557X","Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications","EN","Indian Journal of Public Health","2020-06-05T03:19:38",,,

Introduction: Since the outbreak of Coronavirus on December 31, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People’s Republic of China, the number of cases from China that have been imported into more than 180 countries and regions around the world. Objective: The goal of this study is to flatten the curve of new infection, through nosocomial transmission by health care system along with early identification of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. Methods: A Survey was conducted over a period of 35 days. A total of 1709 individuals were screened (647 patients and 1062 patient attendees) coming to emergency Department. The waiting area of Emergency Care was divided into 3 screening zones and a separate second triage is established. The individuals entering are ensured that they are screened at all the 3 zones. Individuals were divided into two Groups after screening: Group A (suspected COVID-19) and Group B (unsuspected COVID-19). In Acute emergencies, the patient was directly treated at second triage. Results: A total of 1709 individuals, 247 in Group A (Suspected COVID-19) and 1462 in Group B (Unsuspected COVID-19). Among 247 individuals, 141 were males and 106 were females. Age ranged from 14-72 years with a mean age of 46.7years. Among 247 individuals (Group A), 81 were patients, of which one case was found to be COVID-19 Positive. Two Health care workers (HCW’s) found to be positive. Conclusion: Challenges from the widespread pandemic underscores the importance of early implementation of a second triage and vigorous screening for all the individuals to minimize the spread of infection, failing which pandemic infection may turn into an epidemic.

Epidemiologic evidence suggests that diabetic subjects are more susceptible to these conditions. However, the prevalence of diabetes in H1N1 and MERS-CoV has not been systematically described. The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of published reports documenting the prevalence of diabetes in H1N1 and MERS-CoV and compare its frequency in the two viral conditions. Meta-analysis for the proportions of subjects with diabetes was carried out in 29 studies for H1N1 (n=92,948) and 9 for MERS-CoV (n=308). Average age of H1N1 patients (36.2±6.0 years) was significantly younger than that of subjects with MERS-CoV (54.3±7.4 years, P&lt;0.05). Compared to MERS-CoV patients, subjects with H1N1 exhibited 3-fold lower frequency of cardiovascular diseases and 2- and 4-fold higher prevalence of obesity and immunosuppression, respectively. The overall prevalence of diabetes in H1N1 was 14.6% (95% CI: 12.3- 17.0%; P&lt;0.001), a 3.6-fold lower than in MERS-CoV (54.4%; 95% CI: 29.4-79.5; P&lt;0.001). The prevalence of diabetes among H1N1 cases from Asia and North America was ~two-fold higher than those from South America and Europe. The prevalence of diabetes in MERS-CoV cases is higher than in H1N1. Regional comparisons suggest that an etiologic role of diabetes in MERS-CoV may exist distinctive from that in H1N1.","Prevalence of diabetes in the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: a systematic review and meta-analysis","IT",1,"CC BY-NC","CC BY-NC","http://www.jphres.org/index.php/jphres/about/submissions#copyrightNotice","2279-9028","PAGEPress Publications","EN","Journal of Public Health Research","2016-12-23T14:30:11","Public Health Risk Sciences Division, Public Health Agency of Canada, Toronto, ON",1,

We then compared the outcome to ongoing surveillance. We used a modified prioritization method developed at the Robert Koch Institute in Germany. In a Delphi process experts scored pathogens according to ten variables. We ranked the pathogens according to the total score and divided them into four priority groups. We then compared the priority groups to self-reported time spent on surveillance by epidemiologists and ongoing programmes for surveillance through mandatory and/or voluntary notifications and for surveillance of typing results. 106 pathogens were scored. The result of the prioritization process was similar to the outcome of the prioritization in Germany. Common pathogens such as calicivirus and Influenza virus as well as blood-borne pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C virus, gastro-intestinal infections such as Campylobacter and Salmonella and vector-borne pathogens such as Borrelia were all in the highest priority group. 63% of time spent by epidemiologists on surveillance was spent on pathogens in the highest priority group and all pathogens in the highest priority group, except for Borrelia and varicella-zoster virus, were under surveillance through notifications. Ten pathogens in the highest priority group (Borrelia, calicivirus, Campylobacter, Echinococcus multilocularis, hepatitis C virus, HIV, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS- and MERS coronavirus, tick-borne encephalitis virus and varicella-zoster virus) did not have any surveillance of typing results. We will evaluate the possibilities of surveillance for the pathogens in the highest priority group where we currently do not have any ongoing surveillance and evaluate the need of surveillance for the pathogens from the low priority group where there is ongoing surveillance in order to focus our work on the pathogens with the highest relevance.","Communicable Diseases Prioritized According to Their Public Health Relevance, Sweden, 2013.","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license","1932-6203","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","EN","PLoS ONE","2016-06-11T05:38:31",,1,

Methods: The present study included a total of 255 pediatric patients aged less than 7 years old
and admitted to the Department of Pediatrics of Rize Training and Research Hospital between
January 2014 and January 2015 with clinical pre-diagnosis of lower  RTI . Nasopharyngeal swab
specimens collected from these patients were tested for viral pathogens by using multiplex  RT-
PCR kit the ResPlex II plus Panel  PRE (Qiagen, Germany).
Results: A total of 212 out of 255 (83.1%) specimens revealed positive for one or more viral
pathogens. The most common detected pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV )
A/B in 110 samples (43.1%), rhinovirus in 51 samples (20.0%), adenovirus in 36 samples
(14.1%), influenzae virus A in 32 samples (12.5%), and coronavirus in 24 samples (9.4%). In
76 samples (29.8%), more than one viral pathogen were detected.  RSV was seen in more than
50% patients in the first 2 years.  RSV was the most common pathogen in each year of the first
5 years but rhinovirus, influenza A and adenovirus were seen more than  RSV after the fifth
year. A total of 95.8% of the viral detections were seen between November and April without
a significant peak amongst these months. The distribution of the pathogens by months of the
year showed no significance.
Conclusions: These findings can contribute to epidemiological data of Turkey. Detection of
the viral pathogens causing lower  RTIs  can be critical in management of the disease, decrease
inappropriate antibiotic treatment, and lower the morbidity and mortality rates in such diseases.","Distribution of respiratory viruses which cause lower respiratory tract infection in pediatric age group","HK",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","http://www.jclmm.com/news/OA.htm","2309-5288"," Journal of Coastal Life Medicine Editorial Office","EN","Journal of Coastal Life Medicine","2015-12-19T00:34:59","Department of Children Health and Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Recep Tayyip Erdogan University, Rize, Turkey",,

This study was conducted to investigate epidemiological factors and patterns related to this disease.Methods: Full details of MERS-CoV cases available on the disease outbreak news section of the World Health Organization official website from January 2013 to November 2016 were retrieved; demographic and clinical information, global distribution status, potential contacts, and probable risk factors for the mortality of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases were extracted and analyzed by following standard statistical methods.Results: Details of 1,094 laboratory-confirmed cases were recorded, including 421 related deaths. Significant differences were observed in the presentation of the disease from year to year, and all studied parameters differed during the years under study (all P-values &lt;0.05). Evaluation of the effects of various potential risk factors of the final outcome (dead/survived) revealed that two factors, namely, the morbid case being native and travel history, are significant based on a unifactorial analysis (P &lt;0.05). From 2013 to 2016, these factors remained important. However, factors that were significant in predicting mortality varied in different years.Conclusion: These findings point to interesting potential dimensions in the dynamic of this disease. Furthermore, effective national and international preparedness plans and actions are essential to prevent, control, and predict such viral outbreaks; improve patient management; and ensure global health security.

Little is known about the public awareness toward the nature or prevention of the disease. The aim of this work was to assess the knowledge of the adult population in Riyadh toward the MERS-CoV.In this cross-sectional survey, a self-administrated questionnaire was distributed to randomly selected participants visiting malls in Riyadh. The questionnaire contained measurable epidemiological and clinical MERS-CoV knowledge level variables and relevant source of information.The study included 676 participants. Mean age was 32.5 (±SD 8.6) years and 353 (47.8%) were males. Almost all participants heard about the corona disease and causative agent. The study showed a fair overall knowledge (66.0%), less knowledge on epidemiological features of the disease (58.3%), and good knowledge (90.7%) on the clinical manifestation of the MERS-CoV. Internet was the major (89.0%) source of disease information, and other sources including health care providers, SMS, television, magazines and books were low rated (all <25%). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis age ?30 years (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.647, 95%CI 1.048–2.584, P = 0.030), male gender (OR = 1.536, 95%CI 1.105–2.134, P = 0.01), and no tertiary education (OR = 1.957, 95%CI 1.264–3.030, P = 0.003) were independent significant predictors of poor epidemiological knowledge.This study concludes that there was inadequate epidemiological knowledge received by the public and the reliance mostly on the clinical manifestations to recognizing the MERS-CoV disease. Comprehensive public health education programs is important to increase awareness of simple epidemiological determinants of the disease is warranted.

The recent nosocomial outbreaks in hospitals in Seoul, Korea and at the National Guard Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia indicate the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV. Currently there are no effective anti-MERS-CoV anti-viral agents or therapeutics and MERS is associated with a high mortality rate (40%) in hospitalised patients. A large proportion of MERS patients who die have a range of pulmonary pathology ranging from pneumonia to adult respiratory distress syndrome with multi-organ failure, compounded by co-morbidities, reflecting a precarious balance of interactions between the host-immune system and MERS-CoV. Whilst we wait for new MERS-CoV specific drugs, therapeutics and vaccines to be developed, there is a need to advance a range of Host-Directed Therapies. A range of HDTs are available, including commonly used drugs with good safety profiles, which could augment host innate and adaptive immune mechanisms to MERS-CoV, modulate excessive inflammation and reduce lung tissue destruction. We discuss the rationale and potential of using Host-Directed Therapies for improving the poor treatment outcomes associated with MERS. Carefully designed randomized controlled trials will be needed to determine whether HDTs could benefit patients with MERS.

A pair of primers (P1 and P4) specific for CDV corresponding to the highly conserved region of the CDV genome were used as a common primer pair in the first-round PCR of the nested PCR. Primers P2 specific for CDV wild-type strains, were used as the forward primer together with the common reverse primer P4 in the second round of nested PCR. Primers P3, P5 specific for CDV wild-type strain or vaccine strain, were used as the forward primer together with the common reverse primer P4+P6 in the second round of nested PCR. A fragment of 177 bp was amplified from vaccine strain genomic RNA, and a fragment of 247 bp from wild-type strain genomic RNA in the RT-nPCR, and two fragments of 247 bp and 177 bp were amplified from the mixed samples of vaccine and wild-type strains. No amplification was achieved for uninfected cells, or cells infected with Newcastle disease virus (NDV), canine parvovirus (CPV), canine coronavirus (CCV), rabies virus (RV), or canine adenovirus (CAV). The RT-nPCR method was used to detect 30 field samples suspected of canine distemper from Heilongjiang and Jilin Provinces, and 51 samples in Shandong province. As a result of 30 samples, were found to be wild-type-like, and 5 to be vaccine-strain-like. The RT-nPCR method can be used to effectively detect and differentiate wild-type CDV-infected dogs from dogs vaccinated with CDV vaccine, and thus can be used in clinical detection and epidemiological surveillance.</p> ","A multiplex reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction for detection and differentiation of wild-type and vaccine strains of canine distemper virus","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/about/policies/license-agreement","1743-422X","BMC","EN","Virology Journal","2010-06-18T00:00:00",,1,

Direct sequence analysis of the pathogen, particularly at a population level, is generally thought to be too cumbersome, technically difficult, and expensive. We present here a novel application of mass spectrometry (MS)-based technology in characterizing viral sequence variations that overcomes these problems, and we apply it retrospectively to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Singapore. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The success rate of the MS-based analysis for detecting SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) sequence variations was determined to be 95% with 75 copies of viral RNA per reaction, which is sufficient to directly analyze both clinical and cultured samples. Analysis of 13 SARS-CoV isolates from the different stages of the Singapore outbreak identified nine sequence variations that could define the molecular relationship between them and pointed to a new, previously unidentified, primary route of introduction of SARS-CoV into the Singapore population. Our direct determination of viral sequence variation from a clinical sample also clarified an unresolved epidemiological link regarding the acquisition of SARS in a German patient. We were also able to detect heterogeneous viral sequences in primary lung tissues, suggesting a possible coevolution of quasispecies of virus within a single host. CONCLUSION: This study has further demonstrated the importance of improving clinical and epidemiological studies of pathogen transmission through the use of genetic analysis and has revealed the MS-based analysis to be a sensitive and accurate method for characterizing SARS-CoV genetic variations in clinical samples. We suggest that this approach should be used routinely during outbreaks of a wide variety of agents, in order to allow the most effective control.","SARS transmission pattern in Singapore reassessed by viral sequence variation analysis.","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/content-license","1549-1277","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","EN","PLoS Medicine","2005-03-05T00:00:00",,1,

The burden is particularly severe in developing countries. Improved understanding of the source of infection, pathways of spread and persistence in communities would be of benefit in devising intervention strategies. Methods: We report epidemiological data obtained through surveillance of respiratory viruses at nine outpatient health facilities within the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System, Kilifi County, coastal Kenya, between January and December 2016. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from individuals of all ages presenting with acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms (up to 15 swabs per week per facility) and screened for 15 respiratory viruses using real-time PCR. Paediatric inpatient surveillance at Kilifi County Hospital for respiratory viruses provided comparative data. Results: Over the year, 5,647 participants were sampled, of which 3,029 (53.7%) were aged <5 years. At least one target respiratory virus was detected in 2,380 (42.2%) of the samples; the most common being rhinovirus 18.6% (1,050), influenza virus 6.9% (390), coronavirus 6.8% (387), parainfluenza virus 6.6% (371), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 3.9% (219) and adenovirus 2.7% (155). Virus detections were higher among <5-year-olds compared to older children and adults (50.3% vs 32.7%, respectively; ?2(1) =177.3, P=0.0001). Frequency of viruses did not differ significantly by facility (?2(8) =13.38, P=0.072). However, prevalence was significantly higher among inpatients than outpatients in <5-year-olds for RSV (22.1% vs 6.0%; ?2(1) = 159.4, P=0.0001), and adenovirus (12.4% vs 4.4%, ?2(1) =56.6, P=0.0001). Conclusions: Respiratory virus infections are common amongst ARI outpatients in this coastal Kenya setting, particularly in young children. Rhinovirus predominance warrants further studies on the health and socio-economic implications. RSV and adenovirus were more commonly associated with severe disease.

ARIs are responsible for at least six percent of the world's disability and death. Viruses are one of the most common agents causing ARIs. Few studies on the viral etiology and clinical characteristics of ARIs have been performed in the northwest region of China, including Gansu Province. METHODS: Clinical and demographic information and throat swabs were collected from 279 patients from January 1st to December 30st, 2011. Multiplex RT-PCR was performed to detect 16 respiratory viral pathogens. RESULTS: 279 patients were admitted for ARIs. The patients aged from 1 month to 12 years, with the median age of 2 years. Of which, 105 (37.6%) were positive for at least one pathogen. A total of 136 respiratory viral pathogens were identified from the 105 patients. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequently detected pathogen (26.5%, 36/136), followed by parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1-3 (22.1%, 30/136), human rhinovirus (HRV) (21.3%, 29/136), human coronavirus (CoV) (10.3%, 14/136) and human adenovirus (HAdV) (9.6%, 13/136). Influenza A (Flu A), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human bocavirus (BoCA) were found 4.4%, 3.7% and 2.2%, respectively. Influenza B (Flu B) and seasonal influenza A H1N1(sH1N1) were not detected. Single-infections were detected in 30.5% (85/279) of cases. RSV was the most common pathogens in patients under 1 year and showed seasonal variation with peaks during winter and spring. CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents data on the epidemiology of viral pathogens associated with ARIs among children in Gansu Province, China. RSV is most frequently detected in our study. The findings could serve as a reference for local CDC in drawing up further plans to prevent and control ARIs.","Viral etiology of acute respiratory infection in Gansu Province, China, 2011.","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license","1932-6203","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","EN","PLoS ONE","2016-06-15T00:32:25",,1,

Background: Emerging infectious diseases are associated with complex linkages within the broader ecosystem. Studying infectious disease among hosts (animals and humans), outside of the context of their environment, ignores the complexity in which hosts interact. We aimed to formulate a framework to study the effect of large livestock movement on the ecology of emerging zoonotic infectious disease in low-income and middle-income countries. Ultimately such a framework could identify points of intervention in livestock movement chains to reduce the risk of emerging diseases. As a test case, we use camel movement and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
Methods: We reviewed grey and peer-reviewed literature on camel husbandry and interviewed key stakeholders in Egypt and Ethiopia involved in public health research, animal husbandry, the camel trade, veterinary services for camels, and physicians. A multidisciplinary team consisting of wildlife biologists, anthropologists, epidemiologists, veterinarians, geographers, modellers, virologists, and health-care professionals from the USA, Egypt, and Ethiopia was assembled to propose the framework.
Findings: A framework has been developed which highlights the associations between the complex linkages within the broader ecosystem: environment (flora, climate, pollution), animals (distribution and density of animals, interaction between humans, domesticated and wildlife animals), and human behavioural systems (socio-cultural and economic structures around animal husbandry and hunting, connectivity including market trade systems).
Interpretation: While there is an emphasis on interdisciplinary cooperation in the area of one health, this type of work has several challenges. A history of interdisciplinary work in zoonotic infectious disease is limited, in part, because of the lack of undergraduate and graduate curricula that provide training. Additionally the large teams required to conduct truly interdisciplinary work require sustained funding and such opportunities are rare.
Funding: None.

The CCoV-I and CCoV-II strains exhibited genetic diversity when compared with reference strains from China and other countries. The 57 CCoV strains exhibited high co-infection rates with canine kobuvirus (CaKV) (33.33%) and canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2) (31.58%). The CCoV prevalence in diarrheic dogs differed significantly with immunization status, regions, seasons, and ages.

COVID-19 is a new viral infection, and is in form of a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA Coronavirus which belongs to an expanded group of viruses which were identified six decades ago. Importantly, the new COVID-19 belongs to the group of SARS-CoV, and it originated in bats but infected humans through smuggled pangolins. At first, the mode of transmission of infection was animal-to-person, but person-to-person and community transmission of the virus has been confirmed in many parts of the world. With an incubation period of between two-fourteen days, signs and symptoms of infection are mild to high respiratory illness; characterized with cough, breathing problems (shortness of breath), high temperature (Fever), tiredness (Fatigue) and nausea. Presently, no vaccines or specific treatment is available for COVID-19, in light of the aforementioned; prevention is the only substantial and less expensive option. With the envisaged explosive community transmission of COVID-19 in the coming weeks in places with limited daily testing, especially in African countries, it is recommended among many that social distancing which includes avoiding any form of contact with people; either through greetings, hugging or shaking of hands and large gatherings, avoid contact with animal items, dead or alive animals, sick and dead people from areas experiencing COVID-19 epidemic, and basic hygienic practices like thorough washing of hands with clean water and antiseptic soap for the duration of at least twenty seconds should be practiced always. However, in the absence of the aforementioned, an alcohol-based hand gel should be used on the hands frequently. Furthermore, health care workers should adhere strictly to the standard preventive measures in areas of heightened COVID-19 epidemic.","COVID-19: An International Public Health Concern","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://cajgh.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cajgh/about/submissions#copyrightNotice","2166-7403","University Library System, University of Pittsburgh","EN","Central Asian Journal of Global Health","2020-04-01T12:17:14","Department of Health Education, School and Community Health Unit, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria",1,

However, genomic data can be poorly informative of transmission events if mutations accumulate too slowly to resolve individual transmission pairs or if there exist multiple pathogens lineages within-host, and there has been little focus on incorporating other types of outbreak data. We present here a methodology that uses contact data for the inference of transmission trees in a statistically rigorous manner, alongside genomic data and temporal data. Contact data is frequently collected in outbreaks of pathogens spread by close contact, including Ebola virus (EBOV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), and routinely used to reconstruct transmission chains. As an improvement over previous, ad-hoc approaches, we developed a probabilistic model that relates a set of contact data to an underlying transmission tree and integrated this in the outbreaker2 inference framework. By analyzing simulated outbreaks under various contact tracing scenarios, we demonstrate that contact data significantly improves our ability to reconstruct transmission trees, even under realistic limitations on the coverage of the contact tracing effort and the amount of non-infectious mixing between cases. Indeed, contact data is equally or more informative than fully sampled whole genome sequence data in certain scenarios. We then use our method to analyze the early stages of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore and describe the range of transmission scenarios consistent with contact data and genetic sequence in a probabilistic manner for the first time. This simple yet flexible model can easily be incorporated into existing tools for outbreak reconstruction and should permit a better integration of genomic and epidemiological data for inferring transmission chains.","Bayesian inference of transmission chains using timing of symptoms, pathogen genomes and contact data.","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/s/content-license","1553-734X","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","EN","PLoS Computational Biology","2019-09-27T05:31:05",,1,

It is important to fore-tell the epidemic lifetime so to decide on timely and remedic actions. These measures include closing borders, schools, suspending community services and commuters. Resuming such curfews depends on the momentum of the outbreak and its rate of decay. Being able to accurately forecast the fate of an epidemic is an extremely important but difficult task. Due to limited knowledge of the novel disease, the high uncertainty involved and the complex societal-political factors that influence the widespread of the new virus, any forecast is anything but reliable. Another factor is the insufficient amount of available data. Data samples are often scarce when an epidemic just started. With only few training samples on hand, finding a forecasting model which offers forecast at the best efforts is a big challenge in machine learning. In the past, three popular methods have been proposed, they include 1) augmenting the existing little data, 2) using a panel selection to pick the best forecasting model from several models, and 3) fine-tuning the parameters of an individual forecasting model for the highest possible accuracy. In this paper, a methodology that embraces these three virtues of data mining from a small dataset is proposed. An experiment that is based on the recent coronavirus outbreak originated from Wuhan is conducted by applying this methodology. It is shown that an optimized forecasting model that is constructed from a new algorithm, namely polynomial neural network with corrective feedback (PNN+cf) is able to make a forecast that has relatively the lowest prediction error. The results showcase that the newly proposed methodology and PNN+cf are useful in generating acceptable forecast upon the critical time of disease outbreak when the samples are far from abundant.","Finding an Accurate Early Forecasting Model from Small Dataset: A Case of 2019-nCoV Novel Coronavirus Outbreak","ES",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.ijimai.org/journal/policies#20","1989-1660","Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (UNIR)","EN","International Journal of Interactive Multimedia and Artificial Intelligence","2020-03-03T08:51:44",,,

Hence, this study aims to explore perceived infection routes, influencing factors, psychosocial changes, and management procedures for COVID-19 infected healthcare workers. Methods This is a cross-sectional, single hospital-based study. We recruited all 105 confirmed COVID-19 healthcare workers in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from February 15 to 29, 2020. All participants completed a validated questionnaire. Electronic consent was obtained from all participants. Perceived causes of infection, infection prevention, control knowledge and behaviour, psychological changes, symptoms and treatment were measured. Results Finally, 103 professional staff with COVID-19 finished the questionnaire and was included (response rate: 98.1%). Of them, 87 cases (84.5%) thought they were infected in working environment in hospital, one (1.0%) thought their infection was due to the laboratory environment, and 5 (4.9%) thought they were infected in daily life or community environment. Swab of throat collection and physical examination were the procedures perceived as most likely causing their infection by nurses and doctors respectively. Forty-three (41.8%) thought their infection was related to protective equipment, utilization of common equipment (masks and gloves). The top three first symptoms displayed before diagnosis were fever (41.8%), lethargy (33.0%) and muscle aches (30.1%). After diagnosis, 88.3% staff experienced psychological stress or emotional changes during their isolation period, only 11.7% had almost no emotional changes. Arbidol (Umifenovir; an anti-influza drug; 69.2%) was the drug most commonly used to target infection in mild and moderate symptoms. Conclusion The main perceived mode of transmission was not maintaining protection when working at a close distance and having intimate contact with infected cases. Positive psychological intervention is necessary.","Perceived infection transmission routes, infection control practices, psychosocial changes, and management of COVID-19 infected healthcare workers in a tertiary acute care hospital in Wuhan: a cross-sectional survey","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/about /license ","2054-9369","BMC","EN","Military Medical Research","2020-05-17T12:19:15","Center for Evidence-Based and Translational Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University",,

Here, we bring to the attention of the scientific and medical community thymoquinone (TQ), a substance unknown to experts in western countries, which holds the promise to help treating people infected with this novel virus: (1) by inhibiting its proliferation, (2) by killing it, (3) by killing the bacteria associated with pneumonia, (4) by its anti-inflammatory and (5) immunomodulatory effect – perhaps acting synergistically, or even as a prophylactic remedy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, due to the volatility of TQ, bioavailability in infected organs, specifically the lungs, is low. This is where nanomedicine is challenged. Nanocarriers targeting the lungs exist and TQ has already been successfully used in nanomedicines targeting different organs, except the lungs. Thus, there is not a long way to go. It was an anecdotal case report that stimulated the investigation of the therapeutic effect of TQ and the derivation of a mechanism for its dual antiviral action, applicable to Covid-19. Furthermore, by exploiting the material published on the antiviral effect of TQ, we compared the antiviral mechanism of TQ with that of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Our analysis indicates that the antiviral action of TQ is similar and most likely superior to that of CQ and HCQ, however, apparently without the adverse effects reported for CQ and HCQ. The broad antiviral spectrum and the mechanism by which TQ presumably neutralizes the new virus, justifies the hypothesis that TQ is effective to treat Covid-19.","Thymoquinone: shield and sword against SARS-CoV-2","US",1,"CC BY-NC-SA","CC BY-NC-SA","https://precisionnanomedicine.com/about","2639-9431","Andover House Inc.","EN","Precision Nanomedicine","2020-05-20T14:16:27",,,

It is extremely important to understand the prevalence and influencing factors of anxiety and depression symptoms in first-line anti-epidemic medical staff and their coping styles for these negative emotions.MethodsA cross-sectional survey was conducted in Gansu (China), with a questionnaire packet which consisted of the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and the simplified coping style questionnaire (SCSQ). A total of 79 doctors and 86 nurses participated in the survey. Correlation analysis was performed to explore the relationship between SAS, SDS, and SCSQ score. A linear regression model was used to determine the influencing factors for anxiety or depression symptoms.ResultsThe prevalence rates of anxiety and depression symptoms among doctors was 11.4% and 45.6%, respectively. History of depression or anxiety (T=-2.644, p= 0.010, 95%CI: -10.514~-1.481) was shown to be a risk factor for anxiety symptoms in doctors, while being male (T=2.970, p=0.004, 95%CI: 2.667~13.521) was a protective factor for depression. The prevalence rate of anxiety and depression symptoms among nurses was 27.9% and 43.0%, respectively. History of depression or anxiety was a common risk factor for anxiety symptoms (T=-3.635, p=0.000, 95%CI: -16.360~-4.789) and depression symptoms (T=-2.835, p=0.005, 95%CI:-18.238~-3.254) in nurses. The results of partial correlation analysis (controlled for gender and history of depression or anxiety) indicated that the total score of positive coping was negatively correlated with the total score of anxiety (r=-0.182, p=0.002) and depression (r=-0.253, p=0.001).ConclusionsThe first-line anti-epidemic medical staff have high anxiety and depression symptoms and adopting positive coping styles will help to improve their negative emotions.","Prevalence and Influencing Factors of Anxiety and Depression Symptoms in the First-Line Medical Staff Fighting Against COVID-19 in Gansu","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/psychiatry#about","1664-0640","Frontiers Media S.A.","EN","Frontiers in Psychiatry","2020-04-29T14:32:13","Department of Psychiatry, Lanzhou University Second Hospital, Lanzhou, China",1,

We found that the distribution of Wuhan&#8217;s migrants is centred in Hubei Province (approximately 75%) at a provincial level, gradually decreasing in the surrounding provinces in layers, with obvious spatial characteristics of circle layers and echelons. The scale of Wuhan&#8217;s migrants, whose origins in Hubei Province give rise to a gradient reduction from east to west within the province, and account for 66% of Wuhan&#8217;s total migrants, are from the surrounding prefectural-level cities of Wuhan. The distribution comprises 94 districts and counties in Hubei Province, and the cumulative percentage of the top 30 districts and counties exceeds 80%. Wuhan&#8217;s migrants have a large proportion of middle-aged and high-risk individuals. Their social characteristics include nuclear family migration (84%), migration with families of 3&#8722;4 members (71%), a rural household registration (85%), and working or doing business (84%) as the main reason for migration. Using a quasi-experimental analysis framework, we found that the size of Wuhan&#8217;s migrants was highly correlated with the daily number of confirmed cases. Furthermore, we compared the epidemic situation in different regions and found that the number of confirmed cases in some provinces and cities in Hubei Province may be underestimated, while the epidemic situation in some regions has increased rapidly.

There is great uncertainty regarding how countries’ characteristics will affect the spread of the epidemic; to date, there are few studies that attempt to predict the spread of the epidemic in African countries. In this paper, we investigate the role of demographic patterns, urbanisation and comorbidities on the possible trajectories of COVID-19 in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal.Methods We use an augmented deterministic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model to predict the true spread of the disease, under the containment measures taken so far. We disaggregate the infected compartment into asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic and severely symptomatic to match observed clinical development of COVID-19. We also account for age structures, urbanisation and comorbidities (HIV, tuberculosis, anaemia).Results In our baseline model, we project that the peak of active cases will occur in July, subject to the effectiveness of policy measures. When accounting for the urbanisation, and factoring in comorbidities, the peak may occur between 2 June and 17 June (Ghana), 22 July and 29 August (Kenya) and, finally, 28 May and 15 June (Senegal). Successful containment policies could lead to lower rates of severe infections. While most cases will be mild, we project in the absence of policies further containing the spread, that between 0.78% and 1.03%, 0.61% and 1.22%, and 0.60% and 0.84% of individuals in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal, respectively, may develop severe symptoms at the time of the peak of the epidemic.Conclusion Compared with Europe, Africa’s younger and rural population may modify the severity of the epidemic. The large youth population may lead to more infections but most of these infections will be asymptomatic or mild, and will probably go undetected. The higher prevalence of underlying conditions must be considered.","The relatively young and rural population may limit the spread and severity of COVID-19 in Africa: a modelling study","GB",1,"CC BY-NC","CC BY-NC","http://gh.bmj.com/pages/wp-content/uploads/sites/58/2018/04/BMJGH_licence_2016.pdf","2059-7908","BMJ Publishing Group","EN","BMJ Global Health","2020-05-27T09:41:14",,,

Since then, PDCoV has subsequently been reported worldwide, causing a high number of neonatal piglet deaths and significant economic losses to the swine industry. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a highly sensitive and specific method for the rapid diagnosis of PDCoV. Results In the present study, a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic method using recombinase polymerase amplification combined with a lateral flow dipstick (LFD-RPA) was developed for rapid and visual detection of PDCoV. The system can be performed under a broad range of temperature conditions from 10 to 37?°C, and the detection of PDCoV can be completed in 10?min at 37?°C. The sensitivity of this assay was 10 times higher than that of conventional PCR with a lower detection limit of 1?×?102 copies/µl of PDCoV. Meanwhile, the LFD-RPA assay specifically amplified PDCoV, while there was no cross-amplification with other swine-associated viruses, including Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), Porcine kobuvirus (PKoV), Foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and Seneca valley virus (SVV). The repeatability of the test results indicated that this assay had good repeatability. In addition, 68 clinical samples (48 fecal swab specimens and 20 intestinal specimens) were further tested by LFD-RPA and RT-PCR assay. The positive rate of LFD-RPA clinical samples was 26.47% higher than that of conventional PCR (23.53%). Conclusions The LFD-RPA assay successfully detected PDCoV in less than 20?min in this study, providing a potentially valuable tool to improve molecular detection for PDCoV and to monitor the outbreak of PDCoV, especially in low-resource areas and laboratories.","Rapid and visual detection of porcine deltacoronavirus by recombinase polymerase amplification combined with a lateral flow dipstick","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/about","1746-6148","BMC","EN","BMC Veterinary Research","2020-05-10T12:14:25","College of Veterinary Medicine, Gansu Agricultural University",1,

On 11 March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. The first instance of the virus in Nigeria was documented on 27 February 2020. This study provides a preliminary epidemiological analysis of the first 45 days of COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria. We estimated the early transmissibility via time-varying reproduction number based on the Bayesian method that incorporates uncertainty in the distribution of serial interval (time interval between symptoms onset in an infected individual and the infector), and adjusted for disease importation. By 11 April 2020, 318 confirmed cases and 10 deaths from COVID-19 have occurred in Nigeria. At day 45, the exponential growth rate was 0.07 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.05–0.10) with a doubling time of 9.84 days (95% CI: 7.28–15.18). Separately for imported cases (travel-related) and local cases, the doubling time was 12.88 days and 2.86 days, respectively. Furthermore, we estimated the reproduction number for each day of the outbreak using a three-weekly window while adjusting for imported cases. The estimated reproduction number was 4.98 (95% CrI: 2.65–8.41) at day 22 (19 March 2020), peaking at 5.61 (95% credible interval (CrI): 3.83–7.88) at day 25 (22 March 2020). The median reproduction number over the study period was 2.71 and the latest value on 11 April 2020, was 1.42 (95% CrI: 1.26–1.58). These 45-day estimates suggested that cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria have been remarkably lower than expected and the preparedness to detect needs to be shifted to stop local transmission.","Early Transmission Dynamics of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Nigeria","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph/about","1660-4601","MDPI AG","EN","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","2020-04-29T00:00:49","Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine, James Cook University, Townsville 4811, Australia",1,

Materials and Methods: A total of 50 fecal swabs were collected from clinically infected domestic dogs of 2-5 months of age, suspected to suffer from CPV infection, from Cairo and Giza Governorates. The samples were subjected to qualitative antigen detection using the rapid test, followed by isolation on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, molecular characterization with partial amplification of VP2 gene using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.

Results: Out of 50 fecal samples, 20 samples were positive (40%) by Rapid CPV/canine coronavirus Ag Test Kit. These positive samples were cultured successfully on MDCK cells. Nine randomly chosen samples out of 30 apparently negative samples were amplified using PCR with primers Hfor and Hrev to yield a typical 630 bp fragment. Then, six randomly chosen samples out of nine were amplified using PCR with primers Pbs and Pbas to yield a typical 427 bp fragment. Sequencing, BLAST analysis and assembly of the two fragments (630 bp and 427 bp) to produce 912 bp fragments, in the six samples, revealed two serotypes CPV-2b and CPV-2c. The obtained strains were submitted to GenBank and given accession numbers MK642272, MK642273, MK642274, MK642275, MK642276, and MK642277. Phylogenetic analysis of the Egyptian strains serotype 2b illustrated that they were closely related to Thailand strains (accession numbers KP715709, KP715694, KP715701, and KP715700); while Egyptian strains serotype 2c was closely related to Thailand strains (accession numbers MH711894 and MH711902), Taiwanese strain (KU244254), Chinese strain (MF467242), and Vietnamese strain (accession number LC216910).

Conclusion: The current research recommends further epidemiological studies to assess the extent of the occurrence of different serotypes of CPV in Egypt and the efficiency of imported and locally produced vaccines in protection against CPV infection.","Genotyping and phylogenetic analysis of canine parvovirus circulating in Egypt","IN",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://veterinaryworld.org/","0972-8988","Veterinary World ","EN","Veterinary World","2020-02-19T14:05:13","Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Veterinary Research Division, National Research Centre, Dokki 12622, Giza, Egypt.",1,

To this date, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to treat SARS-CoV-2 despite its close relation to the SARS-CoV virus that caused a similar epidemic in 2003. Thus, there remains an urgent need for the identification and development of specific antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. To conquer viral infections, the inhibition of proteases essential for proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins is a conventional therapeutic strategy. In order to find novel inhibitors, we computationally screened a compound library of over 606 million compounds for binding at the recently solved crystal structure of the main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) of SARS-CoV-2. A screening of such a vast chemical space for SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors has not been reported before. After shape screening, two docking protocols were applied followed by the determination of molecular descriptors relevant for pharmacokinetics to narrow down the number of initial hits. Next, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to validate the stability of docked binding modes and comprehensively quantify ligand binding energies. After evaluation of potential off-target binding, we report a list of 12 purchasable compounds, with binding affinity to the target protease that is predicted to be more favorable than that of the cocrystallized peptidomimetic compound. In order to quickly advise ongoing therapeutic intervention for patients, we evaluated approved antiviral drugs and other protease inhibitors to provide a list of nine compounds for drug repurposing.

Souls quarantine of the cives-fideles. The exercise of worship in the health emergency from Covid-19 in Italy


ABSTRACT: The Italian government has issued regulatory provisions during the lockdown due to health emergency from Covid-19, in order to prevent the spread of epidemiological outbreaks. These new rules have not fulfilled the agreements made with Catholic Church, specificly article 2 of Agreement 1984, especially about the freedom of management and organization of pastoral activities, and they have imposed serious restrictions on the right to religious freedom too. In particular, in order to avoid gatherings, the emergency rules have suppressed the religious ceremonies, as well as masses and last rites. Only recently the right to exercise worship was partially allowed and on May 7th, 2020, a Protocol was signed with Italian Episcopal Conference for the gradual reopening of the celebrations coram populo. The issue concerns the balance between the right to health and the rights of freedom. The question is whether this balance of rights was correctly applied.

In 2004, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention office in Kenya (CDC Kenya) established the Global Disease Detection Division of which one core component was to support, with other partners, the One Health approach to public health science. After catalytic events such as the global expansion of highly pathogenic H5N1 and the 2006 East African multi-country outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever, CDC Kenya supported key Kenya government institutions including the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries to establish a framework for multi-sectoral collaboration at national and county level and a coordination office referred to as the Zoonotic Disease Unit (ZDU). The ZDU has provided Kenya with an institutional framework to highlight the public health importance of endemic and epidemic zoonoses including RVF, rabies, brucellosis, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, anthrax and other emerging issues such as anti-microbial resistance through capacity building programs, surveillance, workforce development, research, coordinated investigation and outbreak response. This has led to improved outbreak response, and generated data (including discovery of new pathogens) that has informed disease control programs to reduce burden of and enhance preparedness for endemic and epidemic zoonotic diseases, thereby enhancing global health security. Since 2014, the Global Health Security Agenda implemented through CDC Kenya and other partners in the country has provided additional impetus to maintain this effort and Kenya’s achievement now serves as a model for other countries in the region. Significant gaps remain in implementation of the One Health approach at subnational administrative levels; there are sustainability concerns, competing priorities and funding deficiencies.","Successes and challenges of the One Health approach in Kenya over the last decade","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/about","1471-2458","BMC","EN","BMC Public Health","2019-05-13T12:52:48","Division of Global Health Protection, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-Kenya",1,

Here, we identify epidemiological traits of self-limited infections (i.e. infections with an effective reproduction number satisfying [0 < R eff < 1) that correlate with transmissibility. Our analysis is based on a branching process model that permits statistical comparison of both the strength and heterogeneity of transmission for two distinct types of cases. Our approach provides insight into a variety of scenarios, including the transmission of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Arabian peninsula, measles in North America, pre-eradication smallpox in Europe, and human monkeypox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. When applied to chain size data for MERS-CoV transmission before 2014, our method indicates that despite an apparent trend towards improved control, there is not enough statistical evidence to indicate that R eff has declined with time. Meanwhile, chain size data for measles in the United States and Canada reveal statistically significant geographic variation in R eff, suggesting that the timing and coverage of national vaccination programs, as well as contact tracing procedures, may shape the size distribution of observed infection clusters. Infection source data for smallpox suggests that primary cases transmitted more than secondary cases, and provides a quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of control interventions. Human monkeypox, on the other hand, does not show evidence of differential transmission between animals in contact with humans, primary cases, or secondary cases, which assuages the concern that social mixing can amplify transmission by secondary cases. Lastly, we evaluate surveillance requirements for detecting a change in the human-to-human transmission of monkeypox since the cessation of cross-protective smallpox vaccination. Our studies lay the foundation for future investigations regarding how infection source, vaccination status or other putative transmissibility traits may affect self-limited transmission.","Detecting differential transmissibilities that affect the size of self-limited outbreaks.","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/s/content-license","1553-7366","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","EN","PLoS Pathogens","2016-06-10T11:48:16",,1,

Through a combined modelling approach, we estimate the rates of generation of cases along the zoonotic and human-to-human transmission routes and assess their spatiotemporal heterogeneity. We consider all cases notified to WHO from March 2012 to mid-September 2014. We use a stochastic modelling of the time series of case incidence in the Middle East region to estimate time- and space-dependent zoonotic and human-to-human transmission parameters. The model also accounts for possible lack of identification of secondary transmissions among notified cases. This approach is combined with the analysis of imported cases out of the region to assess the rate of underreporting of cases. Out of a total of 32 possible models, based on different parameterisation and scenario considered, the best-fit model is characterised by a large heterogeneity in time and across space for both zoonotic and human-to-human transmission. The variation in time that occurred during Spring 2014 led to a 17-fold and 3-fold increase in the two transmissions, respectively, bringing the reproductive rate to values above 1 during that period for all regions under study. The model suggests that 75% of MERS-CoV cases are secondary cases (human-to-human transmission), which is substantially higher than the 34% of reported cases with an epidemiological link to another case. Overall, estimated reporting rate is 0.26. Our findings show a higher level of spatial heterogeneity in zoonotic transmission compared to human-to-human, highlighting the strong environmental component of the epidemic. Since sporadic introductions are predicted to be a small proportion of notified cases and are responsible for triggering secondary transmissions, a more comprehensive understanding of zoonotic source and path of transmission could be critical to limit the epidemic spread.","Quantifying spatiotemporal heterogeneity of MERS-CoV transmission in the Middle East region: A combined modelling approach","NL",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","http://www.elsevier.com/journals/epidemics/1755-4365/open-access-journal","1755-4365","Elsevier","EN","Epidemics","2016-06-21T03:01:57","Sorbonne Universités, UPMC Univ Paris 06, INSERM, Institut Pierre Louis d’épidémiologie et de Santé Publique (IPLESP UMRS 1136), F75012, 27 rue Chaligny, Paris 75012, France",,

Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, more than 1,300 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections have been reported in Asia, North Africa, and Europe by July 2015. The recent MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak in South Korea quickly became the second largest such outbreak with 186 total cases and 36 deaths in a little more than one month, second only to Saudi Arabia in country-specific number of reported cases.Methods. We use a simple mathematical model, the Richards model, to trace the temporal course of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak. We pinpoint its outbreak turning point and its transmissibility via basic reproduction number R0 in order to ascertain the occurrence of this nosocomial outbreak and how it was quickly brought under control.Results. The estimated outbreak turning point of ti = 23.3 days (95% CI [22.6–24.0]), or 23–24 days after the onset date of the index case on May 11, pinpoints June 3–4 as the time of the turning point or the peak incidence for this outbreak by onset date. R0 is estimated to range between 7.0 and 19.3.Discussion and Conclusion. The turning point of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak occurred around May 27–29, when control measures were quickly implemented after laboratory confirmation of the first cluster of nosocomial infections by the index patient. Furthermore, transmissibility of MERS-CoV in the South Korea outbreak was significantly higher than those reported from past MERS-CoV outbreaks in the Middle East, which is attributable to the nosocomial nature of this outbreak. Our estimate of R0 for the South Korea MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak further highlights the importance and the risk involved in cluster infections and superspreading events in crowded settings such as hospitals. Similar to the 2003 SARS epidemic, outbreaks of infectious diseases with low community transmissibility like MERS-CoV could still occur initially with large clusters of nosocomial infections, but can be quickly and effectively controlled with timely intervention measures.","2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) nosocomial outbreak in South Korea: insights from modeling","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","https://peerj.com/about/policies-and-procedures/#open-access-copyright-policy","2167-8359","PeerJ Inc.","EN","PeerJ","2017-01-19T14:38:17","Department of Public Health and Center for Infectious Disease Education and Research,China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan",1,

A typical clinical feature associated with SARS is pulmonary fibrosis and associated lung failure. In the aftermath of the SARS epidemic, although significant progress towards understanding the underlying molecular mechanism of the infection has been made, a large gap still remains in our knowledge regarding how SARS-CoV interacts with the host cell at the onset of infection. The rapidly changing viral genome adds another variable to this equation. We have focused on a novel concept of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated host-virus interactions in bronchoalveolar stem cells (BASCs) at the onset of infection by correlating the BASC-microRNome with their targets within BASCs and viral genome. This work encompasses miRNA array data analysis, target prediction, and miRNA-mRNA enrichment analysis and develops a complex interaction map among disease-related factors, miRNAs, and BASCs in SARS pathway, which will provide some clues for diagnostic markers to view an overall interplay leading to disease progression. Our observation reveals the BASCs (Sca-1+ CD34+ CD45- Pecam-), a subset of Oct-4+ ACE2+ epithelial colony cells at the broncho-alveolar duct junction, to be the prime target cells of SARS-CoV infection. Upregulated BASC miRNAs-17*, -574-5p, and -214 are co-opted by SARS-CoV to suppress its own replication and evade immune elimination until successful transmission takes place. Viral Nucleocapsid and Spike protein targets seem to co-opt downregulated miR-223 and miR-98 respectively within BASCs to control the various stages of BASC differentiation, activation of inflammatory chemokines, and downregulation of ACE2. All these effectively accounts for a successful viral transmission and replication within BASCs causing continued deterioration of lung tissues and apparent loss of capacity for lung repair. Overall, this investigation reveals another mode of exploitation of cellular miRNA machinery by virus to their own advantage.","MicroRNome analysis unravels the molecular basis of SARS infection in bronchoalveolar stem cells.","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license","1932-6203","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","EN","PLoS ONE","2016-06-14T18:40:38",,1,

This may be circumvented by having the participants collect their own nasal swabs. We compared self- and staff-collected swabs in terms of swabbing quality and detection of viral respiratory pathogens. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a prospective study among employees of our institution during the ARI season 2010/2011 (December-March). Weekly emails were sent to the participants (n?=?84), reminding them to come to the study center in case of new symptoms. The participants self-collected an anterior nasal swab from one nostril, and trained study personnel collected one from the other nostril. The participants self-collected another two swabs (one from each nostril) on a subsequent day. Human ?-actin DNA concentration was determined in the swabs as a quality control. Viral respiratory pathogens were detected by multiplex RT-PCR (Seeplex RV15 kit, Seegene, Eschborn, Germany). Of 84 participants, 56 (67%) reported at least one ARI episode, 18 participants two, and one participant three. Self-swabbing was highly accepted by the participants. The amount of ?-actin DNA per swab was higher in the self- than in the staff-collected swabs (p?=?0.008). ?-actin concentration was lower in the self-swabs collected on day 1 than in those collected on a subsequent day (p<0.0001). A respiratory viral pathogen was detected in 31% (23/75) of staff- and in 35% (26/75) of self-collected swabs (p?=?0.36). With both approaches, the most frequently identified pathogens were human rhinoviruses A/B/C (12/75 swabs, 16%) and human coronavirus OC43 (4/75 swabs, 5%). There was almost perfect agreement between self- and staff-collected swabs in terms of pathogen detection (agreement?=?93%, kappa?=?0.85, p<0.0001).

It was the second largest MERS outbreak. As a result of the outbreak in South Korea, 186 infections were reported, and 36 patients died. At least 16,693 people were isolated with suspicious symptoms. This paper estimates the basic reproduction number of the MERS coronavirus (CoV), using data on the spread of MERS in South Korea. Methods The basic reproduction number of an epidemic is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an infected subject produces over its infectious period in a susceptible and uninfected population. To estimate the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV, we employ data from the 2015 South Korea MERS outbreak and the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, a mathematical model that uses a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Results We fit the model to the epidemic data of the South Korea outbreak minimizing the sum of the squared errors to identify model parameters. Also we derive the basic reproductive number as the terms of the parameters of the SIR model. Then we determine the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV in South Korea in 2015 as 8.0977. It is worth comparing with the basic reproductive number of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa including Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, which had values of 1.5–2.5. Conclusions There was no intervention to control the infection in the early phase of the outbreak, thus the data used here provide the best conditions to evaluate the epidemic characteristics of MERS, such as the basic reproduction number. An evaluation of basic reproduction number using epidemic data could be problematic if there are stochastic fluctuations in the early phase of the outbreak, or if the report is not accurate and there is bias in the data. Such problems are not relevant to this study because the data used here were precisely reported and verified by Korea Hospital Association.","Estimation of basic reproduction number of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) during the outbreak in South Korea, 2015","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/copyright-and-license","1475-925X","BMC","EN","BioMedical Engineering OnLine","2018-08-20T20:10:43","School of Electrical Engineering, Kookmin University",1,

Preparedness efforts are hampered by considerable uncertainty about the nature and intensity of human-to-human transmission, with previous reproduction number estimates ranging from 0.4 to 1.5. Here we synthesize epidemiological data and transmission models for the MERS-CoV outbreak during April–October 2013 to resolve uncertainties in epidemic risk, while considering the impact of observation bias. We match the progression of MERS-CoV cases in 2013 to a dynamic transmission model that incorporates community and hospital compartments, and distinguishes transmission by zoonotic (index) cases and secondary cases. When observation bias is assumed to account for the fact that all reported zoonotic cases are severe, but only ?57% of secondary cases are symptomatic, the average reproduction number of MERS-CoV is estimated to be 0.45 (95% CI:0.29–0.61). Alternatively, if these epidemiological observations are taken at face value, index cases are estimated to transmit substantially more effectively than secondary cases, (Ri = 0.84 (0.58-1.20) vs Rs = 0.36 (0.24–0.51)). In both scenarios the relative contribution of hospital-based transmission is over four times higher than that of community transmission, indicating that disease control should be focused on hospitalized patients.
Adjusting previously published estimates for observation bias confirms a strong support for the average R < 1 in the first stage of the outbreak in 2013 and thus, transmissibility of secondary cases of MERS-CoV remained well below the epidemic threshold. More information on the observation process is needed to clarify whether MERS-CoV is intrinsically weakly transmissible between people or whether existing control measures have contributed meaningfully to reducing the transmissibility of secondary cases. Our results could help evaluate the progression of MERS-CoV in recent months in response to changes in disease surveillance, control interventions, or viral adaptation.","Synthesizing data and models for the spread of MERS-CoV, 2013: Key role of index cases and hospital transmission","NL",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","http://www.elsevier.com/journals/epidemics/1755-4365/open-access-journal","1755-4365","Elsevier","EN","Epidemics","2015-01-28T04:00:53","Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA",,

To investigate the prevalence and genetic evolution of diarrhea-associated viruses responsible for the outbreaks, a total of 2987 field diarrheal samples collected from 168 pig farms in five provinces in Southern China during 2012–2018 were tested. Results Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was most frequently detected virus with prevalence rates between 50.21 and 62.10% in samples, and 96.43% (162/168) in premises, respectively. Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was the second prevalent virus with prevalence rates ranging from 19.62 to 29.19% in samples, and 70.24% (118/168) in premises, respectively. Both transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine rotavirus (PoRV) were detected at low prevalence rates of <?3% in samples and 10.12% in premises. In this study, we identified a newly emerged swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) in diarrheal samples of piglets from Fujian province in Southern China, and the prevalence rate of SADS-CoV was 10.29% (7/68). Co-infections of these diarrhea-associated viruses were common. The most frequent co-infection was PEDV with PDCoV, with an average detection rate of 12.72% (380/2987, ranging from 8.26–17.33%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PEDVs circulating in Southern China during the last 7?years were clustered with the variant strains of PEDV in genotype IIa. The most frequent mutations were present in the collagenase equivalent (COE) and epitope regions of the spike gene of the PEDVs currently circulating in the field. Genetic relationships of PDCoVs were closely related with Chinese strains, other than those present in the USA, South Korea, Thailand and Lao’s public. Conclusions The findings of this study indicated that variant PEDV, PDCoV, and SADS-CoV were leading etiologic agents of porcine diarrhea, and either mono-infections or co-infections of pathogenic enteric CoVs were common in pigs in Southern China during 2012–2018. Thus, significant attention should be paid in order to effectively prevent and control porcine viral diarrhea.","Prevalence and phylogenetic analysis of porcine diarrhea associated viruses in southern China from 2012 to 2018","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/about","1746-6148","BMC","EN","BMC Veterinary Research","2019-12-29T12:10:20","Key Laboratory for Animal Health of Jiangxi Province",1,

However, due to the complex etiology of RTIs, the clinical diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of these infections remain challenging, especially in developing countries.To determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 18 respiratory pathogens, we analyzed 12,502 patients with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) by performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on patient pharyngeal swabs.Samples positive for at least 1 pathogen were obtained from 48.42% of the total patients. Of these pathogen-positive patients, 17.99% were infected with more than 1 pathogen. Of the 18 pathogens analyzed, four were detected with a positive detection rate (PDR) > 5%: influenza A virus (IAV) > respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) >Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) > human coronavirus (HCoV). The pathogens with the 4 highest co-infection rates (CIRs) were as follows: HCoV > human bocavirus (HBoV) > enterovirus (EV) > parainfluenza virus (PIV). The overall positive detection rate (PDR) varied significantly according to patient age, the season and year of detection, and the disease subgroup, but not according to patient sex. The individual PDRs of the pathogens followed 3 types of distributions for patient sex, 4 types of distributions for patient age, 4 types of seasonal distributions, 2 types of seasonal epidemic trends, 4 types of yearly epidemic trends, and different susceptibility distributions in the disease subgroups. Additionally, the overall CIR showed significantly different distributions according to patient sex, patient age, and the disease subgroup, whereas the CIRs of individual pathogens suggested significant preference characteristics.IAV remains the most common pathogen among the pathogens analyzed. More effort should be directed toward the prevention and control of pathogens that show a trend of increasing incidence such as HCoV, human adenovirus (ADV), and RSV. Although clinically distinguishing specific pathogens responsible for RTIs is difficult, the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the various RTI-causing agents could provide clues for clinicians, thereby informing decisions regarding prevention and medication and guiding appropriate public health strategies.","New Epidemiological and Clinical Signatures of 18 Pathogens from Respiratory Tract Infections Based on a 5-Year Study.","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license","1932-6203","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","EN","PLoS ONE","2016-06-10T13:14:02",,1,

It is of crucial importance to estimate the reproductive number (R0) of the novel virus in the early stage of outbreak and make a prediction of daily new cases on the ship. Method: We fitted the reported serial interval (mean and standard deviation) with a gamma distribution and applied “earlyR” package in R to estimate the R0 in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak. We applied “projections” package in R to simulate the plausible cumulative epidemic trajectories and future daily incidence by fitting the data of existing daily incidence, a serial interval distribution, and the estimated R0 into a model based on the assumption that daily incidence obeys approximately Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness. Results: The Maximum-Likelihood (ML) value of R0 was 2.28 for COVID-19 outbreak at the early stage on the ship. The median with 95% confidence interval (CI) of R0 values was 2.28 (2.06–2.52) estimated by the bootstrap resampling method. The probable number of new cases for the next ten days would gradually increase, and the estimated cumulative cases would reach 1514 (1384–1656) at the tenth day in the future. However, if R0 value was reduced by 25% and 50%, the estimated total number of cumulative cases would be reduced to 1081 (981–1177) and 758 (697–817), respectively. Conclusion: The median with 95% CI of R0 of COVID-19 was about 2.28 (2.06–2.52) during the early stage experienced on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The future daily incidence and probable outbreak size is largely dependent on the change of R0. Unless strict infection management and control are taken, our findings indicate the potential of COVID-19 to cause greater outbreak on the ship.

Arafat Rahman Oany,1 Abdullah-Al Emran,1,2 Tahmina Pervin Jyoti3 1Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Life Science Faculty, Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University, Tangail, Bangladesh; 2Translational Research Institute, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia; 3Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering Discipline, Life Science School, Khulna University, Khulna, Bangladesh  Abstract: Human coronavirus (HCoV), a member of Coronaviridae family, is the causative agent of upper respiratory tract infections and &ldquo;atypical pneumonia&rdquo;. Despite severe epidemic outbreaks on several occasions and lack of antiviral drug, not much progress has been made with regard to an epitope-based vaccine designed for HCoV. In this study, a computational approach was adopted to identify a multiepitope vaccine candidate against this virus that could be suitable to trigger a significant immune response. Sequences of the spike proteins were collected from a protein database and analyzed with an in silico tool, to identify the most immunogenic protein. Both T cell immunity and B cell immunity were checked for the peptides to ensure that they had the capacity to induce both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. The peptide sequence from 88&ndash;94 amino acids and the sequence KSSTGFVYF were found as the most potential B cell and T cell epitopes, respectively. Furthermore, conservancy analysis was also done using in silico tools and showed a conservancy of 64.29% for all epitopes. The peptide sequence could interact with as many as 16 human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) and showed high cumulative population coverage, ranging from 75.68% to 90.73%. The epitope was further tested for binding against the HLA molecules, using in silico docking techniques, to verify the binding cleft epitope interaction. The allergenicity of the epitopes was also evaluated. This computational study of design of an epitope-based peptide vaccine against HCoVs allows us to determine novel peptide antigen targets in spike proteins on intuitive grounds, albeit the preliminary results thereof require validation by in vitro and in vivo experiments.

OBJECTIVES:  The objective of this study is to describe the epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory changes, and outcomes of viral pneumonia caused by influenza and the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections.
METHODS:  In a retrospective cohort study, the medical records of all patients diagnosed with viral pneumonia at Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during the period from January 2012 to December 2015 were screened. Cases who were > 18 years old and were confirmed by a respiratory viral panel to have viral pneumonia either MERS-CoV or influenza viruses were included in the analysis. Sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were extracted from patients' medical files. The data were analyzed descriptively and inferentially to identify the predictors of poor outcome.
RESULTS:  A total of 448 patients with confirmed viral pneumonia were included, of those, 216 (48.2%) were caused by influenza A (non H1N1)/influenza B, 150 (33.5%) by H1N1, and 82 (18.3%) by MERS-CoV. The majority of patients presented with fever (82%), shortness of breath (64%), and flu-like symptoms (54.9%), particularly in MERS-CoV infected cases (92%). The peak incidence of viral pneumonia was in early spring and autumn. The mortality rate was 13.8%, and it was significantly higher among MERS-CoV cases. The predictors of death were age > 65 years, male gender, and associated comorbidities particularly diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney diseases. The number of comorbid illnesses was directly related to the increase in mortality in this group of patients.
CONCLUSION:  Viral pneumonia caused by influenza and MERS-CoV carries a high mortality rate, particularly among MERS-CoV infected cases. Old age, male gender, and comorbid illnesses are predictors of poor outcome. Routine testing for newly emergent viruses is warranted for adults who have been hospitalized with pneumonia.","Characteristics and outcome of viral pneumonia caused by influenza and Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus infections: A 4-year experience from a tertiary care center","IN",1,"CC BY-NC-SA","CC BY-NC-SA","http://www.thoracicmedicine.org/aboutus.asp","1817-1737","Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications","EN","Annals of Thoracic Medicine","2019-07-05T06:30:48",,,

Since 2010, the Thailand Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) and US CDC have conducted surveillance to detect known and new etiologies of severe pneumonia. Methods Surveillance for severe community-acquired pneumonia was initiated in December 2010 among 30 hospitals in 17 provinces covering all regions of Thailand. Interlinked clinical, laboratory, pathological and epidemiological components of the network were created with specialized guidelines for each to aid case investigation and notification. Severe pneumonia was defined as chest-radiograph confirmed pneumonia of unknown etiology in a patient hospitalized ?48?h and requiring intubation with ventilator support or who died within 48?h after hospitalization; patients with underlying chronic pulmonary or neurological disease were excluded. Respiratory and pathological specimens were tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for nine viruses, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and 14 bacteria. Cases were reported via a secure web-based system. Results Of specimens from 972 cases available for testing during December 2010 through December 2015, 589 (60.6%) had a potential etiology identified; 399 (67.8%) were from children aged <?5?years. At least one viral agent was detected in 394 (40.5%) cases, with the most common of single vial pathogen detected being respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (110/589, 18.7%) especially in children under 5 years. Bacterial pathogens were detected in 341 cases of which 67 cases had apparent mixed infections. The system added MERS-CoV testing in September 2012 as part of Thailand’s outbreak preparedness; no cases were identified from the 767 samples tested. Conclusions Enhanced surveillance improved the understanding of the etiology of severe pneumonia cases and improved the MOPH’s preparedness and response capacity for emerging respiratory pathogens in Thailand thereby enhanced global health security. Guidelines for investigation of severe pneumonia from this project were incorporated into surveillance and research activities within Thailand and shared for adaption by other countries.","Enhanced surveillance for severe pneumonia, Thailand 2010–2015","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/about","1471-2458","BMC","EN","BMC Public Health","2019-05-13T12:52:50","Division of Global Health Protection, Thailand Ministry of Public Health–US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Collaboration",1,

However, the shortage of testing services to detect infected persons makes this approach subject to error due to its underdetection of early cases in the U.S. Our new approach overcomes this limitation and provides data supporting the public policy decisions intended to combat the spread of COVID-19 epidemic. Methods We used Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data documenting the daily new and cumulative cases of confirmed COVID-19 in the U.S. from January 22 to April 6, 2020, and reconstructed the epidemic using a 5-parameter logistic growth model. We fitted our model to data from a 2-week window (i.e., from March 21 to April 4, approximately one incubation period) during which large-scale testing was being conducted. With parameters obtained from this modeling, we reconstructed and predicted the growth of the epidemic and evaluated the extent and potential effects of underdetection. Results The data fit the model satisfactorily. The estimated daily growth rate was 16.8% overall with 95% CI: [15.95, 17.76%], suggesting a doubling period of 4?days. Based on the modeling result, the tipping point at which new cases will begin to decline will be on April 7th, 2020, with a peak of 32,860 new cases on that day. By the end of the epidemic, at least 792,548 (95% CI: [789,162, 795,934]) will be infected in the U.S. Based on our model, a total of 12,029 cases were not detected between January 22 (when the first case was detected in the U.S.) and April 4. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate the utility of a 5-parameter logistic growth model with reliable data that comes from a specified period during which governmental interventions were appropriately implemented. Beyond informing public health decision-making, our model adds a tool for more faithfully capturing the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic.","Reconstructing and forecasting the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States using a 5-parameter logistic growth model","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://ghrp.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/copyright","2397-0642","BMC","EN","Global Health Research and Policy","2020-05-17T12:25:30","School of Social Work, University of North Carolina",1,

The generations of the epidemic spread are not well known, yet these are critical parameters to facilitate an understanding of the epidemic. A seafood wholesale market and Wuhan city, China, were recognized as the primary and secondary epidemic sources. Human movements nationwide from the two epidemic sources revealed the characteristics of the first-generation and second-generation spreads of the COVID-19 epidemic, as well as the potential third-generation spread. Methods: We used spatiotemporal data of COVID-19 cases in mainland China and two categories of location-based service (LBS) data of mobile devices from the primary and secondary epidemic sources to calculate Pearson correlation coefficient,r, and spatial stratified heterogeneity, q, statistics. Results: Two categories of device trajectories had generally significant correlations and determinant powers of the epidemic spread. Bothr and q statistics decreased with distance from the epidemic sources and their associations changed with time. At the beginning of the epidemic, the mixed first-generation and second-generation spreads appeared in most cities with confirmed cases. They strongly interacted to enhance the epidemic in Hubei province and the trend was also significant in the provinces adjacent to Hubei. The third-generation spread started in Wuhan from January 17–20, 2020, and in Hubei from January 23–24. No obvious third-generation spread was detected outside Hubei. Conclusions: The findings provide important foundations to quantify the effect of human movement on epidemic spread and inform ongoing control strategies. The spatiotemporal association between the epidemic spread and human movements from the primary and secondary epidemic sources indicates a transfer from second to third generations of the infection. Urgent control measures include preventing the potential third-generation spread in mainland China, eliminating it in Hubei, and reducing the interaction influence of first-generation and second-generation spreads.","First, second and potential third generation spreads of the COVID-19 epidemic in mainland China: an early exploratory study incorporating location-based service data of mobile devices","NL",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","http://www.elsevier.com/journals/international-journal-of-infectious-diseases/1201-9712/open-access-journal","1201-9712","Elsevier","EN","International Journal of Infectious Diseases","2020-06-06T05:20:51","School of Geography and Environment, Jiangxi Normal University, No. 99, Ziyang Rd., Nanchang 330022, China; State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, No. 11A Datun Rd., Chaoyang District, Beijing 100101, China",,

The paper also describes a premature baby with reverse transcription (RT)-PCR-positive COVID-19 seen at the Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK.Design We conducted a multifaceted search of the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, Medline and PubMed from 1 December 2019 to 12 May 2020 to harvest articles from medical journals and publications reporting cases of COVID-19 in neonates from anywhere in the world. Additional searches were also done so as not to miss any important publications. Write-up was in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, the protocol for the review was registered with International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), and risk of bias was analysed with the Newcastle-Ottawa tool. Additionally, the preterm neonate with COVID-19 from our hospital is also reported.Results The systematic review has revealed eight studies where neonates have been described to have confirmed COVID-19, with low risk of bias. Of the 10 reported cases elsewhere, only three are likely to be vertically transmitted, while seven occurred in the postperinatal period and are likely to have been postnatally acquired. All neonates had a mild course, recovered fully and were negative on retesting. Our case of COVID-19 in a 32-week premature baby from the UK was delivered by emergency caesarean section, with the mother wearing a face mask and the family having no contact with the neonate, suggesting vertical transmission. On day 33, the neonate was asymptomatic but was still RT-PCR-positive on nasopharyngeal airway swab.Conclusions Neonatal infection is uncommon, with only two previously reported cases likely to be of vertical transmission. The case we report is still RT-PCR-positive on day 28 and is asymptomatic.

Methods: According to the official data released by the National Health Commission, the epidemic data of infected people from 0:00 on January 24, 2020 to 24:00 on February 23, 2020 were quantitatively analyzed through statistical analysis. We used EXCEL software to draw the overall epidemic trend chart and Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) to carry out descriptive statistical analysis of mortality and cure rate. We made qualitative analysis on the emergency measures implemented by national administrative departments and provincial governments to work on controlling and monitoring COVID-19 nationwide spread.
Results: The number of patients diagnosed showed a linear increasing trend, with the slope increasing first and decreasing later. Suspected and new cases showed an inverted V pattern, with the peak occurring on February 8 and 12, respectively. There was a linear increase in the number of deaths and an exponential increase in the number of cures. Over the 31-day study period, the mortality rate fluctuated between 2.0% and 3.4%. The mean cure rate was 10.03%, the minimum value was 1.33%, and the maximum value was 32.05%. The quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that the public health emergency response system constructed in China plays a significant role in controlling the epidemic in a certain period of time.
Discussion: The four-tier emergency management system and the joint prevention mechanism established in China have provided various resources to control the epidemic, but there are still weakness in dealing with the spread of COVID-19. It is suggested to improve and strengthen the emergency management system, public health service system, health legal system, citizen health education, and international exchange and cooperation.","COVID-19 Epidemic and Public Health Measures in China","NL",1,"CC BY-NC","CC BY-NC","https://www.atlantis-press.com/journals/jegh/publishing-info#copyright-and-end-user-license","2210-6006","Atlantis Press","EN","Journal of Epidemiology and Global Health","2020-04-28T13:27:07",,,

While China—where the outbreak started—seems to have been able to contain the growth of the epidemic, different outbreaks are nowadays present in multiple countries. Nonetheless, authorities have taken action and implemented containment measures, even if not everything is known. Methods To facilitate this task, we have studied the effect of different containment strategies that can be put into effect. Our work referred initially to the situation in Spain as of February 28, 2020, where a few dozens of cases had been detected, but has been updated to match the current situation as of 13 April. We implemented an SEIR metapopulation model that allows tracing explicitly the spatial spread of the disease through data-driven stochastic simulations. Results Our results are in line with the most recent recommendations from the World Health Organization, namely, that the best strategy is the early detection and isolation of individuals with symptoms, followed by interventions and public recommendations aimed at reducing the transmissibility of the disease, which, although might not be sufficient for disease eradication, would produce as a second order effect a delay of several days in the raise of the number of infected cases. Conclusions Many quantitative aspects of the natural history of the disease are still unknown, such as the amount of possible asymptomatic spreading or the role of age in both the susceptibility and mortality of the disease. However, preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be ready for quick and efficacious deployment globally. The scenarios evaluated here through data-driven simulations indicate that measures aimed at reducing individuals’ flow are much less effective than others intended for early case identification and isolation. Therefore, resources should be directed towards detecting as many and as fast as possible the new cases and isolate them.","Evaluation of the potential incidence of COVID-19 and effectiveness of containment measures in Spain: a data-driven approach","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/copyright-and-license","1741-7015","BMC","EN","BMC Medicine","2020-05-31T12:24:52","ISI Foundation",1,

A novel coronavirus was eventually identified, and became the COVID-19 epidemic that affected public health and life. We investigated the psychological status and behavior changes of the general public in China from January 30 to February 3, 2020. Methods Respondents were recruited via social media (WeChat) and completed an online questionnaire. We used the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Self-rating Depression Scale, and Symptom Checklist-90 to evaluate psychological status. We also investigated respondents’ behavior changes. Quantitative data were analyzed by t-tests or analysis of variance, and classified data were analyzed with chi-square tests. Results In total, 608 valid questionnaires were obtained. More respondents had state anxiety than trait anxiety (15.8% vs 4.0%). Depression was found among 27.1% of respondents and 7.7% had psychological abnormalities. About 10.1% of respondents suffered from phobia. Our analysis of the relationship between subgroup characteristics and psychological status showed that age, gender, knowledge about COVID-19, degree of worry about epidemiological infection, and confidence about overcoming the outbreak significantly influenced psychological status. Around 93.3% of respondents avoided going to public places and almost all respondents reduced Spring Festival-related activities. At least 70.9% of respondents chose to take three or more preventive measures to avoid infection. The three most commonly used prevention measures were making fewer trips outside and avoiding contact (98.0%), wearing a mask (83.7%), and hand hygiene (82.4%). Conclusions We need to pay more attention to public psychological stress, especially among young people, as they are likely to experience anxiety, depression, and psychological abnormalities. Different psychological interventions could be formulated according to the psychological characteristics of different gender and age groups. The majority of respondents followed specific behaviors required by the authorities, but it will take time to observe the effects of these behaviors on the epidemic.","Psychological status and behavior changes of the public during the COVID-19 epidemic in China","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/copyright-and-license","2049-9957","BMC","EN","Infectious Diseases of Poverty","2020-05-31T12:35:52","Department of Infectious Diseases, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University",1,

The lack of COVID-19 testing capacity threatens the ability of both the United States (US) and low middle income countries (LMIC) to respond to this growing threat, The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness through participant self-assessment of a rapid response team (RRT) mobile laboratory curriculum Methods: We conducted a pre and post survey for the purpose of a process improvement assessment in Angola, involving 32 individuals. The survey was performed before and after a 14-day training workshop held in Luanda, Angola, in December 2019. A paired t-test was used to identify any significant change on six 7-point Likert scale questions with ?< 0.05 (95% confidence interval). Results: All six of the questions – 1) “I feel confident managing a real laboratory sample test for Ebola or other highly contagious sample;” 2) “I feel safe working in the lab environment during a real scenario;” 3) “I feel as if I can appropriately manage a potentially highly contagious laboratory sample;” 4)“I feel that I can interpret a positive or negative sample during a suspected contagious outbreak;” 5) “I understand basic Biobubble/mobile laboratory concepts and procedures;” and 6) “I understand polymerase chain reaction (PCR) principles” – showed statistical significant change pre and post training. Additionally, the final two questions – “I can more effectively perform my role/position because of the training I received during this course;” and “This training was valuable” – received high scores on the Likert scale. Conclusion: This Angolan RRT mobile laboratory training curriculum provides the nation of Angola with the confidence to rapidly respond and test at the national level a highly infectious contagion in the region and perform on-scene diagnostics. This mobile RRT laboratory provides a mobile and rapid diagnostic resource when epidemic/pandemic resource allocation may need to be prioritized based on confirmed disease prevalence.","Assessment of the Angolan (CHERRT) Mobile Laboratory Curriculum for Disaster and Pandemic Response","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://westjem.com/copyright","1936-900X","eScholarship Publishing, University of California","EN","Western Journal of Emergency Medicine","2020-05-18T19:05:54","Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia",,

The objectives of this study were to find out if it was possible to prevent, or delay, the local outbreaks of COVID-19 through restrictions on travel from abroad and if the virus has already established in-country transmission, to what extent would its impact be mitigated through quarantine of symptomatic patients?
Methods: These questions were addressed in the context of India, using simple mathematical models of infectious disease transmission. While there remained important uncertainties in the natural history of COVID-19, using hypothetical epidemic curves, some key findings were illustrated that appeared insensitive to model assumptions, as well as highlighting critical data gaps.
Results: It was assumed that symptomatic quarantine would identify and quarantine 50 per cent of symptomatic individuals within three days of developing symptoms. In an optimistic scenario of the basic reproduction number (R0) being 1.5, and asymptomatic infections lacking any infectiousness, such measures would reduce the cumulative incidence by 62 per cent. In the pessimistic scenario of R0=4, and asymptomatic infections being half as infectious as symptomatic, this projected impact falls to two per cent.
Interpretation & conclusions: Port-of-entry-based entry screening of travellers with suggestive clinical features and from COVID-19-affected countries, would achieve modest delays in the introduction of the virus into the community. Acting alone, however, such measures would be insufficient to delay the outbreak by weeks or longer. Once the virus establishes transmission within the community, quarantine of symptomatics may have a meaningful impact on disease burden. Model projections are subject to substantial uncertainty and can be further refined as more is understood about the natural history of infection of this novel virus. As a public health measure, health system and community preparedness would be critical to control any impending spread of COVID-19 in the country.","Prudent public health intervention strategies to control the coronavirus disease 2019 transmission in India: A mathematical model-based approach","IN",1,"CC BY-NC-SA","CC BY-NC-SA","http://www.ijmr.org.in/aboutus.asp","0971-5916","Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications","EN","Indian Journal of Medical Research","2020-05-19T11:31:52",,,

However, these measures may interfere in the normal medical service. We sought to model the trend of COVID-19 and estimate the restoration of operational capability of metropolitan medical service in China. Methods Real-time data of COVID-19 and population mobility data were extracted from open sources. SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) and neural network models (NNs) were built to model disease trends in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Combined with public transportation data, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was used to estimate the accumulated demands for nonlocal hospitalization during the epidemic period in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Results The number of infected people and deaths would increase by 45% and 567% respectively, given that the government only has implemented traffic control in Wuhan without additional medical professionals. The epidemic of Wuhan (measured by cumulative confirmed cases) was predicted to reach turning point at the end of March and end in later April, 2020. The outbreak in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou was predicted to end at the end of March and the medical service could be fully back to normal in middle of April. During the epidemic, the number of nonlocal inpatient hospitalizations decreased by 69.86%, 57.41% and 66.85% in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou respectively. After the end of epidemic, medical centers located in these metropolises may face 58,799 (95% CI 48926–67,232) additional hospitalization needs in the first month. Conclusion The COVID-19 epidemic in China has been effectively contained and medical service across the country is expected to return to normal in April. However, the huge unmet medical needs for other diseases could result in massive migration of patients and their families, bringing tremendous challenges for medical service in major metropolis and disease control for the potential asymptomatic virus carrier.","Modeling the trend of coronavirus disease 2019 and restoration of operational capability of metropolitan medical service in China: a machine learning and mathematical model-based analysis","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://ghrp.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/copyright","2397-0642","BMC","EN","Global Health Research and Policy","2020-05-10T12:21:47","State Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease, Fuwai Hospital, National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College",1,

To investigate the epidemiological and genetic variation of HCoV in Guangzhou, south China, we collected totally 13048 throat and nasal swab specimens from adults and children with fever and acute upper respiratory infection symptoms in Gunazhou, south China between July 2010 and June 2015, and the epidemiological features of HCoV and its species were studied. Specimens were screened for HCoV by real-time RT-PCR, and 7 other common respiratory viruses were tested simultaneously by PCR or real-time PCR. HCoV was detected in 294 cases (2.25%) of the 13048 samples, with most of them inpatients (251 cases, 85.4% of HCoV positive cases) and young children not in nursery (53.06%, 156 out of 294 HCoV positive cases). Four HCoVs, as OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1 were detected prevalent during 2010-2015 in Guangzhou, and among the HCoV positive cases, 60.20% were OC43, 16.67% were 229E, 14.97% were NL63 and 7.82% were HKU1. The month distribution showed that totally HCoV was prevalent in winter, but differences existed in different species. The 5 year distribution of HCoV showed a peak-valley distribution trend, with the detection rate higher in 2011 and 2013 whereas lower in 2010, 2012 and 2014. The age distribution revealed that children (especially those <3 years old) and old people (>50 years) were both high risk groups to be infected by HCoV. Of the 294 HCoV positive patients, 34.69% (101 cases) were co-infected by other common respiratory viruses, and influenza virus was the most common co-infecting virus (30/101, 29.70%). Fifteen HCoV-OC43 positive samples of 2013-2014 were selected for S gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, and the results showed that the 15 strains could be divided into 2 clusters in the phylogenetic tree, 12 strains of which formed a separate cluster that was closer to genotype G found in Malaysia. It was revealed for the first time that genotype B and genotype G of HCoV-OC43 co-circulated and the newly defined genotype G was epidemic as a dominant genotype during 2013-2014 in Guanzhou, south China.","Epidemiology characteristics of human coronaviruses in patients with respiratory infection symptoms and phylogenetic analysis of HCoV-OC43 during 2010-2015 in Guangzhou.","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license","1932-6203","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","EN","PLoS ONE","2018-03-11T05:43:57",,1,

The main microbial agents responsible for ALRTI are either bacterial agents (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Mycoplasma pneumoniae) or viruses (respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, also known as human orthopneumovirus), Myxovirus influenzae, Myxovirus parainfluenzae, adenovirus) [1]. More recently, other viruses (rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, bocavirus) have been implicated in ALRTI; their identification has been facilitated by new molecular biology techniques such as real-time PCR. To our knowledge, these emerging viruses have never been the subject of epidemiologic studies in our country. Résumé: Les infections aiguës des voies respiratoires comptent parmi les principales causes de morbidité et de mortalité chez les enfants. Elles se produisent dans le monde entier et constituent l'un des principaux fardeaux mondiaux des maladies chez les enfants. Le but de cette étude était de déterminer l'étiologie virale des infections respiratoires chez les enfants hospitalisés et âgés de moins de 02 ans.Sur une période d'un an, des aspirations nasales été effectuées chez 117 enfants âgés de 15 jours à 02 ans et hospitalisés pour une maladie respiratoire aiguë. Les échantillons prélevés ont été testés pour la présence de 12 virus respiratoires à l'aide d'une RT-PCR multiplex en temps réel. Des agents pathogènes ont été identifiés chez 97 enfants (82,9 %) et ont été fréquemment observés à l'automne et en hiver. Une co-infection a été observée dans 21,4 % des échantillons. Les pathogènes les plus fréquemment détectés étaient le Virus respiratoire syncytial (VRS, 47,9 %), le rhinovirus humain (hRV, 23,1 %), le métapneumovirus humain (hMPV, 22,2 %).

SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, domestic cats, swine, and rodents. A SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in vulnerable senescent populations, against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoonotic strains that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs. We report the comprehensive investigation of SARS vaccine efficacy in young and senescent mice following homologous and heterologous challenge.Using Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP) expressing the 2003 epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike (S) glycoprotein (VRP-S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the same strain (VRP-N), we demonstrate that VRP-S, but not VRP-N vaccines provide complete short- and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice. To test VRP vaccine efficacy against a heterologous SARS-CoV, we used phylogenetic analyses, synthetic biology, and reverse genetics to construct a chimeric virus (icGDO3-S) encoding a synthetic S glycoprotein gene of the most genetically divergent human strain, GDO3, which clusters among the zoonotic SARS-CoV. icGD03-S replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cells and in the lungs of young and senescent mice, and was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the Urbani strain. Although VRP-S vaccines provided complete short-term protection against heterologous icGD03-S challenge in young mice, only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals. VRP-N vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge, but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of SARS-CoV-challenged mice. VRP-N-induced pathology presented at day 4, peaked around day 7, and persisted through day 14, and was likely mediated by cellular immune responses.This study identifies gaps and challenges in vaccine design for controlling future SARS-CoV zoonosis, especially in vulnerable elderly populations. The availability of a SARS-CoV virus bearing heterologous S glycoproteins provides a robust challenge inoculum for evaluating vaccine efficacy against zoonotic strains, the most likely source of future outbreaks.","Vaccine efficacy in senescent mice challenged with recombinant SARS-CoV bearing epidemic and zoonotic spike variants.","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/content-license","1549-1277","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","EN","PLoS Medicine","2016-06-14T17:31:36",,1,

In the absence of epidemiological data on the reservoir species, patterns of zoonotic transmission have largely been approximated from primary human cases. This study aimed to identify meteorological factors that may increase the risk of primary MERS infections in humans. Methods A case-crossover design was used to identify associations between primary MERS cases and preceding weather conditions within the 2-week incubation period in Saudi Arabia using univariable conditional logistic regression. Cases with symptom onset between January 2015 – December 2017 were obtained from a publicly available line list of human MERS cases maintained by the World Health Organization. The complete case dataset (N?=?1191) was reduced to approximate the cases most likely to represent spillover transmission from camels (N?=?446). Data from meteorological stations closest to the largest city in each province were used to calculate the daily mean, minimum, and maximum temperature (?C), relative humidity (%), wind speed (m/s), and visibility (m). Weather variables were categorized according to strata; temperature and humidity into tertiles, and visibility and wind speed into halves. Results Lowest temperature (Odds Ratio?=?1.27; 95% Confidence Interval?=?1.04–1.56) and humidity (OR?=?1.35; 95% CI?=?1.10–1.65) were associated with increased cases 8–10?days later. High visibility was associated with an increased number of cases 7?days later (OR?=?1.26; 95% CI?=?1.01–1.57), while wind speed also showed statistically significant associations with cases 5–6?days later. Conclusions Results suggest that primary MERS human cases in Saudi Arabia are more likely to occur when conditions are relatively cold and dry. This is similar to seasonal patterns that have been described for other respiratory diseases in temperate climates. It was hypothesized that low visibility would be positively associated with primary cases of MERS, however the opposite relationship was seen. This may reflect behavioural changes in different weather conditions. This analysis provides key initial evidence of an environmental component contributing to the development of primary MERS-CoV infections.","A case-crossover analysis of the impact of weather on primary cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/about","1471-2334","BMC","EN","BMC Infectious Diseases","2019-02-10T12:10:16","Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph",1,

Aim: The Centre for International Public Policy has undertaken a public opinion research in which we tested the opinions of the citizens of Serbia on the coronavirus epidemic. The respondents had the opportunity to express their opinion on measures undertaken by the Serbian Government to combat the virus, to state their trust in the media, as well as the health system in general. In addition, we tested the prevalence of different conspiracy theories among citizens, whether the pandemic gave China a new image in the minds of the people and, most importantly, the level of solidarity among Serbian citizens as well as within the European / international community as a whole.


Methods: In seven days, from 8-15th April 2020, we gathered a convenient sample of N=5989 respondents, which makes this the largest public opinion research project in Serbia on the topic of COVID-19 since the start of the epidemic. The electronic questionnaire consisted of 24 questions of mixed and closed type.


Results: The findings of this research suggest that citizens of Serbia are not afraid of COVID-19, but are nevertheless cautious (86%). The percentage of those willing to consult a doctor when they notice any symptoms lies at 70%. Half of the respondents do not believe in alternative theories regarding the origin of the COVID-19 virus. The majority of the respondents (55%) hold government officials accountable for spreading panic through public speeches and daily public addresses. Moreover, 60% of the respondents do not trust the Serbian media outlets that are currently reporting on the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, over half of the respondents are prepared to report their neighbour when he or she is coming from abroad and violates the obligation to self-isolate. However, mostly due to the significant fines, 65% of the respondents would not report the elderly when they are breaking the limited-movement restriction measures.


Conclusion: As before the epidemic, opinions of the Serbian population on current topics are somewhat polarized. Although the majority of the respondents are cautious, a significant number also believes in conspiracy theories and does not fully trust the information provided by the media or the government.

SARS-CoV-2 began like all new viruses with an ordinary moment when a cluster of patients admitted to a hospital with pneumonia turned out to have a new strain of coronavirus. The virus’s high transmissibility made the epidemic in China turn into a global pandemic with an ongoing daily reporting of new cases and deaths. However, as fast as viruses spread, the detection of pandemics and taking early measures has become much easier due to the advancement of science in today’s world. The early responses and measures adopted by China, such as early reporting and situation monitoring, large-scale surveillance, and preparation of medical facilities and supplies, were all successful in reducing the epidemic in China generally and in the epicenter Wuhan specifically. The purpose of this review is to focus on the effectiveness of the measures taken by the Chinese government to stop COVID-19 spreading by comparing the country’s response to SARS and CO­VID-19 outbreaks, which will provide an example for the communities, health managers, and leaders of countries to follow on how to prepare, detect, and respond to potential outbreaks. Method: For this article, epidemic preparedness and management strategies under comparison were derived from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) frameworks and guidelines. Other data related to COVID-19 and reported cases were taken from more than 25 official public health organization reports and relevant articles using various databases (e.g., Google Scholar, PubMed and Science Direct). Results: Working on developing resilient systems against infectious diseases should be one of the top priorities of any country. China embraced resilience in its battle against COVID-19 and proved its capability to cope with the outbreak crisis. Despite succeeding in altering the course of the outbreak, healthcare experts warned about possible epidemic recurrence and stressed the need for caution as the pandemic is still ongoing and most of the infected cases are presenting with only mild symptoms.","China’s Response to the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Model for Epidemic Preparedness and Management","CH",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","https://www.karger.com/Journal/Guidelines/231997#sec72","2571-726X","Karger Publishers","EN","Dubai Medical Journal","2020-05-27T09:57:33",,,

Camel and bats have been identified as a potential source of virus for disease spread to human. Although, significant information related to MERS-CoV disease, spread, infection, epidemiology, clinical features have been published, A little information is available on the sequence diversity of Spike protein gene. The Spike protein gene plays a significant role in virus attachment to host cells. Recently, the information about recombinant MERS-CoV has been published. So, this work was designed to identify the emergence of any another recombinant virus in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Methods: In this study samples were collected from both human and camels and the Spike protein gene was amplified and sequenced. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of MERS-CoV Spike protein gene were used to analyze the recombination, genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationship with selected sequences from Saudi Arabia. Results: The nucleotide sequence identity ranged from 65.7% to 99.8% among all the samples collected from human and camels from various locations in the Kingdom. The lowest similarity (65.7%) was observed in samples from Madinah and Dammam. The phylogenetic relationship formed different clusters with multiple isolates from various locations. The sample collected from human in Jeddah hospital formed a closed cluster with human samples collected from Buraydah, while camel sample formed a closed cluster with Hufuf isolates. The phylogenetic tree by using Aminoacid sequences formed closed cluster with Dammam, Makkah and Duba isolates. The amino acid sequences variations were observed in 28/35 samples and two unique amino acid sequences variations were observed in all samples analyzed while total 19 nucleotides sequences variations were observed in the Spike protein gene. The minor recombination events were identified in eight different sequences at various hotspots in both human and camel samples using recombination detection programme. Conclusion: The generated information from this study is very valuable and it will be used to design and develop therapeutic compounds and vaccine to control the MERS-CoV disease spread in not only in the Kingdom but also globally.

This is due to the vulnerability of health and economic systems, coupled with the high burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB), and malaria. Here we examine the potential implications of COVID-19 on the control of these major epidemic diseases in Africa. We use current evidence on disease burden of HIV, TB, and malaria, and epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 in Africa, retrieved from the literature. Our analysis shows that the current measures to control COVID-19 neglect important and complex context-specific epidemiological, social, and economic realities in Africa. There is a similarity of clinical features of TB and malaria, with those used to track COVID-19 cases. This coupled with institutional mistrust and misinformation might result in many patients with clinical features similar to those of COVID-19 being hesitant to voluntarily seek care in a formal health facility. Furthermore, most people in productive age in Africa work in the informal sector, and most of those in the formal sector are underemployed. With the current measures to control COVID-19, these populations might face unprecedented difficulties to access essential services, mainly due to reduced ability of patients to support direct and indirect medical costs, and unavailability of transportation means to reach health facilities. Therefore, if not accompanied with appropriate economic and epidemiological considerations, we anticipate that these measures might result in unprecedented difficulties among vulnerable segments of society to access essential services, including antiretroviral and prophylactic drugs among people living with HIV and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, anti-tuberculosis drugs, and curative and preventive treatments for malaria among pregnant women and children. This might increase the propensity of patients taking substandard doses and/or medicines, which has the potential to compromise drug efficacy, and worsen health inequalities in the region. COVID-19 responses at country level should include measures to protect vulnerable and under-served segments of society.","What does the COVID-19 pandemic mean for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria control?","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/copyright-and-license","1348-8945","BMC","EN","Tropical Medicine and Health","2020-05-17T12:28:58","Department of Global Health Policy, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo",1,

The strategy of managing the dental clinics is quite different from that of the medical healthcare clinics, and the key point of the administration of those dental healthcare providers is to focus on the management of outpatient care because they only supply just a little bit of inpatient care service but quite an large amount of outpatient care service. So we think the next step is to make plausible and effective scenarios to protect our dental healthcare staff and patients against corona virus infection during the treatments procedures after the reopening all of our dental clinics. To overcome this harsh condition, the infection prevention and control strategies adopted by the Stomatological Hospital, Southern Medical University were designed to be flexible and could be adjusted promptly according to the national and local governmental orders and latest guidelines released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All these prevention procedures and protocols were customized to fit our own situation and have been updated for several times based on the latest global pandemic reports. After going through the hardest time in the past four months, it’s considered that our COVID-19 prevention rules have been proved to be efficient and work well. Further more, it has made massive progress for the hospital in improving the capability of dealing with this state of emergency, especially by previewing and triaging patients strictly to cut off the possible coronavirus spreading from the original step, enhancing the standard precautions and those specific protocols made for minimizing the droplets, aerosol and contact transmission of COVID-19 indoors. Besides, a daily supervision system was set up as a routine job and a team of qualified infection prevention specialists were assigned to check and report every incorrect details during the whole procedure of dental practice. Meanwhile, the safety and well-being of the public and our medical workers could be also guaranteed through following those detailed prevention scenarios.","Administrative strategy of dental clinic during the epidemic of Corona Virus Disease 2019","CN",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.kqjbfz.com/EN/column/item55.shtml","2096-1456","Editorial Department of Journal of Prevention and Treatment for Stomatological Diseases","ZH","??????","2020-06-04T01:56:53","Stomatological Hospital, Southern Medical University",,

As one of the relevant approaches, the vaccination of risk groups with BCG vaccine has recently been suggested. BCG (Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin) is a live vaccine for tuberculosis , which is used in many countries with a high tuberculosis prevalence and helps preventing childhood tuberculosis, primarily, military disease and tuberculosis meningitis. Whether BCG may be used to increase the protection against COVID-19 is currently a question of debates. The review considers scientific background underlying possible impact of BCG in increased protection against COVID-19.BCG is able of inducing the heterologous and trained immunity, and its capacity to stimulate antiviral immune response has been demonstrated in experimental animals and humans. Our comparison of the dynamics of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in countries with different BCG vaccination policies has demonstrated a milder course of COVID-19 (i.e., a slower increase in disease cases and mortality) in countries where BCG vaccination is mandatory for all children.  However, an association between BCG vaccination and a milder COVID-19 course is not obligatory direct. Other factors that may affect the association, such as the level of virus testing, the rigidity and the speed of quarantine implementation and others are discussed. An important argument against a role of BCG in the protection against COVID-19 is that BCG is given in childhood and may hardly induce long-lasting immunity. Because mandatory BCG vaccination is implemented in countries with high TB burden and because in these countries latent tuberculosis infection is widely spread, we suggest a hypothesis that latent tuberculosis infection may contribute to the maintenance of heterologous/trained antiviral immunity in countries with mandatory BCG vaccination. Four countries have recently initiated clinical trials to investigate whether BCG vaccination can increase the level of protection against COVID-19 in risk groups. The results of these studies, as well as COVID-19 epidemiological modeling will help understanding the impact of BCG in the level of the protection against COVID-19. Performing analogous clinical trials in Russia seems appropriate and scientifically sound.","COVID-19 and BCG vaccine: is there a link?","RU",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://iimmun.ru/index.php/iimm/about/submissions#copyrightNotice","2220-7619","Sankt-Peterburg : NIIÈM imeni Pastera","RU","Infekciâ i Immunitet","2020-05-18T16:28:55","Koltzov Institute of Developmental Biology of Russian Academy of Sciences",,

Knowledge about the pathways and mechanisms of transmission from animals to humans is limited; as of yet, transmission risks have not been quantified. Moreover the divergent sanitary situations and exposures to animals among populations in the Arabian Peninsula, where human primary cases appear to dominate, vs. other regions in the Middle East and Africa, with no reported human clinical cases and where the virus has been detected only in dromedaries), represents huge scientific and health challenges. Here, we have used expert opinion elicitation in order to obtain ideas on relative importance of MERS-CoV risk factors and estimates of transmission risks from various types of contact between humans and dromedaries. Fourteen (14) experts with diverse and extensive experience in MERS-CoV relevant fields were enrolled and completed an online questionnaire that examined pathways based on several scenarios e.g. camels-camels, camels-human, bats/other species to camels/humans and the role of diverse biological substances (milk, urine etc.) and potential fomites.Experts believed that dromedary camels play the largest role in MERS-CoV infection of other dromedaries; however, they also indicated a significant influence of the season (i.e. calving or weaning periods) on transmission risk. All experts thought that MERS-CoV infected dromedaries and asymptomatic humans play the most important role in infection of humans, with bats and other species presenting a possible, but yet undefined, risk. Direct and indirect contact of humans with dromedary camels were identified as the most risky types of contact, when compared to consumption of various camel products, with estimated 'most-likely' incidence risks of at least 22% and 13% for direct and indirect contact, respectively. The results of our study are consistent with available, yet very limited, published data regarding the potential pathways of transmission of MERS-CoV at the animal-human interface.  These results identify key knowledge gaps and highlight the need for more comprehensive, yet focused research to be conducted to better understand transmission.","MERS-CoV at the Animal-Human interface: inputs on exposure pathways from an Expert-Opinion elicitation","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/veterinary-science#about","2297-1769","Frontiers Media S.A.","EN","Frontiers in Veterinary Science","2016-12-22T06:22:57","Institut Pasteur",1,

Patients and methods: Epidemiological analysis was performed on data from all MERS-CoV cases recorded by the Saudi Ministry of Health between June 6, 2013 and May 14, 2014. The frequency of cases and deaths was calculated and adjusted by month, sex, age group, and region. The average monthly temperature and humidity of infected regions throughout the year was also calculated. Results: A total of 425 cases were recorded over the study period. The highest number of cases and deaths occurred between April and May 2014. Disease occurrence among men (260 cases [62%]) was higher than in women (162 cases [38%]), and the case fatality rate was higher for men (52%) than for women (23%). In addition, those in the 45&ndash;59 years and &ge;60 years age groups were most likely to be infected, and the case fatality rate for these people was higher than for other groups. The highest number of cases and deaths were reported in Riyadh (169 cases; 43 deaths), followed by Jeddah (156 cases; 36 deaths) and the Eastern Region (24 cases; 22 deaths). The highest case fatality rate was in the Eastern Region (92%), followed by Medinah (36%) and Najran (33%). MERS-CoV infection actively causes disease in environments with low relative humidity (&lt;20%) and high temperature (15&deg;C&ndash;35&deg;C). Conclusion: MERS-CoV is considered an epidemic in Saudi Arabia. The frequency of cases and deaths is higher among men than women, and those above 45 years of age are most affected. Low relative humidity and high temperature can enhance the spread of this disease in the entire population. Further analytical studies are required to determine the source and mode of infection in Saudi Arabia.

Like the other viruses belonging to the same family of coronaviruses, it can cause from mild flu-like symptoms, such as cold, sore throat, cough and fever, to more severe ones such as pneumonia and breathing difficulties, and it can even lead to death. Since no effective specific drug therapy has been found yet, nor any vaccine capable of limiting the spread of this pathogen, it is important for ways of preventing the spread of this infection to be established. <b>Methods</b>: the purpose of our research was to provide a protocol to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in light of the limited information related to this coronavirus. In detail, we analysed and searched targeted evidence-based guidelines issued in the various countries affected by this epidemic up till now. In addition, we analyzed the recommendations for the prevention and control of other epidemics caused by other pathogens belonging to the same family of coronaviruses or others that present the same mechanisms of transmission. <b>Discussion</b>: general organizational measures regarding the containment and management of the epidemiological emergency of COVID-19 have been imposed by the competent authorities for an adequate and proportionate management of the evolution of the epidemiological situation. The prevention and protection organizational measures therefore aim to minimize the probability of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, measures must also be taken at work to avoid new infections or even the spread of the virus where it has already been present. Furthermore, environmental measures are aimed at reducing the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to individuals through contact with infected subjects, objects, equipment, or contaminated environmental surfaces. <b>Conclusion</b>: protective devices must be used whenever there is potentially close contact with a suspect case, especially when the potentially infected person does not wear a surgical mask that could reduce the spread of viruses in the environment. By adopting this specific prevention and protection measures recommended in the workplace, it will be possible to help overcome this COVID-19 pandemic.","COVID-19 Pandemic: Prevention and Protection Measures to be Adopted at the Workplace","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability/about","2071-1050","MDPI AG","EN","Sustainability","2020-04-30T00:01:48","Department of Health Promotion, Mother and Child Care, Internal Medicine and Medical Specialties “Giuseppe D’Alessandro”, University of Palermo, 90127 Palermo, Italy",1,

The virus causing SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and multiple genomic sequences have been revealed since mid-April, 2003. After a quiet summer and fall in 2003, the newly emerged SARS cases in Asia, particularly the latest cases in China, are reinforcing a wide-spread belief that the SARS epidemic would strike back. With the understanding that SARS-CoV might be with humans for years to come, knowledge of the evolutionary mechanism of the SARS-CoV, including its mutation rate and emergence time, is fundamental to battle this deadly pathogen. To date, the speed at which the deadly virus evolved in nature and the elapsed time before it was transmitted to humans remains poorly understood.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>Sixteen complete genomic sequences with available clinical histories during the SARS outbreak were analyzed. After careful examination of multiple-sequence alignment, 114 single nucleotide variations were identified. To minimize the effects of sequencing errors and additional mutations during the cell culture, three strategies were applied to estimate the mutation rate by 1) using the closely related sequences as background controls; 2) adjusting the divergence time for cell culture; or 3) using the common variants only. The mutation rate in the SARS-CoV genome was estimated to be 0.80 – 2.38 × 10<sup>-3 </sup>nucleotide substitution per site per year which is in the same order of magnitude as other RNA viruses. The non-synonymous and synonymous substitution rates were estimated to be 1.16 – 3.30 × 10<sup>-3 </sup>and 1.67 – 4.67 × 10<sup>-3 </sup>per site per year, respectively. The most recent common ancestor of the 16 sequences was inferred to be present as early as the spring of 2002.</p> <p>Conclusions</p> <p>The estimated mutation rates in the SARS-CoV using multiple strategies were not unusual among coronaviruses and moderate compared to those in other RNA viruses.

In India, an association of Pteropus medius bats with the Nipah virus was reported in the past. It is suspected that the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also has its association with bats. To assess the presence of CoVs in bats, we performed identification and characterization of bat CoV (BtCoV) in P. medius  and Rousettus species from representative States in India, collected during 2018 and 2019.
Methods: Representative rectal swab (RS) and throat swab specimens of Pteropus and Rousettus spp. bats were screened for CoVs using a pan-CoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. A single-step RT-PCR was performed on the RNA extracted from the bat specimens. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on a few representative bat specimens that were tested positive. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out on the partial sequences of RdRp gene sequences retrieved from both the bat species and complete viral genomes recovered from Rousettus spp.
Results: Bat samples from the seven States were screened, and the RS specimens of eight Rousettus spp. and 21 Pteropus spp. were found positive for CoV RdRp gene. Among these, by Sanger sequencing, partial RdRp sequences could be retrieved from three Rousettus and eight Pteropus bat specimens. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial RdRp region demonstrated distinct subclustering of the BtCoV sequences retrieved from these Rousettus and Pteropus spp. bats. NGS led to the recovery of four sequences covering approximately 94.3 per cent of the whole genome of the BtCoVs from Rousettus bats. Three BtCoV sequences had 93.69 per cent identity to CoV BtRt-BetaCoV/GX2018. The fourth BtCoV sequence was 96.8 per cent identical to BtCoV HKU9-1.
Interpretation & conclusions: This study was a step towards understanding the CoV circulation in Indian bats. Detection of potentially pathogenic CoVs in Indian bats stresses the need for enhanced screening for novel viruses in them. One Health approach with collaborative activities by the animal health and human health sectors in these surveillance activities shall be of use to public health. This would help in the development of diagnostic assays for novel viruses with outbreak potential and be useful in disease interventions. Proactive surveillance remains crucial for identifying the emerging novel viruses with epidemic potential and measures for risk mitigation.","Detection of coronaviruses in Pteropus & Rousettus species of bats from different States of India","IN",1,"CC BY-NC-SA","CC BY-NC-SA","http://www.ijmr.org.in/aboutus.asp","0971-5916","Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications","EN","Indian Journal of Medical Research","2020-05-19T11:31:52",,,

Two laws that are penal in nature are now applicable in the current pandemic, namely the Epidemics Diseases Act 1897 and the Indian Penal Code 1860. No act of an endoscopist should be seen to be in contravention of any of the aforementioned laws, and the sections thereunder as provisions of the Indian Penal Code can be attracted in the current scenario for spreading an infectious disease either knowingly (Section 270) or unknowingly or negligently (Section 269). Section 4 of the Epidemics Disease Act 1897 gives legal protection to every person who has acted under this Act or the directions issued under this Act subject to only one condition, that is, the act must have been done in good faith. Though the hospitals are obliged to ensure personal safety of its staff legally, morally and ethically, because of the huge gap in demand and supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), it is advisable to arrange PPE on one’s own to first protect oneself and then, by extension, to prevent the spread to others. The dictum is “take care of yourself.” Self-preservation is a supreme law. In the current COVID-19 pandemic conditions, certain additional information, to be agreed upon by the patient, needs to be incorporated in the consent. It should be incorporated in the consent that: •?While all the necessary precautions are being taken, there is a finite though small risk that the patient may contract the infection from the hospital. •?He/she indemnifies the hospital and the endoscopist against any such liability arising out of any action taken while doing the procedure. •?Furthermore, to protect the patient him/herself, he/she agrees to get the preprocedural test for COVID-19 as well as bear the additional cost of the PPE used by the endoscopist and support staff. Several of those who have undergone an endoscopy would require a follow-up consultation. As it is difficult to have physical interaction, teleconsultation may be done as per the telemedicine practice guidelines issued by the Medical Council of India (MCI).","Being Legally Sound in the COVID-19 Era","IN",1,"CC BY-NC-SA","CC BY-NC-SA","http://www.jdeonline.in/contributors.asp#Copyrights","0976-5042","Thieme Publishers","EN","Journal of Digestive Endoscopy","2020-05-16T22:31:27","Department of Gastroenterology, Max Super Speciality Hospital, New Delhi, India",,

Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. <i>Methods:</i> From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). <i>Results:</i> This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Most respondents spent 20&#8722;24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%). Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <i>Conclusions:</i> During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Immediate Psychological Responses and Associated Factors during the Initial Stage of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Epidemic among the General Population in China","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph/about","1661-7827","MDPI AG","EN","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","2020-03-13T14:14:17","Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Faculty of Education, Huaibei Normal University, Huaibei 235000, China",1,

Influenza epidemic lasted for 12 weeks (weeks 6–17), was of moderate intensity and 10,4% of the population of the country was involved with children aged 0–2 and 3–6 years being the most affected groups as usually. The average hospitalization rate of patients with ILI and ARI was 2,6% and was the highest in infants aged 0–2 years (5,4%). The number of influenzaassociated deaths was two times higher this season compared to 2016–2017 which can be attributed to the circulation of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses that still is the major cause of lethal influenza outcomes in the country. A total 72 759 patients were investigated by RT-PCR in 55 collaborating RBLs. Laboratory confirmed influenza (LCI) was detected in 12 149 (20.7%) cases, of which 39.3% were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, 29.6% were A(H3N2) and 31.1% influenza B (Yamagata lineage) viruses. The first cases of influenza viruses were detected at the very beginning of the season (weeks 40–45.2017), however a distinct increase in the rate of detection was registered only from the week 2.2018 with the peak on the week 13–14.2018 and subsequent gradual decline up to the end of the season. The certain differences in the etiology of morbidity between Federal Districts were registered. The impact of influenza and other ARI agents in different stage of epidemic was determined. In the pre-epidemic period, the incidence growth was occurred mainly due to ARI agents (about 32,7%), especially due to rhinoviruses (RhV) and RSV (10.2 and 8.0% cases, respectively) while LCI were registered in 3.4% only. During the epidemic, the rate of LCI detection increased up to 29.2% at simultaneous decrease in frequency of parainfluenza, adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus and, especially, rhinoviruses, to a lesser extent RSV infection. In the post-epidemic period, the role of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and ? viruses decreased up to 6.1; 6.9 and 3.6%, respectively, with increase of rhinoviruses (9.5% of diseases). Genetic analysis of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses circulating in 2017–2018 season showed that all analyzed viruses by the structure of surface genes encoding antigenic determinants, in difference from influenza B viruses, corresponded to the vaccine strains recommended by WHO for the Northern Hemisphere for 2017–2018 epidemic season. However, significant changes in the internal genes of circulating viruses were revealed. The control of the susceptibility of 316 influenza A and B viruses to antiviral drugs showed that the absolute majority of them (99.7%) retained their susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors.","SUMMARY OF INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES DETECTED AND CHARACTERIZED IN RUSSIA DURING 2017–2018 SEASON","RU",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://iimmun.ru/index.php/iimm/about/submissions#copyrightNotice","2220-7619","Sankt-Peterburg : NIIÈM imeni Pastera","RU","Infekciâ i Immunitet","2019-01-18T08:52:35","Smorodintsev Research Institute of Influenza, St. Petersburg",,

The spike (S) protein is one of the best characterized proteins of SARS-CoV, which plays a key role in SARS-CoV overcoming species barrier and accomplishing interspecies transmission from animals to humans, suggesting that it may be the major target of selective pressure. However, the process of adaptive evolution of S protein and the exact positively selected sites associated with this process remain unknown.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>By investigating the adaptive evolution of S protein, we identified twelve amino acid sites (75, 239, 244, 311, 479, 609, 613, 743, 765, 778, 1148, and 1163) in the S protein under positive selective pressure. Based on phylogenetic tree and epidemiological investigation, SARS outbreak was divided into three epidemic groups: 02–04 interspecies, 03-early-mid, and 03-late epidemic groups in the present study. Positive selection was detected in the first two groups, which represent the course of SARS-CoV interspecies transmission and of viral adaptation to human host, respectively. In contrast, purifying selection was detected in 03-late group. These indicate that S protein experiences variable positive selective pressures before reaching stabilization. A total of 25 sites in 02–04 interspecies epidemic group and 16 sites in 03-early-mid epidemic group were identified under positive selection. The identified sites were different between these two groups except for site 239, which suggests that positively selected sites are changeable between groups. Moreover, it was showed that a larger proportion (24%) of positively selected sites was located in receptor-binding domain (RBD) than in heptad repeat (HR)1-HR2 region in 02–04 interspecies epidemic group (p = 0.0208), and a greater percentage (25%) of these sites occurred in HR1–HR2 region than in RBD in 03-early-mid epidemic group (p = 0.0721). These suggest that functionally different domains of S protein may not experience same positive selection in each epidemic group. In addition, three specific replacements (F360S, T487S and L665S) were only found between 03-human SARS-CoVs and strains from 02–04 interspecies epidemic group, which reveals that selective sweep may also force the evolution of S genes before the jump of SARS-CoVs into human hosts. Since certain residues at these positively selected sites are associated with receptor recognition and/or membrane fusion, they are likely to be the crucial residues for animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoVs, and subsequent adaptation to human hosts.</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>The variation of positive selective pressures and positively selected sites are likely to contribute to the adaptive evolution of S protein from animals to humans.</p> ","Adaptive evolution of the spike gene of SARS coronavirus: changes in positively selected sites in different epidemic groups","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/about","1471-2180","BMC","EN","BMC Microbiology","2006-10-21T00:00:00",,1,

Here we describe efforts to compile and disseminate epidemiological information on COVID-19 from news media and social networks. Methods: In this population-level observational study, we searched DXY.cn, a health-care-oriented social network that is currently streaming news reports on COVID-19 from local and national Chinese health agencies. We compiled a list of individual patients with COVID-19 and daily province-level case counts between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, in China. We also compiled a list of internationally exported cases of COVID-19 from global news media sources (Kyodo News, The Straits Times, and CNN), national governments, and health authorities. We assessed trends in the epidemiology of COVID-19 and studied the outbreak progression across China, assessing delays between symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and reporting, before and after Jan 18, 2020, as awareness of the outbreak increased. All data were made publicly available in real time. Findings: We collected data for 507 patients with COVID-19 reported between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, including 364 from mainland China and 143 from outside of China. 281 (55%) patients were male and the median age was 46 years (IQR 35–60). Few patients (13 [3%]) were younger than 15 years and the age profile of Chinese patients adjusted for baseline demographics confirmed a deficit of infections among children. Across the analysed period, delays between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic were longer in Hubei province than in other provinces in mainland China and internationally. In mainland China, these delays decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter until Jan 31, 2020 (p=0·0009). Although our sample captures only 507 (5·2%) of 9826 patients with COVID-19 reported by official sources during the analysed period, our data align with an official report published by Chinese authorities on Jan 28, 2020. Interpretation: News reports and social media can help reconstruct the progression of an outbreak and provide detailed patient-level data in the context of a health emergency. The availability of a central physician-oriented social network facilitated the compilation of publicly available COVID-19 data in China. As the outbreak progresses, social media and news reports will probably capture a diminishing fraction of COVID-19 cases globally due to reporting fatigue and overwhelmed health-care systems. In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of public datasets is important to encourage analytical efforts by independent teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.

An understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns and influencing factors of the COVID-19 epidemic on multiple scales could benefit the control of the outbreak. Therefore, we used spatial autocorrelation and Spearman’s rank correlation methods to investigate these two topics, respectively. The COVID-19 epidemic data reported publicly and relevant open data in Hubei province were analyzed. The results showed that (1) at both prefecture and county levels, the global spatial autocorrelation was extremely significant for the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases (CCC) in Hubei province from 30 January to 18 February 2020. Further, (2) at both levels, the significant hotspot and cluster/outlier area was observed solely in Wuhan city and most of its districts/sub-cities from 30 January to 18 February 2020. (3) At the prefecture level in Hubei province, the number of CCC had a positive and extremely significant correlation (<i>p </i><<i> </i>0.01) with the registered population (RGP), resident population (RSP), Baidu migration index (BMI), regional gross domestic production (GDP), and total retail sales of consumer goods (TRS), respectively, from 29 January to 18 February 2020 and had a negative and significant correlation (<i>p </i><<i> </i>0.05) with minimum elevation (MINE) from 2 February to 18 February 2020, but no association with the land area (LA), population density (PD), maximum elevation (MAXE), mean elevation (MNE), and range of elevation (RAE) from 23 January to 18 February 2020. (4) At the county level, the number of CCC in Hubei province had a positive and extremely significant correlation (<i>p </i><<i> </i>0.01) with PD, RGP, RSP, GDP, and TRS, respectively, from 27 January to 18 February 2020, and was negatively associated with MINE, MAXE, MNE, and RAE, respectively, from 26 January to 18 February 2020, and negatively associated with LA from 30 January to 18 February 2020. It suggested that (1) the COVID-19 epidemic at both levels in Hubei province had evident characteristics of significant global spatial autocorrelations and significant centralized high-risk outbreaks, and had an extremely significant association with social and economic factors. (2) The COVID-19 epidemics were significantly associated with the natural factors, such as LA, MAXE, MNE, and RAE, -only at the county level, not at the prefecture level, from 2 February to 18 February 2020. (3) The COVID-19 epidemics were significantly related to the socioeconomic factors, such as RGP, RSP, TRS, and GDP, at both levels from 26 January to 18 February 2020. It is desired that this study enrich our understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns and influencing factors of the COVID-19 epidemic and benefit classified prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic for policymakers.","Spatial Statistics and Influencing Factors of the COVID-19 Epidemic at Both Prefecture and County Levels in Hubei Province, China","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph/about","1660-4601","MDPI AG","EN","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","2020-06-01T00:00:50","School of Geography and Tourism, Jiaying University, Meizhou 514015, China",1,

According to the duration from symptom onset to release from quarantine, the patients were divided into the ?20 and &gt;20-day groups, and the similarities and differences between them were compared.Results: Among the 37 patients, five had mild disease, 30 had moderate disease, one had severe disease, and one was critically ill. All of the patients were released from quarantine, and no mortality was observed. The average duration from symptom onset to release from quarantine was 20.2 ± 6.6 days. The average duration from symptom onset to hospitalization was 4.1 ± 3.7 days, and the patients were hospitalized for an average of 16.1 ± 6.2 days. The average age was 44.3 ± 1.67 years, and 78.4% of cases were caused by exposure to a patient with confirmed disease or the workplace of a patient with confirmed disease. The main symptoms were cough (67.6%), fever (62.2%), shortness of breath (32.4%), fatigue (24.3%), sore throat (21.6%), vomiting, and diarrhea (21.6%). White blood cell count was decreased in 27.0% of patients, and lymphocyte count was decreased in 62.2% of the patients, among whom 43.5% patients had counts of ?0.6 × 109/L. On admission, 86.5% of patients showed pneumonia in chest CT scans, including some asymptomatic patients, while 68.8% of patients showed bilateral infiltration. In the &gt;20-day group, the average age was 49.9 ± 1.38 years, and the average duration from symptom onset to hospitalization was 5.5 ± 3.9 days. Compared with the ?20-day group, patients in the &gt;20-day group were older and the duration was longer (P &lt; 0.05). All of the seven asymptomatic patients belonged to the ?20-day group. When the 37 patients were released from quarantine, the white blood cell count of 16.2% of the patients was &lt;4.0 × 109/L, the lymphocyte count of 59.5% of the patients was &lt;1.1 × 109/L, and the absolute counts of white blood cells and lymphocytes were 5.02 ± 1.34 × 109/L and 1.03 ± 0.34 × 109/L, respectively, compared with those recorded on admission (P &gt; 0.05).Conclusion: The majority of COVID-19 cases in the study area were mild and moderate, with good clinical outcomes. There were some special characteristics in the clinical course. The reasons for differences in the duration from symptom onset to release from quarantine were complex. There was no significant change in the number of granulocytes at the time of release from quarantine compared to that at the time of admission.","Clinical Characteristics and Reasons for Differences in Duration From Symptom Onset to Release From Quarantine Among Patients With COVID-19 in Liaocheng, China","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/medicine#about","2296-858X","Frontiers Media S.A.","EN","Frontiers in Medicine","2020-05-12T07:24:35","Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, China",1,

In the autumn of 2019, the organizers of the 2020 Padua Muscle Days planned an intense program, which was to be held from March 18 to March 21, 2020. The program included eight Scientific Sessions to occur over three full days at either Padova University or the Hotel Augustus on Euganei Hills (Padova), Italy. Abruptly, however, in early January the Coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak started in China and changed the world perspectives and expectations. In Italy, it started in Lombardy and Veneto, two main industrial areas of the country with intense connections and interchanges of people and commercial activities with China. Indeed, the virus was first isolated from a couple of Chinese tourists, who inadvertently incubated the infection during their visit to many towns in Italy. Within the following two weeks, the epidemic had the first Italian cases and victims in an area south of Milan and in a Village of the Euganei Hills (Vo Euganeo, Padova). The village was immediately quarantined, but it was too late. The virus had escaped the area. Thus, it was a mandatory, though difficult decision (made even before the Italian National Government posted rules to be followed to decrease spread of the infection), to post-pone the Padua Muscle Days meeting from 18-21 March, 2020 to 25-28 November, 2020. Luckily, the vast majority of organizers, chairs, speakers, and attendees accepted the decision and have assured their presence in late November, despite the coincidence with the Thanksgiving holiday in the US. Currently, the only changes in the program are the new dates; however, it is difficult to forecast the future. Anyhow, the rationale of the decision to post-pone 2020PMD was reinforced by the actions of many organizers of international events. One of the most recent examples is the March 6, 2020 decision of the leaders of the Experimental Biology Host Societies to cancel Experimental Biology (EB) 2020, set to take place April 4–7 in San Diego, California, USA. All these active civil responses to world dangers are mandatory to avoid those military responses that are easy to start, but provide the worst results. How do we not lose half of the 2020 year? The option is to try to achieve some of the goals of the meeting by long-distance communications. Thus, the Collection of Abstracts will be, as originally planned, e-published in this 30(1) 2020 Issue of the European Journal of Translational Myology (EJTM) together with the many EJTM Communications submitted by speakers and attendees of the 2020PMD. We may also start the process that will implement EMMA, the European Mobility Medicine Association, by circulating a proposal and inviting comments.

The recent emergence of this new pathogen, the careful tracing of its transmission patterns, and the ability to propagate in culture allows the exploration of the mutational dynamics of the SARS-CoV in human populations.</p> <p>Methods</p> <p>We sequenced complete SARS-CoV genomes taken from primary human tissues (SIN3408, SIN3725V, SIN3765V), cultured isolates (SIN848, SIN846, SIN842, SIN845, SIN847, SIN849, SIN850, SIN852, SIN3408L), and five consecutive Vero cell passages (SIN2774_P1, SIN2774_P2, SIN2774_P3, SIN2774_P4, SIN2774_P5) arising from SIN2774 isolate. These represented individual patient samples, serial in vitro passages in cell culture, and paired human and cell culture isolates. Employing a refined mutation filtering scheme and constant mutation rate model, the mutation rates were estimated and the possible date of emergence was calculated. Phylogenetic analysis was used to uncover molecular relationships between the isolates.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>Close examination of whole genome sequence of 54 SARS-CoV isolates identified before 14<sup>th </sup>October 2003, including 22 from patients in Singapore, revealed the mutations engendered during human-to-Vero and Vero-to-human transmission as well as in multiple Vero cell passages in order to refine our analysis of human-to-human transmission. Though co-infection by different quasipecies in individual tissue samples is observed, the in vitro mutation rate of the SARS-CoV in Vero cell passage is negligible. The in vivo mutation rate, however, is consistent with estimates of other RNA viruses at approximately 5.7 × 10<sup>-6 </sup>nucleotide substitutions per site per day (0.17 mutations per genome per day), or two mutations per human passage (adjusted R-square = 0.4014). Using the immediate Hotel M contact isolates as roots, we observed that the SARS epidemic has generated four major genetic groups that are geographically associated: two Singapore isolates, one Taiwan isolate, and one North China isolate which appears most closely related to the putative SARS-CoV isolated from a palm civet. Non-synonymous mutations are centered in non-essential ORFs especially in structural and antigenic genes such as the S and M proteins, but these mutations did not distinguish the geographical groupings. However, no non-synonymous mutations were found in the 3CLpro and the polymerase genes.</p> <p>Conclusions</p> <p>Our results show that the SARS-CoV is well adapted to growth in culture and did not appear to undergo specific selection in human populations. We further assessed that the putative origin of the SARS epidemic was in late October 2002 which is consistent with a recent estimate using cases from China. The greater sequence divergence in the structural and antigenic proteins and consistent deletions in the 3' – most portion of the viral genome suggest that certain selection pressures are interacting with the functional nature of these validated and putative ORFs.</p> ","Mutational dynamics of the SARS coronavirus in cell culture and human populations isolated in 2003","GB",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.biomedcentral.com/about","1471-2334","BMC","EN","BMC Infectious Diseases","2004-09-17T00:00:00",,1,

In addition, we had European and Northern American venture capital experts attending and presenting at the conference. The purpose of the conference was to bridge the gap between biotech, pharma and academia regarding drug discovery and development. Its aim primarily was to: (a) bring together world experts on academic drug discovery to discuss and propose new approaches to discover and develop new therapies; (b) establish a permanent platform for scientific exchange between academia and the biotech and pharmaceutical industries; (c) entice national and international investors to consider funding drugs discovered in academia; (d) educate the population about the causes of diseases, approaches to prevent them from happening and their cure; (e) attract talent to consider the drug discovery track for their studies and career. During the conference, we discussed the unique academic drug discovery disrupting business models, which can make their discoveries easily accessible in an open source mode. This unique model accelerates the dissemination of knowledge to all world scientists to guide them in their research. This model is aimed at bringing effective and affordable medicine to all mankind in a very short time. Moreover, the program discussed rare disease targets, orphan drug discovery, immunotherapy discovery and process, the role of bioinformatics in drug discovery, anti-infective drug discovery in the era of bad bugs, natural products as a source of novel drugs and innovative drug formulation and delivery. Additionally, as the conference was organized during the surge of the epidemic, we dedicated the first day (25 February) to coronavirus science, detection and therapy. The day was co-organized with the King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia(KSA) Ministry of Education to announce the grant winner for infectious diseases. Simultaneously, intensive courses were delivered to junior scientists on the principle of drug discovery, immunology and clinical trials, as well as rare diseases. The second therapeutics discovery forum provided a platform for interactive knowledge sharing and the convergence of researchers, governments, pharmaceuticals, biopharmaceuticals, hospitals and non-profit organizations on the topic of academic drug discovery. The event presented showcases on global drug discovery initiatives and demonstrated how collaborations are leading to successful new therapies. In line with the KSA 2030 vision on becoming world leaders with an innovative economy and healthy population, therapeutic discovery is becoming an area of interest to science leaders in the kingdom, and our conference gave us the opportunity to identity key areas of interest as well as potential future collaborations.","KAIMRC’S Second Therapeutics Discovery Conference","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://www.mdpi.com/about/openaccess","2504-3900","MDPI AG","EN","Proceedings","2020-04-30T00:00:42","King Abdullah International Medical Research Centre, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King Abdulaziz Medical City, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh 14611, Saudi Arabia",1,

We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and the number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 24, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view of the lack of suitable data and the uncertainty of the different parameters, namely, the variation of the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time, the initial number of exposed individuals and infected people, the incubation and infectious periods, and the fatality rate. First, we perform an analysis of the results of the model by varying the parameters and initial conditions (in order for the epidemic to start, there should be at least one exposed or one infectious human). Then, we consider the Lombardy case and calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (May 5, 2020) and constrain the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (March 31) approximately, with a reproduction ratio R0 of 3 initially, 1.36 at day 22, and 0.8 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death toll is approximately 15,600 casualties, with 2.7 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit to the dead individuals is 4.25 days, and the infectious period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57%, and it is 2.37% if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initial number of exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47%. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infectious periods, we observe that a higher incubation period (13 vs. 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 vs. 0.57%), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case. Other choices of the set of parameters also provide a good fit to the data, but some of the results may not be realistic. Therefore, an accurate determination of the fatality rate and characteristics of the epidemic is subject to knowledge of the precise bounds of the parameters. Besides the specific example, the analysis proposed in this work shows how isolation measures, social distancing, and knowledge of the diffusion conditions help us to understand the dynamics of the epidemic. Hence, it is important to quantify the process to verify the effectiveness of the lockdown.","A Simulation of a COVID-19 Epidemic Based on a Deterministic SEIR Model","CH",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/public-health#about","2296-2565","Frontiers Media S.A.","EN","Frontiers in Public Health","2020-05-28T06:40:34","National Institute of Oceanography and Applied Geophysics - OGS, Trieste, Italy",1,

A día de hoy ha ocasionado más de 1,7 millones de contagios y más de 100.000 muertes en todo el mundo. La investigación científica actual se centra en el mejor conocimiento de la infección aguda y de sus estrategias terapéuticas. Dada la magnitud de la epidemia, planteamos una revisión especulativa sobre las posibles consecuencias en patología neurológica a medio/largo plazo, con especial atención a enfermedades neurodegenerativas y neuropsiquiátricas con base neuroinflamatoria, teniendo en cuenta la evidencia directa de afectación neurológica a causa de la infección aguda. Desarrollo: Revisamos de forma sistemática lo conocido sobre los mecanismos patogénicos de la infección por SARS-CoV-2, la repercusión de la tormenta de citoquinas sobre el sistema nervioso central y su persistencia en el tiempo y las consecuencias que la neuroinflamación puede tener sobre el sistema nervioso central. Conclusiones: El SARS-CoV-2 es un virus neuroinvasivo capaz de provocar una tormenta de citoquinas que podría convertirse en persistente en población seleccionada. Aunque nuestra hipótesis tiene alto componente especulativo, la repercusión que esta situación puede tener en la puesta en marcha y progresión de enfermedades neurodegenerativas y neuropsiquiátricas con base neuroinflamatoria debe ser considerada como posible germen de una pandemia demorada que podría tener un gran impacto en salud pública a medio o largo plazo. Se hace necesario un estrecho seguimiento de la salud cognitiva y neuropsiquiátrica de los pacientes supervivientes a infección COVID-19. Abstract:  Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has since spread across the world. At present, the virus has infected over 1.7 million people and caused over 100 000 deaths worldwide. Research is currently focused on understanding the acute infection and developing effective treatment strategies. In view of the magnitude of the epidemic, we conducted a speculative review of possible medium- and long-term neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with particular emphasis on neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin, based on the available evidence on neurological symptoms of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Development: We systematically reviewed the available evidence about the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immediate and lasting effects of the cytokine storm on the central nervous system, and the consequences of neuroinflammation for the central nervous system. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 is a neuroinvasive virus capable of triggering a cytokine storm, with persistent effects in specific populations. Although our hypothesis is highly speculative, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the onset and progression of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin should be regarded as the potential cause of a delayed pandemic that may have a major public health impact in the medium to long term. Cognitive and neuropsychological function should be closely monitored in COVID-19 survivors.","Influencia de la infección SARS-CoV-2 sobre enfermedades neurodegenerativas y neuropsiquiátricas: ¿una pandemia demorada?","ES",1,"CC BY-NC-ND","CC BY-NC-ND","https://www.elsevier.com/journals/neurologia/0213-4853/open-access-journal","0213-4853","Elsevier España","ES","Neurología","2020-06-06T05:20:26","Servicio de Neurología, Hospital Regional Universitario de Málaga, Málaga, España; Instituto de Investigación Biomédica de Málaga (IBIMA), Málaga, España; Red Andaluza de Investigación Clínica y Traslacional en Neurología (Neuro-RECA); Autor para correspondencia.",,

En general aquellas que se transmiten de personas y solo por contacto o por el aire son más difíciles de controlar. A continuación, me limito a describir solo algunos ejemplos de epidemias que han ocurrido a través de la historia humana y que probablemente por su impacto sobre la humanidad son más conocidas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La plaga, muerte negra o peste bubónica, la enfermedad causada por una bacteria, la Y. pestis, conocida desde la época de los griegos y romanos, se hizo famosa por la pandemia al final de la edad medieval (siglos XIV) pero posteriormente se presentaron otras nueve pandemias, registrándose la última en 1720. Estas pandemias causaron la muerte de al menos 25 millones de personas (20- 25% de la población europea de ese entonces) y contrario a lo que se piensa, todavía se siguen presentado casos en muchas partes del mundo. Esta pandemia no solo tuvo gran impacto en el sistema de salud, sino que cambió los comportamientos humanos, incluyendo los destierros, la aplicación de las cuarentenas e incluso fue un tema repetido de pintores y escritores relacionándola con la muerte, o dedicados a San Roque, protector contra la peste; cuadros como el del pintor flamenco Pieter Breughel, El triunfo de la muerte, o publicaciones como El Decamerón, El flautista de Hamelin y más recientemente la epidemia en Argel de 1965, que inspiró a Albert Camus para su novela La peste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Otras epidemias famosas han sido causadas por el cólera o cólera nostras o bisuchika mordexim, causada por una bacteria llamada Vibrio cholerae de la cual se tiene noticias de una epidemia en 1503 que afectó a la población asiática. En el siglo XIX se extendió por toda Europa y fue una causa recurrente de mortalidad. Sin embargo, esta enfermedad no desapareció y continúa siendo una causa frecuente de epidemias. En Suramérica, incluyendo Colombia, el último brote fue introducido en 1991.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Más cerca, en 1918, la pandemia de la influenza (gripa española) produjo solo en Estados Unidos 500.000 muertes y mucho más cerca, la pandemia de influenza por la A(H1N1) causó solo en el 2009 cerca de 500.000 muertes y aún sigue circulando, generando muertes adicionales (1). Si a esto le sumamos los casos de otras enfermedades emergentes como síndrome respiratorio agudo severo causados por coronavirus (SARS) en el 2003 o MERS actualmente o el brote de fiebre amarilla (enfermedad reemergente) ocurrido en el 2003-2004 en nuestro país, se puede decir que las enfermedades infecciosas, tanto las emergentes como las reemergentes, lejos de estar controladas, cada vez son un problema creciente de salud pública.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 Miembro Correspondiente.

Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data for Hubei, China from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters. In particular, we provide an estimation of the case fatality and case recovery ratios, along with their 90% confidence intervals as the outbreak evolves. On the basis of a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SIDR) model, we provide estimations of the basic reproduction number (R0), and the per day infection mortality and recovery rates. By calibrating the parameters of the SIRD model to the reported data, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak at the epicenter three weeks ahead, i.e. until February 29. As the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, which can be considered only as a subset of the actual numbers of infected and recovered cases in the total population, we have repeated the calculations under a second scenario that considers twenty times the number of confirmed infected cases and forty times the number of recovered, leaving the number of deaths unchanged. Based on the reported data, the expected value of R0 as computed considering the period from the 11th of January until the 18th of January, using the official counts of confirmed cases was found to be ?4.6, while the one computed under the second scenario was found to be ?3.2. Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R0 was found to be ?2.6 based on confirmed cases and ?2 based on the second scenario. Our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the simulations suggest that the cumulative number of infected could reach 180,000 (with a lower bound of 45,000) by February 29. Regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of the up to the 10th of February reported data, the death toll might exceed 2,700 (as a lower bound) by February 29. Our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the case fatality ratio from January 26 to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals), but mainly because of the fact that the actual cumulative numbers of infected and recovered cases in the population most likely are much higher than the reported ones. Thus, in a scenario where we have taken twenty times the confirmed number of infected and forty times the confirmed number of recovered cases, the case fatality ratio is around ?0.15% in the total population. Importantly, based on this scenario, simulations suggest a slow down of the outbreak in Hubei at the end of February.","Data-based analysis, modelling and forecasting of the COVID-19 outbreak.","US",1,"CC BY","CC BY","http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license","1932-6203","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","EN","PLoS ONE","2020-04-07T05:34:14",,1,

Man’s incursions into forests have resulted in denudation of massive tracts of land, and the displaced inhabitants—vectors carrying exotic infectious agents—have begun to wander deeper into man’s territory. 
In 1993, in South-Western United States, the Sin Nombre virus (the first Hantavirus) normally a pathogen of mice, developed its first taste for Homo sapiens. In 1997, the avian influenza H5N1 virus, jumped species to man. In 2002, a virus of civet cats in the Guangdong Province in Southern China transformed itself into the lethal SARS virus. In 2009, two swine strains, one human strain, and one bird strain of influenza all combined them-selves into a new deadly strain—the H1N1 Swine Flu virus. And only last year, the MERS-Coronavirus became a new player in the changea-ble game of infectious disease.
Almost as soon as the world comes stumblingly to terms with one new epidemic, another unleashes itself. Lessons were clearly not learnt after the Ebola epidemic in 1976 which was followed by another major outbreak in Zaire in 1995.
This year, confronted with a death-count that ex-ceeds the combined tally of all previous Ebola epidemics, the WHO has finally declared the Ebola outbreak in West Africa as an “extraordinary event” and admitted that it is indeed a “public health risk to other countries.”
As a human pathogen, the Ebola virus is four dec-ades old. True to form, the little-affected developed nations—the countries with the resources to tackle emerging infections—have taken no great interest in the matter. Forty precious years have ticked by. The CDC admits: “We do not know how to treat Ebola or vaccinate against it—and it will be a long time before we do.” As with the other major infectious killers that ravage the developing world, the profit margin for a drug against Ebola is slender. The Zaire Ebola virus though, is special—it is the most deadly Ebola virus known, with fatality of around 90 per cent.  By the time the victim is aware of the infection (the incubation period of the disease can be up to three weeks) he or she may have infected dozens of others. With over 7 million air flights crisscrossing the globe every year with half a billion-odd passengers, the earth has truly been reduced to a global village. This of course has immense implications for any new epidemic that is unleashed upon an immunologically unprepared population. 
And that’s not to say the older scourges have been done and dusted with. Every second, somewhere in the world, a person contracts tuberculosis. Every minute a person dies of it. Each year, nine million individuals become ‘fresh cases’ of TB, and nearly two million persons succumb to it. Each year, unlikely diseases like rabies kill at least 55,000 individuals. Hard to believe, but even today, someone, somewhere dies of rabies every ten minutes or so.
The decline in the incidence of rabies in the devel-oped world has unfortunately not been mirrored in developing countries, and impoverished countries account for nearly half of all deaths from rabies. For instance, in India, for the better part of the last decade, there has been no perceptible decline in its incidence: India alone accounts for over a third of all rabies deaths1 and about 20,000 cases of rabies a year2, and these figures are almost cer-tainly gross underestimates3. This comes as no surprise. In earlier studies, as many as a third of the lay Indian public in India were polled as being unaware of the existence of rabies3,4 but recent studies (including the one published in this issue5) show that, in urban areas at least, the awareness appears to be much higher. Despite the fact that human rabies is uniformly fatal unless the exposed individual is vaccinated before the onset of illness, most rabies continue to be treated with age old remedies and fewer than two-thirds of dog-bite victims receive the vaccine3,4. Fewer people yet are aware of the facilities available under the National Programme for the Prevention and Control of Rabies.
In respect of infectious disease, there is much work to be done. Countries will need to come to-gether and take ownership of their common home. The book on infectious disease is by no means closed*: it continues to be a living document, and grows bulkier by the day.","The book of infectious diseases—a living document","IN",1,"CC BY-SA","CC BY-SA","http://www.jmas.in/","2231-1696","Deccan College of Medical Sciences","EN","Journal of Medical and Allied Sciences","2015-10-23T07:48:29","Deccan College of Medical Sciences",,

The response to the COVID-19 pandemic is a tragic aberration gripping the world. As the disease evolves, uncertainty and fear of harm rise, which can significantly diminish community health and wellbeing. This article stresses the importance of public health preparedness in overcoming social and health risks associated with public panic.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak began in late 2019, the numbers of people affected and fatalities continue to mount, causing panic and crippling vital economic and social activities. Authorities have failed to prevent inaccurate and misleading headlines that agitate the public and impinge on public communication. Fake news and rumors about magical products claiming to cure the virus abound. Additionally, people assumed emergency preparation meant stockpiling resources. Amid growing fears, consumers raided supermarkets and pharmacies for supplies, from masks to hygiene products, and people have fought over protective gear as tensions flared among anxious customers.

When general panic starts driving political decision-making, public health professionals may be unable to implement strategies based on informed decisions. Researchers argue that government secrecy and non-transparency diminish people’s confidence and trust, creating panic (Wilson et al., 2007). Even naming the disease possibly triggered epidemic-related trauma and the ensuing public mistrust and disbelief of authorities; the panic has also sparked a wave of racial prejudice (Titanji, 2020). Although a series of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, from Avian flu to Zika virus, may have created more public awareness, whether leaders can translate this newfound awareness into meaningful policies and action is debatable.

Globally, attention is growing on responses from state leaders, as some try to downplay the epidemic’s severity to maintain “business as usual”. In early March 2020, the Indonesian government was still in a state of denial and was attempting to convince the general public that the country was free from COVID-19 (Lindsey & Mann, 2020) Instead, currently confirmed cases are growing rapidly, suspected cases are far above the testing capacity, and case fatality is at an alarming rate.

In contrast, several countries took drastic action by declaring travel restrictions and locking down cities. As an example, New Zealand decided to implement level-4 measures, with strict movement restrictions, not long after they confirmed their first case on 28 February 2020; they have recently begun a gradual exit from coronavirus lockdown (Knight, 2020).

The public expects leaders to curb the spread of COVID-19 responsibly, appropriately, effectively, and proactively. Meanwhile, leaders are urging the public to stay calm and adopt new norms during this rapidly evolving situation. This crisis is not limited to any individual and requires cooperation rather than a unilateral response.

 

DISCUSSION

How to do this?

A critical approach to pandemics is to ensure the preparedness of both healthcare capacity and public health systems (Jain, Duse, & Bausch, 2018). To respond to emergency needs—to have the capacity to treat rapidly increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients—it is important for each country to have existing policies and action plans for healthcare facilities to temporarily expand service capacity, cancel or postpone elective procedures, and engage in rapid intervention to conserve medical supplies, including personal protective equipment (Gan, Tseng, & Lee, 2020). Measures including recalling recently retired healthcare workers and providing drive-through services for chronic disease medications have been implemented to lessen pressures on hospitals (Wang, Ng, & Brook, 2020).

While healthcare capacity is the ability to care for patients with COVID-19, the public health system aims to prevent people from being infected and mitigating the health risks associated with COVID-19. The public health system is important for strengthening community vigilance by promoting effective sanitation, a healthy lifestyle, and food safety, and preventing injuries, inequality, and violence. This involves not only healthcare professionals, but also well-planned strategies that consider various stakeholders’ perspectives and concerns (Glik, 2007). Despite the lockdown, we have seen healthcare workers and people in the community providing the basic essentials for those in need—from food, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), mental health support, and evidence-based research communication, to virtual musical performances and concerts. Organizations in the virtual sphere, including WhatsApp (WhatsApp Inc, 2020) and TikTok, are partnering with health agencies to increase accessibility to health information.

The best outbreak response is a collective response (Gille & Brall, 2020), which could effectively contain the disease and the panic caused by the disease. People naturally experience fear when dealing with a catastrophic event. This unprecedented threat triggered panic purchasing or falling for viral hoaxes, which reflects misconceptions about the problem, most likely because people lack trust in the measures taken (Heide, 2004), When designing and implementing public health measures, we must ensure we do not just acknowledge that, but actively engage relevant stakeholders. In an age of uncertainty, community solidarity and collective action are key to maintaining community vigilance against the crisis (Aldrich et al., 2015).","HOW CAN THE PUBLIC BE BETTER PROTECTED AGAINST COVID-19?","ID",1,"CC BY-SA","CC BY-SA","http://e-journal.unair.ac.id/index.php/JBE/about/submissions#copyrightNotice","2301-7171","Universitas Airlangga","ID","Jurnal Berkala Epidemiologi","2020-05-31T13:08:05","Centre for Environment and Population Health",,
