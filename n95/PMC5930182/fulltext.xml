According to the National Center for Health Statistics [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], 83% of adults and 93% of children received care from an ambulatory or outpatient clinic in 2015. Increasing demand, volume, and complexity of procedures performed in these settings lead to a greater risk of transmission of infections.</p><p>Infection prevention recommendations for outpatient care have been reactive to novel diseases or outbreaks. The first outpatient infection prevention recommendations were published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1983 in response to the AIDS epidemic [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. With the emergence of pandemic illnesses along with multiple outbreaks, the CDC created outpatient infection prevention recommendations to include hand hygiene, personal protective equipment (PPE) use, respiratory hygiene, safe injection practices, and disinfection of the environment and equipment.</p><p>Goodman et al. [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] published a review of transmission of infectious diseases occurring from 1946 to 1989 in the outpatient setting. Their analyses revealed that lapses in hand hygiene, reprocessing of reusable instruments, use of PPE, and lack of restriction of sick health care workers were associated with disease transmission. The authors concluded that policy development in combination with education and designating infection prevention oversight should be initiated. Subsequent hepatitis B and C outbreaks led to the creation of the first edition of <italic>The Guide to Infection Prevention of Outpatient Settings</italic> in 2011 [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;9</xref>]. The publication highlighted the minimum infection prevention practices that must be followed for safe care. Despite these recommendations, outbreaks continue to be reported as a result of failure to comply with these guidelines.</p><p>The purpose of this review is to provide a step-wise approach for implementing an outpatient infection control program for systems or practices able to allocate or support dedicated personnel for infection prevention. Many programs and clinics may not have the resources to begin a robust infection prevention program; therefore, we suggest focusing on high-priority areas such as injection safety, sterilization, and high-level disinfection (HLD). Contracts with infection prevention services could be considered to support standalone or smaller system clinics.</p><sec id="s1"><title>GETTING STARTED</title><p>The first step in setting up a program is to convene a multidisciplinary program oversight committee composed of the practice&#x02019;s clinical and financial leadership to obtain buy-in and resource commitment, along with ongoing oversight of the program. Once the institution makes a commitment, the infection prevention team is formed. This team will ideally consist of at least an infectious diseases&#x02013;trained medical director and an infection prevention specialist. The next step is to draft policies and/or procedures, creating a framework for the team to enforce CDC and professional society recommendations. Next, we found it useful to perform a census of all practice clinics and settings to ascertain the scope of the services being performed, including which locations perform sterilization and HLD. As in the hospital setting, it is important to perform an initial and yearly infection control risk assessment to identify and prioritize high-risk areas and activities such as injections, infusions, reprocessing of reusable medical devices, and procedures such as vein ablations. Once the risk assessment is complete, a standardized survey tool that incorporates elements of the CDC checklists [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], along with items in the newly created policies, can be utilized to perform a baseline survey to determine areas for improvement and future educational opportunities. A sample checklist can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Eventually, as the program continues to develop, follow-up surveys are performed. The following sections describe high-priority items and major areas of focus when rolling out an infection prevention program.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Sample Clinic Assessment Checklist</p></caption><table frame="vsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="3" valign="bottom" rowspan="1">I.

According to the APIC Megasurvey [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], most infection prevention specialists in outpatient clinics spend about 15% of their time on education and research. It is useful to construct a mandatory onboarding orientation that covers standard precautions, hand and respiratory hygiene, injection safety, cleaning/disinfection, and other relevant topics to set up the patient safety culture. A good resource to gather educational materials is the CDC infection control web page [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Employees who reprocess instruments and administer injectable medications should complete additional training that incorporates competency evaluation. In order to maintain or update infection prevention knowledge, it is important to administer continuing education through an annual online overview course and annual competency evaluations.</p><p>Despite education, health care workers can develop a &#x0201c;this is not the hospital&#x0201d; attitude. The absence of routine outcome measures and microbial surveillance perpetuates this attitude. In fact, ambulatory clinics are an extension of hospitals in the continuum of care as patients are typically managed in the outpatient setting, including pre-admission and after discharge. A potential downfall of perceiving the clinic environment as safer than the hospital is illustrated by an outbreak of group A <italic>Streptococcus</italic> among patients in an outpatient clinic due to ignoring numerous infection prevention practices [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The clinic was noted to have lapses in disinfection of multi-use items between patients, glove use, hand hygiene, and in implementing contact precautions. Although the ambulatory setting presents unique challenges, the message remains the same as in the hospital: Practice evidence-based care and implement infection prevention and control strategies to prevent harm, regardless of the setting.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>HAND HYGIENE</title><p>Hand hygiene is the cornerstone of infection prevention. In a study by Bringham et al. [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], health care workers&#x02019; hands were contaminated 28% of the time during patient care in a clinic setting, which highlights a lack of consistent hand hygiene and need for interventions. Examples of interventions that can be effective in increasing compliance include education, just-in-time coaching, and hand hygiene monitoring [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. After education, selecting which monitoring method will work in an individual clinic is important [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Many methods have been applied to measure or improve hand hygiene, including using the patient as an observer [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], installing electronic devices that measure hand hygiene [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], direct observation [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], hand hygiene champions [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and surveys.</p><p>A barrier to performing hand hygiene is the type and location of hand hygiene facilities [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Hand hygiene facilities&#x02014;that is, a sink or alcohol-based hand sanitizer&#x02014;must be placed in each exam room, medication preparation area, reprocessing area, and other patient care areas [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>ENVIRONMENT OF CARE, CLEANING, STERILIZATION, AND HIGH-LEVEL DISINFECTION</title><p>The CDC has released guidelines for disinfection and sterilization in health care settings [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Noncritical items such as thermometers, stethoscopes, and baby scales should be cleaned according to the manufacturer instructions. Cleaning and disinfection may not always occur because user manuals for equipment are not always available, and the infection prevention specialists are usually tasked to obtain copies of manuals as needed. An approach to facilitate compliance with cleaning is reducing the variety in the type and model of devices used. Standardization of glucometers and training on their use and disinfection should be a priority because they have been associated with transmission of blood-borne pathogens [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>We recommend replacing over-the-counter disinfectants with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)&#x02013;registered disinfectants that have broad-spectrum claims. Infection prevention specialists should have frequent discussions and provide just-in-time coaching regarding applying the right amount of product and allowing it to dry for the required contact time.</p><p>The Joint Commission reports that more than half of all ambulatory and office-based surgical clinics surveyed in 2016 were noncompliant with sterilization or HLD standards [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The CDC recommends that all staff who reprocess critical or semicritical instruments receive training, perform initial and annual competency assessments, and be retrained when new devices are introduced. Clinic staff should consult with infection prevention for guidance on purchasing new devices.</p><p>Preparation before training includes taking an inventory of supplies and reviewing device manuals and Healthcare Infection Control Practice and Advisory Committee recommendations [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] to align training with manufacturer instructions and national guidelines. Training and competency assessments should be conducted by qualified personnel such as a designated staff member, infection prevention specialist, or manufacturer representative. Ambulatory clinic reprocessing areas vary in design and are often not built to current reprocessing specification standards, and older clinics generally have only 1 room to perform the reprocessing. With compact spaces, we recommend focus on the separation of clean and dirty processes.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>INJECTION SAFETY</title><p>Kossover-Smith et al. [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] reported that there have been more than 50 outbreaks of viral and bacterial pathogens due to unsafe injection practices since 2001, a majority of which occurred in ambulatory settings [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Identified issues with injection safety include no access to hand hygiene [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], reuse of single-dose vials [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], reuse of a syringe, multidose vials not dated [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], drug diversion [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and multidose vials entering a patient treatment area [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In 1 study regarding an outbreak of septic arthritis related to intra-articular injections, complex compounding was a culprit. To avoid complex compounding, clinics should work with pharmacy services [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In all reported outbreaks, implementation of basic infection prevention measures decreased subsequent transmission [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The CDC&#x02019;s One and Only campaign is a useful resource that is often underutilized; we utilize campaign material to provide evidence-based education [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>CONSTRUCTION</title><p>The infection prevention specialist should work with construction management to develop policies and procedures and help design the clinic, renovation, implementation of the project, and after-construction walkthrough [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Infection prevention specialists ideally should review construction plans and make recommendations. All projects should include an infection control risk assessment and a preconstruction risk assessment (ICRA/PCRA) to guide recommendations [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Recommendations include reprocessing and waiting room design and the location of hand hygiene facilities (sink or alcohol-based hand sanitizer dispensers) and medication preparation areas. For example, infection prevention specialists can provide guidance when it is suggested that there should only be 1 sink in a reprocessing area, instead of multiple sinks [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We have found that infection prevention construction education for staff whose clinic is under construction is useful, as the staff can alert the infection prevention team if the ICRA/PCRA is not implemented.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>WAITING ROOM CONSIDERATION AND TRANSMISSION-BASED PRECAUTIONS</title><p>Clinics are generally restricted to small and confined areas, with limited ventilation and a rapid rate of patient turnover, and therefore a risk of infection transmission. Moving the infectious patients to their own exam room as quickly as possible is important. However, transmission-based isolation precautions are often initiated after patients have been seen by the provider. Early detection of the potentially infectious patients is necessary to limit transmission, which includes triage during scheduling or in the waiting room.</p><p>Airborne illnesses, such as measles and tuberculosis, can present unique challenges to the clinic as there is a potential to spread airborne droplets throughout the clinic area [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The best way to prevent airborne droplet exposures in the clinic is to implement airborne isolation precautions [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Because most clinics do not have negative pressure rooms, we suggest implementing a modified version of airborne isolation. Key contributors to transmissions were listed in the 1998 article &#x0201c;Infection Control in the Outpatient Setting&#x0201d; [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and include failure to recognize that isolation is warranted, combined with a lack of airborne isolation rooms. If a patient is known or suspected of having an airborne illness before arriving, it is wise to have a room ready and a back entrance for the patient to enter. A surgical mask should be placed on the patient, and the door to their exam room should remain shut. Health care providers must don N95 masks prior to contact with the patient. Depending upon the air exchange rate for the clinic, after discharge, the room should remain unoccupied for the specified amount of time before reuse [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Patients with infections transmittable through the contact route can be more difficult to identify in the waiting room. To facilitate rapid identification and isolation, a short 3&#x02013;5-question form maybe used to identify patients during registration. While most staff and providers will readily recognize patients with diarrhea, it can be difficult to assure that patients with scabies or bed bugs will not be seen by multiple staff before being identified.</p><p>Droplet diseases, such as influenza and rhinovirus, can be prevented from spreading through the use of respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette, which includes hand hygiene. Masks and tissues provide a mechanical defense against illnesses like influenza, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in waiting rooms and the rest of the clinic area [<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Also, it has been shown that face masks are able to reduce infectivity [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; however, in a cross-sectional study on patient mask use, Longtin et al. [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] found that only 27% of patients who were coughing in an emergency room waiting room reported having used a mask. We recommend masking symptomatic children age 5 years or older. In order to improve compliance, frontline desk staff should be trained to ask all patients and visitors with respiratory signs and symptoms and children with a rash to perform hand hygiene and don masks. The staff should also alert the health care workers so that they can move the patient to an exam room promptly.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH</title><p>Infection prevention collaborates with occupational health to assess, prevent, and control infections and communicable disease in health care workers. Three key components of the occupational health program are immunization, tuberculosis (TB) control, and blood-borne exposure prevention. Screening newly hired staff for their immunization status and administering necessary vaccines aid in the prevention of vaccine-preventable diseases. A TB control plan and risk assessment should be reviewed and updated annually based on CDC guidelines. Health care worker screening should be performed according to the CDC risk categories [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. To prevent staff from exposure to sharps, needle sticks, and blood-borne pathogens, programs should actively promote safety devices, as well as the safe handling and disposal of sharps. We have found it useful to provide &#x0201c;exposure kits&#x0201d; to each clinic. These contain the necessary supplies for collecting blood from the source patient and the notification and management procedure when a needle stick occurs.</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS</title><p>Globalization and population mobility allow infectious disease to spread globally with relative ease. Since 2009, there have been 5 international outbreaks: Swine Flu in 2009, MERS in 2012, Polio in 2014, Ebola in 2014, and Zika in 2016 [<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37&#x02013;41</xref>]. Ambulatory care clinics must be prepared to identify and transfer cases safely without disease transmission. Preparation for all diseases should include (1) screening and isolating potentially infectious persons, (2) PPE use, (3) cleaning and disinfection, and (4) drilling scenarios.</p><p>The first step is creating a simple algorithm detailing screening questionnaires for early detection of potentially infectious persons. Travel advisory posters can be posted to facilitate the screening process by prompting patients to be proactive by self-reporting travel history. Individuals who meet criteria for highly communicable diseases requiring isolation such as novel influenza or other emerging infections must be placed in a private exam room as soon as possible. PPE kits should be available.</p><p>Clinical staff should be trained on the correct steps and techniques to don and doff PPE. PPE assessment includes competency validation to ensure that participants are using PPE correctly. To maintain the level of competency and awareness, staff should participate in drills. PPE skill maintenance can be included in annual competency trainings.</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>CLINIC SURVEYS</title><p>Compliance with infection prevention standards is monitored through surveillance utilizing a clinic survey tool. Initially, surveys are scheduled ahead of time with the clinic according to work load and availability of staff; however, the goal is to eventually go to a clinic unannounced. During the survey, clinic staff are observed performing routine care, and the environment is examined. Emulating Joint Commission methodology, we find it useful to &#x0201c;trace&#x0201d; or follow a patient throughout their visit. When interviewing staff to elicit answers for compliance with standards, leading questions should be avoided. At the conclusion of the survey, the results should be reviewed with the manager, and a formal report should follow. Clinic survey data such as overall compliance, hand hygiene, injection safety, sterilization and high-level disinfection, and other infection prevention activities can be compiled into a dashboard. Other activities include number of clinics visited, trainings performed, and consultations provided. Dashboard data are presented to administration on a monthly basis.</p><p>The CDC outpatient guideline does not make any specific recommendations on how frequently surveillance activities should be conducted using the outpatient tool, only that they should be done routinely [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Ideally, we recommend that surveillance of the environment of care and adherence to infection prevention practices is performed annually in clinics that do not reprocess reusable instruments. In clinics that perform sterilization or high-level disinfection of reusable instruments, surveillance should be ideally performed every 6 months.</p></sec><sec id="s11"><title>COMMUNICATION</title><p>For multiclinic practices, a large number of clinics inhibits frequent visitation by the infection prevention specialist and may prevent direct communication with staff. Communication from Infection Prevention comes in the form of in-person interactions, as well as email and phone, along with a website. We suggest a website that contains policies, forms, health alerts, videos, and recent publications from the team. We have found a monthly newsletter useful.</p><p>Attending multidisciplinary and nursing management meetings greatly increases the amount of communication.</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Developing a comprehensive outpatient infection prevention program is a multistep process. These steps include getting stakeholder approval, identifying an infectious diseases&#x02013;trained medical director and/or an infection prevention specialist, assessing clinics for current processes and types of devices used, and performing a risk assessment based on findings. Policies can be built up, educational trainings created and provided, and survey tools conducted in the clinics during the creation of the program. The outpatient infection prevention program can have a large positive impact in outpatient settings. The CDC&#x02019;s <italic>Guide to Infection Prevention for Outpatient Settings: Minimum Expectations for Safe Care</italic> [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] can be operationalized as a surveillance tool. Initial infection prevention efforts should focus on high-risk practices: injection safety, sterilization, and high-level disinfection. As more research is published on outpatient infection prevention, and as more clinics start infection prevention programs, a set standard, beyond basics, will be the new normal. Outpatient infection prevention is an exciting new career option for infectious diseases physicians and infection prevention specialists.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>
