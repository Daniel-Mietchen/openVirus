Nanoparticles are produced by both natural (incidental nanoparticles) and industrial processes (engineered nanoparticles)<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Engineered nanoparticles are materials deliberately synthesized to have unique physical or chemical properties that allow them to be useful for specific applications. Recent studies have reported the presence of both incidental and engineered nanoparticles in a variety of workplaces<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Worker exposure to engineered nanoparticles in these workplaces is not well characterized although it has been suggested that generation and handling processes in industrial settings could generate aerosolized nanoparticles which might be inhaled, ingested or absorbed through skin<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p id="P6">Respiratory protection for nanoparticles has been recommended by various organizations. However, there is no information available regarding what types of respirators should be required to use against nanoparticles. The lack of occupational exposure limits for many types of nanomaterials poses a significant challenge on selection of the most appropriate type of respirator<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), in its document &#x0201c;Approaches to Safe Nanotechnology&#x02013;Managing the health and safety concerns associated with engineered materials&#x0201d;<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>, states that appropriate respirators can be selected based on the criteria described in the NIOSH Respirator Selection Logic<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommends using the applicable General Industry standards for nanotechnology industries<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends NIOSH-approved respirators with an Assigned Protection Factor (APF) of at least 10 for nanoparticles such as siloxane-modified silica<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. For single and multi-wall carbon nanotubes, however, the EPA recommendation specifies the use of NIOSH-approved tight-fitting air-purifying full-face piece respirators with N100 filters. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) recommends the use of half-mask respirators equipped with P100 cartridges/filters for airborne exposures of engineered nanomaterials<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. Other organizations, including the International Standards Organization (ISO)<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>, have also recommended respiratory protection for workers exposed to nanoparticles.</p><p id="P7">After examining the use of respiratory protection in 82 nanoparticle manufacturing facilities internationally, it was reported that respirators were used at 22 of the facilities. P100 (FFR or cartridge) type respirators were stated as the most commonly reported type<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. Dahm et al. found that elastomeric half-mask respirators (EHRs) were the most commonly used followed by FFRs after investigating 30 workplaces<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. A number of studies have reported the filtration efficiency of NIOSH-approved respirators against nanoparticles<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. It is acknowledged that the filtration efficiency of P100 rated filters is higher than that of N95 rated filters for nanoparticles. However, contribution from the faceseal leakage could be higher for P100 respirators (both FFR and EHR) due to higher breathing resistance (pressure drop) versus N95 respirators<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>, although there is some debate<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>. As a result, the performance for P100 respirators (i.e., any FFR or EHR with aP100 filter) may be similar to the N95 respirators<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">1</xref></sup> if the respirator does not seal well. If this result is found it would motivate the need for design improvements for P100 FFRs to reduce faceseal leakage. Conversely, if P100 respirators are found to give higher protection then this would support recommendations to use a P100 class respirator. However, besides our recent submitted manuscript<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>, no data are available for comparing N95 versus P100 FFRs or EHRs using human subjects exposed to nanoparticle aerosols under simulated workplace activities.</p><p id="P8">The term simulated workplace protection factor (SWPF), defined as the ratio of ambient concentration of a given contaminant to that inside a respirator, is determined under laboratory conditions using test exercises designed to simulate work activities<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>. The SWPF takes into account particle penetration pathways such as filter media, faceseal leakage and leakage through the exhalation valve (if equipped) and any other components. Several studies investigated the SWPF for N95 FFRs<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup>. The performance of twenty N95 FFRs and one elastomeric respirator was measured in a laboratory setting using a PortaCount Plus<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>. The 95<sup>th</sup> percentile value for the total penetration for all the fit tested respirators combined was 4% (SWPF=25), which was higher than the OSHA APF for N95 class respirators (APF=10). Some researchers investigated the SWPF for particles &#x0003c; 100 nm for four different models of N95 FFRs using an Electrical Low Pressure Impactor (ELPI)<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup>. The authors obtained the geometric mean protection factor (PF) of 21.5 for four commercially available N95 FFR models over the eight specific nanoparticle sizes. Nine samples of N95 FFRs for each model were tested and the PF values were &#x0003c;10 for at least one sample for each model, and the PF values were less for particles in the 40&#x02013;200 nm range compared to the 200&#x02013;1300 nm range, suggesting that the tested N95 FFRs failed to provide the adequate protection efficiency equivalent to the OSHA APFs against nanoparticles. On the other hand, although the filter media rating (N95 vs. P100) will not change the APF value for a given respirator type, it was recommended that, in the OSHA APF final rule discussion<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>, a respirator with a higher rated filter (e.g., upgrading from N95 to P100) should be chosen for workplaces with a large percentage of aerosols in the most penetrating particle size (MPPS) range<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. For electret filter media (all the respirators tested in this study consist of this type of filter media) commonly used in today&#x02019;s environments, the MPPS values are consistently &#x0003c; 200 nm (mostly in the range of 30 to 100 nm), which falls within the nanoparticle size region<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p id="P9">It should be noted that this work was built upon our earlier effort<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>, which investigated performance of eight different respirators against nanoparticles under simulated workplace activities.

In brief, the experiments were carried out in a test chamber (2.5&#x000d7;1.5&#x000d7;2.5 m) in a controlled laboratory setting. Sodium chloride (NaCl) particles were generated using a six-jet atomizer (Model: 9036, TSI Inc.) and charge-equilibrated by passing them through a <sup>85</sup>Kr electrical charge equilibrator (Model: 3054, TSI Inc.) prior to being released inside the test chamber. A NaCl particle concentration of ~2&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> particles/cm<sup>3</sup> was maintained during testing. Three mixing fans inside the chamber were used to circulate the NaCl aerosol. The challenge aerosol was log-normally distributed with a size range of 10&#x02013;500 nm, a count median diameter of 60 nm, and a geometric standard deviation of 2.88.</p><p id="P12">The twenty five human test subjects were medically cleared for testing and gave their written consent to participate. The study was approved by the NIOSH Institutional Review Board. Before performing the SWPF test for a particular respirator model, the subject underwent a standard OSHA-accepted eight-exercise fit test using a Porta Count Pro+ (Model: 8038, TSI, Inc.). This fit test was performed to acquaint the subject with the donning and adjustment procedures and to ensure a good fit (i.e., passing fit factor &#x02265; 100) could be achieved. Passing fit factors were obtained for all test subject/respirator model combinations. After passing the PortaCount fit test, the test subject wearing the respirator entered the chamber and performed a set of six modified OSHA fit test exercises (3 min for each), which included 1) normal breathing, 2) deep breathing, 3) turning head side to side, 4) moving head up and down, 5) bending over, and 6) simulated reactor cleanout. The simulated reactor cleanout entailed the subject holding a scoop and performing a scooping motion from an empty bucket. Two Scanning Mobility Particle Sampling Systems (SMPS) (Model: 3080 EC with long DMA 3081, Model: 3772 CPC, TSI Inc.) were used to measure aerosol concentrations inside (C<sub>in</sub>) and outside (C<sub>out</sub>s) of the respirator, simultaneously. The SMPS measures particles in the 10&#x02013;400 nm size range at a sampling flow rate of 0.6 L/min. SWPF was calculated as the ratio of C<sub>out</sub> to C<sub>in</sub> for each exercise.

All SWPFs produced by P100 were &#x0003e;200, whereas 67.1% and 44.3% of the SWPFs were below 200 for N95 respirators A and B.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S11"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P21">Respiratory protection against exposures to engineered nanoparticles has been recommended by various organizations such as NIOSH, OSHA, EPA, ISO, etc. To date, no studies (besides our submitted work)<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> have included both N95 and P100 respirators (FFR and EHR) to investigate SWPFs again-stnanoparticles. In our earlier effort<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> several objectives were addressed: 1) measure simulated workplace protection factors (SWPFs) for both FFR and EHR types as a function of particle size; 2) determine if individual models within each type provide the expected level of protection; and 3) compare SWPF levels between class N95 and class P100 respirators and between FFR and EHR types. Only limited analysis of the third objective was performed in the previous work. In comparison, in this manuscript we reported the 5<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>, 25<sup>th</sup>, 50<sup>th</sup>, 75<sup>th</sup>, 90<sup>th</sup> and 95<sup>th</sup> percentiles offered by N95 vs P100 for FFR [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>], and for EHR [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. We also analyzed the percentage of data points below indicated SWPF (e.g., 10, 50, 100, and 200 nm) for particles of 10&#x02013;100 nm [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] and for particles of 100&#x02013;400 nm [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. The corresponding discussion on those results were presented in the text body of the manuscript.</p><p id="P22">As the first of its kind, this study, along with our earlier effort<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>, revealed that the tested P100 respirators were generally able to provide at least 10 times better protection than the N95 when used against nano-size (10 to 100 nm) and large-size (100 to 400 nm) particles, which was true for both the FFR and EHR classes. This finding supports the current OSHA and NIOSH recommendations that a higher rated filter (e.g., changing from N95 to P100) should be chosen for workers to receive a better respiratory protection when exposed to a high percentage of nanoparticles in the workplace. Although the performance of the N95 respirators was less than the P100, the 5<sup>th</sup> percentiles of the SWPFs were all greater than the OSHA APF of 10 for the tested N95 respirators; however, it is noted that the SWPFs were obtained under well-controlled laboratory conditions, thus the results may not represent the true protection levels in the field. In actual workplace environments involving higher work actives (higher work load), the protection levels would be expected to be lower<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup>.</p><p id="P23">Though no study has compared N95 versus P100 respirators worn by human test subjects in a simulated workplace environment, several SWPF studies were conducted for various types of N95 respirators. Dulinget al. reported SWPFs of three types of respirators (N95 EHRs, N95 FFRs, and surgical masks) using a PortaCountPlus<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup>. They found that 14% of the subject- respirator combinations had SWPFs &#x0003c; 10. However, when only subjects who passed a quantitative fit testing were included, all combinations showed SWPFs &#x0003e;10. Our results agree with the quoted study in that all tested N95 FFRs had SWPFs &#x0003e; 10. As mentioned in the methods section, all 25 human subjects passed a fit test screening before entering the exposure chamber for the SWPF test.</p><p id="P24">Fit testing is required under the OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard when tight-fitting respirators (including N95 and P100 FFRs and EHRs) are used<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup>. However, not all workplaces are in compliance<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup>. The importance of fit testing has been discussed elsewhere<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup>. Coffey et al. demonstrated that when a fit test was applied to the test subjects, the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of total penetrations (equal to 1/SWPF) dropped from 33% to only 4%, and they concluded that fit-testing of N95 respirators is necessary to ensure the expected level of protection<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>. Another study conducted by Reponen et al. reported the same trend for N95 FFRs that 29% had PFs &#x0003c; 10 when all subjects were included, whereas 9% had PFs &#x0003c; 10 when only including the subjects who passed the fit testing<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. While 9% of subject-respirator combinations had PFs &#x0003c; 10 in the latter quoted study, no subjects (0%) had SWPFs &#x0003c; 10 in this study. The possible factors causing the difference are different respirator models used (different fitting characteristics of the respirators), the size range of the challenge aerosols (0.04 to 1.3 &#x000b5;m in the quoted study), different sample flow rate (10 L/min in the referenced study), methods of measurement (ELPI used in their study), and subject variability (training received, motivation, age, facial characteristics etc.).</p><p id="P25">Another interesting finding of this study is that no statistical significance (P &#x0003e; 0.05) was identified in SWPF values against nanoparticles (10 to 100 nm) versus large particles (100 to 400 nm) after controlling the respirator model. Although several studies have demonstrated that total inward leakageis dependent on particle size<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,&#x02013;<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> others found that the effect of particle size on TIL became less significant at lower flow rates (5&#x02013;20 L/min)<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup>. In addition, in this study the particles were-only separated into two sizes (nano-size from 10 to 100 nm, and large-size from 100 to 400 nm). Further data analysis would need to be performed to determine if other particle size ranges caused significant differences. However, this was not the goal of the current study.</p><p id="P26">There are a few limitations of this study. First, the SWPFs were measured under laboratory condition, which may overestimate the protection offered by the tested respirators. Our future study will determine if those respirators provide the expected level of protection for workers in real nanoparticle workplaces using portable size-selective instruments. The second limitation was the challenge aerosol (NaCl particles) used in the study, which may not be representative enough to reflect true particle characteristics (e.g., particle size, shape, density, charge, size distribution etc.). Therefore, field studies are necessary in the future to better understand the respiratory protection against various nanoparticles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S12"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P27">The important finding was that the tested P100 FFRs and EHRs had significantly higher SWPFs compared to the N95 FFRs and EHRs, which is in agreement with our recent work<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>. Most of the N95 respirators achieved 5thpercentiles of the SWPFs &#x0003e; 10 when tested against nano-size (10 to 100 nm) and large-size (100 to 400 nm) particles, whereas the P100 class was able to generate 5<sup>th</sup> percentile SWPFs &#x0003e; 100, which was tenfold greater than the N95 class. When the same respirator model was tested, it offered similar protection against nano-size and large-size particles. Overall, the findings suggest that the P100 respirators provide better performance than the N95 against particles from 10 to 400 nm, supporting current OSHA and NIOSH recommendations.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1"><label>1</label><p id="P28"><bold>Notes:</bold> In this manuscript, N95 respirators refer to filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) or elastomeric half-mask respirators (EHRs) with N95 filters; similarly, P100 respirators refer to FFRs/EHRs with P100 filters.</p></fn></fn-group><ack id="S13"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p id="P29">The authors thank NIOSH colleagues Ronald Shaffer, Lee Portnoff, Kenny Kim, and Zhipeng Lei for their valuable review comments on the manuscripts.</p><p id="P30" content-type="publisher-disclaimer"><bold>Disclaimer</bold></p><p id="P31">The findings and conclusions in this manuscript are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).
