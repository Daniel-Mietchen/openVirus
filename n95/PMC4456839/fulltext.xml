After an introductory review of Ebola routes of transmission, this article compares and contrasts the advantages and disadvantages of powered air-purifying respirators versus N-95 masks, particularly with respect to aerosol-generating procedures. Additionally, the authors describe their experience with PPE measures and policies at the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, Quebec. Given the frontline responsibility of respiratory therapists in treating individuals with communicable infections, the authors stress the importance of being proactive in the decision-making process for PPE use and implementation.</p></abstract><abstract><p>The present outbreak of Ebola has health care professionals seeking guidance on isolation precautions for routine care and aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs). The most recent guidelines state that during AGPs, health care professionals should wear respiratory protection at least as protective as a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-certified fit tested N95 filtering face piece respirator or higher; for example, a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR). The present review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using a PAPR versus an N95 mask, and relates the experience of the Jewish General Hospital (Montreal, Quebec) of PAPR policy implementation. Training programs on proper donning and doffing of personal protective equipment and quality control systems need to be in place. Respiratory therapists are frontline during AGPs and need to be active in the decision making of the type of equipment chosen to protect them.</p></abstract><trans-abstract xml:lang="fr"><p>La pr&#x000e9;sente &#x000e9;closion du virus Ebola incite les professionnels de la sant&#x000e9; &#x000e0; chercher des conseils sur les pr&#x000e9;cautions en mati&#x000e8;re d&#x02019;isolement dans les soins habituels et les interventions produisant des a&#x000e9;rosols (IPA).

These precautions include the appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) as indicated by hospital policy. The present outbreak of Ebola viral disease (EVD) has health care personnel seeking guidance on the appropriate use of PPE for suspected cases that may arrive to their facility. The 2007 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, Georgia, USA) Guideline for Isolation Precautions (<xref rid="b1-cjrt-50-87" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) emphasize that the route of transmission dictates recommendation for infection control measures; however, the question remains as to what PPE is required for aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs). Do we use powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) or N95 masks? Are there advantages or disadvantages to using a PAPR, and is there a recommended procedure for donning and doffing?</p><sec><title>EBOLA ROUTE OF TRANSMISSION</title><p>Taking the Ebola outbreak as an example, we need to understand how it is transmitted. Ebola hemorrhagic fever is caused by infection with the Ebola virus, a member of the family <italic>Filoviridae</italic>, a severe and often fatal illness in humans. The mode of transmission to humans is through close contact with the blood, secretions, or organs of ill or deceased chimpanzees, gorillas or fruit bats. Human-to-human transmission occurs by direct contact (through broken skin and mucous membrane) with infected blood, body fluids, secretions or organs of an infected person (<xref rid="b2-cjrt-50-87" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-cjrt-50-87" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). To date, airborne transmission has not been documented; therefore, early recognition of an individual with suspected EVD is critical for infection control (<xref rid="b3-cjrt-50-87" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Clinical symptoms of EVD include sudden onset of fever &#x0003e;38&#x000b0;C, malaise, myalgia, headache, conjunctival injection (red eye), pharyngitis, vomiting, diarrhea that can be bloody, gastrointestinal pain, and impaired kidney and liver function (<xref rid="b4-cjrt-50-87" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6-cjrt-50-87" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The incubation period varies from two to 21 days, with seven days being the average. Currently, experimental treatments have been tested in animals, but have been provided/administered on a compassionate basis to humans without knowledge of effect or safety (<xref rid="b3-cjrt-50-87" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Exposure to the Ebola virus in the health care setting occurs when infection control precautions are not strictly practiced by health care workers (ie, not wearing appropriate PPE). The CDC has released infection prevention and control recommendations for hospitalized patients with known or suspected Ebola hemorrhagic fever in the United States (<xref rid="b4-cjrt-50-87" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-cjrt-50-87">Table 1</xref> summarizes of the main CDC recommendations for hospitalized patients with known or suspected EVD, and includes the standard contact and droplet precautions.</p></sec><sec><title>RESPIRATORS: N95 OR PAPR?</title><p>Respiratory protection in health care for contact droplet/airborne precautions commonly follows two filtering device paths, N95 mask respirators and PAPRs. Currently, the CDC and the WHO have no clear guidelines on AGPs and the use of N95 versus PAPRs. The N95 masks filter at least 95% of particles &#x0003c;5 &#x003bc;m in diameter and are not resistant to oil. These masks have the advantages of blocking aerosol (&#x0003c;5 &#x003bc;m) and droplet-size (5 &#x003bc;m to 50 &#x003bc;m) particles, are readily available, allow the use of stethoscopes, are noiseless and do not require a power source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cjrt-50-87">Figure 1</xref>). Their disadvantages include requiring an initial and periodic fit testing, the possibility of being compromised by an improper fit (eg, because of facial hair), poor tolerance by users due to breathing resistance, and heat and moisture build up, the high cost of stocking different types and sizes, and the potential for contamination due to exposed face and neck (<xref rid="b7-cjrt-50-87" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-cjrt-50-87" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>A PAPR is a battery-powered blower that provides positive airflow through a filter, cartridge, or canister to a hood or face piece. The type and amount of airborne contaminant will dictate the type of filter, cartridge or canister required for the PAPR. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) tests different respirator models in its laboratory to ensure they meet certain minimum performance standards and it is the employer&#x02019;s responsibility to assess the respiratory precaution needs and ensure that the correct filter, cartridge or canister is purchased (<xref rid="b9-cjrt-50-87" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Cartridges/filters are colour coded; for example, P100 filters are coded purple.</p><p>High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters have a similar filtration as P100 (ie, they filter at least 99.97% of particles 0.3 &#x003bc;m in diameter and are oil proof) (<xref rid="b9-cjrt-50-87" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and are the filters of choice for infection control airborne precautions. The use of HEPA filters in PAPRs implies that they have a greater level of respiratory protection than N95 masks. They also have the advantage of providing head and neck protection, do not require fit testing because of a full hood, are approved for use with facial hair and allow for continuous bedside care of a patient. Their disadvantages include difficulties in communicating due to their bulk and noise, the inability to use a stethoscope and a requirement for electricity (batteries) to ensure proper airflow rates into the hood. After use, filters are considered to be contaminated with infectious material; therefore, they pose a potential risk to individuals reprocessing reusable respirators (<xref rid="b9-cjrt-50-87" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>The most commonly used models of PAPRs available for respiratory protection are manufactured by 3M (USA) and Bullard (USA) (<xref rid="b10-cjrt-50-87" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>); however, a list of NIOSH-approved respirators can be obtained online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/respusers.html">www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/respusers.html</ext-link>. The 3M Air-Mate HEPA is the model purchased by the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, Quebec. It consists of a mounted battery-operated respirator with disposable black tubing and a double-shrouded hood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-cjrt-50-87">Figure 2</xref>). The rechargeable battery must be tested routinely by a designated individual. Before using the PAPR, one must ensure that the HEPA filter and gasket are in place. The black tube connects to the PAPR and the blower is tested by placing a nipple in the tube and ensuring that it rises according to manufacturer&#x02019;s specifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-cjrt-50-87">Figure 3</xref>). The tube is then attached to the hood and the blower turned on before placing the hood over the face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-cjrt-50-87">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>The correct sequence of donning, doffing and hand hygiene is important to the effectiveness of the PAPR and the N95 mask. The greater protection provided by a PAPR over a N95 mask for droplet and airborne particles is reduced if one self-contaminates with a disease that is transmitted via contact; hence, the importance of proper training. When donning, the shoe cover (which may or may not be used) is first and then the gown (ensuring it is tied at the back). The N95 mask or the PAPR is secured after verifying the flow, and the face shield or the loose-fitting hood is placed over the face, with the inner shroud tucked inside the gown. Then hand hygiene, and the long-cuffed gloves go over the sleeves of the gown.</p><p>The removal of PPE should be performed at least 2 m away from the patient, near the door. The shoe cover, gloves and gown should be removed inside the room, and a trained assistant should be available to help you remove and clean the PAPR. The hood or face shield and N95 mask should only be removed outside the patient&#x02019;s room, and then placed in a biohazard bag. All PPE should be removed so as not to self-contaminate. Hand hygiene should be performed after glove removal &#x02013; before removal of the face mask and after removal of all PPE (<xref rid="b7-cjrt-50-87" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-cjrt-50-87" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The advantage of using the N95 mask for AGPs is that it is disposable and does not place additional personnel at risk; hence, the CDC&#x02019;s statement for EVD &#x0201c;Because of the potential risk to individuals reprocessing reusable respirators, disposable filtering face piece respirators are preferred&#x0201d; (<xref rid="b4-cjrt-50-87" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>In cases in which a health care worker cannot be fit-tested for an N95 mask or has facial hair, the use of a PAPR is an alternative. Also, in situations in which a live airborne virus is being handled, a PAPR may be preferred to the N95 mask.</p></sec><sec><title>EXPERIENCE AT THE JEWISH GENERAL HOSPITAL</title><p>The Ebola outbreak has reminded our team that we have PAPRs in our institution (purchased in anticipation of the H1N1 epidemic), and that we do not have a policy for when it is required and how it is used. Only two members of hospital staff were trained on donning, doffing and cleaning of the PAPR. We are now developing a policy on the use of PAPRs, which will be followed by training sessions for staff identified as potentially requiring their use. During H1N1, we used the waterproof gown, long-cuff nitrile glove, N95 mask and face shield for all AGPs with success. As respiratory therapists, we still use N95 masks as a routine precaution during bronchoscopies and intubations because there have been situations in which samples returned positive for airborne infection and the patient was not under airborne precautions.</p><p>Hospital infection control policy makers have been left to decide whether a PAPR should be used for EVD. What is clear is that we must be proactive because it is just a question of time before an infected patient arrives in Canada. As part of a disaster infection control plan, there must be provisions for training in the use of all types of PPE for health care workers who may be involved in the care of an infected or suspected case, and there must be proper quality control systems in place. The decision to use a PAPR for AGPs without a program in place can lead to more self-contaminations than using appropriate PPE with a fit-tested N95 mask.</p><boxed-text position="float"><p>Additional information regarding EVD, including risk assessment, diagnosis and treatment, can be accessed at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/infection-prevention-and-control-recommendations.html">www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/infection-prevention-and-control-recommendations.html</ext-link>.

Its use has not yet found a specific niche, EVD being no exception. The Infection Prevention and Control Department of the Jewish General Hospital recently developed a policy for infection control precautions for EVD and ensured that it was reviewed by a multidisciplinary team including the respiratory therapy department. It is extremely important as respiratory therapists that we ensure that our role in AGPs is identified and our needs are met. All respiratory therapy departments should be proactive and ensure that their hospitals have policies in place.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="b1-cjrt-50-87"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Siegel</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name><name><surname>Rhinehart</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Jackson</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Chiarello</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><collab>the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee</collab></person-group><source>CDC 2007 guideline for isolation precautions: Preventing transmission of infectious agents in the healthcare setting</source><publisher-loc>Atlanta</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-cjrt-50-87"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><article-title>The Public Health Agency of Canada</article-title><comment>&#x0003c;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/id-mi/vhf-fvh/ebola-eng.php">www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/id-mi/vhf-fvh/ebola-eng.php</ext-link>&#x0003e;
