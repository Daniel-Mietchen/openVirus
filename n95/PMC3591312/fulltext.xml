However, there is minimal data on influenza virus aerosol shedding, the infectiousness of exhaled aerosols, and none on the impact of facemasks on viral aerosol shedding from patients with seasonal influenza.</p><p>We collected samples of exhaled particles (one with and one without a facemask) in two size fractions (&#x0201c;coarse&#x0201d;&#x0003e;5 &#x000b5;m, &#x0201c;fine&#x0201d;&#x02264;5 &#x000b5;m) from 37 volunteers within 5 days of seasonal influenza onset, measured viral copy number using quantitative RT-PCR, and tested the fine-particle fraction for culturable virus.</p><p>Fine particles contained 8.8 (95% CI 4.1 to 19) fold more viral copies than did coarse particles. Surgical masks reduced viral copy numbers in the fine fraction by 2.8 fold (95% CI 1.5 to 5.2) and in the coarse fraction by 25 fold (95% CI 3.5 to 180). Overall, masks produced a 3.4 fold (95% CI 1.8 to 6.3) reduction in viral aerosol shedding. Correlations between nasopharyngeal swab and the aerosol fraction copy numbers were weak (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.17, coarse; r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.29, fine fraction). Copy numbers in exhaled breath declined rapidly with day after onset of illness. Two subjects with the highest copy numbers gave culture positive fine particle samples.</p><p>Surgical masks worn by patients reduce aerosols shedding of virus. The abundance of viral copies in fine particle aerosols and evidence for their infectiousness suggests an important role in seasonal influenza transmission. Monitoring exhaled virus aerosols will be important for validation of experimental transmission studies in humans.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The relative importance of direct and indirect contact, large droplet spray, and aerosols as modes of influenza transmission is not known but is important in devising effective interventions. Surgical facemasks worn by patients are recommended by the CDC as a means of reducing the spread of influenza in healthcare facilities. We sought to determine the total number of viral RNA copies present in exhaled breath and cough aerosols, whether the RNA copies in fine particle aerosols represent infectious virus, and whether surgical facemasks reduce the amount of virus shed into aerosols by people infected with seasonal influenza viruses. We found that total viral copies detected by molecular methods were 8.8 times more numerous in fine (&#x02264;5 &#x000b5;m) than in coarse (&#x0003e;5 &#x000b5;m) aerosol particles and that the fine particles from cases with the highest total number of viral RNA copies contained infectious virus. Surgical masks reduced the overall number of RNA copies by 3.4 fold. These results suggest an important role for aerosols in transmission of influenza virus and that surgical facemasks worn by infected persons are potentially an effective means of limiting the spread of influenza.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cooperative agreements 1U01CI000446 and 1U01IP000497, NIH grant RC1AI086900, and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Office of Aerospace Medicine through the Air Transportation Center of Excellence for Airliner Cabin Environment Research (Cooperative Agreement 04-C-ACE-HU and 07-C-RITE-HU) via a subcontract from Auburn University (#06-ACER-207814).

However, the reduction in copy number was statistically significant: The median number of viral copies in the fine particle fraction was 250 with masks and 560 without masks. The geometric mean copy number in the fine particle fraction without a facemask was 110 (95% CI 45 to 260) and the facemasks produced a 2.8 fold reduction in copy number (95% CI 1.5 to 5.2, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.001).</p><p>Combining the coarse and fine fractions, we detected viral RNA in 29 (78%) subjects when wearing facemasks and 35 (95%) when not wearing facemasks (McNemar's test p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01).

Reported asthma (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.029) and feverishness (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.014) were associated with significantly lower fine fraction copy numbers. However, coarse fraction copy numbers were not significantly impacted and temperature measured at the time of testing was not associated with exhaled copy numbers. Vaccination in any prior year was associated with a non-significant trend toward lower copy numbers in coarse (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.11) and fine fractions (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.15); there were too few having received the current season's vaccine to analyze.

We observed that viral copy numbers were greater in the fine than in the coarse fraction, and recovered infectious virus from the fine particle fraction collected from the two samples with the highest RNA copy numbers. These results, combined with older data suggesting that the infectious dose via aerosol is about two orders of magnitude lower than via large droplets <xref rid="ppat.1003205-Alford1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, suggest an important role for aerosols in seasonal influenza transmission.</p><p>Surgical masks nearly eliminated viral RNA detection in the coarse aerosol fraction with a 25 fold reduction in the number of viral copies, a statistically significant 2.8 fold reduction in copies detected in the fine aerosol fraction, and an overall statistically significant 3.4 fold reduction of viral copy number in the exhaled aerosols. This finding supports current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations that healthcare facilities encourage patients with influenza-like illness to don surgical facemasks as one component of an influenza infection control program <xref rid="ppat.1003205-Centers4" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>When volunteers were not wearing surgical masks, we detected virus RNA in coarse particles exhaled by 43% and in fine particles exhaled by 92% of influenza patients. This is in contrast to the report by Johnson et al <xref rid="ppat.1003205-Johnson2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, who detected influenza virus RNA in cough generated large droplet spray from 100% of influenza patients over two brief sampling trials, and from 78% on each trial. These discrepant findings are likely due to the very different collection techniques and particle sizes collected in these two studies. We used a specially designed aerosol sampler to collect particles from 0.05 to 50 &#x000b5;m in diameter. Johnson et al, by contrast, used simple deposition on petri dishes, and based on particle settling rates and collection times, that method would have been unlikely to collect particles with diameters of less than approximately 50 &#x000b5;m because smaller particles would have remained suspended in air and flowed around the petri dishes.</p><p>We view results from Johnson et al and the present study as complementary. Together the studies show that surgical masks can limit the emission of large droplet spray and aerosol droplets larger than 5 &#x000b5;m <xref rid="ppat.1003205-Johnson2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, surgical masks are not as efficient at preventing release of very small particles. It is well known that surgical masks are not effective for preventing exposure to fine particles when worn as personal protection <xref rid="ppat.1003205-Oberg1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. We had hypothesized that when used as source control, exhaled droplets might be large enough prior to evaporation to be effectively captured, primarily through impaction. This appears to be true for virus carried in coarse particles. But the majority of virus in the exhaled aerosol appear to be in the fine fraction that is not well contained. Nevertheless, the overall 3.4 fold reduction in aerosol copy numbers we observed combined with a nearly complete elimination of large droplet spray demonstrated by Johnson et al. suggests that surgical masks worn by infected persons could have a clinically significant impact on transmission. For example if one hypothesized that all transmission were due to aerosol particles &#x0003c;50 &#x000b5;m, and estimated a reproductive number of 1.5 for influenza (i.e. each infection generates 1.5 new infections on average at the start of the epidemic) <xref rid="ppat.1003205-Boelle1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, then the use of surgical masks by every infected case could reduce the reproductive number below 1 <xref rid="ppat.1003205-Brienen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Compliance, however, would be a major limitation resulting in lower efficacy in real-world practice <xref rid="ppat.1003205-Cowling1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003205-Radonovich1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>While it is generally assumed that large droplets shed from the respiratory tract contain infectious virus, there are limited data that indicate that fine particle aerosols released from the human respiratory tract contain infectious virus. In one previous study by Lindsley et al, infectious virus was detected in 2 of 21 cough aerosol samples, once with a sampler that did not discriminate between coarse and fine particles and once in the coarse particle fraction of a second instrument <xref rid="ppat.1003205-Lindsley1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. This observation, along with our observation that it was possible to recover culturable virus from the fine-particle fraction using our device demonstrates that humans generate infectious influenza aerosols in both coarse and fine particle fractions. This lends support to the hypothesis that aerosols may be a common pathway for influenza transmission among humans <xref rid="ppat.1003205-Tellier1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003205-Tellier2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. However, a clear test of the hypothesis requires intervention studies that can interrupt only one mode of transmission without interfering with others <xref rid="ppat.1003205-Langmuir1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>We only detected infectious virus in exhaled breath samples with high (10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup>) copy numbers by quantitative RT-PCR. This implies that the ratio of total viral particles to infectious virus was about 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup>, compared with 10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>3</sup> for laboratory stocks and experimental aerosols <xref rid="ppat.1003205-Fabian2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. It is not yet known whether the low recovery of infectious virus (despite high copy numbers of viral RNA) represents technical difficulties in sampling and culturing exhaled breath samples or whether the vast majority of the virus exhaled by influenza A patients is actually non-infectious. These findings are consistent with those by Lindsley et al. <xref rid="ppat.1003205-Lindsley1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> We designed the sampler specifically to overcome problems with existing bioaerosol samplers, including efficiently collecting sub-micron particles into a liquid and use of appropriate buffer to preserve infectiousness <xref rid="ppat.1003205-McDevitt1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. We have previously shown that collection on solid, dry collection media resulted in large losses of culturability <xref rid="ppat.1003205-Fabian2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Therefore, we did not attempt to culture the coarse fraction collected on a Teflon substrate. Subsequent studies in our laboratory indicated that about 50% of the infectious virus is lost during the concentration step of our procedure (data not shown), suggesting that this is one contributing factor in the low rate of recovery of infectious virus in this study.</p><p>The lack of strong correlation between the viral load in the nasopharyngeal and aerosol samples is possibly of interest. This may merely be a result of nasopharyngeal sample variability; in future studies, control for sample quality by PCR of a cellular gene may be helpful. Our sampler, as is the case with all samplers for fine and ultrafine particles, has an upper limit to the size droplet that can be pulled into its inlet airstream. Thus, a second possible explanation for the lack of correlation is that the nasopharynx is primarily a source for very large droplets (&#x0003e;50 &#x000b5;m) that we would not have detected. Furthermore, none of our subjects sneezed; an efficient method of generating droplets from the upper respiratory tract. This may imply that the smaller droplets we detected were generated in the lower respiratory tract and that the viral load at that location is not strongly correlated with the nasopharyngeal load. Alternatively, shedding into aerosol droplets may be driven by other host factors (e.g. asthma, symptom severity, and immune response), co-infection with other agents, virus factors affecting release from the epithelium, or the nature of the resident microbiome. If shedding into aerosol is determined in large part by the location of infection in the respiratory tract, this may have implications for experimental studies of transmission <xref rid="ppat.1003205-Killingley1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003205-Killingley2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Such studies will need to monitor aerosol shedding to determine whether nasal inoculation of donors results in aerosol shedding that mimics naturally acquired infection to validate the experimental design and aid the interpretation of results.</p><p>Most of the viral aerosol generation we observed occurred during the first days of symptomatic illness (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003205-t003">Table 3</xref>), consistent with studies of shedding monitored by nasal washes <xref rid="ppat.1003205-Carrat1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. We studied each individual on only one occasion and, by design, have little data beyond day 3. Further longitudinal studies of viral aerosol generation are needed to confirm these findings. New study designs will be needed to examine aerosol generation before and on the day of symptom onset in community acquired infection. A limitation of our study is that we recruited patients with certain signs and symptoms or who were positive on a rapid test or had fever, and therefore our data could be biased towards patients with higher viral loads <xref rid="ppat.1003205-Cowling1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However, we still observed significant inter-individual variation and modeling suggests that cases with higher viral loads are disproportionately important in the spread of influenza <xref rid="ppat.1003205-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003205-LloydSmith1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Additional studies are also needed to determine how aerosol generation correlates with symptoms (including milder disease), presence of other health conditions, age (we studied a narrow age distribution), and co-infection with other respiratory viruses so that recommendations for infection control can be critically evaluated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Patient population</title><p>We recruited volunteers with influenza-like illness from the Lowell, MA community, primarily among students and staff of the University of Massachusetts, beginning January 29 and ending March 12, 2009.

We screened self-referred volunteers by telephone for influenza-like illness (ILI). Persons who reported onset of fever and cough within the preceding 72 hours or were referred by a health care provider were invited to the laboratory for testing. We collected a nasopharyngeal specimen using a flocked swab (501CS01, Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA) and temperature was taken with a digital ear thermometer (Model 18-200-000, Mabis Healthcare, Waukegan, IL).

The cone allows the subject to breathe normally and unlike use of a mouthpiece, the subject could also wear a mask. The cone served as a capture type ventilation hood allowing collection of exhaled breath with minimal fugitive emissions even when the subject was wearing a mask with resultant redirection of flow. Intake air (130 L/min) flowed through a conventional slit impactor that collected particles larger than 5 &#x000b5;m on a Teflon surface (&#x0201c;coarse&#x0201d; particle fraction). To collect a &#x0201c;fine&#x0201d; particle fraction, water vapor was condensed on the remaining particles, which created droplets large enough to be captured by a 1.0-&#x000b5;m slit impactor. The 1.0-&#x000b5;m impactor was composed of a slit and a steel impaction surface sealed inside a large reservoir. Impacted droplets drained from the impaction surface into a buffer-containing liquid in the bottom of the reservoir. Concentrated buffer was pumped into the reservoir during collection to match the accumulation of water from collected droplets and maintain phosphate buffered saline with 0.1% bovine serum albumin throughout collection. The sampler was shown to be 85% efficient for particles greater than 50 nm in diameter and was comparable to the SKC BioSampler for detection and recovery of influenza A/PR/8/34 H1N1 by PCR and culture.

Tobit analysis was also used to compare coarse and fine particle fractions. Tobit regression avoids bias that would arise from assigning samples below the limit of detection a specific value such as zero or the limit divided by the square root of 2. Surgical mask use was the dependent variable.
