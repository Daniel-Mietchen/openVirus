A contour value of 1 indicates a region that consists entirely of air leaked after exhalation by the patient; where there is a 100% chance of exposure to the exhaled air, such as at the oxygen mask side vent.

<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> It was not entirely clear whether different modalities of respiratory support had contributed to the nosocomial outbreaks of SARS through the generation of infective aerosols, but our previous study<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> showed that substantial exposure to exhaled air occurs within a 0.5-m radius of patients who are receiving NPPV.</p><p id="para220">Few studies have assessed the potential risk of oxygen therapy in spreading respiratory infection. Using an aerosolized 3% hypertonic saline solution and photographic techniques, Somogyi et al<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> demonstrated that throughout exhalation both the nonrebreathing and Venturi-type of oxygen masks could produce potentially infectious plumes of exhaled air that could be inhaled by health-care workers, whereas the addition of an expiratory port and a filter to an oxygen mask (Hi-Ox80; VIASYS Healthcare; Yorba Linda, CA) could reduce aerosol production.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> Using a laser visualization technique and a mathematical model that was different from the one used in the current study for data analysis, we have previously shown a maximal dispersion distance of approximately 0.4 m during the application of oxygen at 4 L/min via a simple mask to the HPS, which was programmed at a respiratory rate of 12 breaths/min and a tidal volume of 0.5 L.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Our previous study<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> relied on image-processing techniques to define the edge of the visible smoke boundary from the captured digital video images, which represented the &#x0201c;peak&#x0201d; of simulated exhalation during one breath cycle by the HPS.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> The current study, which is based on our previous work on the safety of NPPV,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> has the advantage of allowing the smoke concentration in the exhaled plume to be estimated from the light scattered by smoke particles, whereas the probability contours were made up of data collected from at least 10 breaths. Outside the boundary contour of 20%, the probability of exposure to a patient's exhaled air was &#x0003c; 20% in this study.</p><p id="para230">This study was limited by the use of smoke particles as markers for exhaled air. The inertia and weight of larger droplets in an air-droplet, two-phase flow would certainly cause them to have less horizontal dispersion than the continuous air carrier phase in which they traveled. However, the evaporation of water content in some droplets during oxygen therapy may produce droplet nuclei that are suspended in air, whereas the larger droplets will fall to the ground in a trajectory pathway. As the smoke particles in this study mark the continuous air phase, our data contours refer to exhaled air. Our results would represent the &#x0201c;upper bound&#x0201d; estimates for the dispersion of droplets that would be expected to follow a shorter trajectory than the air jet due to gravitational effects, but would not fully reflect the risk of droplet transmission.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Second, the room airflow was switched off during the experiment in order to reveal the maximum distribution of exhaled air without interference by external factors. Further work is needed to assess the interaction between ward ventilation and the dispersion distances related to oxygen therapy. Last, we were unable to capture the maximum dispersion distance during coughing due to the limitation of the equipment used in this study. A higher speed camera with a wider laser beam will be required in future studies to detect the full range of dispersion distances during maneuvers such as coughing and sneezing.</p><p id="para240">A recent review<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> has demonstrated a strong association among ventilation, air movements in buildings, and the transmission/spread of infectious diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, influenza, and SARS, but there are insufficient data to specify and quantify the minimum ventilation requirements in hospitals and isolation rooms in relation to the spread of infectious diseases via the airborne route. In a study of the dispersion characteristics of polydispersed droplets in a general hospital ward equipped with a ceiling-mixing type of ventilation system, the small droplets or droplet nuclei (initial size, &#x02264; 45 &#x003bc;m) behaved as airborne-transmittable particles (<italic>ie</italic>, staying airborne for &#x0003e; 360 s) and the dispersions were strongly affected by the ward ventilation airflow pattern, with the expiratory droplets exhibiting an initial rapid dispersion followed by slower dispersion in the subsequent stage.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> In contrast, large droplets (initial sizes, 87.5 and 137.5 &#x003bc;m) were subjected to gravitational effects and stayed airborne for &#x0003c; 30 s, demonstrating the upper-bound reasoning that was discussed previously in this article.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Thus, the location of exhaust air vents on the medical ward has a significant impact on the dispersion pattern of expiratory droplets.</p><p id="para250">In conclusion, we have shown in a worst-case scenario that substantial exposure to exhaled air occurs within 0.4 m of patients receiving supplemental oxygen via a simple oxygen mask but that coughing can extend the dispersion distance further. Health-care workers must take precautions when managing patients with CAP of unknown etiology that is complicated by respiratory failure. In addition to maintaining contact, droplet, and standard precautions among the health-care workers when providing routine care to patients infected with H5N1 influenza, the World Health Organization recommends airborne precautions in health-care facilities including placing patients with suspected and confirmed H5N1 influenza in isolation rooms with at least 12 air exchanges per hour (if available) during aerosol-generating procedures due to the high lethality of the disease and the uncertainty about the mode of human-to-human transmission.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> While other investigators have examined the filtration capacity of different surgical and N95 masks in protecting health-care workers from viral infection,<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref>
<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref>
<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> further studies are needed to examine the dispersion of exhaled air from common respiratory therapy devices in relation to the air exchange rate and airflow patterns on the medical ward in the control of airborne viral infections.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref
