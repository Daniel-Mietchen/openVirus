The virus has a high human-to-human transmissibility via airborne, droplet and contact routes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Patient numbers can surge, and hospitals should be ready not just with the infrastructure, but also staff to be familiar with workflows. Kain and Fowler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] have eloquently detailed influenza pandemic preparations for hospitals and intensive care units, and we feel the principles described in the article are relevant to COVID-19. Staff must consider patient transfers in between wards, as COVID-19 patients are admitted in isolation facilities to contain infected cases and to avoid nosocomial spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">Infectious cases may be intentionally brought out of isolation rooms for various reasons. Intra-hospital transfer may be required from emergency departments to the wards, from the general floor to the intensive care unit and from the wards to radiology suites. Inter-hospital transfer may be required for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) if patients with COVID-19 develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome within hospitals with only basic ventilation facilities. During episodes of patient transport outside of isolation, potential breaches of infection control can occur. At the same time, when COVID-19 patients turn ill during transport, their management is exceptionally challenging as accompanying staff would be wearing cumbersome personal protective equipment (PPE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Mitigating the spread of COVID-19 is a national priority in Singapore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and part of this effort involves planning and conducting safe patient transport for suspected or confirmed cases. HCWs who handle the transport of COVID-19 patients must consider the following principles (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>): firstly, early recognition of the deteriorating patient; secondly, HCW safety; thirdly, bystander safety; fourthly, contingency plans for medical emergencies during transport; fifthly, post-transport decontamination. Specific action steps require designated zones for transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], sufficient supplies of PPE, staff training and support personnel like security officers and cleaning crews. Powered air-purifying respirators add a layer of safety on top of N95 respirators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and should be used if possible for high-risk cases, such as those requiring ambulance transport to ECMO centres.
