For implementation and facilitation of source control, respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette are important measures to help contain respiratory secretions in persons with respiratory symptoms.

We have demonstrated that coughing bouts produced a turbulent jet close to 0.7 m towards the end of the bed from the recumbent high fidelity HPS lying at 45&#x000b0; in a hospital isolation room with negative pressure. During normal cough, exhaled air dispersion distances along the median sagittal plane was significantly reduced to &#x02264; 30 cm when the HPS wore either a surgical mask or a N95 mask. With worsening lung injury, the forward dispersion distances were further reduced, so that the median sagittal distnace was &#x02264; 12.1 cm with the N95 mask. Lateral dispersion distances during normal cough were 28 cm and 15 cm when the HPS wore a surgical mask and a N95 mask, respectively. Thus N95 mask was more effective than surgical mask in preventing air leakage forward during coughing but there was still substantial sideway leakage.</p><p>During the influenza A (H1N1) 2009 pandemic, hospital-acquired infection had occurred in healthcare workers (HCWs) <xref rid="pone.0050845-Wise1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and patients <xref rid="pone.0050845-Enstone1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Front-line HCWs had higher sero-prevalence than other hospital staff or the general population in a study in Taiwan presumably due to greater exposure, <xref rid="pone.0050845-Chan2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> whereas several nosocomial outbreaks occurred in hospitalized immuno-compromised patients<xref rid="pone.0050845-Moore1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0050845-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Infection control measures recommended by the WHO during the influenza pandemic included droplet and standard precautions among the HCWs in addition to maintaining a minimum distance of &#x0003e; 1 m between patients when providing routine care to patients infected with pandemic H1N1 influenza and those with influenza-like symptoms <xref rid="pone.0050845-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Our coughing propagation distances from the HPS would support the WHO recommendation for the HCW to wear a medical mask if working within approximately 1 m from the patient or upon entering the room/cubicle of a patient on droplet precautions <xref rid="pone.0050845-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Surgical masks appeared to be as effective as N95 respirators for respiratory protection of HCWs during the routine care of patients hospitalized with seasonal influenza, <xref rid="pone.0050845-Jefferson1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050845-Loeb1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and were also as effective in reducing production of infectious aerosols during coughing when worn by influenza patients <xref rid="pone.0050845-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The incidence of nosocomial pandemic H1N1 infections appeared to remain low in staff members using surgical masks in a hospital despite admitting substantial numbers of pandemic H1N1 patients <xref rid="pone.0050845-Ang1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. A systematic review has shown that the surgical masks perform similar to the N95 masks in reducing the transmission of respiratory viruses but the latter are more expensive, uncomfortable and irritating to the skin <xref rid="pone.0050845-Jefferson2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Recently, Noti et al have shown that about two-thirds of influenza virus particles from a coughing manikin (in a simulated patient room with a high-efficiency particulate air filter) were blocked from entering the mouth by surgical masks or N95 masks that were not properly fitted whereas over 99% of infectious virus particles were blocked by a well-fitted N95 mask on the breathing simulator <xref rid="pone.0050845-Noti1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Nevertheless it seems more practical for the HCWs to wear the surgical masks as a preventive measure against nosocomial infections in view of its reasonable filtering capacity, better comfort, and higher compliance.</p><p>Patients with influenza or other highly infectious conditions such as TB are often required to put on a facemask during acute hospital admission in order to minimize the risk of causing nosocomial infection. In a laboratory room setting, Tang et al<xref rid="pone.0050845-Tang4" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0050845-Tang6" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> examined cough aerodynamics in healthy subjects in the upright position using the Schlieren and shadowgraph imaging techniques. It was estimated that voluntary human coughing led to airflow propagation distances of 0.55 m and 0.64 m in females and males respectively, <xref rid="pone.0050845-Tang6" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> but wearing a N95 mask could block the formation of the jet whereas a surgical mask could redirect it in a less harmful direction around the top, bottom and the sides of the mask <xref rid="pone.0050845-Tang5" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The shadowgraph imaging technique was unable to visualize the cough airflows once the temperature cooled to that of the ambient air and might have under-estimated the full cough propagation distance <xref rid="pone.0050845-Tang6" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Our current study was able to estimate the normalized concentrations of expelled coughing particles at different distances from the recumbent patient with different extent of lung injury, in addition to showing similar distribution of the coughing plume with and without coverage by the surgical or N95 mask to Tang et al <xref rid="pone.0050845-Tang5" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050845-Tang6" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Although the N95 mask was relatively more effective than the surgical mask in reducing air leakage forward from the patient during normal coughing (from 68 cm without wearing any mask to 15 cm and 30 cm), our study has revealed important novel findings that there was still substantial sideway leakage to 15 cm and 28 cm despite wearing the two different masks respectively.</p><p>Our study was limited by the use of smoke particles as markers for exhaled air. Evaporation of water content in some respiratory droplets produced by coughing would produce droplet nuclei suspended in air, whereas the larger droplets would fall to the ground in a trajectory pathway. As the smoke particles in this study mark the continuous air phase, our results would therefore represent the &#x0201c;upper bound&#x0201d; estimates for the dispersion of droplets which would be expected to follow a shorter trajectory than the air jet due to gravitational effects, but not fully reflect the risk of large droplet transmission<xref rid="pone.0050845-Hui3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0050845-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Although the coughing efforts in this study were artificial, the peak cough velocity during normal coughing was close to the healthy human peak coughing data of 8 m/s observed by Tang et al with the Schlieren optical method<sup>38</sup> and within the maximum derived velocities of 3.2&#x02013;14 m/s for males measured by Shadowgraph imaging <xref rid="pone.0050845-Tang6" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Pantelic et al <xref rid="pone.0050845-Pantelic1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> have demostrated the initial puff velocity produced by a cough machine as about 10 m/s whereas other investigators have reported human peak cough velocities measured by particle image velocimetry as 6 to 22 m/s <xref rid="pone.0050845-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050845-Kwon1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. The variations are likely related to different areas of mouth opening <xref rid="pone.0050845-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> and the gender of the subjects <xref rid="pone.0050845-Tang6" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050845-Kwon1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.</p><p>In summary, this study has demonstrated that coughing bouts produced a turbulent jet close to 0.7 m towards the end of the bed from the recumbent patient lying at 45&#x000b0; in a hospital isolation room with negative pressure. N95 mask was relatively more effective than surgical mask in preventing air leakage forward during coughing but there was still substantial sideway leakage to 15 cm. HCWs should take appropriate infection control precaution when examining or nursing hospitalized patients with potential airborne infectious diseases or severe pneumonia of unknown aetiology at an antero-lateral radial distance of 30 cm even if the patients are wearing surgical or N95 masks.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0050845-Musher1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
