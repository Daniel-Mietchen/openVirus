Current predictions estimate that, during a pandemic wave, 12&#x02013;30% of the population will develop clinical influenza (compared with 5&#x02013;15% for seasonal influenza) with 4% of those patients requiring hospital admissions and one in five requiring critical care. This review covers the background, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment. The role of immunization and antiviral drugs is discussed. Experience from the first wave of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza suggests that a number of infected patients become critically ill and require intensive care admission. These patients rapidly develop severe progressive respiratory failure which is often associated with failure of other organs, or marked worsening of underlying airways disease. The critical care management of these patients and the implications for resources is reviewed. Guidance from a range of bodies has been produced in a relatively short period of time in response to pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza. Disease severity has the potential to change, especially if there is virus mutation. Clinicians must be prepared for the unexpected and continue to share their experiences to maximize patient outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="cekeyws10"><kwd>intensive care</kwd><kwd>pandemic, influenza (H1N1) 2009</kwd><kwd>vaccination, influenza</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="cesec10"><title>&#x02003;</title><p id="para10">There have been three influenza pandemics in the last century.

The number of critical care beds required in a pandemic has been estimated using several models. The assumption is that peak demand for critical care beds will significantly exceed capacity.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> There is a risk that an increase in the virulence of the virus will mean a huge increase in demand for critical care.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> DOH guidance clearly acknowledges that previous emergency planning advice to achieve a 100% increase beyond normal critical care bed capacity is not likely to meet demand.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> It is estimated that at the peak of the pandemic, the requirement for mechanical ventilation may exceed available beds 10-fold.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> When resources are limited, it is ethically reasonable to aim for the maximum benefit for the most people.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Applying this principle, critical care services should be used preferentially for patients most likely to benefit. Despite understanding the necessity for triage criteria when resources are scarce to allocate access to critical care, HCWs find the idea morally challenging and legally ambiguous. Withdrawing care from an established critical care patient with uncertain outcome for the benefit of other individuals, so-called &#x02018;reverse triage&#x02019; is particularly testing. Triage may be socially, ethically, and politically difficult to countenance for the population and politicians.</p><p id="para830">Critical care professionals routinely have to assess very sick patients and decide on withholding critical care admission or treatments and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments, where it is in the patient's best interest. When faced with intense demand, basic assessment tools to aid this process in a fair manner could offer assistance and reassurance to both professionals and the public. Inclusion criteria for potential survivors should facilitate appropriate and rapid referral. Similarly, exclusion criteria which identify patients unlikely to gain benefit from critical care treatment would assist delivery of appropriate treatment in primary and secondary care settings. Deciding which patients should be in inclusion or exclusion categories should be based on objective evidence to prevent arbitrary admissions and prolonged treatment of patients unlikely to survive.<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr"><sup>51</sup></xref>
</p><p id="para840">However, there are no universally agreed procedures to triage and prioritize admission to critical care. The UK pandemic flu surge plan uses a staged triage scheme.<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr"><sup>73</sup></xref> This is based on the Canadian expert panel's plan to triage admissions into and out of critical care units. Their plan uses the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score;<xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr"><sup>79</sup></xref> combined with a list of inclusion and exclusion criteria for admission to the critical care unit as a triage tool to augment clinical judgement.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> The scoring is simple, easily reproducible, and based on physiological parameters.

<xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr"><sup>78</sup></xref> The use of a protocol like this may improve appropriate use of resources and help modify the stress of <italic>ad hoc</italic> clinical resource allocation. The protocol inclusion criteria are based on the need for single organ support (most benefit for respiratory failure) or a SOFA score of 7 or above. The exclusion criteria include a SOFA score of 11 or above (predicted mortality 90%) and severe or advanced disease states that usually preclude admission to an ICU.<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr"><sup>68</sup></xref>
<xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr"><sup>69</sup></xref>
<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr"><sup>72</sup></xref> The appropriateness of critical care referral is judged on the initial SOFA score. On occasions when the score and clinical assessment appear conflicting, additional review by an experienced clinician is recommended. The minimum requirement for survival requires reassessment of SOFA scores at 48 and 120 h to determine response to treatment. Those not improving at this point are felt likely to have a poor outcome. A SOFA score of 11 or above at any point after 48 h can also be used as a cut-off and critical care withdrawal considered, so that resources can be redirected to other patients who may have a better response. Concurrent global assessment of the patient by an experienced intensive care clinician should occur; withdrawal based solely on the score achieved is not advocated. Most clinicians would aim to avoid triage by increasing capacity by accepting a decrease in quality of care and an increase in rate of critical care transfers.</p><p id="para850">Triage decisions should be tiered, adaptable, and implemented across the health economy regionally/nationally and not just institutional. Triage decisions should be supported by public health agencies and have legal indemnity. The decision to triage should be made by two experienced clinicians and carefully documented. Although there may be no ethical difference between withholding and withdrawing treatment, it may be easier not to start a treatment, particularly high-intensity treatments such as renal replacement therapy.</p></sec><sec id="cesec310"><title>Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cardiopulmonary resuscitation</title><p id="para860">During cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), there is the potential for rescuers to be exposed to H1N1 via infectious body fluids and aerosol-generating procedures (e.g. tracheal intubation and ventilation).
