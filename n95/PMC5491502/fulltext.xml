The widespread and untimely infection of Health Care Workers (HCW) in the affected countries accelerated spread of the virus within the community. Among the reasons attributed to this trend, it must be considered that HCW were exposed to the virus in their occupational environment. The contribution of environmental conditions to the spread of Ebola in West Africa was examined by investigating the effect of temperature/humidity on the virus&#x02019;s environmental persistence and by modeling if saturation (liquid stress) allows for penetration of Ebola virus through personal protective equipment (PPE). Ebola-Makona virus persisted on PPE and materials found in outbreak settings for less than 72&#x02009;hours at 27&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 80% relative humidity (RH). A difference in virus penetration was observed between dry (5%, 1/21 tests) and saturated (33%, 7/21 tests) samples of PPE. Infectious virus particles penetrated through saturated coupons of Tyvek Micro Clean, Tychem QC, whole surgical masks and N95 respirators. These findings suggest inclusion of saturation or similar liquid stress simulation in protective equipment testing standards.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The Ebola virus, a member of the <italic>Filoviridae</italic>, has caused more than 20 sporadic and lethal outbreaks since its discovery in central Africa during 1976<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>PPE Penetration</title><p id="Par7">The hot and humid conditions of West Africa cause staff working in ETU or other outbreak facilities to suffer from elevated body temperatures leading to heavy perspiration, heat exhaustion and increased respiration rate. The saturation of PPE in such conditions may allow for virus particles which persist on a material to penetrate through causing a risk of exposure. To elucidate a link between virus penetration and vulnerability of saturated material, we tested for passage of Ebola virus through coupons of three PPE materials, which showed longer term virus survivability in the persistence study. Dry and saturated coupons made from a Tyvek Micro-Clean hood, Tychem QC suit and KC 300 N95 respirator (including fluid-shield) were inoculated with 6.8 (+/&#x02212;0.4) log<sub>10</sub> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL of Ebola-Makona virus. Dry coupons made from Tychem QC did not allow for viral penetration. Ebola did penetrate through a dry coupon made from the Tyvek Micro-Clean hood, 3.8 log<sub>10</sub> TCID<sub>50</sub> units/mL was recovered in 1/4 replicates. Coupons soaked in PBS, meant to simulate saturation, provided lesser protection than dry material, as both the Tyvek hood and the Tychem QC suit had a failure rate of 1/4. In the instances of failure, 1.8 log<sub>10</sub> TCID<sub>50</sub> units/mL of Ebola virus penetrated the Tyvek Micro-Clean hood and 4.6 log<sub>10</sub> TCID<sub>50</sub> units/mL passed through Tychem QC suit.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Mask Penetration</title><p id="Par8">Ebola virus penetrated through saturated coupons of Tyvek Micro-Clean and Tychem QC, but not through the KC 300-N95 mask. We wished to further investigate if Ebola virus could penetrate surgical masks or N95 respirators. The KC 300 mask coupons used in the persistence study were not representative of the entire mask surface, because they were made from the area surrounding the facial opening which is lined with a plastic fluid shield. The fluid shield layer may have prevented detection of virus that had penetrated through the other layers of the mask. To account for the bias of testing coupons made from a part of the whole material, we challenged whole masks with Ebola virus. Three types of facial protection (surgical mask, KC 200-N95 respirator and KC 300-N95 respirator) were challenged with virus using a respiratory mannequin. Saturating the masks in PBS, affected the equipment&#x02019;s permeability to Ebola virus particles. Regardless of mask type, saturation allowed for virus penetration in at least 1/3 biological replicates of the experiment. Virus particles were also detected on the face of the mannequin after removal of saturated KC 200 and KC 300 N95 respirators (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B,C</xref>). In comparison, no virus was detected from the inside surface of any dry masks or from the mannequin&#x02019;s face when fitted with a dry mask (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A&#x02013;C</xref>). RNA was recovered from all of the saturated mask samples and positive controls, but not from the dry mask samples. In cases where both infectious virus particles and vRNA were recovered, the number of genomic equivalents was ~1&#x02013;4 log<sub>10</sub> units/mL higher than the titre of infectious virus particles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A&#x02013;C</xref>). The recovery of vRNA from mask and face swabs taken from all the saturated mask samples (9/9) indicates that each mask was likely penetrated by infectious virus particles (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). In cases where vRNA was detected in the absence of infectious virus particles, the amount of virus was below the detection limit for the TCID<sub>50</sub> assay.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Ebola or VSV-GFP virus penetration through a surgical mask and N95 respirators challenged in dry and saturated conditions.

Infectious VSV-GFP was not recovered from any of the dry masks or the face of the mannequin when fitted with a dry mask (0/3 replicates). Infectious virus particles were detected from the inside surface of the saturated mask and face of the mannequin in 1/3 experiments (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). Viral RNA was only detected in saturated mask samples and in the controls, no vRNA was detected from swabbing the dry masks or the mannequin when fitted with a dry mask.

The ramifications of the outbreak cultivated our study and the findings suggest reconsideration of how to best protect HCW and others with the risk of Ebola virus exposure in outbreak environments. High temperature and humidity were demonstrated to shorten Ebola virus persistence on the challenged materials in comparison to conditions reflective of a clinical environment in resource wealthy nations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Notably, virus persisted long enough (&#x0003e;24&#x02009;hours) to allow for possible fomite driven transmission if contaminated surfaces are not properly identified and disinfected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Other authors found that material and fluid matrix types complicate defining how temperature and humidity affect Ebola virus persistence. At high temperature and humidity, the virus survives longest in whole human blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The survivability of Ebola in whole blood - being longer than that of residual bodily fluids - could lengthen the window of opportunity for the virus to penetrate through material. Liquid stress/saturation of PPE, a consequence of hot humid conditions, perspiration and condensation from respiration, compromised the protection of: spun polyester attire, whole surgical masks and N95 respirators. Ebola virus penetrated through saturated materials at a greater incidence (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;7/21) than the same materials when dry (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1/21)(Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). The penetration of Ebola virus through a dry coupon made from a Dupont Tyvek Micro-Clean hood is not unexpected as the ASTM F2101 standard rated the equipment&#x02019;s 3.0&#x02009;&#x000b5;m filtration efficiency as 98.9%&#x02009;+/&#x02212;&#x02009;1.2% STD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Persons responsible for the selection of PPE during Ebola virus outbreaks should check filtration efficiency ratings and other descriptors provided by regulators before approval. The average titre of infectious virus particles recovered from the seven samples (1.1 log<sub>10</sub> TCID<sub>50</sub> units/mL) is greater than the perceived infectious dose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In agreement with our previous work, recovery of Ebola virus RNA does not adequately represent infectious virus particles in stressful environmental conditions (i.e. chemical disinfection or desiccation)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Detection of vRNA in the mask penetration studies was more comparable to the titre of infectious virus particles, when they were detected together. Current standards for assessing PPE do not include saturation (i.e. perspiration) as a factor in their testing models. The passage of Ebola virus and the tested surrogate virus VSV-GFP through the examined materials should not be completely unexpected because, many items of PPE are certified to protect against penetration of particles &#x02265;0.1&#x02013;0.3&#x02009;&#x000b5;m in size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Ebola virus particles measure 80&#x02009;nm (0.080&#x02009;&#x000b5;m) in diameter and vary in length up to 14,000&#x02009;nm (14&#x02009;&#x000b5;m)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. VSV was chosen as an Ebola virus surrogate because it also possesses an envelope and measures similarly (70&#x02009;nm (0.070&#x02009;&#x000b5;m) in diameter)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Both the Ebola and VSV particle sizes fall below the defined minimum pore size for each of the tested masks and the woven polyester fabric used to manufacture Tyvek and Tychem QC materials (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). Viral penetration through the material pores was likely increased after saturation because of changes in pore structure, surface tension, fluid polarity and capillary action<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">The conditions applied in this study surpassed the recommendations for PPE use provided by the manufacturers and applied in current standards. Kimberly Clark recommends that neither the KC 200 or KC 300 N95 respirators be used in elevated temperature (&#x0003e;25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) or relative humidity (&#x0003e;60%). Dupont does not recommend the use of the Tyvek Micro Clean hood for biohazard protection but for use in controlled environments such as clean-rooms. The ASTM standards, condition fabric samples for a minimum of 24&#x02009;hours to 21&#x02009;+/&#x02212;&#x02009;5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 30&#x02013;80% relative humidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Other limitations of our study include not measuring the surface tension of liquids on the material coupons or measuring the volume of PBS each mask absorbed after 30&#x02009;minutes. We acknowledge that the use of PBS (pH 7) may not accurately represent perspiration of a human being, one of the pre-defined causes of saturation. However, it would be difficult to more closely model how human sweat directly affects the permeability of protective materials, because of the complex interactions between the solute, material and other environmental factors.</p><p id="Par12">The possible penetration of Ebola virus through liquid stressed (saturated) PPE should impact future concepts and strategies of infection prevention and control in tropical environments. The negative impacts of saturation on the protection afforded by PPE should be considered and mitigated. PPE could either be re-designed for increased temperature transfer/gaseous exchange to reduce perspiration or to offer more complete protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The use of powered air purifying respirators should be discussed as they provide air circulation and liquid impermeable shielding to the wearer&#x02019;s face. The face is considered the most vulnerable region of the body to Ebola virus infection due to mucosal membranes of the eyes, nose and mouth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Even the use of highly protective PPE does not guarantee safety of HCWs or others exposed to Ebola virus because user error (i.e. improper donning/doffing or use of the equipment) may lead to exposure or heighten exposure risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">Continued investigation into the high incidence of HCW infections during the Ebola-Makona outbreak in West Africa has attributed numerous factors including lack of suitable PPE and its effective use, virus exposure in the community, reporting bias in epidemiological numbers and propensity for colleagues to treat each other forgoing personal safety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The contributions of the West African environment also deserve consideration. Teams deployed to the Ebola crisis in Guinea reported that excessive deforestation around ETU made daily temperatures very hot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Such extreme environmental conditions paired with the physical exertion of work within ETU likely caused HCW to perspire and the build-up of condensation on the inner surface of their equipment. These sources of saturation may have increased the risk of Ebola virus exposure. Although our understanding of Ebola is evolving, many questions remain. Specifically, can the PPE used in Ebola outbreaks be made more safe? And do current testing standards accommodate for the stress of outbreak scenarios?</p><p id="Par14">We propose a new model for testing the protection that Ebola virus PPE affords to the wearer which includes saturation (liquid stressing) of the tested materials in PBS or a like simulant of perspiration or condensation. Spun polyester fabrics used to manufacture PPE such as Tychem, Tyvek are subjected to the ISO 16604, ASTM F1670 and ASTM F1671 as benchmarks of liquid permeability and virus penetration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Masks are evaluated by three ASTM standards (F1862, F2101 and F2299) which test penetration of horizontal projection of synthetic blood, bacterial filtration efficiency and particulate penetration using latex spheres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. None of these standard tests factor for saturation/perspiration or challenge the material with infectious Ebola virus. In fact, the ASTM reference document F1671 states that protection afforded by protective material must be assessed on a pathogen-specific basis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Reviews on the usage of PPE in Ebola virus outbreaks call for more empirical evidence to aid in the selection of appropriate materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. As a solution they suggest that items of PPE should undergo testing in a BSL-4 facility following ISO or ASTM methodology and challenged with Ebola instead of a surrogate virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The bacteriophage Phi-X174 functions as a surrogate for blood-borne viruses in the ISO 16604 standard. We were unable to perform the standard using Ebola virus, because it requires a positive pressure apparatus not currently approved for use in high containment laboratories. Future efforts should aim to complete the aforementioned standards including saturation as a preconditioning factor with the Ebola virus or VSV as a surrogate. The methods of this work follow an amended QCT-2 method published as ASTM E2197 &#x02013; 11 and by the US Environmental Protection Agency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Generating knowledge of Ebola in environmental systems particularly the West African climate, will allow for better policy on hemorrhagic fever virus infection prevention control and outbreak management.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Limitations of the Study</title><p id="Par15">We wish to highlight that real world use of PPE may involve complex potentially risk amplifying conditions not recommended by the manufacturer or tested in standards. The experimental model we devised- liquid stress of PPE and challenge with high titre infectious Ebola virus- was intended to demonstrate a worst case scenario. This scenario did not incorporate available strategies to decrease the examined risks such as disinfection and removal of affected equipment. We hope that this work helps policy makers define acceptable levels of liquid stress such as perspiration or condensation during use of PPE.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Virus Stock Preparations</title><p id="Par16">Ebola virus Makona variant stocks (Ebola virus/H.sapiens-tc/GIN/2014/Makona-C05) were propagated in African green monkey kidney (VeroE6) cells (ATCC CRL-1586) within the Containment Level 4 (CL-4) laboratory at the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) of the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health (CSCHAH) located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.
