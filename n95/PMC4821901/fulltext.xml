tuberculosis infection in the hospital. The aims of this study were to develop and
validate an education program that teaches senior medical students how to wear and choose
the proper size and type of respiratory protective equipment (RPE), which may help reduce
the risk of contracting <bold><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </italic></bold>(MTB)
from patients. Overall, 50 senior medical students participated in this education program.
Methods of choosing the proper type of RPE, performing a fit check of the RPE, and
choosing a suitable mask size were taught by certified instructors using the real-time
quantitative fit test (QNFT). The validity of education program was evaluated with
qualitative fit test (QLFT) before and after the education as pass or fail. The education
program was effective, as shown by the significantly pass rate (increased 30 to 74%) in
the QLFT after the education program (<bold><italic>p</italic></bold>&#x0003c;0.05). Among
study participants, changing mask size from medium to small significantly increased the
pass rate (<bold><italic>p</italic></bold>&#x0003c;0.001). Incorporation of this program into
the medical school curriculum may help reduce risk of MTB infection in medical students
working in the hospital.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Education</kwd><kwd>Medical student</kwd><kwd>Respiratory protective device</kwd><kwd>Fit test</kwd><kwd>Tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>Industrial hygiene</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Korea is at intermediate risk for <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosiss </italic>(MTB)

public health problem for health care workers (HCWs) in Korea<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to a previous study, MTB infection accounted for 19.5% of
work-related infectious diseases in Korea from 2006 to 2011<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, the majority of HCWs (70.6%) considered MTB infection
to be a serious health problem. Thus, programs for preventing MTB in HCWs are needed.</p><p>Respiratory protective equipment (RPE) is recommended for HCWs to prevent the spread of MTB

disease was shown<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several countries have
already promulgated regular fit tests for HCWs working in the hospital to reduce incidence
of infection from patients. Although every HCW should undergo fit tests for the RPE they
use<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, these tests have not been used in

medical students complete clinical training courses during a clerkship in the training
hospital, and these individuals will also be clinicians as interns or residents in the near
future. Therefore, educating medical students on the proper usage of RPE is essential
because they are subject to MTB exposure in the hospital. However, no regular education
program that teaches appropriate RPE usage exists for medical students in Korea.</p><p>The aims of this study were to develop and validate an education program for medical

Medical College at the Catholic University of Korea who had just finished the
poly-clinical rotations periods. The education program was performed from July 2014 to
September 2014. The quantitative fit test (QNFT) was used to educate the medical students,
and the qualitative fit test (QLFT) was performed to analyze the rate of pass/fail before
and after the RPE education program. In the St. Mary&#x02019;s hospitals, the disposable RPEs have
been used, therefore, only disposable RPEs were verified by fit test. The sample size was
calculated to estimate an ideal number of participants for this education program. A
sample size of 50 participants was estimated to have sufficient power (80%) to determine a
true success rate of 74% (n=37) or 76% (n=38), assuming a 5% chance of a type I error and
a 20% chance of a type II error<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, a total of 50 senior medical students volunteered to participate in the present
study. The informed consent was obtained from participants. The study design, sampling
methods, statistics, and practice were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the
College of Medicine at The Catholic University of Korea (approval ID: MC14OISI0065).</p></sec><sec><title>Qualitative fit test (QLFT)</title><p>A QLFT was performed using a 3M Qualitative Fit-Testing tool (3M<sup>TM</sup>-FT10 kit,
3M Cp., St Paul, MN, USA). Before the fit test, a screening test was performed using a
sensitivity solution (0.83&#x02005;g of saccharin/100 ml of distilled water). All participants
passed the test. After the screening test, the participant drank 1 cup of water, gargled
his or her mouth with 2 cups of water, and left the experiment room. The participant
selected and donned the RPE. Procedures of the fit test consisted of normal breathing,
deep breathing, moving the head side to side, moving the head up and down, talking loudly,
and a second bout of normal breathing. The test solution was 100 times more concentrated
(83&#x02005;g of saccharin/100 ml of distilled water) than the sensitivity solution. The QLFT was
performed before and after the RPE education program.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative fit test (QNFT)</title><p>The Portacount Pro Plus 8038 (TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA) was used for the QNFT. This
instrument was capable of supporting the QNFT for N95 masks. The probe for QNFT was
installed at the midpoint between the nose and mouth. The QNFT procedures were similar to
those of the QLFT, with the addition of grimace, bend, and toe-touch movements. During the
QNFT, participants were able to monitor the changes in fit factors in real time.</p><p>All the processes for QNFT and QLFT were performed according to OSHA (29 CFR 1910.134)
standards<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Quality control of QLFT and QNFT</title><p>All practice and quality control processes were reviewed by two occupational physicians
and an industrial hygienist. Two occupational physicians (BJS and MJP), who were certified
by the 3&#x02005;M company to administer the FIT TEST (QLFT and QNFT) on June 20th 2014, performed
the fit test.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The
characteristics of participants were described as means and standard deviation (SD) for
continuous variables, and frequency and proportion (%) for categorical variables,
according to final fit test results. Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-tests and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>
tests were used to evaluate differences in continuous variables (such as age and
anthropometrical indices) and categorical variables, respectively, according to final fit
test results. To validate the RPE education program, the program should satisfy two
requisitions. First, the number of passed participants for final QLFT is up to 37 (74%) or
more will be considered as effective and valid education and practice program. The
<italic>McNemar</italic> test was used to compare the proportion of individuals who
passed the QLFT before and after the program with QNFT. Second, the statistical
significant changes at the <italic>NcNemar</italic> test for QLFT should be shown before
and after the education program with QNFT. A <italic>p</italic>-value less than 0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Education and practice program development</title><p>The scheme of the education and practice program for RPE is described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Structural assessment of successful respiratory protective equipment use.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="indhealth-54-177-g001"/></fig>. The program consist of the pre-evaluation with QLFT (pass/fail), the education and
practice program, and the post-evaluation with QLFT (pass/fail). The QLFT was used to
estimate the effectiveness of education program. The QNFT was used to educating the
medical students. The education and practice program consisted of three domains; choosing
the proper types of RPE, wearing RPE (which included a fit check), and choosing a suitable
mask size. All participants have donned four different respirators: VFlex 9102, VFlex
9102S, and 3M 1870 (3M Cp., St Paul, MN, USA), and procedure mask 82001 (YuHan-Kimberly,
Seoul, South Korea) during the QNFT. Wearing and fitting the different sizes of VFLEX
9102/9102S RPEs and monitoring the real-time fit factors of participants were designed to
find the proper RPE size for individual fitting. Passing the QNFT was regarded as
achieving a minimum fit factor of 100. Comparing the real-time fit factors between the N95
RPE (3M 1870) and procedure mask (surgical mask 82001) consisted of finding the
appropriate mask type after exposure to the tuberculosis droplet nuclei (1&#x02013;5
<italic>&#x000b5;</italic>m). Students were instructed on wearing and fit checks with
instruction figures (supplement 1), and were rechecked when participants switched to other
RPE. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Figure 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2 </label><caption><p>Scheme of education and practice program for respiratory protection equipments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="indhealth-54-177-g002"/></fig> summarized the process of education and practice program for respiratory protection

use of RPE significantly increased the pass rate of the QLFT of senior medical students in a
medical college in Korea.</p><p>Choosing the proper type of RPE is the most important factor to ensure adequate protection.
Currently, procedure or simple surgical masks are commonly used by HCWs. However, previous
studies indicate that surgical masks are not adequate for preventing MTB<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Although the filter for fluid resistance and bacterial filtration efficiency is confirmed by
the manufacturers, the facial fit and protection factors are not certified or
guaranteed<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Leakages can occur
through the gaps between the face and mask. Therefore, comparing real-time fit factors
between procedure masks or simple surgical masks and N95 RPE was one of the education points
to inform the medical students of the proper RPE type to prevent MTB infection.</p><p>Fit check is important to prevent leakage<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, participants wore three RPE types and one
procedure mask, and performed fit checks and tests four times for each device. The repeated
checks and tests may increase the pass rate by providing feedback on necessary adjustments.
Ciotti <italic>et al.</italic> found that those who performed the fit test three times on
RPEs had a successful fit test of 60&#x02013;90%, whereas 0&#x02013;60% of those who tested only one mask
had a successful fit test<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. However,
Ciotti <italic>et al.</italic> emphasized that this approach will only achieve a rate of
100% if the RPE is adapted correctly to the facial anthropometry of the participant<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Most commercial RPE is made according to the facial anthropometrical standards of
individuals in US or European countries. Due to the racial differences between Koreans and
westerners, medium sizes of RPE may be too large or have a poor fit for Korean individuals.
Therefore, several previous studies have aimed to measure and find the proper size of RPE
for Korean anthropometrical dimensions<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Unfortunately, we were unable to find the N95 RPE for hospital use that was available in
both medium and small sizes. Thus, the VFlex 9102 and 9102S were selected to teach the
proper size of RPE to use in this study. The small- and medium-size RPE was a sister model
of N95 RPE (3M VFlex 9105), which was the same product but was available under a different
model number in a different country (which was confirmed by the 3&#x02005;M manufacturer). After
wearing two different sizes in the real-time QNFT, participants likely learned which size
fit them most appropriately, which was indicated by the increase in QLFT pass rates after
education. Over sixty percent of individuals (n=9 of 14) who failed the test before the
program with the medium size passed the test after the program, suggesting that the small
size based on Western facial anthropometry may be a better fit for the Korean participants.
However, the present study was focused on the effectiveness of education for appropriate RPE
fitting and not to verify the proper sizing of RPE for Koreans. Thus, further evaluation of
proper RPE size in a Korean population should be performed.</p><p>The minimum fit factor for a successful fit test was set at 100 in the present study based
on previous research<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. After QNFT, the RPE
size that was successfully fit tested (small or medium size) was recommended as the proper
size. Previous studies have shown discordance between fit test results and the workplace
protection factor<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, the results of the fit test in the present study do not
translate to a perfect protection from MTB or other hazardous materials in the real setting,
which may be a significant limitation for adopting this education program in the real
setting. However, several studies have estimated a significant correlation between the fit
test results and protection factor in the workplace (R<sup>2</sup>=0.38&#x02013;0.55)<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to US government documents for RPE, an assigned protection
factor of 10 was recommended to indicate RPE safety, and the fit factor should be over 100
to satisfy this level<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Even with this
guideline, participants failed the fit test even when abiding by the recommendations of the
QNFT. Follow-up evaluation is warranted to reinforce the applicability of this RPE education
program to HCW safety.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, the QLFT was used to verify the effectiveness of
the education program for RPE. The QLFT with saccharin is a subjective test that depends on
the ability of the participant to taste sweetness<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, and those who have deficits in olfactory senses were unable to
complete the QLFT. Therefore, we used the sensitivity test with diluted saccharin before the
QLFT to ensure that the participants were capable of tasting the saccharin in the QLFT. All
of our participants passed the sensitivity test, and instructors were certified to
administer QLFT before this study. Second, although there were two QLFTs (a sweet kit with
saccharin and a bitter kit with denatonium benzoate), we only used the QLFT with saccharin
in this study due to a previous report of adverse effects associated with denatonium
benzoate<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Third, this study was
designed to validate the effectiveness of the newly developed education program for RPE, and
therefore the predictive factors for failing the fit test were not assessed. Further
evaluation and measures should be performed to protect those who failed the fit test.
Fourth, the QNFT was not used to pre-post education program. While the QNFT the count
numbers of particle in/out side of RPEs were shown in the monitor. To reduce the
student&#x02019;s</p><p>The present study had several strengths. Previous studies have aimed to validate specific
components such as effectiveness of RPE type, size, or fit check<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Those components are important to protect users, and the
RPE would be useless if one of those components was not satisfied. Therefore, actual
practices in the present study consisted of choosing proper types of RPE, wearing RPE
(including a fit check), and choosing a suitable mask size to determine RPE fit.
Furthermore, we controlled for potential confounders such as cigarette smoking, eating, and
shaving facial hair before the fit test.</p><p>In conclusion, the present education program for RPE use for medical students was
effective, as shown by the increase in the pass rate of the QLFT after taking this course.
Thus, including this program in the regular curriculum of medical schools may help to reduce
the risk of MTB infection in medical students working in the hospital. Moreover, further
studies on possible countermeasures for those who failed the fit test should be
performed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pdf_001"><caption><title>Supplement figure</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="indhealth-54-177-s001.tif" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e937" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge Dr. Bum-Seok Cho for being a model of fit check in the figure.
