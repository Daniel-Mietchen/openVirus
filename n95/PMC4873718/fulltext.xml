The use of surgical masks as a means of source control has not been quantified in terms of reducing exposure to others. We designed an <italic>in vitro</italic> model using various facepieces to assess their contribution to exposure reduction when worn at the infectious source (Source) relative to facepieces worn for primary (Receiver) protection, and the factors that contribute to each. In a chamber with various airflows, radiolabeled aerosols were exhaled via a ventilated soft-face manikin head using tidal breathing and cough (Source). Another manikin, containing a filter, quantified recipient exposure (Receiver). The natural fit surgical mask, fitted (SecureFit) surgical mask and an N95-class filtering facepiece respirator (commonly known as an &#x0201c;N95 respirator&#x0201d;) with and without a Vaseline-seal were tested. With cough, source control (mask or respirator on Source) was statistically superior to mask or unsealed respirator protection on the Receiver (Receiver protection) in all environments. To equal source control during coughing, the N95 respirator must be Vaseline-sealed. During tidal breathing, source control was comparable or superior to mask or respirator protection on the Receiver. Source control via surgical masks may be an important adjunct defense against the spread of respiratory infections. The fit of the mask or respirator, in combination with the airflow patterns in a given setting, are significant contributors to source control efficacy. Future clinical trials should include a surgical mask source control arm to assess the contribution of source control in overall protection against airborne infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Aerosol</kwd><kwd>environmental controls</kwd><kwd>respirator</kwd><kwd>surgical mask</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="25"/><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the past decade, the appearance of novel airborne viruses and the reemergence of tuberculosis have posed major public health threats.

Our study assesses the efficacy of surgical masks in providing secondary protection to healthcare workers and others in relation to masks and respirators used for personal protection.</p><p>Diaz and Smaldone recently modeled effects of mask-related aerosol transmission between individuals.

<sup>]</sup> As shown in <xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>, they included environmental airflow in the room and mask protection, both deflection (e.g., face seal leakage) and filtration effects, with masks placed on either the infectious Source or the Receiver. The contribution of deflection (outward leakage around the faceseal perimeter) was determined comparing N95 with and without a Vaseline seal. They found that source control (mask on the Source) was often 3&#x02013;300&#x000a0;times more effective than a mask on the Receiver. Interactive factors in that study were limited to tidal breathing, negative pressure room effects, and use of a hard plastic manikin. To further study the model of Diaz and Smaldone, using a new soft realistic manikin, we expanded the <italic>in vitro</italic> bench model to test three airflow environments during tidal breathing and coughing.

We constructed a scale model of a single patient room in our hospital (204 ft<sup>3,</sup> 6.25 ft length x 5.25 ft width x 6.25 ft height). Three different flow regimes were chosen (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>): (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A) no ambient airflow (0 air exchanges per hour), all air movement in the chamber was secondary to the coughing or breathing of the Source and the Receiver; (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B) a model of a typical Hospital room fitted with an input and output ceiling fan (6 air exchanges per hour);<sup>[</sup>

<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>
<sup>]</sup> Proper direction of flow in the negative pressure room was checked using smoke tests. Chamber flow in ft<sup>3</sup>/min (CFM) was adjusted by regulating the fans using a balonometer (model 6200D; Alnor, Huntington Beach, CA). CFM was converted to air exchanges per hour (ACH) using the formula: ACH = (CFM x 60&#x000a0;min)/(Room Volume in Cubic Feet). Relative humidity and temperature of the chamber were measured daily and ranged from 33&#x02013;58% and 21.0&#x02013;22.8&#x000b0;C, respectively. We adjusted airflow in the chamber using a scaling factor. This factor was defined as the ratio of the volume of a hospital room to our chamber, e.g., 8.41 to create ventilation at both 6 ACH (171 CFM) and 12 ACH (343 CFM). This adjustment was necessary because our ventilatory parameters (e.g., tidal and cough volume) were for normal individuals but the test chamber volume was smaller than a standard room.<sup>[</sup>
<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>]</sup> As the volume of the test chamber decreases relative to tidal volume, the contribution of tidal volume per breath increases proportionately, thus increasing particulate concentration per breath relative to a decreased room volume. To correct for this air exchange flow must be proportionately increased.<sup>[</sup>

This maneuver was repeated 20&#x000a0;times over an 8-min collection period. The Receiver maintained a tidal breathing pattern during the coughing. The chamber was washed out with clean air between experiments to prevent cross contamination.

Nebulizer output was constant over the eight minute period. In separate experiments, the distributions of particle aerodynamic diameters at the Source and the Receiver manikin heads were measured by cascade impaction (Marple 8-stage impactor; Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA; 2 L per minute flow) (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>).

</p><p>The effect of each mask intervention in reducing exposure is best illustrated by the change in RPF (<xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>). There were important differences observed between the rooms. For the room with no airflow, mask on Source was statistically superior for the SecureFit Ultra fitted surgical mask and N95 respirator with and without a Vaseline seal. The only mask to provide significantly different results on the Receiver was the N95 with a Vaseline seal. Differences between mask types were significant indicating that the major mechanism of protection was filtration. Similar findings were seen in the Hospital room, that is, with better filtration, exposure was reduced with an N95 with and without a Vaseline seal on Source or Receiver. Review of RPF data for the Hospital room indicates that, in general, exposure was lower (higher RPF) when the respirator was on the Source. However, this was not statistically significant. In the Negative pressure room applying either surgical mask or respirator to the Source resulted in statistically significant reductions in exposure, while on the Receiver only the N95 with or without a Vaseline seal afforded similar protection. While there were significant differences between some masks (e.g., capture efficiency effect, SMnat vs. N95&#x000a0;vs. N95vas), in the Negative pressure room, the major differences in exposure were due to outward leakage of particles around the faceseal perimeter (deflection) at the Source. In this environment, deflected particles are rapidly carried away by the airstream. This observation is most evident by comparing RPF between the Source and Receiver. Each mask on the Source markedly reduced receiver exposure even if the mask had a poor capture efficiency. Here, deflection was the important mechanism in reducing receiver exposure.</p></sec><sec id="s0003-0003"><title>Exposure and mask protection: cough</title><p>Data for cough are shown in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref> and the lower panel of <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>. Compared to tidal breathing there are major differences in magnitude and mechanisms of exposure. In general, for all rooms, mask on Source was superior to mask on Receiver. Results were relatively insensitive to capture efficiency, that is, compared to an N95 on the Receiver, the natural fit surgical mask on the Source was either as effective (No flow room and Hospital room) or more effective (Negative pressure room). Compared to tidal breathing, the reduction of exposure from coughing is likely a function of impaction of larger particles in any mask or respirator placed on the Source.</p></sec><sec id="s0003-0004"><title>Filtration at the source</title><p>Mask capture efficiency (capture of particles exiting at the Source) for the various facepieces is demonstrated in <xref rid="f0006" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>. For tidal breathing (upper panel) a typical capture efficiency pattern was observed. That is, the natural fit surgical mask captured particles poorly due to outward leakage around the faceseal perimeter (&#x0223c; 5&#x02013;20%). With a better-fit and reduced mask leakage using the SF surgical mask filters &#x0223c; 50%, the N95 &#x0223c; 80&#x02013;90%, and a sealed N95 &#x0223c;100%. During coughing a different pattern was observed (<xref rid="f0006" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref> - lower panel). Capture efficiency of particles was increased for both surgical masks and respirators, such that with the increased fit provided by the SF, both the SF surgical mask and the N95 capture &#x0223c; 100% of the exhaled aerosol.

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s0004"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our data quantifies the potential synergy of source control using facepieces and personal protection using respiratory protection devices. Combined with environmental controls, source control can be more effective than personal protection alone.</p><p>Our study focused on the use of masks and respirators as a means to reduce environmental contamination via barrier protection at the source and does not suggest or support the use of surgical masks as a means of respiratory protection. Nor does it address the many variables associated with such protection, such as infectious dose and transmission modes, all of which may vary significantly with each infectious threat. Rather, we utilize <italic>in vitro</italic> respiratory protection measurements such as RPF as a means to correlate exposure reduction with source control to that achieved through the use of different masks or respirators on the Receiver. Our findings support the use of facemasks as a potentially reliable and consistent means of infection control, akin to other environmental controls such as respiratory etiquette, hand washing, physical partitions and engineering controls such as negative pressure isolation rooms. While &#x0201c;patients&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;HCW&#x0201d; are used here to identify the most obvious &#x0201c;Sources&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Receivers&#x0201d; within a hospital setting, our data would likely apply to any combination of potential &#x0201c;Sources&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Receivers,&#x0201d; e.g., hospital visitors, HCW who have not received influenza flu shots or patients within healthcare settings such as emergency rooms and physician office waiting rooms.</p><p>While clinical studies are needed to confirm our observations, analysis of the mechanisms of exposure illustrated in <xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> combined with our quantitative data suggests source control as an approach to reducing exposure. For example, if the patient in a negative pressure room were to wear a surgical mask for a period of time prior to the entry of a HCW, e.g., for several air exchanges, exposure would be significantly reduced. This observation applies to all the rooms but the magnitude of the effect depends on the interaction of source control and the room's environment, as observed in the Negative pressure room.</p><p>Our data may help in designing better masks. In the Hospital room, when there was an increased outward leakage at the Source (e.g., less aerosol captured by the mask) there was reduced protection (reduced RPF) at the Receiver. Reducing facepiece resistance would reduce outward leakage and may compensate for flaws with the fit of a mask.<sup>[</sup>

</p><p>During coughing, source control was clearly superior to masking the Receiver. In the Negative pressure chamber, placing a natural fit surgical mask (S-SMnat) on the Source during coughing reduced exposure approximately 1,500-fold (RPF = 1587), compared to the extreme of sealing an N95 respirator (R-N95-vas) to the face of the receiver (RPF = 17). This observation was due to the combined effects of the impaction of expelled particles on the mask (<xref rid="f0006" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>) and extraction of deflected particles by the flow of air in the room. These findings were consistent with the results reported by Cheong and Phua<sup>[</sup>
<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>]</sup> who found that, in a negative pressure room, placing the exhaust vent on the wall behind the patient's bed, as in our experiments, was more effective in removing pollutants than having the exhaust vent in the ceiling above the patient.<sup>[</sup>

</p><p>Our study has several limitations. Directions of airflow and head position were fixed and changes in direction may affect our observations. In addition, in an actual hospital setting, the airflow and ventilation may vary based on room design, location of vents and position of the patient and HCW. Our head positions and airflow were in an optimized direction for HCW protection, from Receiver to Source. This may enhance the reported effect of Source control. However, the parameters we have chosen for ventilation and airflow magnitude and direction are typical for those reported for hospital rooms in previous studies.<sup>[</sup>
<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>]</sup> In addition, Lindsley et&#x000a0;al. found that exposure to potentially infectious aerosols anywhere in the room was unaffected by head position.<sup>[</sup>

</p><p>Our aerosols are aqueous and particle distributions will be affected by changes in ambient relative humidity. While relative humidity of the ambient air varied, wet nebulizers provide saturated air so the aerosols leaving the Source manikin always are insensitive to room air humidity.</p><p>Our study does not use formal fit-testing methods to arrive at protective RPF values, but we utilize set of measurements to arrive at an equivalent fit factor (e.g., a reduction in exposure due to use of a mask). Fit testing of manikins is complex as reported in our previous study, which focused on the effects of testing different types of manikins on our measurement of fit.<sup>[</sup>
<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>
<sup>]</sup> As we reported in that study, improved fit was readily quantified by our techniques allowing a separation of effects caused by changes in Source control and/or changes in fit at the Receiver. Many manikin studies simply seal the facepiece to the manikin to avoid this issue. We feel that our sealed and unsealed results provide an increased understanding of the interaction between factors involved with actual exposures beyond that of only Receiver protection alone.</p><p>Our data should help design future clinical trials. A source control arm should be included in tests of mask and respirator effectiveness.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Lorraine Morra for her assistance in performing the experiments and creating the manuscript and figures.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="cit0001"><element-citation publication-type="journal">
