tuberculosis in the bacillary phase, and d) having a formal Healthcare-associated
Infection Control Committee (HICC).</p><p>Selected variables were used to characterize the participant institutions and to

calculate the indicators. These variables included the number of active beds; the
average prevalence of daily (or monthly) inpatients with pulmonary orlaryngeal
tuberculosis bacillus and aerosol precautions indicated, number of employees in the
institution, and nature of the institution (public / private / philanthropic).</p><p>Data were collected using a standardized form, and the time was measured using a

the time spent to collect each indicator. Periods of interruption and time intervals
were deducted from the overall time span of the activity. Also, the time spent on
healthcare facility characterization, as well as the time required to access the
hospital facilities (reception, elevators, etc.) was not included in data collection.

</p><p> All evaluated facilities had the same recommendation for the use of a N95 particulate
respirator: to put it on in the anteroom or in the hallway before entering the room of a
patient with known or suspected pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis bacillus.</p><p>The TORPS indicator resulted in minimal effort and time spent on its application in all
institutions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>) Regarding the TOSCI
indicator, the information necessary for its calculation was not found in five of the
six health institutions. Several arguments were used to report the absence of the use of
Tuberculosis Skin Test (TST): lack of trained personnel to perform the test, the
porosity of collection, frequent lack of HCW follow-up for appropriate characterization
of the reaction; difficulty in identifying the exact time period of the HCW's exposure
to the mycobacterium. </p><p>The TOI indicator was collected in five of the six institutions; there was only one
healthcare facility in which data were not organized in such a way that it could be
collected. The time used to collect this indicator was not toolong, but depended on the
level of data organization. </p><p>The TOPWC indicator required greater time for calculation(<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>)<italic>.</italic> To note, public hospitals were more likely
to require less time to collect data than the private sector. In public hospitals there
are usually more patients admitted with tuberculosis, therefore it was possible to
observe two or more patients simultaneously, thus reaching 51 observations more
rapidly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Many quality indicators have been proposed in the literature, however few have been
evaluated regarding their feasibility for application, which creates a gap between
theory and practice. Nevertheless, the recommendation for their use is quite frequent.
To our knowledge, the present study is the first to evaluate the feasibility of quality
indicators, using as the criterion the time spent on administering /
calculatingthem.</p><p>Information on quality of care depends upon data availability. Therefore, quality is
difficult to measure without correct and consistent information, which is often
unavailable<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>. A previous study evaluated the feasibility of quality indicators related to
radical prostatectomy and concluded that indicators not obtaining more than 25.9% of the
necessary information were considered unenforceable<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>. It has also been previously shown that quality indicators for antibiotic
treatment of complicated urinary tract infections were considered feasible if the data
necessary to score the indicator can be abstracted from the available data for &#x0003e;70%
of cases<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>. Indicators should require ease of obtaining data or ease of availability of the
data as a condition of feasibility, resulting in minimal effort and additional cost<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>. Because time spent on data gathering and analysis reflects both on efforts and
cost, less time means higherf easibility.</p><p>Although time spent on the application of quality indicators of an occupational
tuberculosis prevention program may vary in different healthcare facilities, some common
features were noted from this study. For instance, the indicator that evaluated the
structure of the program (TORPS) proved to be highly feasible. This indicator has
characteristics suggestive of being used for external audits and evaluations. On the
other hand, the process indicator (TOPWC) requires greater dedication of professional
time for its application. This indicator should be used preferentially by healthcare
facilities that have a higher number of in-patients requiring special precautions for
tuberculosis, aiming to evaluate compliance with the use of the N95 mask by HCWs. As a
suggestion, TOPWC could be applied biannually, or after major intervention and training
programs.</p><p>It is a matter for discussion as to why, despite recommendations, some healthcare
facilities in Brazil are not using the TST routinely, as we demonstrated in our sample.
As an outcome to be measured, it was shown that the indicator for skin conversion
(TOSCI) was not feasible due to this lack of compliance. The Centers for Disease Control
recommends the use of the TST whenever there is the possibility of high exposure to
tuberculosis<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>. HCWs should be periodically screened for latent tuberculosis infection using
TST. As pointed out, concerning the healthcare facilities, many operational issues can
interfere in the process. Among these issues, are the high turnover of HCWs, the
limitations of the TST interpretation, and a potential booster effect of the BCG
vaccine<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>.In order to overcome the booster effect, a two-step TST has been suggested in
the literature<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>.The TST has a high sensitivity, but lacks specificity in a vaccinated
population, such as the HCWs in Brazil. Due to this feature, countries such as France
and Japan are now recommending, with some restrictions, the gama-interferon release
assays as a substitute for TST<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref>. To note, in our sample, none of the healthcare facilities that were not using
TST provided any other screening measure as a substitute. </p><p>The main outcome indicator (TOI), which measures the incidence of cases of tuberculosis
among HCW, is quite simple to obtain, provided the Occupational Medicine Service has a
structured form to record such cases. Usually cases of occupational tuberculosis are not
as frequent as to warrant a great deal of effort in recording them. Besides this, the
number of exposed HCWs is, in general, quite steady and does not require a sophisticated
system to collect the information. Despite this, many healthcare facilities are not
aware of monitoring the annual incidence of occupational cases of tuberculosis. </p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) shows that tuberculosis mortality in Brazil in 2013
was 3.2/100.000 and the prevalence was 57/100.000<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref>. Some authors have published similar results. A Peruvian study found a
tuberculin test conversion incidence in medical students of approximately 3%<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>. A Brazilian study conducted in Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil, where the
tuberculosis incidence rate is 23/100.000, had the cooperation of 251 HCWs. The TST
conversion was 5.1%, with the risk of infection of 1.4<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref>. A study aimed to identify the TST conversion rate of HCWs with previously
negative TST results who had been working for less than 1 year in a hospital in
Botswana, where tuberculosis is highly endemic. This population had a conversion rate of
4.2% for the entire group studied, or 6.87 per 1000 person-weeks<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>A Chinese study showed that the health care workers' annual tuberculosis notification
rates were lower than the general population. Healthcare workers with tuberculosis were
a mean of 35.5 years old, with females out numbering males (58.0%&#x0003e;42.0%). The
proportion of pulmonary tuberculosis was significantly higher among the women compared
with men (88.5%&#x0003e;83.4%, p = 0.031). This study suggested that the priority for
tuberculosis prevention in healthcare institutions should be given to the young female
HCWs<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>.</p><p> An Argentinean study that included 15,276 HCWs from 15 centers found a mean incidence
rate of tuberculosis in 111.3/100,000 HCWs<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref>; A Brazilian study demonstrated incidence rates in the general population of
approximately 62/100,000, a prevalence of tuberculosis infection in HCW of 63.1% and an
annual rate of tuberculin conversion of 10.7%<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref>. In such an epidemiologic context, monitoring the incidence of occupational
tuberculosis and the TST conversion can aid institutions in planning and evaluating
strategies for occupational tuberculosis prevention, as demonstrated by other
authors<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>With 1.5 million deaths in 2013 and 5.7 million new cases of tuberculosis disease, the
WHO goal is to dramatically reduce the global burden of tuberculosis by 2015<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref>. For this control, it will be necessary to include the successful development
and application of new drugs, diagnostics, vaccines, and prevention tools as well as a
clearer understanding of the impact of social and economic determinants of this disease
in the health sector. The quality indicators of programs for prevention of occupational
tuberculosis evaluated in the present study were shown to be feasible. Since HCWs have
2- 50 times the chance of acquiring the disease than people in the general population,
these indicators can help institutions prevent occupational tuberculosis. Therefore, we
recommend their application at least once a year in healthcare facilities that
frequently deal with patients affected by tuberculosis.</p><p>The results are limited by the small amount of participant institutions, which only
enables a suggestion of possible relationships between indicators and the institutional
profile. Further studies should include multiple institutions to enable the
investigation of relationships between the nature of the institution and the feasibility
of applying the quality indicators. , There were not many objective criteria found in
the literature that allowed for the evaluation of the applicability of indicators, so it
was decided to use time as a marker. However, we understand that this is a specific
perspective that limits the study.</p><p>This study brings new insight to the applicability of previously validated quality
indicators, revealing that even a validated indicator may not have all the properties of
applicability; this approach needs to be considered to suggest recommendations for their
use.</p><p>Moreover, strengths in the structure assessment, and weaknesses in the process and
outcomes assessments, have been identified. Areas to be improved include maintaining
periodic screening for latent tuberculosis using TST, monitoring the annual incidence of
occupational cases of tuberculosis, and evaluating compliance with occupational
prevention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The indicators to evaluate the structure for occupational tuberculosis prevention are
highly feasible. The feasibility of applying indicators for process and outcome is
limited, due to relevant differences in administrative issues at healthcare facilities,
such as the system for data archiving and management.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>To Esperan&#x000e7;a Abreu Santos, Vera L&#x000fa;cia Borrasca, Cristiane Schmitt, Anna Sara Levin,
