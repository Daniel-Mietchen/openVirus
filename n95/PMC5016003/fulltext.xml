</xref>. Aerosols are defined as smaller particles or equal to 5&#x003bc;m, that may or may not
contain an infectious agent and, due to their size, can remain suspended in the
atmosphere for hours, slowly being transported over long distances and achieve adjacent
areas<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>.</p><p>Aerosols containing an infectious agent that remain in the environment can be inhaled by
susceptible individuals, even if there is no close contact with the disposing source, or
contaminated surfaces<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>. The main diseases transmitted by aerosols are tuberculosis, measles and chicken
pox. However, there are reports of aerosolization of other microorganisms such as fungi,
<italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> and <italic>Staphilococcus aureus</italic>

lay on the floor or other surfaces due to gravity. Its liquid portion can evaporate,
depending on the environmental conditions, resulting in aerosols. There are slight
variations of the nomenclature and definition of sizes, however the Brazilian National
Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) uses the definition that aerosols are smaller than
5&#x003bc;m, which was adopted for this study<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. </p><p>Ventilation systems and air conditioning in various establishments promote comfort, and
are useful in the prevention and treatment of diseases transmitted via aerosols. The use
of these systems in health services (HS) requires special attention. The basic
differences stem from the need to restrict the dispersion of air within an environment
to adjacent areas; the specific requirements for ventilation and filtration aiming to
dilute and eliminate contamination; the different requirements of temperature and
humidity for each area; and sophistication that is demanded for the project<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Among hospital sectors that require air pressure control, temperature and humidity we
highlight the Central Service Department (CSD). The CSD is responsible for medical
device (MD) from one use to another, it must contain a reception and cleaning room; a
preparation and sterilization room; a chemical disinfection room (where applicable); a
monitoring area of the sterilization process and a storage and distribution of sterile
materials room<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>The RDC Resolution 15, of March 15, 2012 from ANVISA, disposes on the good practice
requirements for the processing of MD and other measures. According to this resolution,
the CSD class II (which processes complex materials) and processing companies must
maintain a negative differential air pressure between the cleaning area and adjacent
areas<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>. The areas adjacent to the reception and cleaning room consist mainly of the
preparation and sterilization room of MD and circulation areas of other
professionals.</p><p>Differential ambient air pressure means that there is a difference in measuring the
relative air pressure between two areas. This parameter works to provide a positive or
negative pressure within a particular area in order to prevent air from migrating from
one to the other. If a room has a negative air pressure it means that the air supply is
less than the exhaustion<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>With the growing concern for the safety of patients and health professionals, there is a
need for implementation of best practices that should be based on proven scientific
evidence. Thus, the objective of this systematic literature review was to analyze the
scientific evidence for the formation of aerosols during the MD cleaning activities in
CSD and the impact of negative air pressure, or to the safety of the material to be
sterilized, and for health professionals in the adjacent areas too.</p></sec><sec><title>Method </title><p>The steps of this systematic review followed the guidelines published in the
<italic>Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis</italic>
(PRISMA) Statement, which aims to help the authors to carry out complete and clear
records of a systematic review and meta-analysis<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>It was defined as the guiding question of this review: Formation of aerosols occurs
during cleaning activities of MD, and what is the impact of negative air pressure in the
dispersion of these to adjacent areas?</p><p>Inclusion criteria were defined as the PICO strategy as follows: P (Patients) = health
professionals or MD cleaning professionals; I (Intervention) = negative pressure; C
(Comparison) = normal atmospheric pressure; O (Outcome) = dispersion of aerosols. After
an initial search in major databases and query in the manuals and guidelines, we
identified the lack of studies, both experimental and field, published specifically
regarding the CSD. Therefore, it was defined as inclusion criteria: a. Studies published
in full, regardless of the publication date and language; b. Clinical studies,
experimental studies, guidelines, manuals and national and international technical
standards; c. Studies that reported data on the justification for the presence of
negative differential ambient air pressure in MD cleaning area; d. Studies that have
addressed the formation of aerosols or droplets during the MD cleaning procedures.
Exclusion criteria were defined as: a. Reviews of unsystematic or editorial literature;
b. Studies where there was only review of the dispersion aerosols; c. Studies that
evaluated other air treatment modes.</p><p>Initially a consultation of experts in the field of air treatment methods in Health
System was held with the clinical engineers and professionals from the Brazilian
Association of Refrigeration, Air Conditioning and Heating - (ABRAVA in Portuguese).
These experts were asked about the scientific evidence of the need for negative
differential ambient air pressure in CSD, which indicated guidelines, manuals and
national and international technical standards for consultation. These documents were
accessed through the websites of organizations such as the National Health Surveillance
Agency (ANVISA), <italic>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</italic> (CDC) and
the <italic>Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation</italic> (AAMI).
The documents that were not available on the Internet were obtained from the
documentation center of ABRAVA, such as technical standards and booklets of: Brazilian
Association of Technical Standards (ABNT), <italic>American Society of Heating,
Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers</italic> (ASHRAE) and the
<italic>American Institute of Architects</italic> (AIA). </p><p>Initially, to search for scientific articles, consultations were held on portal
descriptors encyclopedias (<italic>MeSH - Medical Subject Headings</italic> do PUBMED)
and ("CINAHL Titles" - <italic>Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health
Literature)</italic>, to identify descriptors related to the inclusion criteria.
However, to ensure access to all potentially eligible studies, keywords were also used.
Therefore, the following descriptors were selected: <italic>equipment and
supplies</italic>; <italic>health personnel</italic>; <italic>ventilation</italic>;
<italic>air pressure</italic>; <italic>aerosols</italic>; <italic>atmospheric
pressure</italic>. And the keywords: <italic>devices</italic>; <italic>health
worker</italic>; <italic>negative pressure</italic>; <italic>HVAC system</italic>
(<italic>heating ventilation and air conditioning</italic>);
<italic>bioaerosol</italic>; <italic>airborne</italic>; <italic>droplet</italic>;
<italic>droplet nuclei</italic>. </p><p>As a search strategy, the website and databases were consulted as follows: PUBMED and
SCOPUS - the controlled descriptors of MESH were primarily used in a single search box.
In CINAHL - through the feature "CINAHL Titles" preferably with the expanded definition
of the term, with the search first being carried out with all titles separately and
later combining the titles using the Boolean operators. In the <italic>Web of
Science</italic> - the controlled descriptors of MESH and synonym keywords were used.
Access to Embase was restricted in the country at the time of data collection. Filters
were not used in the bases and the Boolean AND operator was used to cross the data
between the descriptors of the PICO strategy. The OR operator was used to descriptors or
synonyms keywords. The search was carried out between March and April 2015, and updated
in June of the same year. The search strategies were built with the help of a librarian
expert in database.</p><p>Given the scarcity of scientific articles detected initially, it was decided to conduct
a comprehensive search, a large number of articles being found with crossings. The
titles and summaries of them were read, identifying potentially eligible articles. Thus,
68 articles were read in full by two of the authors of this review, individually, which
evaluated whether the articles corresponded to the established inclusion criteria. If
there were no correlation, the authors recorded the reason for the exclusion. A third
researcher was consulted when there were doubts and disagreements. </p><p>The manual search step was the consultation of all technical document references (when
mentioned), of the included articles and non-systematic reviews read in its entirety in
order to identify other potentially eligible studies.</p><p>The articles selected according to the inclusion criteria were analyzed separately by
two reviewers. After the critical reading, reviewers completed a table, prepared by two
of the authors of this review in Microsoft Excel, considering the concerned matter. The
table was composed of the following items: identification of the article; objective,
study outline; study site; aerosolizing mechanism; presence or absence of negative air
pressure environment; type of statistical analysis; main results; main conclusions;
recommendations for their practice; and finally limitations of the studies. Because of
gaps in the methodological descriptions and results, it was necessary to consult a third
reviewer to discuss the doubts of all articles. After establishing a consensus among
reviewers, a final table with all the relevant data extracted from the studies was
prepared.</p><p>The risk of bias was assessed according to the design of each study. Due to the
heterogeneity of the articles, it was decided to present the results descriptively.
Since laboratory experimental studies are not included in the reference classification
of evidence, studies of this review were classified as inconclusive, partly conclusive
and conclusive, considering the guiding question of this review.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Five technical documents and four scientific articles that met the inclusion criteria

equipment commonly used in the CSD: ultrasonic cleaner and scrubbers with pressurized
water.</p><p>In the study conducted with the ultrasonic cleaner<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>, air samples above the water surface in the washer tank were collected (the air
gatherer had a flexible termination that was placed inside the washing machine), aiming
to recover aerosols with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. Air specimens were
obtained in four moments: before the washer was turned on (during 15 minutes),
considering that the instruments were placed within it (five minutes), during its
operation (25 minutes), and after it was off (15 minutes); covered with a lid
(suggesting that all generated aerosols were from the washer); and with the lid off
(ambient air added to the aerosol generated by the washer). Samples from surfaces on
nine points around the washer (before and after collecting air samples) and from the
cleaning solution (10ml) were collected. By analyzing the four moments of air
collection, higher average of colonies per ft3 were found during the operation of the
washer. And when compared to the results of the samples with and without a lid,
statistically significant differences were found, with larger numbers of colonies
related to the operation with the lid, which means aerosols formed exclusively by the
operation of the washer. The results of surface samples were not influenced by the
aerosol, because there was no correlation between the number of colonies found before
and after the operation of the washing machine. The authors suggest that surface
contamination is related to cleaning solution leakage and dripping during the insertion
and removal of the MD, regardless of the washer being with or without the lid. There was
no apparent correlation between the contamination of the air and the cleaning solution.
The authors indicated that the ultrasonic cleaner should be used with the lid to
minimize the release of aerosols to the environment.</p><p>Regarding the formation of aerosols from automatic washers with pressurized water, in a
study<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>, surface cleaning was performed (wall) with an intentionally contaminated
prepared solution of organic food components added with microorganisms (<italic>Serratia
marcescens</italic>; spores of <italic>Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus
aureus</italic> positive coagulase, <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> and a
bacteriophage virus). The size of the aerosols generated after the use of a pressurized
automatic washer and cleaning with stiff bristle brush were compared. In addition, we
evaluated the number of viable microorganisms after cleaning only with water and a
disinfectant solution (sodium hypochlorite, benzalkonium chloride, peracetic acid,
detergents and phenolic disinfectants, non-toxic neutral liquid detergent). The wall was
infected one day prior to the collection of air samples, that occurred immediately
before, during and after the spraying of the cleaning solution / disinfection, through
two types of air collectors: <italic>Andersen sampler</italic> six stages (size
evaluation of the particles) and May air sampler (<italic>impingers</italic> -
quantitative evaluation). It was observed that after using the washer with pressurized
water and the collection with the <italic>Andersen sampler</italic> for 15 to 30
seconds, the number of colonies in the aerosol was greater compared to brushing (24,565
and 1628, respectively). Furthermore, 45.5% of the particles formed after the washer
with pressurized water correspond to the third and sixth stages of the gatherer (up to
6&#x003bc;m) and after brushing, 27.6%; therefore, aerosols generated by the washer were
smaller. For all the pathogens, the number of viable microorganisms per liter of air
collected were higher during the cleaning procedures, when compared to the numbers after
completion. When compared with washing only with water, all the cleaning solutions /
disinfection reduced the number of viable microorganisms in aerosols and the peracetic
acid solution was proved to be more effective. Comparative analyzes using statistical
tests were not performed.</p><p>In another study<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>, in order to evaluate the formation of aerosols during household activities, a
car cleaning experiment was conducted in a controlled environment, sealed with plastic.
Two ways of using the hose with pressurized water were tested: spraying (used for
rinsing) and a water jet with controlled flow (used to remove dirt), conventional (low
pressurization - manual trigger) and efficient (high pressurization). The authors used
three gauges of particle sizes not aiming to identify microorganisms in aerosols. It was
observed that when used in higher pressurization (efficient method), more and smaller
particles were identified (up to 2&#x003bc;m). However, there were no statistically significant
differences between the methods: efficient and conventional or between the spray modes
and jet. The authors reported that they observed the formation of visible fog in the
tent where the experiments were carried out, especially after the high pressurization
method, and cogitated they were hydrated aerosols, possibly lower than 500&#x003b7;m.</p><p>A study<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref> was included considering the possibility that the CSD could be equipped with hot
tap water. In this one, the formation of aerosols from showers and hot tap water
contaminated with <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> was evaluated. Samples were
collected for cultures of water from showers and faucets; <italic>Swabs</italic> of the
internal surface of those; air samples outside the scope of the shower jet; and samples
of 14 air rooms, where the gatherer was positioned 61cm away from the tap area. Two
types of air collectors were used: <italic>Andersen sampler</italic> six stages
(Calibrated to collect particles 0,65&#x003bc;m to 3,3&#x003bc;m in stages four, five and six and in
stages one, two and three particles larger than 3,3&#x003bc;m) and two stages (differentiation
only in two particle sizes: 0.8 to 8&#x003bc;m and greater than or equal to 8&#x003bc;m). Air samples
were collected before the tap was opened, while open, and after being closed. Of 19
paired samples of tap water or <italic>swab</italic> of the tap's nozzle and air
samples, in 17 water samples and in 13 air samples there was identification of bacteria
colonies. Eleven samples with positive cultures were obtained while the tap was open.
Aerosols generated by taps were fewer in number and larger in size when compared to
aerosols of the showers. No statistical tests were applied. </p><p>The summary of the results is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure

</xref>, where it is stated that in class II CSD a negative differential ambient air
pressure (minimum 2,5Pa) should be kept between adjacent areas. However, it was found
that both the national and international technical documents do not cite scientific
references that prove, with conclusive evidence, the risk of environmental exposure to
aerosols for both the MD and for professionals. The classification of CSD as level one,
related to the risk of adverse health events by exposure to ambient air<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>, states that this risk is not scientifically proven, but based on expert
opinions, which reinforces the need for research to generate data for the support of
laws, rules and recommendations. </p><p>As mentioned in the introduction of this study, microorganisms in the air of the CSD
environment can be related to two issues: inhalation by professionals and depositing of
them on the clean material in the preparation area. Regarding the last issue,
considering that the MD will be sterilized before use and that this method was designed
to eliminate all forms of microbial life<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>, by theoretical deduction, the possible air contamination of the MD can be
considered negligible.</p><p>It is noteworthy, in technical documentation, the need for environments with efficient
system of negative air pressure having automatic doors, that have all windows and floor
sealed, because the opening and closing of a door, associated with the movement of
people, immediately reduces the differential air pressure between the areas. In the case
of environments with a high circulation of people, as it occurs in the CSD cleaning
area, the construction of an anteroom should be considered <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">

efficiency in isolation rooms was demonstrated in the study by Adams, Johnson and
Lynch<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>. The air pressure differentials were measured between the room and the anteroom
and between the room and the hallway. The average in the aerosol count per m3 where
larger when there were greater movement of people and doors, however the aerosol score
decreased as the air pressure differential increased. The authors indicate a negative
air pressure differential of 20 Pa when there is heavy traffic between areas. In this
context, there is a need for routine monitoring of the pressure differential between the
areas, for example, by testing with the observation of the direction of smoke flow or
specific gauges<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Other parameters shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> relate to the
minimum and total number of air changes per hour. The ventilation and air conditioning
systems act favorably in controlling infections decreasing the time of exposure to
bioaerosols by means of air exchange and differential pressure. In addition, they
provide the dilution of the air through supplement and/or exhaustion, reducing the
concentration of contaminants; improving air quality by filtration; allowing control of
temperature and humidity; and creating air flow patterns<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>The need for negative air pressure in isolation rooms is strongly evidenced in the
literature, aiming to reduce the risk of exposure microorganisms transmitted by aerosol
infected people to uninfected people (especially other patients or professionals). The
advent of diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian flu and drug
resistant tuberculosis raises concern for health authorities in relation to the
isolation of patients<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">

of Verde and collaborators<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref>, the goal was to characterize the air pollution levels in different areas of the
hospital (emergency room, surgical ward and operating room). After finishing the
procedure, it was detected an increase in the concentration of bacteria in the air.
However, the contamination level returned to baseline values (collected in the empty
operating room) after cleaning procedures.</p><p>Bronchoscopy is a procedure recognized for its potential to generate aerosols, by
stimulating coughing patient leading to the contamination of the environment and
professionals. In the study by Lavoie and collaborators<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>, although it is not the main goal of the authors, sizes and aerosol
concentrations were compared in two bronchoscopy rooms, (one with negative differential
air pressure and one without). After statistical analysis, it was shown statistically
significant increase in the average concentration of aerosols per m3 in a non-negative
differential room during the performance of bronchoscopy, and there was no significant
increase in the room with differential. These data shows a greater contamination of the
air in rooms without negative pressure, while performing procedures that form aerosols.
Despite the concentration of aerosols return to baseline levels more quickly in the room
with negative differential air pressure after completion of the procedures, it took
fifteen minutes to the bioaerosols levels to return to baseline in both rooms.</p><p>The papers included in this review are in the majority originated in previous decades,
which demonstrates the need of current research conduction because there were advances
in the technology of the equipment used in CSD, for example, in ultrasonic cleaner. The
ultrasonic cleaner complement the manual cleaning or are self-cleaning in cleaning the
MD with simple conformation depending on the power of ultrasound. They are mainly
suitable for complementary cleaning of the complex forming MD and operate on the
principle of cavitation (sound waves propagated in an aqueous medium fragmenting rupture
or dirt adhered to products)<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">

aerosol when compared to conventional methods (brushing and low pressurization of
water). Considering the guiding question of this review and the fact that these
experiments were not performed in a CSD environment they were classified as partially
conclusive. On CSD, the pressurized water guns are used for crude dirt cleaning.

physicochemical processes such as evaporation, interaction with other particles,
transportation, gravity, temperature, relative humidity and air currents, among others.
There are reports that aerosols remain suspended in the same environment for years<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref>. Therefore, there is evidence of air pollution in the CSD cleaning area;
however, data on the permanence in the air and displacement of aerosols to adjacent
areas is lacking. A limitation of the studies included in this review was the lack of
control of environmental factors where the experiments were carried out, which may have
underestimated or overestimated the recovery of aerosols.</p><p>In a study of this review the contamination of water and air by <italic>Legionella

generated in cleaning activities. It is known that, in the chain of transmission of
infections, there is need for interaction between the elements: host susceptibility,

coughing, expiration, speech) and by the activities carried out there.</p><p>Given the above, this review has brought advances in scientific knowledge in the control
of air pollution in CSD, providing theoretical foundations for better understanding of
the phenomenon studied. It was found that aerosols are inevitably generated during the
MD cleaning activities, emphasizing the importance of the use of PPE among cleaning room
workers. Because of the risk of the deposition of contaminant particles, this data
reinforces the need for decontamination of surfaces touched associated with the hand
hygiene of professionals. Considering the aerosols generated during the operation of the
ultrasonic cleaner, it is recommended to use it with the lid closed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Scientific evidence showed that aerosols are generated during cleaning activities and
use of devices found in CSD such as the ultrasonic cleaner and the washer with
pressurized water. Although the need for a negative differential ambient air pressure
between the cleaning area and adjacent areas in CSD is standardized, no studies
evaluating its impact on the dispersion of aerosols were found, which could compromise
the safety of the material in the preparation room and the health of the cleaning room
professionals and the ones that circulate in the adjacent areas.</p><p>The studies have not provided information regarding the occupational health of workers
in the surrounding areas, but there are strong indications for the use of the N95 mask
by cleaning area workers. It demonstrates the need to conduct research on the occurrence
of occupational diseases in the workers of CSD.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Morawska</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Droplet fate in indoor environments, or can we prevent the spread of
