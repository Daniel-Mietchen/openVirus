More generally, there are limited data on the circulation and transmission patterns of influenza in GP practices. There is a need to better assess this, as well as to study preventive and protective measures specifically in GP practices, in order to make clear and adequate recommendations for this specific setting. In the meantime, it seems wise to recommend vaccination of staff and additional protective measures for healthcare workers (HCWs), by extrapolation from other healthcare settings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="s2"><title>Introduction</title><p>Seasonal influenza is a potentially serious illness and is responsible for an important part of the burden of infectious diseases worldwide.<sup><xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
</p><p>The three (non-mutually exclusive) transmission routes for influenza are aerosols, droplets, and direct contact.<sup><xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> All three transmission routes are present in the GP practice; for example, through close contact in the waiting area, desk surfaces, and the sharing of magazines with viral contamination.<sup><xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> NPIs are of particular interest in cases of high-risk individuals responding poorly to vaccination or with contraindication to vaccination, or when vaccination coverage is unknown, such as in the waiting room.<sup><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> HCWs in practices often use NPIs as protective measures during the influenza season, including masks, disinfectant hand gel dispensers, disinfectant wipes, surface disinfection, or social distancing through isolation of ill patients.<sup><xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>
</p><p>Influenza virus persistence on commonly-used equipment or desks is an important target for controlling viral transmission by contact.<sup><xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Many disinfection substances are proven for neutralising influenza virus on surfaces, but none has been specifically tested in practices.<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Furthermore, environmental factors, such as humidity and temperature, as well as individual factors, like aerosol production, may influence the transmission of influenza.<sup><xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>
</p><p>HCWs are especially at risk for seasonal influenza infection.<sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The relative risk ratio (RR) for unvaccinated HCWs to be infected is estimated to be three to four times higher than for comparable vaccinated adults.<sup><xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> HCWs build up a high basic immunity and therefore more often have pauci- or asymptomatic seasonal influenza compared to their patients, making them more likely to transmit the disease.<sup><xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Some studies have demonstrated that influenza transmission can be reduced in hospitals, institutions, and in the community by preventive and protective measures, depending on the adherence rates to these measures.<sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> However, a Cochrane review showed no conclusive evidence for vaccinating HCWs to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications (lower respiratory tract infections [RTIs], hospitalisation, or death due to lower RTIs), or to reduce all-cause mortality in older people living in care institutions.<sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Preventive measures are interventions before the illness appears and protective measures are interventions during the illness appearance.

Only one RCT measured the effectiveness of seasonal influenza prevention among GPs (in Flanders, during the two consecutive influenza seasons: 2002&#x02013;2004). The quality of the study was evaluated as moderate, mainly due to missing data in the intervention group in the second wave. In this study, Michiels <italic>et al</italic>
<sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> compared 177 vaccinated GPs (intervention) with 85 non-vaccinated GPs (control). Outcomes were the occurrence of RTI and symptomatic swab-confirmed seasonal influenza during the influenza season, and four-fold increase in influenza haemagglutination inhibition antibody titre (comparing pre-infection period [post-vaccination titres in vaccinated] with after-infection period). There was no difference in the number of GPs with an RTI between the intervention and the control group (RR 0.98, 95% CI = 0.76 to 1.27), and a trend towards protection against seasonal influenza infection was observed in the intervention group compared to the control group (RR 0.59, 95% CI = 0.28 to 1.24). When comparing only the occurrence of RTI that included a four-fold influenza hemagglutination inhibition antibody titre, a 72% decrease in infection was observed between the intervention and control groups (RR 0.28, 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.75). In multivariate analyses, influenza vaccination of GPs aged &#x02264;30 years was effective in preventing RTI, and seasonal influenza infection. GPs with a lower basic antibody titre against influenza and GPs with an influenza case in the family were more at risk for an episode of swab-positive seasonal influenza.<sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>

The samples were taken in October, January, and March, but only the samples during the annual influenza epidemic in March were tested for influenza virus. Viral RNA was detected on 11/52 (21%) tested toys; only one was an influenza B virus. Fifteen toys were sampled before and after cleaning in October. Out of six samples positive for picornavirus, four became negative after cleaning, while two negative samples became positive.

Only two studies were found that were specifically performed in practices. One study investigated the prevention of transmission of seasonal influenza through the vaccination of GPs, and the other was an interventional study about surface colonisation through respiratory viruses in waiting areas before and after surface disinfection. The study by Michiels <italic>et al</italic> showed a benefit of vaccinating GPs in practices, with a positive influence on seasonal influenza infection and RTI, although only among GPs aged &#x02264;30 years.<sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Pappas <italic>et al</italic>&#x02019;s study about surface colonisation showed a high colonisation of toys by respiratory virus in the waiting area, but no impact of cleaning the toys. Overall, there is a lack of evidence to support any intervention aiming to decrease influenza transmission in practice.<sup><xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>
</p></sec><sec id="s5-2"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This systematic review was strengthened by a predefined search strategy, with a broad initial literature search followed by secondary filtering. Many relevant studies were captured by performing an additional reference list search.</p><p>The study has some limitations. First, definitions for prevention and protection had to be determined by the author group, as consensus definitions do not exist in the literature. This might limit the generalisability of the results. However, the authors tried to adhere as closely as possible to WHO recommendations, and believe that the operational definitions used might be useful and acceptable to a larger audience. Second, the wide literature search complicates the selection and interpretation of the studies, and the identification of those studies actually performed in general practice, and thus it is difficult to make clear statements about what might or might not work in general practices. On the other hand, a wide search has the advantage that all possible studied interventions were captured, independent of the setting, which thus provides a broad picture of what could be useful in practices. It also sheds light on the gaps in knowledge relating specifically to studies performed in this setting (that is, in general practices) and those extrapolated from other settings. A further limitation is that the research had to be updated a second time.</p></sec><sec id="s5-3"><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>Although vaccination of HCWs in practices may be an effective measure to reduce transmission of seasonal influenza between patients and HCWs, there are no studies directly assessing its effectiveness in this setting. The GP is in constant contact with patients and is, therefore, at special risk of transmitting seasonal influenza infection and RTI. Michiels <italic>et al</italic> showed that vaccinating GPs can protect them from contracting seasonal influenza.<sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> No study showed the influence of the GP or their patients&#x02019; vaccination status on seasonal influenza transmission in the practice. Several studies with high risk of bias were performed in nursing homes where HCWs were vaccinated against seasonal influenza. A Cochrane review did not find conclusive evidence in favor of vaccinating HCWs in care institutions.<sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Indeed, investigating the effectiveness of vaccinating practice staff against seasonal influenza transmission is difficult, because symptoms are only expressed several days after infection, and it is difficult to conceive of a study design that would disentangle transmission in practice from that elsewhere in the community. Indeed, vaccinating patients against seasonal influenza in the practice, with trivalent or quadrivalent vaccination, may protect patients from seasonal influenza infection, but in this case transmission most likely occurs in the community.<sup><xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>
</p><p>NPIs are implemented in the GP setting even though no study showed any real impact on RTI transmission in the practice. Pappas <italic>et al</italic> demonstrated the colonisation of toys in a waiting area with different respiratory infection viruses and a positive influence of cleaning the toys, but direct transmission to individuals handling the toys was not demonstrated.<sup><xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> NPIs are mainly effective if used in combination.<sup><xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Again, as for vaccination, the effectiveness of most NPIs was mainly assessed in community settings and not in practices.<sup><xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> For example, a significant risk reduction of RTI, influenza-like illness, or seasonal influenza was observed in studies that assessed seasonal influenza transmission in interventions combining mask use and hand hygiene in a community setting.<sup><xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> A tendency towards reduction in seasonal influenza infection, and hospitalisation due to seasonal influenza infection, was observed with proper hand hygiene.<sup><xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>
</p><p>In addition, interventions are only effective when they are used by a high number of HCWs and patients. Unfortunately, most studies confirm a low vaccination coverage against seasonal influenza infection (of 30.2%&#x02013;81.3%) among GPs and HCWs, which could contribute to the transmission of seasonal influenza in the practice.<sup><xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Interventions such as vaccination promotion programmes, email reminders, or free vaccination programmes may improve vaccination coverage of general practice workers.<sup><xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> The main barriers to vaccination identified in general practice HCWs were lack of awareness of vaccination recommendations and belief of low risk of contracting seasonal influenza.<sup><xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Patient seasonal influenza vaccination is higher if physicians are themselves vaccinated and when the patient consults more often, in addition to external factors such as media campaigns.<sup><xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> However, there is currently no evidence directly linking vaccination coverage of the HCWs in general practice or of their patients with a decrease in seasonal influenza transmission in practice.</p><p>Similarly, combined NPIs are well investigated and implemented in hospital, institutional, and community settings, showing a tendency towards reduction of seasonal influenza infection and influenza-like illness transmission from HCWs to patients, but studies in general practices are missing.<sup><xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Promotion of NPI use positively influences the habits of HCWs, resulting in an increase in their use.<sup><xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Actual recommendations are based on extrapolation and it seems reasonable to recommend that GPs use NPIs, even though no studies were performed in GP practices.</p><p>Recommendations to reduce seasonal influenza transmission in practices are usually derived from other settings, such as hospitals or institutions, as in the case of the UK flu plan 2017/18, which recommends strict vaccination coverage for eligible patients and practice HCWs, as well as adapted respiratory and hand hygiene.<sup><xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Despite this, practices are different from hospitals and institutions in many aspects.<sup><xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Practices probably concentrate more people with influenza-like illness symptoms in close proximity, such as in the waiting area. For these reasons, extrapolating results from other settings to the practice might be quite hazardous. But, at present, it is the only means by which to make recommendations for the GP setting.</p></sec><sec id="s5-4"><title>Implications for research</title><p>Good quality studies about seasonal influenza transmission in general practices are lacking, both for prevention by vaccination and chemoprophylaxis, as well as possible combined effect with NPIs. In addition, most of the few existing studies use non-uniform definitions of influenza-like illness, non-uniform methods of detection of seasonal influenza infection, or inconsistent testing protocols, thereby impeding a proper comparison and interpretation of the studies. Good quality interventional studies are needed to provide evidence for the existing recommendations.</p></sec></sec></body><back><notes><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This study was self-funded.
