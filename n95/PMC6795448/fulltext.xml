In this study we propose tools to evaluate building resilience to extreme episodes of outdoor particulate matter using a combination of indoor and outdoor IoT measurements, coupled with survey-based information of occupants&#x02019; perception and behaviour. We demonstrated the application of the tools on two buildings with different modes of ventilation during the Chico Camp fire event. We characterized the resilience of the buildings on different temporal and spatial scales using the well-established I/O ratio and a newly proposed E-index that evaluates indoor concentration in the context of adopted 24-hour exposure thresholds. Indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration during the entire Chico Camp Fire event was 21 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> for 4<sup>th</sup> Street (Mechanically Ventilated) and 36 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> for Wurster Hall (Naturally Ventilated). The cumulative median I/O ratio during the fire event was 0.27 for 4<sup>th</sup> Street and 0.67 for Wurster Hall. Overall E-index for 4<sup>th</sup> Street was 0.82, suggesting that the whole building was resilient to outdoor air pollution while overall E-index was 1.69 for Wurster Hall suggesting that interventions are necessary. The survey revealed that occupant perception of workplace air quality aligns with measured PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the two buildings. The results also highlight that a large portion of occupants wore face masks, even though the PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration was below WHO threshold level. The results of our study demonstrate the utility of the proposed IoT-enabled and survey tools to assess the degree of protection from air pollution of outdoor origin for a single building or across a portfolio of buildings. The proposed survey tool also provides direct links between the PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels and occupants&#x02019; perception and behavior.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>CITRIS and the BANATAO Institute</institution></funding-source><award-id>69085-24003-44-NHJVN</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7541-8274</contrib-id><name><surname>Pantelic</surname><given-names>Jovan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The authors would like to acknowledge CITRIS at University of California Berkeley for sponsoring this research with the grant number 69085-24003-44-NHJVN.

Introduction</title><p>In recent years, we have observed increased wildfire frequency and intensity in response to global warming [<xref rid="pone.0223136.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Many regions prone to fire are forecasted to have increased frequency of wildfires and associated air pollution episodes [<xref rid="pone.0223136.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Wildfire smoke includes carbon dioxide, water vapor, carbon monoxide, particulate matter (PM), complex hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, trace minerals, and several thousand other compounds [<xref rid="pone.0223136.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There is clear evidence that wildfire smoke, which includes particulate matter with 2.5 &#x003bc;m diameter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), is linked to respiratory health implications, morbidity, and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0223136.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0223136.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the U.S., mathematical models show that premature deaths attributed to wildfire generated PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure will double compared to the early 21st century [<xref rid="pone.0223136.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, studies have shown that wildfire smoke exposure during pregnancy affected birth weight among term infants [<xref rid="pone.0223136.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and that mental health symptoms increased among an adolescent population exposed to wildfire smoke [<xref rid="pone.0223136.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In planning for the future, cities, communities, and building ecosystems in wildfire prone regions need to be resilient to the associated wildfire effects [<xref rid="pone.0223136.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and provide safe indoor air quality (IAQ) to protect occupants.</p><p>In order to achieve appropriate IAQ, the building industry must develop standards for protecting building occupants against wildfire air pollution, which do not currently exist [<xref rid="pone.0223136.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0223136.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Building ventilation standards such as ASHRAE 62.1 and 62.2 only deal with typical outdoor air conditions (i.e., not under extreme air pollution events). The available guidelines include the British Columbia Center for Disease Control <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bccdc.ca/health-professionals/professional-resources/wildfire-smoke-response-planning">Wildfire Smoke Response Planning</ext-link> document that states: <italic>&#x0201c;More than one portable air cleaning unit may be required for large rooms or homes with high air change rates&#x0201d;</italic>. WHO/UNEP/WMO Guidelines for Vegetation fire events provide general recommendations, such as &#x0201c;reduce infiltration&#x0201d; or install and maintain &#x0201c;effective filters&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0223136.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The California Department of Health [<xref rid="pone.0223136.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] provide similar guidance. WHO and EPA provide short-term (24-hr average) and long-term (annual) PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure thresholds, above which there are long-term human health impacts. The existing guidelines are largely qualitative without quantifiable instructions, such as an appropriate filter grade, air pollution monitoring and ventilation operation. Few studies have examined personal particle exposure indoors during air pollution events [<xref rid="pone.0223136.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0223136.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A study by [<xref rid="pone.0223136.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] is one of the few that examined infiltration of wildfire generated air pollution into buildings. A major barrier to establishing standards and protecting occupants is that very few (if any) buildings have equipment to measure indoor PM or pollutants, besides CO<sub>2</sub> and CO.</p><p>Internet of Things (IoT) environmental sensing platforms can be placed indoors and outdoors to measure diverse air pollutants, including PM<sub>2.5.</sub> IoT PM<sub>2.5</sub> measurements can be used to understand the relationship between outdoor and indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels and pathways by which outdoor particles enter indoors. These relationships can be described with known metrics such as Indoor to Outdoor (I/O) ratio, infiltration factor (F<sub>in</sub>), and penetration factor (P) [<xref rid="pone.0223136.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The studies have concluded that low-cost IoT PM<sub>2.5</sub> sensors have reasonable accuracy for building scale implementation [<xref rid="pone.0223136.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0223136.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0223136.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and that they are sufficiently accurate for identifying high air pollutant concentrations, as is observed in wildfires [<xref rid="pone.0223136.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The effect of wildfire generated air pollution on human health and mortality highlight the importance of managing exposure. However, the barriers to reducing indoor exposure are three-fold. First, there are no quantifiable guidelines or standards in place. Second, there is a lack of measurement equipment in buildings for wildfire generated air pollutants, such as PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Lastly, without measurement equipment, the building industry is left with only the existing qualitative guidelines without the ability to quantify the effectiveness of resiliency strategies. This all leads to a significant gap in defining and quantifying building resiliency, effectiveness of chosen interventions, and general understanding of occupant exposure indoors. The objective of this study was to address the second two barriers by demonstrating how a combination of an IoT environmental sensing network implemented locally outdoors and inside the building and an occupant survey can quantify building resiliency to urban scale air pollution. In doing this, we applied known analytical tools and developed another. Specifically, we analyzed PM<sub>2.5</sub> measurements during a wildfire event at different spatial (whole building or room scale) and temporal scales (instantaneous and long term) to demonstrate the application of building assessment tools. We used two buildings located in Berkeley (California) during the two-week Chico Camp fire in November 2018; one building was equipped with mechanical ventilation and the other with natural ventilation. By reliance on combination of I/O ratio metric, survey questionnaires and a newly proposed E-index, the study sought to quantify the resilience of buildings against particle penetration indoors from outdoor origin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>2. Materials and methods</title><p>We used two types of indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> sensors (Clarity Inc, and Senseware), one type of outdoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> sensor (Clarity Inc), and one type of CO<sub>2</sub> sensor (Senseware) placed on and in two commercial buildings in Berkeley, CA. One of the buildings was naturally ventilated, while the other was mechanically ventilated. We also developed and distributed a survey to gather feedback on occupant experience in their workplace during the Chico Camp fire compared to their typical experience in the space. With this data, we developed and evaluated tools to quantify and assess each building&#x02019;s resilience to the extreme air pollution episode.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>2.1 Experimental apparatus</title><p>Both Clarity and Senseware PM<sub>2.5</sub> nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223136.g001">Fig 1</xref>) count the particle number using the principle of light scattering, which are characteristic for optical particle counters. The accuracy of the all the sensors was the same&#x02014;within &#x000b1;10 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> in the range of 0 to 100 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> and &#x000b1;10% in the range of 100 to 1000 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>. Data was collected on 15-minute intervals for Clarity nodes on 1-minute intervals for Senseware nodes. As typical for optical particle counters, Clarity and Senseware nodes are factory-calibrated with Arizona Test Dust (ATD). Calibration with ATD does not robustly account for many <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/aerosol">aerosol</ext-link>
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/particle-property">particle properties</ext-link>, such as density, shape, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/refractive-index">refractive index</ext-link>, and absorption. Therefore, if aerosol properties of the particles measured in the field do not have properties similar to ATD (as is likely the case for wildfires), the optical particle counters can produce inaccurate readings. There is a lack of understanding of the wildfire source profiles and resulting aerosol composition [<xref rid="pone.0223136.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; thus making the field calibration challenging. To arrive at accurate measurements, the Clarity nodes apply co-location of nodes and post-processing correction factors to the raw outdoor measurements using a local government measurement stations that indirectly include information on particle optical properties. For this dataset, the Clarity node corrections for particle optical properties were extracted from the California Air Resources Board Oakland Laney College measurement station. Clarity Inc. typically only applies these corrections to outdoor nodes; however, we applied the same correction to indoor Clarity nodes because under the Chico Camp fire scenario indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> dominantly originated from the outdoors. Senseware nodes do not make corrections to the raw measurements and are calibrated with the ATD.</p><fig id="pone.0223136.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0223136.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>IoT sensors used in the study: Clarity outdoor node (right); Clarity indoor note (middle); Senseware indoor node (left).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0223136.g001"/></fig><p>Senseware CO<sub>2</sub> sensors measured CO<sub>2</sub> levels with an accuracy of &#x000b1;50 ppm.

The measure CO<sub>2</sub> decay profile during non-occupied hours were used to calculate infiltration rates (details in the Supporting Information).

The average indoor raw PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations (i.e., not corrected for particle properties) measured in each building during the Chico Camp fire followed trends of outdoor measurements and were approximately 80 times greater than the average concentrations measured the week before and after the Chico Camp fire. This validates the assumption that all indoor particles can be treated as having outdoor origin during the Chico Camp fire.</p><p>As mentioned, Clarity Inc. corrects measured data to include information about PM<sub>2.5</sub> composition, while Senseware measurements rely on ATD calibration. Due to this disparity, the analysis uses raw measurements when combining or comparing data from the Clarity and Senseware nodes, and the Clarity corrected measurements when discussing observed indoor and outdoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations. For the analysis, we define building operating hours as 07:00 to 19:00.

Overall average E-index, calculated by averaging hourly values for the entire pollution episode, for 4<sup>th</sup> Street was 0.82, suggesting that the building as a whole was resilient to outdoor air pollution during this episode, and that the tight building envelope paired with two-staged particle filtration of MERV 8 and MERV 13 at the air handler was effective at blocking PM<sub>2.5</sub> penetration and providing acceptable IAQ conditions.</p><p>Results for the Wurster Hall show that PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration exceeded the recommended level for 77% of the hours.

From an hourly analysis, we can see that Wurster Hall had periods that could potentially cause acute effects on occupants, especially for those with pulmonary health issues. One potential way to think about the role of interventions would be to eliminate periods where E-index was above a specified threshold (e.g. level that causes acute effects). For the entire pollution episode, overall average E-index was 1.69, suggesting that Wurster Hall requires intervention in order to be operational during an air pollution episode.

During this period, median I/O ratio was 0.33 during operating hours compared to 0.21 during non-operating hours. This indicated that PM<sub>2.5</sub> ingress is the dominant pathway of outdoor particle entry. The higher I/O ratios observed in Wurster Hall compared to 4<sup>th</sup> Street is due to the building being less airtight. Wurster Hall has operable windows designed for natural ventilation, and although the windows were closed (based on contact sensor readings) during the pollution event, the CO<sub>2</sub> decay rate shows infiltration of 0.4 h<sup>-1</sup>, as opposed to 0.1 h<sup>-1</sup> for 4<sup>th</sup> Street.</p><p>Cumulative I/O ratio can also be viewed on smaller spatial scales, such as individual rooms or zones, which allows for comparison and assessment within a building, similar to the comparison between buildings. We can use cumulative I/O ratio as a tool to assess (post-event) the effectiveness of an intervention, such as changes in building control strategy, economizer regime, air handler filter grade, or changes in recirculated-to-outdoor air ratio. Local level of intervention might improve conditions in a particular room or zone without necessity for larger scale intervention or any significant effect on a building scale.</p><p>Cumulative I/O ratio describes overall resilience to an air pollution episode but is limited in that it is only a post-event evaluation tool. IoT sensing can also be used to show instantaneous I/O ratio that can aid in real-time evaluation, such as quickly assessing whether a portable filter is appropriately sized for a room.

As in the case of Wurster Hall (NV), the survey indicated low IAQ satisfaction, but sensor measurements were necessary to quantify the indoor pollutant concentrations and mechanisms for air pollutant entry into the building. As opposed to the IoT devices, a survey is more often used as a retrospective tool (i.e., can only be applied after the air pollution event occurs), and it could be used to assess the resiliency of buildings or effectiveness of interventions to maintain &#x0201c;business-as-usual&#x0201d;.</p><p>As indicated by respondents wearing face masks indoors, maintaining PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration levels within the prescribed limits, either through building level features such as air handler&#x02019;s filter grade or alternatives solutions like portable air filters, might not be enough to prevent occupants from feeling at risk. A key missing piece was ensuring that occupants are aware of the conditions in the space. Results from this survey only point to this possibility, and need to be validated. Without sensor equipment from this study, neither 4th Street nor Wurster Hall had mechanisms to monitor indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels and thus, there was a limited ability to provide building-specific information.

Recommendations for building resilience evaluation</title><p>The general trending direction of IoT environmental sensing application and research is to create urban air pollution maps and increase knowledge about the pollution distribution on a city scale; however, this maintains the assumption that outdoor measurement is a good proxy for personal exposure of the entire population within the vicinity of the measurement location. This study shows new and additional value of dense urban environmental IoT sensing networks and addresses the missing gap in integration between urban and building scale IoT sensing, especially considering that humans in developed parts of the world spend approximately 90% of their time indoors [<xref rid="pone.0223136.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>The use of these tools is widespread and can serve several purposes including benchmarking building performance, assessing the effectiveness of interventions, and understanding occupant perception and behavior. Benchmarking building resilience is useful for an entity that manages a large building portfolio (e.g. university campus consisting of ~100 buildings). E-index and I/O ratio are benchmarking tools that can rank and prioritize buildings for improvements and inform occupants of safety. The use and potential applications of these tools at various temporal and spatial scales are listed in <xref rid="pone.0223136.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. E-index provides information on exposure level compared to a specified threshold (e.g., WHO) and can identify &#x0201c;safe&#x0201d; buildings or spaces within buildings; similarly, it will identify buildings with high air pollutant exposure or hotspots within buildings. I/O ratio can quickly assess the effectiveness of potential interventions on a whole building or space-by-space scale, such as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223136.g006">Fig 6</xref> with the portable air filter. It can also detect pollution hotspots, and predict what indoor pollution would be under different outdoor pollution scenarios. This is important during an extreme pollution event when actions need to be taken immediately. To illustrate the use of exceedance concept, comparison of 4<sup>th</sup> Street and Wurster Hall for 3 month period excluding forest fire episode is presented in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0223136.s003">S3 Fig</xref> in Supporting Information.

Together with low-cost IoT sensing, these tools can map out the indoor air pollution risk in a city or campus to inform organizational policies during an extreme event. This could lead to incorporating requirements for building resilience against wildfire-associated air pollution into the design stage of buildings. It can also lead to the development of clean air safe shelters for those at risk, such as homeless people, those who were evacuated from the wildfires affected areas, those with respiratory problems, or those who cannot afford portable filters.</p><p>Using the suggested criteria for a resilient building during extreme events, which is to maintain &#x0201c;business as usual&#x0201d; occupant behavior and perception, buildings can be considered successful if occupants feel safe enough indoors not to wear face masks. It is necessary to understand how to achieve this, and one component in this process is collecting IAQ information which can be achieved with IoT sensing. In future work, the survey can be used as an assessment tool and can be reduced to the questions necessary to understand perception and behavior. Additionally, it should include aspects about the effectiveness of methods to increase occupant awareness of indoor air quality during pollution episodes. Further, if IoT sensing measurements are not available or feasible for a building, the study results indicate that occupant perception could be used as a proxy for IAQ; although additional studies in various buildings should be conducted to confirm this.</p><p>In interpreting the study results, a few limitations should be recognized. Firstly, sample of only two buildings and a relatively limited number of responses were used for the analysis. As such, the I/O ratio, E-index and occupancy response results reported here cannot be indicative of all buildings and all people. Secondly, the assumption that one local measurement location (placing the sensor on the roof of each of the buildings) is sufficient to represent the outdoor pollution level for the entire building and conclude how the building operates in respect to the penetration of outdoor pollution indoors. Another limitation is a restricted utility of I/O ratio for recommending the specific building interventions, unless used for building resiliency evaluation against the elevated outdoor air pollution. However, the tools can be effective in dry areas prone to wildfires and in heavily polluted cities around the world. Notwithstanding the limitations, our study has not only provided useful preliminary data on which further research, but also offered a methodological contribution towards the assessment of building protection from air pollution of outdoor origin elsewhere.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec024"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>The tools we used in this study are methods to evaluate building resilience to extreme outdoor air pollution episodes using IoT sensing indoors and outdoors, coupled with survey-based information of occupant perception and behaviour. We demonstrated the application of the tools on two buildings with different modes of ventilation. We characterized the resilience of the buildings on different temporal and spatial scales using the well-established I/O ratio and a newly proposed E-index. These tools can be used for a single building or across a portfolio of buildings for resilience ranking. Meanwhile, the survey tool provides qualitative insights on the connection between air pollution levels and occupants&#x02019; perception and behavior, which allows assessment of a building&#x02019;s ability to be resilient, meaning that occupants can maintain &#x0201c;business as usual&#x0201d; view.</p><p>Results indicate that even under the extreme outdoor air pollution events, outdoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations can be significantly different across a region, and therefore, outdoor sensors need to be localized to properly evaluate building resilience.

Further, the occupant survey has been utilized to understand and evaluate building resiliency to urban scale air pollution has not yet been attempted to my knowledge.</p><p>&#x02022; A study with such objectives could fill some significant gaps in defining and quantifying building resiliency, the effectiveness of chosen interventions, and general understanding of occupant exposure.</p><p>1.4 Weakness of Paper</p><p>&#x02022; Yet, while there are some merits of the study as mentioned above, this study needs some improvements. There is a need to highlight the implication of this study. The introduction section needs to be more concise in terms of elaborating on the research gap.</p><p>1.5 Significance of the Paper</p><p>The study is significant in defining and quantifying building resiliency by providing an understanding of the accuracy of IoT sensing equipment. The survey tool provides qualitative insights on the connection between air pollution levels and occupants&#x02019; perception and behavior, which allows assessment of a building&#x02019;s ability to be resilient.</p><p>1.6 Clarity of the study</p><p>Clearly define focal constructs and terms.
