The specific objectives were to characterize the environment in operating rooms and identify PAH concentrations arising from the smoke produced by electrocautery during surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>This exploratory, cross-sectional field research with a quantitative approach was conducted in an SC of a public university hospital located in the north of Paran&#x000e1;, Brazil. There are 262 health workers and graduate students working in this SC: eight nurses, eight perioperative nursing residents, 16 nursing technicians, 23 nursing auxiliaries, 18 anesthesiologists, 13 anesthesiology residents, 83 surgeons, and 93 surgery residents. All of these are exposed to surgical smoke. </p><p>This SC is composed of seven operating rooms in which 700 surgeries, from various medical specialties, are performed per month, on average. Elective surgeries are performed on weekdays from 7am to 5pm, while urgent and emergency surgeries are also performed on weekends, including nights and holidays. </p><p>This study addressed an intentional sample composed of 50 abdominal surgeries in which electrocautery was used. These surgeries were chosen because of their being high frequency abdominal surgeries (from one to three times a day), in which electrocautery is used. An average of 30 surgeries of this specialty are performed per month.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were abdominal surgeries using electrocautery, except emergency open abdominal and videolaparoscopic surgeries, as these are procedures that require immediate surgical intervention and it would be difficult to set up the apparatus used to collect data in time. The data collection system was assembled daily and at every surgical event. Data were collected during the morning, afternoon, and evening shifts from April 22 to July 8, 2015.</p><p>A form was used to characterize the operating rooms and another to characterize the surgeries, the use of the electrocautery, surgical staff, and PPE use (masks and goggles). Both forms were developed according to data provided in the literature and assessed in regard to content and objectivity by three nurses who are researchers experienced in the fields of occupational health and perioperative care, who deemed the instruments to be appropriate for this study. A pretest was performed with both instruments for six abdominal surgeries. </p><p>The assessment of PPE used by the intraoperative team considered surgical masks, respirators (N95) and goggles<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">

The test showed the pump was valid and reliable for suctioning airborne PAH in operating rooms. This pump includes a battery and a plastic extension to which cartridges, adapted from five-milliliter syringes, were connected for every surgical event.</p><p>Each cartridge is composed of an Amberlite(r) XAD4 resin, characterized as a polymeric adsorbent with large pores able to remove aromatic compounds, such as PAHs, from the air, and a filter to allow the passage of PAHs in gaseous form only, impeding the passage of compounds in particulate form or polypropylene foam. The foam enabled the fixation of XAD4 resin, impeding it from leaving through the tip of the cartridge.</p><p>The vacuum suction pump remained on during all the surgeries included in the sample, under a flow rate of 120 liters per hour, from the time the surgical site was opened until its closure. It was located at a fixed point at the height of the workers' breathing zone, specifically seven centimeters from the operative field.</p><p>PAHs were extracted from the XAD4 resin, concentrated and then analyzed by high efficiency liquid chromatography. This chromatographer is able to analyze 16 types of PAHs, namely: naphthalene, acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, fluorine, phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene, chrysene, benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, benzo(a) pyrene, dibenz(a,h)anthracene, benzo(ghi)perylene, and indene(1,2,3-cd) pyrene.</p><p>The preparation, extraction of the cartridges and PAHs readings were conducted by one Master's student and one PhD student from the chemistry field in an air compounds analysis laboratory.</p><p>Data collected with the forms and PAH concentrations were recorded in a spreadsheet in Excel<sup>(r)</sup> 2010 through sequence double entry, organized and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Science<sup>TM</sup> version 20.0. Descriptive statistics were used so that the frequency and percentage of categorical variables (type of surgery, time of surgery, mode of electrocautery use, staff characterization, PPE usage) were calculated. Mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values were calculated for the continuous variables (surgery duration, how long the electrocautery was used, electrocautery power, and PAH concentrations). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test the hypothesis of normality in the distribution of quantitative variables, which was not normal (p&#x0003c;0.01). The non-parametrical Spearman's correlation test was used for the continuous variables, with a level of significance at 0.05.</p><p>This study was approved by the hospital's Institutional Review Board in September 2014 (Registration No. 34232714.1.0000.5231) and conducted according to the ethical guidelines established by the National Ethics Committee.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The operating rooms presented different dimensions: three were 34.22 m<sup>2</sup>; two were 32.78 m<sup>2</sup>; and another two were 45.47m<sup>2</sup>.

In this study, naphthalene was not identified in two of the videolaparoscopic procedures (one cholecystectomy and one appendectomy), while phenanthrene was not detected in only one surgery (exploratory laparotomy). At least one of the compounds was present in all three surgeries.</p><p>The negative impact of PAH on human health, regardless of concentration, has already been acknowledged as having high carcinogenic potential, in addition to deleterious effects on the skin, liver and immune system<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>. Therefore, the naphthalene and phenanthrene airborne compounds identified in the operating rooms are harmful and pose a risk to the health of the intraoperative team.</p><p>Naphthalene was classified as potentially carcinogenic and, even though this effect was not reported in humans, but only in experimental rats, exposure through the inhalation of this compound arising from surgical smoke may be associated with various types of cancer in humans, such as in the lung, olfactory and nasal tissues<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">

Hence, we assume the production of these two compounds increases concomitantly.</p><p>The average concentrations of naphthalene (0.0053 mg/m<sup>3)</sup> and phenanthrene (0.0007 mg/m<sup>3)</sup> were higher than the averages reported by other studies. One study conducted in Changhua (Taiwan) with mastectomies found average concentrations of 0.001055 mg/m<sup>3</sup> of naphthalene and 0.0000843 mg/m<sup>3</sup> of phenanthrene<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>10</sup>

For this reason, the PAH concentrations were not compared to the recommended occupational exposure limits, while none of the surgeries lasted more than eight hours.</p><p>Even small concentrations of these compounds are a concern, if we consider the frequent use of electrocautery and consequent cumulative effects. The intraoperative staff is exposed to small amounts of smoke compared to the other professionals, but the exposure is more prolonged and more constant<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">

Thus, future studies are needed to obtain further scientific evidence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The operating rooms of the SC addressed in this study are not in agreement with either national or international standards, as they do not have local exhaust and ventilation systems to purify the air. </p><p>PAH concentrations, naphthalene and phenanthrene, arising from surgical smoke produced by electrocautery, were identified in the air of the operating rooms in all the surgical events assessed, both procedures by incision that might be open and large and small, like videolaparoscopic procedures, while a strong correlation was found between the naphthalene and phenanthrene variables.</p><p>Total PAH concentrations, which ranged from 0.0061 mg/m&#x000b3; to 0.208 mg/m&#x000b3;, indicate that workers and graduate students in the intraoperative team are constantly exposed to chemical compounds that are harmful to human health due to their cumulative effects.</p><p>Adherence to utilizing PPE, such as safety goggles, on the part of the intraoperative team is low and most use masks without filters, therefore, masks that are considered inappropriate for PAH exposure. In addition to personal protective measures, collective measures should be implemented to improve air quality in operating rooms.</p><p>This study supports future studies intended to identify harm caused to the health of workers and graduate students exposed to surgical smoke and to encourage a healthy and safe work environment for the intraoperative team.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>To the workers of the assessed surgical center and those involved in this study</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><label>1</label><p>Paper extracted from Master&#x02019;s Thesis &#x0201c;Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons produced by the smoke from electrocautery: chemical risk to intraoperative staff&#x0201d;, presented to Universidade Estadual de Londrina, Londrina, PR, Brazil</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Navarro-Meza</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Gonz&#x000e1;lez-Baltazar</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Aldrete-Rodr&#x000ed;guez</surname><given-names>MG</given-names></name><name><surname>Carmona-Navarro</surname><given-names>DH</given-names></name><name><surname>L&#x000f3;pez-Cardona</surname><given-names>MG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>S&#x000ed;ntomas respiratorios causados por el uso del electrocauterio en m&#x000e9;dicos en formaci&#x000f3;n quir&#x000fa;rgica de un hospital de M&#x000e9;xico</article-title><source>Rev Peru Med Exp Salud Publica</source><year>2013</year><volume>30</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>41</fpage><lpage>44</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1590/S1726-46342013000100008</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23612810</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Eickman</surname><given-names>IU</given-names></name><name><surname>Falcy</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Fokuhl</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>R&#x000fc;egger</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><source>International Section of the ISSA on prevention of occupational risks in health services.
