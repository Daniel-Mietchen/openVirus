However, direct evidence for the effectiveness of these controls is limited particularly in low-and middle-income (LMIC) countries. Thus, we sought to evaluate whether recommended administrative, environmental and personal protective measures are effective in preventing tuberculin skin test conversion among HCWs, and whether there has been recent research appropriate to LMIC needs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Using inclusion criteria that included tuberculin skin test (TST) conversion as the outcome and longitudinal study design, we searched a number of electronic databases, complemented by hand-searching of reference lists and contacting experts. Reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed study quality using recommended criteria and overall evidence quality using GRADE criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Ten before-after studies were found, including two from upper middle income countries. All reported a decline in TST conversion frequency after the intervention. Among five studies that provided rates, the size of the decline varied, ranging from 35 to 100%. Since all were observational studies assessed as having high or unclear risk of bias on at least some criteria, the overall quality of evidence was rated as low using GRADE criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">We found consistent but low quality of evidence for the effectiveness of combined control measures in reducing TB infection transmission in HCWs in both high-income and upper-middle income country settings. However, research is needed in low-income high TB burden, including non-hospital, settings, and on contextual factors determining implementation of recommended control measures. Explicit attention to the reporting of methodological quality is recommended.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">This systematic review was registered with PROSPERO in 2014 and its registration number is <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?RecordID=9087">CRD42014009087</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Systematic review</kwd><kwd>Tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>Health care workers</kwd><kwd>Transmission control</kwd><kwd>Tuberculin skin test</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par15">Reviews in the past decade have concluded that health care workers (HCWS) in most countries have a higher tuberculosis (TB) disease incidence than the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and further that HCWs in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) have a higher prevalence and incidence of latent TB infection than their counterparts in high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This gap is consistent with the occurrence of 80% of the global burden of TB in 22 LMICs, where overcrowded and under-resourced health care facilities are important sites of TB transmission, including multi-drug resistant TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Since 1982 the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and later the World Health Organisation (WHO), have published a number of TB transmission control guidelines for health care settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These guidelines classified protective practices under the now well-established headings of administrative, environmental and personal levels of protection. A fourth overarching category, &#x0201c;managerial activities&#x0201d;, at both national level and facility level, was elaborated in the WHO 2009 guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Implementation of these guidelines in combination is credited with the control of nosocomial outbreaks of TB and particularly multidrug resistant TB in high-income countries such as the US (described below) and Italy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], as well as an outbreak of extremely drug resistant TB in South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, questions about the practicality of these guidelines in low resource health care settings was expressed as early as 1997 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and given expression in a WHO 1999 guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A 2006 review deemed the evidence for a reduction in the risk of TB transmission after implementation of these measures to be &#x0201c;limited and weak&#x0201d; in LMIC settings, in contrast with stronger evidence from high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Of ten control measures reviewed in the WHO 2009 Guideline (pp. 23&#x02013;33) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], nine were judged as having &#x0201c;low quality&#x0201d; evidence, the exception being a package of HIV-testing, isoniazid preventive therapy and access to anti-retroviral treatment for HCWs, which was supported by &#x0201c;high quality&#x0201d; evidence.</p><p id="Par18">The need to identify more appropriate protective practices, i.e. fewer and less resource demanding, but nevertheless effective in these settings, has thus been frequently identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A 2007 systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] concluded that there was &#x0201c;limited evidence based on uncontrolled observations&#x02026;that administrative controls are the most important component.&#x0201d; More recently, Nardell and others have argued for a refocusing of clinical administrative measures, namely FAST (&#x0201c;Find cases Actively, Separate temporarily and Treat effectively&#x0201d;) in health care settings where undiagnosed tuberculosis is likely to be main source of nosocomial infection for both staff and patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Given the passage of a decade and the evolution of the methods of systematic review, we sought to update the evidence on the effectiveness of measures to control TB transmission in health care settings from the 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] reviews. We aimed to sharpen our understanding of the quality of evidence by using up to date methods of systematic review, including a detailed assessment of the risk of bias and overall quality of evidence.</p><p id="Par20">The question we asked was as follows. Do tuberculosis transmission prevention practices in the categories of administrative, environmental and/or respiratory protection, collectively or individually, reduce the transmission of tuberculosis infection to HCWs? We sought to limit heterogeneity by concentrating on studies which used tuberculin skin test (TST) conversion as the most direct outcome indicator of transmission. A particular interest was LMIC settings, but the review was not limited to such studies. We restricted the review to longitudinal studies able to compare the same setting before and after implementation of an intervention so as to establish temporality and limit confounding.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Search strategy and study design</title><p id="Par21">We considered all studies, observational or experimental in design, comprising HCWs, among whom TST conversion rates in both the &#x0201c;before&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;after&#x0201d; phases of implementation of control measures in the same facility could be measured. HCWs include nurses, doctors, laboratory staff, allied professionals and support staff. Studies were sought which compared either a single preventive measure, or multiple measures at one or different levels, against controls. A control was defined as non-use, less complete or less frequent use of TB transmission prevention measures. We excluded workplace studies of the effectiveness of disease screening for TB, or of screening for and treatment of latent TB infection in preventing disease.</p><p id="Par22">The electronic searches were conducted to the end of July 2017.

Administrative measures such as FAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] are the current focus in this regard, particularly given the pressures for decentralised care to manage MDR TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Ventilation solutions appropriate to building design and climate in high patient throughput settings are also under-researched [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Research settings should include both hospitals and district or primary health care services as well as special locations such as laboratories. Missing from the literature are studies of &#x0201c;upstream&#x0201d; or health system factors which may determine the successful application of facility level control measures, such as political commitment, leadership, funding, or information systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">To strengthen the quality and presentation of such research, studies with more explicit methodological quality than those reviewed are needed. Although randomised controlled trials are desirable for reducing selection bias and confounding, controlled before and after studies may have to be relied upon, but with greater attention to the comparability of before and after intervention groups, the time periods being compared and intervention and control groups where relevant. An alternative approach is the study of quality improvement interventions for intermediate processes, such as the steps that make up FAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. However, ultimately the effectiveness in preventing TB infection in HCWS needs be tested directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The outcome indicator used in the current review, namely TST conversion, remains the most practical measure for studies in LMICs. There is as yet insufficient evidence of the reliability of repeated interferon gamma release assays as an indicator of interval infection in these settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Use of incident tuberculosis as the outcome is constrained by variability in susceptibility to progress to active disease, which might dilute a short-term association between transmission control measures and incident TB.</p><p id="Par41">Assessment of bias should be explicit, using an accepted schema. However, even before-after studies are logistically demanding, requiring establishment of an accurate baseline rate of conversion, proper implementation of the intervention, and subsequent follow up periods of measurement. Sustained and accurate record-keeping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], consistency of testing practice, assessment of co-intervention and confounding over this period all increase the resource and staffing requirements of such research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par42">This review has found very little progress over the past decade in updating the evidence, specifically in high TB burden low income settings, on the effectiveness of recommended practices to prevent nosocomial transmission of TB infection in health care workers. The reasons for this lack of progress were not investigated, but barriers are likely to include the many practical difficulties in conducting such research.</p><p id="Par43">In the face of the continuing TB epidemic in many countries, such studies deserve a higher priority in funding programmes than has been the case over recent decades. Such funding should encourage research in a breadth of settings, inclusion of systems or contextual elements in the intervention, and management and reporting of quality issues inherent in different study designs.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec16"><title>Appendix</title><p id="Par47">
