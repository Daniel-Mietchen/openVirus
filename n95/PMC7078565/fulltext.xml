The hierarchy of controls follows the so-called &#x0201c;STOP-Principle&#x0201d;. This principle can be used to choose protective measures against hazardous substances. As the first step, substitution with a less-dangerous substance or process should be considered. The second step is the possible implementation of technical solutions. Third, organizational solutions may be considered. If all of these solutions do not eliminate or minimize the hazard, personal protective equipment may be necessary. The respiratory protective device is one type of the personal protective equipment that protects a worker from airborne hazards by providing the wearer with clean air.</p><p id="p0015">The performance of respiratory protective devices can be described by the term &#x0201c;protection factor&#x0201d;, which has several definitions. The &#x0201c;Nominal Protection Factor (NPF)&#x0201d; represents the level of protection provided by a respirator under standard laboratory test conditions. Corresponding to NPF is the &#x0201c;(total) inward leakage&#x0201d; as used in European Standards, which can be converted into the NPF [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The total inward leakage test is a part of requirements in European Standard (EN 149:2001&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;A1) if a particulate filtering facepiece respirator needs to be approved. The total inward leakage consists of face seal leakage, filter penetration, and exhalation valve leakage, and is measured with a stationary flame photometer [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is tested under laboratory test conditions with a series of test subjects by using defined sodium chloride aerosol. It is presented by a ratio between the aerosol concentration inside the respirator and the aerosol concentration outside the respirator in consideration of breathing frequency [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is reasonable to conclude that NPF cannot indicate a protection level of a respirator achieved under actual working conditions. The main reason for the discrepancy between laboratory testing and the use of the respirators at the workplace is that the simulated exercises in the laboratory do not represent all activities that can occur in the workplace. Furthermore, the respirators are only tested by a small group of test subjects while in the laboratory [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The last point to be made here is that sodium chloride aerosols may differ from the aerosols encountered in the workplace. Therefore, the &#x0201c;Assigned Protection Factor (APF)&#x0201d; is applied to indicate the level of protection likely to be achieved in the workplace by 95% of trained respirator users [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The realistic level of protection in the workplace is characterized by the &#x0201c;Workplace Protection Factor (WPF)&#x0201d;, which should be determined under working conditions by measuring the concentration of a hazardous substance outside and inside the respirator [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, the establishment of APF values should be based on the WPF data [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">Owing to a lack of standardized test procedures for the measurement of WPF for particulate filtering facepiece respirators in Europe and insufficient WPF data, the APF values are established through a combination of a small number of workplace studies and professional judgment. Consequently, the APF values are different even for the same class of respirator in various European countries [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out more WPF measurements and provide more WPF data for testing if the current APF are appropriate and for determining APF values conclusively.</p><p id="p0025">The traditional sampling method consists of a personal sampling pump and filter cassette&#x000a0;and has been used for inside and outside respirators sampling [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>]. The sampling periods can vary between one and four hours [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Laboratory analytical methods are necessary for the determination of the particle masses [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This method is widely used in workplace studies and provides high efficiency for sampling in the facepiece [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p id="p0030">In the past few years, several workplace studies have been conducted using count-based methods, such as direct-reading instruments [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>]. Compared with the traditional sampling method, a direct-reading instrument can offer an effective measurement procedure and more information on temporary exposures. Furthermore, particle count methods have been recommended for testing respirator filters, in particular, against ultrafine particles [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In this study, a direct-reading measuring instrument named &#x0201c;PortaCount 8020&#x0201d; (TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA) is taken into account as a possible instrument for conducting workplace measurements. The PortaCount was chosen because it can determine the particle number concentration inside and outside the respirator. In addition, it is already known for simulated workplace studies [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The PortaCount 8020 is originally designed for a fit test. This test is used to determine how well a specific respirator fits its user by evaluating the face seal leakage. The PortaCount 8020 has a wide measuring range and, at the same time, is transportable. Those features make it a suitable measuring instrument to be used at the workplace.</p><p id="p0035">The flame photometer is the standard measuring instrument for determining the total inward leakage of the particulate filtering facepiece respirator in Europe [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and it measures the mass concentration of particles (mass-based method), whereas the PortaCount measures particle number concentration (count-based method). Owing to that, it is needed to verify the appropriateness of the PortaCount and validate it against the flame photometer. Therefore, a comparison study was conducted between the PortaCount and the flame photometer. This verification can provide the basis for conducting the measurements of WPF with PortaCount in actual workplaces.</p><p id="p0040">The purpose of this research is to examine whether a linear relationship between the PortaCount and the flame photometer exists, to establish a method for the measurement of WPF in workplaces.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Instrument description</title><p id="p0045">All measuring devices used in this study are described in detail below.</p><sec id="sec2.1.1"><label>2.1.1</label><title>Flame photometer</title><p id="p0050">The flame photometer from Moores (Wallisdown) Ltd (Type No. 1100) is a part of the standard test setup for the determination of total inward leakage of particulate filtering facepiece respirators [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and particle filter penetration [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It measures the mass concentration of sodium chloride aerosol by determining the intensity of emitted light radiated from the sodium element. The test aerosol is generated from a sodium chloride solution by an atomizer.

The respirator fit is then presented by the ratio between the particle number concentration outside the respirator and inside the respirator.

The fit factor measured in this way is actually equal to a protection factor&#x000a0;because the filter penetration cannot be eliminated.</p><p id="p0065">To eliminate the filter penetration and obtain a correct fit test result for the respirator with low filter efficiency, an accessory of PortaCount named &#x0201c;N95-Companion&#x02122;&#x0201d; (TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA) can be used for this situation. The N95-Companion&#x02122; functions as an aerosol preconditioner for the PortaCount and it can be attached to the PortaCount <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The N95-Companion&#x02122; contains an electrostatic particle classifier, which selects particles with the particle size range from approximately 0.03 to 0.06&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m and transfers them to the PortaCount for the fit test [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Such particles are highly likely to penetrate through the face seal and cannot get through the N95/R95/P95 filter medium, which means that only the face seal leakage is measured.</p><p id="p0070">The principle of the PortaCount is based on a condensation particle counter (CPC).

To avoid overpressure caused by high flow rate, a three-necked flask was applied for recollecting the remaining airflow (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>).</p><p id="p0145">As a result of a separate measurement, it was found that there was only a small difference between the particles after the test chamber and in the three-necked flask. The particle concentrations measured by PortaCount varied within 6%. Particle size distributions measured by TSI Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) (Classifier Model 3080, DMA Model 3081, CPC Model 3025) showed a minor shift of small particle sizes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>), which indicates a systematic error of the experimental setup. Two main reasons are considered for this minor shift: diffusion losses of small particles in a long tube and temporary or occasional instability of the atomizer. However, the minor shift of particle size should not lead to any perceptible impact on measuring results.<fig id="fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Particle size distribution after the test chamber and in the three-necked flask.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0035">Fig.&#x000a0;5</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr5"/></fig></p><p id="p0150">The penetration through the respirator was measured by the flame photometer, PortaCount and PortaCount with N95-Companion&#x02122;.

Moreover, differences exist in calculation of WPFs between using direct-reading instruments and using traditional method with, e.g., personal sampling pumps and filter cassettes. Therefore, it is currently not clear how the WPFs collected using direct-reading instruments should be compared with WPFs collected using traditional methods.</p><p id="p0280">Some limitations should be noted.
