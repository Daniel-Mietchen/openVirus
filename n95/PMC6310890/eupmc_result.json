    "High-level biosafety laboratories (BSL), such as BSL-3 and BSL-4, which deal with high infectivity and virulence pathogens, have become indispensable. Mice are frequently used in animal BSL (ABSL) to establish animal models for infection and to evaluate in vivo immune responses. A project of monitoring and evaluation on the physiology and immune status of mice housed in different ABSL labs was performed in the ABSL-2/3/4 labs of Kunming National High-level Biosafety Research Center, China. Female Kunming mice were housed in the ABSL-2/3/4 labs for 1 month, and mouse behavior, body physiology/immune status, pulmonary immune status and respiratory bacteria composition were evaluated and compared among mice from the different labs. Mice settled in their new housing environment of the different labs after transfer and gained weight steadily. Blood hematology testing, serum cytokine/chemokine profiles and blood/spleen lymphocyte constitutions were comparable between the ABSL-2/3/4 labs. The numbers of different pulmonary leukocytes in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were at baseline levels in mice from the ABSL-2/3/4 labs. Diversity and dominance of mice respiratory bacteria were semblable among the ABSL-2/3/4 labs. Our results confirm the stability of physiology and immune status of Kunming mice maintained in different ABSL-2/3/4 labs for at least 1 month."
