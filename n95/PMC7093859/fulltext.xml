Standard Precautions also include three subsets of precautions, known as &#x0201c;Transmission-Based Precautions,&#x0201d; that are based on the routes of disease transmission for a smaller number of patients who are known or suspected to be infected or colonized with highly transmissible or epidemiologically important pathogens. Transmission-Based Precautions are designed to reduce the risk of airborne, droplet and contact transmission and always are used in addition to Standard Precautions. Since the publication of the Guidelines for Infection Control in Dental Health-Care Settings&#x02014;2003,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> the CDC has published updated isolation guidelines, which have introduced new elements of Standard Precautions and provided more detailed information about Transmission-Based Precautions.</p><p id="para100">In this article, I review Standard Precautions, including the new elements applicable to dentistry, and the importance and relevance of Transmission-Based Precautions in dental settings.</p><sec id="cesec10"><title>STANDARD PRECAUTIONS</title><sec id="cesec20"><title>Overview</title><p id="para110">Because patients with blood-borne infections can be asymptomatic or unaware that they are infected, in 1985 the Centers for Disease Control (now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) introduced the concept that all blood and body fluids that might be contaminated with blood should be treated as infectious.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Infection control precautions were introduced largely because of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic and were updated and revised across the years. They eventually became known as Universal Precautions and were designed to prevent transmission of HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and other blood-borne diseases.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) based its blood-borne pathogens standard on the concept of Universal Precautions.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>
</p><p id="para120">Many fluids, secretions and excretions from patients not covered under Universal Precautions are colonized with organisms (that often are resistant to antimicrobial therapy) before any symptoms of illness become apparent, and they are potential sources of hospital- and community-acquired infections. Therefore, infection control personnel at the Harborview Medical Center, Seattle, and the University of San Diego introduced Body Substance Isolation (BSI) guidelines in 1987. These guidelines concentrate on isolating all moist and potentially infectious body substances (blood, feces, urine, sputum, saliva, wound drainage and other body fluids) primarily by wearing gloves.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Although these guidelines were accepted, there was some confusion regarding which body fluids or substances required HCP to use precautions under Universal Precautions and BSI. Also, it was becoming necessary to address droplet transmission and emerging multidrug&#x02013;resistant organisms (MDROs) such as <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> and vancomycin-resistant enterococci; direct or indirect contact transmission of some infectious microorganisms from dry skin or environmental sources (for example, <italic>C. difficile</italic> and vancomycin-resistant enterococci); and airborne transmission of infections across long distances by floating droplet nuclei. CDC expanded the concept of Universal Precautions in 1996 and began using the term &#x0201c;Standard Precautions,&#x0201d; which was introduced in the Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>
</p><p id="para130">Standard Precautions combined and expanded the elements of Universal Precautions and BSI into a standard of care designed to protect HCP and patients from pathogens that can be spread by blood or any other body fluid, excretion or secretion (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>
).<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Standard Precautions apply to contact with blood; all body fluids, secretions and excretions (except sweat), regardless of whether they contain blood; nonintact skin; and mucous membranes. While the term &#x0201c;Universal Precautions&#x0201d; still is used in OSHA's blood-borne pathogens standard and other documents, no operational difference exists in clinical dental practice between Universal Precautions and Standard Precautions, because even when blood is not visible, saliva has been considered a potentially infectious material in dentistry.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>

Although Standard Precautions apply to all patient encounters, the application of Standard Precautions during patient care is determined by the task being performed and the type of exposure to blood, body fluid or pathogens that is anticipated. In other words, infection control procedures are determined according to the procedure, not the patient. In OSHA terminology, they are performance-based standards because they are applied to the level necessary to provide exposure protection relative to the procedure performed and the given circumstances. For example, only gloves may be needed when obtaining dental radiographs, whereas protective eyewear and clothing, gloves and masks are necessary when placing restorations.</p></sec><sec id="cesec30"><title>Update</title><p id="para150">In 2007, CDC updated and expanded the 1996 Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> with the 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Health Care Settings.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> The 2007 isolation guideline introduced several new elements of Standard Precautions.

Respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette are a combination of infection control measures designed to minimize the transmission of respiratory pathogens via droplet or airborne routes in health care settings. These measures apply not only to SARS, but also to any respiratory illness&#x02014;such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and whooping cough&#x02014;and are targeted at all patients with symptoms of respiratory infection and their accompanying family members or friends. These infection control measures begin at the point of the patient's initial encounter with a health care setting, such as the reception area in the dental office. The primary components of respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette are as follows:

A second tier of precautions, referred to as Transmission-Based Precautions, is necessary to prevent the potential spread of these diseases. There are three categories of Transmission-Based Precautions: Airborne, Droplet and Contact.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> More than one Transmission-Based Precaution category may apply at a time because some diseases are transmitted via multiple routes, and Transmission-Based Precautions sometimes are recommended for use on an empiric, temporary basis until a diagnosis can be made. When used alone or in combination, Transmission-Based Precautions always should be used in addition to Standard Precautions.</p><p id="para260">CDC's 2007 isolation guideline addresses the changing patterns of health care delivery, as well as those of emerging and evolving pathogens such as SARS and community-associated methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA).<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> A primary difference in this guideline from previous CDC isolation precautions is the inclusion of recommendations for a broader spectrum of health care delivery settings than found in the previous guidelines for hospitals only. Specifically, CDC makes recommendations for ambulatory care settings that include dental offices. Challenges may exist when adapting Transmission-Based Precautions to dental offices rather than to inpatient facilities. For example, dental office staff members may not be able to identify patients with infections immediately, patients frequently remain in common waiting areas for prolonged periods and treatment rooms may be turned around quickly with limited cleaning.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref>

This may be because patients usually do not seek routine dental outpatient care when they are acutely ill with diseases that require Transmission-Based Precautions.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Nonetheless, a general understanding of precautions for diseases transmitted via all routes is important, because some dental health care personnel (DHCP) are hospital based or work part time in hospital settings, patients infected with these diseases might seek urgent treatment at outpatient dental offices, and DHCP might become infected with these diseases.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Also, recently, several diseases requiring precautions beyond Standard Precautions (for example, MRSA or 2009 H1N1 influenza) have received extensive media coverage, and some dental professionals have inquired why there were not specific infection control recommendations to cover these conditions in ambulatory care dental settings.</p><p id="para280">The purpose of infection control procedures is to interrupt the spread of diseases.

for those treating patients in ambulatory care or outpatient settings such as a dental office or a hospital-based outpatient clinic. I emphasize the differences between recommendations for inpatient (hospital) and ambulatory care settings. Special or additional procedures for cleaning and disinfecting environmental surfaces or instrument processing, which are available in CDC's 2003 infection control guidelines for dental health care settings,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> are not indicated after treating patients requiring Transmission-Based Precautions. It is beyond the scope of this article to review specific diseases; however, I mention some briefly as examples.</p><sec id="cesec80"><title>Contact Precautions</title><p id="para310">Contact is the most common mode of transmission.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Infections are spread directly when disease-causing microorgan-isms pass from an infected person to a healthy person via direct physical contact with blood or body fluids. Examples of direct contact in health care settings are touching, contact with oral secretions or contact with body lesions. Infectious microorganisms also can be transferred indirectly via a contaminated intermediate object or person. Contaminated hands frequently are cited as a significant source of indirect contact transmission.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Other modes of indirect contact transmission include percutaneous injuries sustained via a contaminated needle or other sharp object and instruments, surfaces and equipment that are not properly cleaned and disinfected or sterilized between patients.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</p><p id="para320">Contact Precautions are intended to prevent transmission of infectious agents that are spread by direct or indirect contact with the patient or the patient's environment. Examples of conditions requiring Contact Precautions include, but are not limited to, herpes simplex (mucocutaneous, disseminated, or primary or severe) and MRSA. Recurrent oral herpetic lesions only require Standard Precautions.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> CDC's MDROs guideline covers patients colonized or infected with MDROs, such as MRSA.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Contact Precautions are recommended for inpatients known to be infected or colonized with MDROs and for patients in ambulatory care settings who have uncontrolled wound drainage or other syndromes representing increased risk of contact transmission.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>
</p><sec id="cesec90"><title>PPE</title><p id="para330">HCP caring for patients requiring Contact Precautions should wear protective clothing and gloves whenever contacting the patient or potentially contaminated areas surrounding the patient. To contain pathogens, PPE should be donned when HCP enter the room. This is distinctly different from Standard Precautions, for which protective clothing is worn only if contact with blood or body fluid is anticipated. Also, to prevent environmental contamination outside of the treatment room, PPE should be removed in a manner that prevents contamination of underlying clothing and skin and discarded before exiting the room, and hand hygiene should be performed.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</p><p id="para340">In ambulatory care clinics, such as a dental clinic, Contact Precautions are indicated only for patients who have uncontrolled wound drainage or other syndromes representing increased risk of contact transmission. Strict enforcement of Standard Precautions, including wearing gloves and protective clothing when contact with uncontrolled secretions and other potentially infectious body fluids is anticipated, is considered adequate in most situations to prevent the transmission of MRSA and other MDROs.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="cesec100"><title>Patient placement</title><p id="para350">In acute care hospitals, it is preferred that each inpatient is placed in a single-patient room to limit the opportunities for transmission. In some cases, cohorting (grouping patients infected or colonized with the same infectious agent together in one area to limit further transmission) may be acceptable after assessing the risks associated with this type of patient placement. In dental care settings, place patients requiring Contact Precautions in a treatment room or operatory as soon as possible after they arrive at the dental office to limit the number of people exposed in the waiting area.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref>
</p></sec><sec id="cesec110"><title>Patient transport</title><p id="para360">Transporting patients should be limited as much as possible to reduce opportunities for disease transmission to staff members and other patients. If a patient in any health care setting must be transported to another area in the facility or office, all infected or colonized areas of the patient's body should be contained or covered.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref>
</p></sec></sec><sec id="cesec120"><title>Droplet Precautions</title><p id="para370">Droplet Precautions should be followed to prevent the transmission of pathogens spread through close respiratory or mucous membrane contact with respiratory secretions. Person-to-person transmission can occur when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks and generates large-particle droplets (&#x0003e; 5 micrometers). Blood and saliva frequently spatter during dental treatment, and disease transmission may occur if these fluids from an infected patient contact unprotected broken skin or mucous membranes.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Generally, special ventilation requirements are not required to prevent droplet transmission because these pathogens do not remain infectious across long distances in a health care facility. Three feet is considered the definition of a &#x0201c;short distance&#x0201d;; however, the results from some studies have shown that droplets traveled six feet or more with emerging and highly virulent pathogens (for example, SARS or smallpox).<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Technically, droplet transmission is considered a form of contact transmission because some infectious agents transmitted via this route also may be transmitted by direct or indirect contact.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref>
</p><p id="para380">Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses and commonly is referred to as &#x0201c;seasonal&#x0201d; influenza because it typically occurs in winter. It can cause mild to severe illness, but sometimes it can lead to death. Influenza is spread from person to person primarily when an infected person coughs and sneezes, so it is a good example of a condition requiring Droplet Precautions. As I previously mentioned, sometimes people become infected by touching something with influenza viruses on it and then touching their mouths or noses. Therefore, frequent hand hygiene is critical in preventing further spread of influenza. Patients with acute respiratory illnesses often visit their dentists, and, as with any patient, the goal of infection control is to prevent transmission of the disease. Other examples of diseases spread through droplets include pertussis, mumps and rubella. Implementing respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette measures at the first point of contact with a potentially infected person is vital with diseases spread by droplets.</p><sec id="cesec130"><title>PPE</title><p id="para390">HCP should wear a mask that preferably is donned when entering a room before engaging in close contact with infective patients. CDC's 2007 isolation guideline does not make a recommendation for routinely wearing eye protection in addition to a mask for close contact with patients who require Droplet Precautions.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Nevertheless, protective eyewear is indicated for DHCP because rotary dental and surgical instruments (for example, handpieces and ultrasonic scalers) and air-water syringes primarily generate a large-particle spatter of water, saliva, blood, microorganisms and other debris that may contact unprotected mucous membranes of the eyes, leading to microorganisms entering the body.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="cesec140"><title>Patient placement</title><p id="para400">As with Contact Precautions, placing each patient in a single-patient room is preferable so that opportunities for transmission are limited. In some cases, cohorting may be acceptable after assessing the risks associated with this type of patient placement. Instruct patients receiving treatment in dental ambulatory care settings to follow respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette and place them in an examination room promptly after arriving at the dental office to limit exposure to other people in the waiting area.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref>
</p></sec><sec id="cesec150"><title>Patient transport</title><p id="para410">Transporting of patients who require Droplet Precautions should be limited. If a patient requires transport to another area of the facility, the patient should wear a mask and follow respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette to reduce opportunities for transmission.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref>
</p></sec></sec><sec id="cesec160"><title>Airborne Precautions</title><p id="para420">Airborne transmission involves particles that are smaller (&#x0003c; 5 &#x003bc;m) and are called &#x0201c;droplet nuclei&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;aerosols.&#x0201d; Transmission occurs when these particles, which can remain suspended in the air for long periods, are inhaled by DHCP or patients. Exposure to aerosols containing microorganisms from a patient's blood or saliva may occur during a use of rotary dental and surgical instruments, including dental handpieces and ultrasonic scalers.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Airborne Precautions are used to prevent transmission of infectious agents that remain infectious across long distances when suspended in the air. Examples of diseases transmitted via the airborne route may include, but are not limited to, rubeola virus (measles) and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>.</p><sec id="cesec170"><title>PPE</title><p id="para430">Because surgical masks protect the mouth and nose only from splashes, spray and spatter from large-particle droplets and not the smaller aerosol particles, they cannot be used when Airborne Precautions are indicated. When breathing with a surgical mask in place, much of the inhaled air comes in around the sides of the mask, along with airborne organisms. According to CDC's 2007 isolation guideline, HCP should don fit-tested N95 respirators approved by CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) when entering the room of a patient who has confirmed or suspected infectious pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis (TB) or who is suspected of having TB when infectious skin lesions are present and for aerosol-generating procedures.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> This recommendation also applies when treating patients with smallpox.</p><p id="para440">When HCP use respirators while treating patients with diseases requiring Airborne Precautions, they should use the respirators in the context of a complete respiratory protection program. This program should include training and fit testing to ensure an adequate seal between the edges of the respirator and the wearer's face.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Because it is not likely that patients with confirmed TB or who are suspected of having TB will be treated in nonhospital&#x02013;based dental clinics, a respiratory protection program is not always necessary for ambulatory care settings. Health care settings in which HCP do not treat patients with TB need only written protocols for recognizing the signs and symptoms of TB and for referring patients to a setting in which they can be treated.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref>
</p></sec><sec id="cesec180"><title>Patient placement</title><p id="para450">A patient requiring Airborne Precautions should be in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR), which is a single-patient room with special air-handling and ventilation capacity.

Elements of a respiratory protection program include education about use of respirators, fit testing and user seal checks with each use of an N95 respirator.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref>
</p><p id="para460">In dental offices or other medical settings in which Airborne Precautions cannot be implemented because of limited engineering resources, having the patient wear a mask, placing the patient in a private room (for example, an examination room) with the door closed and providing N95 or better respirators (or masks, if respirators are not available) to HCP will reduce the likelihood of airborne transmission until the patient is either transferred to a facility with an AIIR or returned to the home environment, as deemed medically appropriate.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> If a patient has TB or is suspected of having TB, CDC recommends postponing any nonurgent dental treatment until the patient does not have TB or is not infectious.

Using Standard Precautions is the primary infection control strategy; it was designed to use when treating all patients, regardless of diagnosis or presumed infectious status. However, when the routes of transmission cannot be interrupted completely with Standard Precautions alone, it is necessary to use Transmission-Based Precautions. I reviewed the three categories of Transmission-Based Precautions&#x02014;Contact, Droplet and Airborne&#x02014;along with recommendations for managing the treatment of patients with conditions that require the use of these measures as well as Standard Precautions. Traditionally, patients with diseases requiring Transmission-Based Precautions were too ill to seek routine outpatient dental care. However, with the emergence of new pathogens and more patients' seeking care in ambulatory care facilities, it is more likely that dentists may see these patients for treatment. DHCP need to be aware of additional measures they need to take when treating these patients in an outpatient setting so that they fully protect other patients, their staff members and themselves.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group
