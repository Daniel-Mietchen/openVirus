Correct diagnosis and treatment is important for achieving a high quality of care. As a national organisation whose role is to educate and advocate for the needs of patients with primary headaches, the Danish Headache Society has set up a task force to develop a set of guidelines for the diagnosis, organisation and treatment of the most common types of headaches and for trigeminal neuralgia in Denmark. The guideline was published in Danish in 2010 and has been a great success. The Danish Headache Society decided to translate and publish our guideline in English to stimulate the discussion on optimal organisation and treatment of headache disorders and to encourage other national headache authorities to produce their own guidelines. The recommendations regarding the most common primary headaches and trigeminal neuralgia are largely in accordance with the European guidelines produced by the European Federation of Neurological Societies. The guideline provides a practical tool for use in daily clinical practice for primary care physicians, neurologists with a common interest in headache, as well as other health-care professionals treating headache patients. The guideline first describes how to examine and diagnose the headache patient and how headache treatment is organised in Denmark. This description is followed by individual sections on the characteristics, diagnosis, differential diagnosis and treatment of each of the major headache disorders and trigeminal neuralgia. The guideline includes many tables to facilitate a quick overview. Finally, the particular problems regarding headache in children and headache in relation to female hormones and pregnancy are described.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2012</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Headache conditions are among the ten most costly diseases in Europe and one in every three Danes have seen a physician at some point in their lives due to a headache. In a normal Danish general practice, more than 10% of patients have migraine and more than 5% suffer from a chronic, often incapacitating, headache. Due to the high occurrence, the overall socioeconomic costs derived from headaches are substantial and also cause 20% of the overall sickness absence recorded in the total Danish workforce. The quality of life of patients who suffer from headaches is also considerably reduced. Consumption of medication follows an increasing trend and the recent introduction of novel specific migraine medications and novel prophylactic pharmaceuticals contributes to a considerable need to establish a systematic and updated treatment strategy in Denmark. The overwhelming majority of Danes who suffer from headaches are currently being treated in primary health care and should continue to be so in future, but there is a growing need for clear guidelines on referral and organisation of specialist treatment of the more severe and rare headache conditions.</p><p>International general recommendations on the treatment of migraine and other primary headache disorders are now in place, and there is a substantial need to implement such guidelines in the Danish context.</p><p>In Denmark, patients with trigeminal neuralgia and other types of facial pain are typically treated by specialised neurologists, but even in this field there is a growing need for organisation and systematisation of treatment offers, particularly in the light of novel treatment strategies. This type of neuralgia is closely related to headache conditions and is therefore included in the present guidelines.</p><p>On this background, the Danish Headache Society established a workgroup with a view to revising the previous Danish reference programme on headache conditions from 1994. The present reference programme was prepared in relation to the general recommendations made by the previous Reference Programme Committee of the Danish National Board of Health and has been the subject of a hearing phase in the Danish Neurological Society and Danish Headache Society. In the present paper, the reference programme is translated into English and adapted to journal format.

The international headache classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] marked a substantial step forward for our understanding of the various types of headache, but also has the weakness of focusing on symptoms rather than patients. It may therefore be useful to focus on the overall differences between migraine and the most frequent differential diagnosis, tension-type headache, when the diagnosis is made. Furthermore, it is important to keep in mind that many patients suffer from migraine as well as tension-type headache.

In migraine with aura, the headache phase frequently meets the criteria for migraine without aura and is then classified as typical aura with migraine headache (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). It should be noted that aura is not necessarily followed by headache, and that such headache does not necessarily meet the criteria for migraine without aura.

It is probable that migraine is a neurovascular disease in which a genetic disposition makes the brain of patients susceptible to a series of endogenous and exogenous trigger factors.</p><p>Migraine aura is probably caused by a transitory and slowly extending reduced neuronal metabolism, which typically starts occipitally, so-called cortical spreading depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Migraine headache is probably caused by activation of nociceptors in the meninges and cerebral vessels and by secondary, increased pain sensitivity in the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Clinical assessment and special assessment programme</title><p>Use of a headache diary is essential to reach the correct diagnosis, particularly to distinguish between mild migraine attacks and tension-type headache, and to exclude medication overuse headache.</p><p>Comorbidity, e.g. hypertension, asthma, severe obesity and depression, shall also be diagnosed and managed.

In between clusters, patients have symptom-free periods of highly varying lengths (from weeks to several years). Cluster headaches are severe, unilateral headaches with burning and drilling pain around or above one eye or temporally. In the majority of cases, the same side is affected in all attacks (but the pain can change sides). The pain typically has a duration of 45&#x02013;90&#x000a0;min and may occur several times a day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In some patients, the attacks occur at roughly the same time of day every day, and in others clusters occur at the same time of every year. The pain is accompanied by ipsilateral autonomic symptoms such as rhinorrhoea, lacrimation, ptosis, miosis and oedema of the eyelid as signs of parasympathetic hyperactivity and sympathetic hypoactivity. Patients are typically restless and agitated during attacks. Attacks often occur at night, typically 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;h after the patient has fallen asleep. Migraine-like symptoms such as nausea, photophobia and phonophobia may also occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].

Atypical facial pain does not have the neuralgiform characteristics seen in TN, but is often a more constant, diffuse pain.<table-wrap id="Tab18"><label>Table&#x000a0;18</label><caption><p>Characteristics of trigeminal neuralgia</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left">In the majority of cases, trigeminal neuralgia is a unilateral condition with ultra-short stabbing pain located along one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Onset is most often located to the second or third branch</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Onset typically occurs after 50&#x000a0;years of age</td></tr><tr><td align="left">The pain is often triggered by stimuli such as chewing, washing of the face, speech, tooth-brushing, shaving and cold winds, but also occurs without any stimuli.

Approximately, 200&#x02013;250 new cases are seen in Denmark annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. TN may be caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve, most frequently near its connection to the brainstem. Compression is frequently caused by a minor artery leading to the cerebellum. This causes demyelination of the nerve root and subsequently ephaptic impulse formation with cross-excitation of the neighbouring fibres (in plain English: short-circuiting of the nerve fibres). TN is furthermore seen in multiple sclerosis and in idiopathic cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec73"><title>Clinical assessment</title><p>A thorough medical history and a detailed neurological examination are essential to reach the correct diagnosis.

In microvascular decompression, a retromastoid craniotomy is performed after which the vessel(s) compressing the nerve are dissected off.

The pain is often triggered by stimuli such as chewing, washing of the face, speech and tooth-brushing. Trigeminal neuralgia is primarily caused by compression of the nerve near its origin at the pons. The treatment consists primarily of prophylactic pharmacological treatment with anti-epileptics. In case of insufficient effect or unacceptable side effects, neurosurgical treatment using microvascular decompression or lesion treatment should be considered.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec82"><title>Hormones and migraine</title><p>This section describes the particular conditions associated with migraine in relation to menstruation, hormonal treatment, pregnancy and breast-feeding.</p><sec id="Sec83"><title>Diagnosis</title><p>Menstrual migraine is defined as migraine attacks occurring on the first menstrual day&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;days in a minimum of two out of three menstrual cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Menstruation is defined as endometrial haemorrhage associated with either a normal menstrual cycle or discontinuation of added female sex hormone, e.g. from oestrogen-containing contraceptive pills and cyclic hormone therapy.</p><p>The overwhelming majority of women also have migraine attacks at points in time that are unrelated to their menstrual cycle. In such cases, migraine is classified as menstrually related migraine. If attacks occur exclusively in connection with menstrual periods, the condition is defined as pure menstrual migraine.</p></sec><sec id="Sec84"><title>Background</title><p>The occurrence of migraine is associated with the menstrual cycle. This is particularly pronounced for migraine without aura [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Migraine is equally frequent in pre-adolescent girls and boys, but approximately three times as many women as men have migraine after puberty. Migraine may be triggered by a sudden drop in the oestrogen level, but only if the level has previously remained high for several days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. This explains why migraine occurs more frequently at menstrual periods and less frequently during pregnancy. There is, however, no certain association with ovulation. Around menopause, some women experience an aggravation of their migraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. After menopause, both the incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] and the prevalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] of migraine decrease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec85"><title>Specific risk factors</title><p>The risk of cerebral infarction is approximately doubled in women with migraine with aura compared with the background population. If these women are under 45&#x000a0;years and are smokers or take oestrogen-containing contraceptive pills, the risk is considerably higher. As cerebral infarction occurs rarely in young persons, it is difficult to quantify the increase in relative risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. However, it is now considered a fact that young women who have migraine with aura are at an increased risk of cerebral infarction. It is important to put this into perspective, as the absolute risk of cerebral infarction remains small in young women with migraine (18 cases per 100,000 female years).</p><p>In one study, an overweight of cardiovascular risk factors was found in patients with migraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], but the causes of the increased risk of cerebral infarction in women with migraine with aura remain unknown. Women above 45&#x000a0;years of age with migraine without aura do not have an increased risk of cerebral infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Migraine with aura is thus a risk factor for cerebral infarction in women, and the risk is more pronounced in women below 45&#x000a0;years of age who are smokers and who take oestrogen-containing contraceptive pills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. In women suffering from migraine with aura it is essential, to the extent possible, to reduce other known and modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, smoking, etc.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Contraceptive measures without systemic oestrogen contents should be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, most experts do not consider that oestrogen-containing contraceptive pills are an absolute contraindication if there are substantial reasons to choose these [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. For such treatment, contraceptive pills with the lowest possible oestrogen contents should be used, and the patient should be informed of the increased risk. Hormonal contraceptives only containing progesterone do not increase the risk of cerebral infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Young women who have migraine with aura are strongly encouraged not to smoke. Women who have migraine with aura should be informed that they have a slightly increased risk of a blood clot in the brain, but that the risk is very limited if no other risk factors exist and if they abstain from smoking and from taking oestrogen-containing contraceptive pills. Consequently, for the overwhelming majority of these patients, migraine is a benign if bothersome condition with a good prognosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec86"><title>The effect of hormone treatments on migraine</title><p>There are no well-executed prospective studies which show how contraceptive pills affect migraine occurrence. Two retrospective studies reported that 24&#x02013;35% of women with migraine experienced an aggravation, 5% an improvement and 44&#x02013;65% no change in their migraine during treatment with contraceptive pills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. In a recent, population-based study from Norway, an increased occurrence of migraine was found among women taking oestrogen-containing contraceptive pills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. The overall conclusion is that contraceptive pills often have no impact on the course of migraine, but when there is an impact, it is generally an aggravation.</p><p>Cyclic oestrogen treatment in connection with menstruation was reported to have some beneficial effect in a limited number of small studies, but such effect could not be confirmed in a recent placebo-controlled study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. When there is a need for hormonal substitution treatment, continuous treatment with transdermal oestrogen should be preferred, as in the majority of cases this does not aggravate migraine in contrast to oral hormone treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].
