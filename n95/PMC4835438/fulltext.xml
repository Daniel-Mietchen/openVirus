The outbreak was almost all healthcare-associated, which was aggravated by lack of availability in laboratory diagnosis of MERS-CoV on site. On behalf of the MERS joint public and private sector response committee (MERS Joint committee), the Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine (KSLM) launched a MERS response task force (MERS KSLM TF) to facilitate clinical laboratories set up MERS molecular diagnosis. MERS TF established guidelines for laboratory diagnosis of MERS-CoV and provided it to all participating laboratories as the official guidance of MERS Joint committee. This guideline was used for procedure manual of molecular diagnosis of MERS-CoV and laboratory safety manual.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus</kwd><kwd>The Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine</kwd><kwd>Task force</kwd><kwd>Molecular diagnosis</kwd><kwd>Guideline</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Basic description of MERS-CoV diagnosis</title><sec><title>1.

Early diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection from close contact cases</title><p>Before close contact cases progress to full-brown MERS an early diagnosis is essential to prevent further spread. Therefore, both upper and lower respiratory tract specimens are collected at the same time for the diagnosis of close contact cases when the symptoms are not overt [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Detection tests of MERS-CoV RNA are performed at least two times on the 7th and 14th days after exposure or whenever related symptoms are developed. To collect sputum specimens from the cases with no purulent sputum, he or she is carefully instructed to exert cough forcefully until the secretion from trachea is produced. Even if the tests are negative, close contact cases are quarantined until 14 days after exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>4. Differential diagnosis of unknown causes of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI)</title><p>For all patients with pneumonia accompanied by fever, the detection tests of MERS-CoV RNA is incorporated to the diagnostic panels to differentiate the cause of SARI during MERS epidemics.</p><p>*Caution: There are many reports of co-infection of MERS-CoV with parainfluenza, rhinovirus, influenza A (H1N1) pdm09, herpes simplex, and influenza B. Therefore, differential diagnosis for MERS-CoV infection is recommended even when one of the above pathogens is detected.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Specimen types and handling of detection tests of MERS-CoV RNA</title><sec><title>1.

For the acute phase, both molecular detection tests and antibody tests can be performed, and in order to look for seroconversion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), recovery-phase blood is also required.

After work on the specimen has been completed, the BSC is sterilized with 70% alcohol.</p></list-item><list-item><p>d. Any objects that contact the infectious specimen should be disposable if possible, and if they become contaminated by the specimen, they need to be autoclaved before disposal.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>7) Specimen handling during common tests (biochemical, hematological, and other tests)</p><p>
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>a. When hematological or biochemical tests are performed using blood, serum, or urine specimens, standard precautions should be taken, as with any ordinary clinical specimen.</p></list-item><list-item><p>b. Use a BSC when producing smears (cytospin, etc.) or counting the number of cells in bodily fluids other than blood (e.g. BAL).</p></list-item><list-item><p>c. Respiratory specimens and other body fluids (including feces) are infectious specimens, and must be processed at a class II biosafety cabinet.</p></list-item><list-item><p>d. Tests that should be performed in standard precaution</p><p>
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>i. Pathological tests of tissue that has been fixed in formalin or inactivated by another method</p></list-item><list-item><p>ii. Molecular tests using nucleic acid extract</p></list-item><list-item><p>iii. Examination using an electron microscope after fixation in glutaraldehyde</p></list-item><list-item><p>iv. Testing bacterial and fungal cultures in a microbial laboratory</p></list-item><list-item><p>v. Tertiary (final) package of infectious specimens: specimens already enclosed in the secondary container</p></list-item><list-item><p>vi. Inactivated specimens (specimens in nucleic acid extraction solution)</p></list-item></list>
</p></list-item><list-item><p>e. Procedures that should be performed using a class II BSC</p><p>
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>i. Splitting and dilution of infectious specimens</p></list-item><list-item><p>ii. Media inoculation for bacterial and fungal cultures</p></list-item><list-item><p>iii. Diagnostic tests for infectious specimens, other than isolation or culturing of MERS-CoV</p></list-item><list-item><p>iv. Nucleic acid extraction from infectious specimens</p></list-item><list-item><p>v. When producing smears for microscopic observation, specimens should only be moved outside BSC after inactivation
of MERS-CoV by chemical or heat fixation.</p><p><sup>*</sup> Take care that neither the devices nor the bench inside
the BSC are contaminated, and in the case of contamination, decontamination must be performed.</p><p>e.g.) Dangerous actions - specimen pipetting (use filter
tips or disposal droppers), specimen splitting and dilution (an absorbent, non-permeable mat must be used when moving specimen to the bench), excessive or rapid force during pipetting (to-deliver types are safer than to-contain types), disposing of disposable pipette tips in a waste container holding an antiseptic solution (the waste container should be used inside the BSC), using syringes (do not use if possible), burning (burners and alcohol lamps should not be used), writing (no writing is allowed inside the BSC)</p><p><sup>*</sup> BSC decontamination: Fumigation must be performed when the filter needs to be changed.</p></list-item></list>
</p></list-item><list-item><p>f. Isolation or culturing of MERS-CoV requires BL3 equipment
and protocols</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>8) Environmental infection control</p><p>
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>a. All waste materials contaminated with infectious specimen,
test tubes, pipette tips, and other disposable items are collected in a Y-bag, taped, and autoclaved before disposal. Syringes and needles are placed in a medical waste container, and collected and incinerated by a certified waste management company, in accordance with the Wastes Control Act.</p></list-item><list-item><p>b. Contaminated disposable items are placed in a Y-bag immediately,
in the place that they were used.</p></list-item><list-item><p>c. Sterilization method: At least 15 minutes at 121&#x02103;, 1 atm, by autoclave</p></list-item><list-item><p>d. Environmental surfaces (devices, surfaces of objects, etc.) contaminated with blood, body fluids, secretions, or excrement</p><p>
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>i. Disinfectants : 70% alcohol or 0.5% sodium hypochlorite</p></list-item><list-item><p>ii. Specimens of feces or body fluids are disposed through the sewage system, in accordance with sewage regulations.</p></list-item><list-item><p>iii. When disposing of liquid waste, care must be taken that it does not splash</p></list-item></list>
</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>9) In the case of contact with infectious respiratory specimens from an infected patient without the proper protective equipment against aerosols, the KCDC guideline to treat the person who contact with confirmed case is followed</p><p>
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>e.g.) Spillage accident, specimen splashing onto an unprotected face during processing</p></list-item></list>
