    "Five health care systems in Texas.To describe the epidemiology of inadequate isolation for pulmonary tuberculosis leading to tuberculosis (TB) exposures from confirmed TB patients and the patient factors that led to the exposures.A retrospective cohort and case-control study of adult patients with TB resulting in exposures (cases) vs those TB patients who did not result in exposures (controls) during January 2005 to December 2012.There were 335 patients with pulmonary TB disease, 199 cases and 136 controls. There was no difference between groups in age (46 ± 14.6 vs 45 ± 17 years; P > .05), race, or substance abuse. Cases were more likely to be transplant recipients (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 18.90; 95% CI, 1.9-187.76), have typical TB chest radiograph (AOR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.1-4.51), and have positive acid-fast bacilli stains (AOR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.31-4.27). Cases were less likely to have extrapulmonary disease (AOR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.24-0.95).TB exposure resulting from inadequate isolation is frequent in health care settings. Extrapulmonary involvement resulted in earlier airborne isolation. Being a transplant recipient, having chest radiograph findings typical for TB, and sputum positivity acid-fast bacilli upon staining were associated with increased risk of inadequate isolation."
