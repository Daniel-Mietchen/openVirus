In 2011, most European countries reported MRSA prevalence rates between 10% and 50%, while only six countries (Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, Estonia and the Netherlands) reported prevalence rates of less than 5% [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The most likely explanation for the low rate in the Netherlands is the MRSA &#x02018;Search and Destroy&#x02019; (S&#x00026;D) policy that was implemented in Dutch hospitals in 1988. This policy aims to prevent MRSA transmission and has resulted in stable and low MRSA prevalence rates since its introduction. Nowadays, the overall Dutch MRSA prevalence rate is estimated to be 1.7% (percentage of MRSA positive isolates with respect to all <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> isolates) [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The Dutch MRSA S&#x00026;D policy is characterized by active screening and pre-emptive isolation of high risk groups, as well as treatment of infections and colonization and isolation of MRSA positive patients in a single room until decolonization is successfully established [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In 2006, Bootsma et al. reported a significant association between application of the S&#x00026;D policy and lower prevalence rates in hospitals and the community, which demonstrates its success in MRSA control [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, several cost-benefit studies that were carried out in Dutch hospitals showed that the MRSA S&#x00026;D policy is probably beneficial [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Despite these promising results, a major drawback of these studies is the lack of detailed information on costs and benefits of the separate components of the S&#x00026;D policy, limiting the evaluation of these components. Several studies have suggested that minor changes (such as incorporation of PCR screening and excluding pre-emptive isolation in high risk groups from the MRSA S&#x00026;D policy) may improve the costs of the S&#x00026;D policy [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148175.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Detailed information on costs and benefits of separate S&#x00026;D policy components will help to evaluate the effect of adaptations of the policy.</p><p>Furthermore, the results of previously performed cost-benefit studies of S&#x00026;D policies in the Netherlands may not be directly applicable to all regions. The regional MRSA prevalence can have a great influence on the estimation of costs of these policies [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For example, in some regions of the Netherlands the MRSA incidence increased three-fold since 2006, when persons who work with pigs and veal calves were added to the high risk group (33% of this group is colonized with livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA)) [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148175.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148175.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In this perspective, regional cost-benefit studies are essential since regional differences in MRSA (and LA-MRSA) prevalence can influence costs and benefits involved with the S&#x00026;D policy.</p><p>In the Kennemer Gasthuis, a 400 bed teaching hospital in the region Kennemerland, all actions involved with the MRSA S&#x00026;D policy are registered by the Infection Control Department (ICD), allowing the possibility to evaluate the costs and benefits of this policy. The aim of the present study is to describe the epidemiology, costs and benefits of the MRSA S&#x00026;D policy in the Kennemer Gasthuis, over a six-year period (between 2008 and 2013). Additionally, the total costs for inpatients were calculated for five different scenarios: (1) following the current guidelines whereby culture and PCR screening are used combined (as actually occurred), (2) following the current guidelines when only culture or (3) PCR screening was used and (4) a proposed adjustment scenario (abandoning pre-emptive isolation) using only culture or (5) PCR screening.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>According to the Dutch regulation for research with human subjects, neither medical or ethical approval was required to conduct the study since the data were retrospectively recorded. Additionally we received approval to conduct the study from the institutional review board of the Kennemer Gasthuis which waived the need for participant consent. The data were anonymized and analyzed under code.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>The MRSA &#x02018;Search and Destroy&#x02019; policy and population</title><p>The Dutch MRSA S&#x00026;D policy protocol, which is implemented in the Kennemer Gasthuis, aims to actively search for MRSA positive patients through screening and isolation of (high) risk groups [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Risk groups can be divided into three groups: (1) high, (2) low and (3) no increased risk. High-risk groups are preventively isolated until microbiological test results are known, and isolation measures are continued when patients test positive and lifted when negative. These high-risk groups are: (1) microbiological confirmed MRSA positive patients, (2) patients who had unprotected contact with a MRSA positive person, (3) patients who were recently admitted to a hospital abroad (less than 2 months ago), (4) patients treated in a hospital with an ongoing MRSA outbreak, (5) foreign holiday dialysis patients and since 2006, (6) persons who work with pigs and veal calves. Low-risk groups are not nursed in isolation, but only tested for MRSA colonization (and isolated when testing positive) and defined as: (1) patients who were recently admitted to a hospital abroad (more than 2 months ago), (2) patients who had unprotected contact with a MRSA positive Health Care Worker (HCW) and (3) former positive patients (but not yet tested negative after one year). Patients without any of the above mentioned risk factors were assumed to be &#x02018;not at risk&#x02019; for MRSA colonization. Patients who test positive receive decolonizing treatment and are considered decolonized when three consecutive negative tests are available with an interval of at least seven days. Apart from the risk approach described above, some patients have a clinical sample cultured with MRSA as an unexpected result during their hospital stay. In case of an unexpected MRSA positive patient, all contacts (patients and HCWs) are screened for MRSA colonization. Contacts (patients) are isolated until test results are known and measures are lifted when tests are negative. HCWs who test positive for MRSA are suspended from work and return to work after proven negative. Furthermore, when contacts (patients and HCWs) test positive, decolonizing treatment will follow according to the S&#x00026;D policy. The ICD is responsible for consultation (for physicians, nursing personal and patients) and registration of the policy activities. This department also coordinates and performs the contact tracing (and the sampling of patients).</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Data collection</title><p>Between 2008 and 2013, data on the following items were collected by the ICD in the Kennemer Gasthuis: patient demographics, risk category (as described above), in-, out- or dialysis patient, MRSA positive or negative and if necessary, how many contacts (patients and HCWs) were screened. Additionally, admission data obtained from the hospital information system and culture data obtained from the laboratory information system of the Regional Public Health Laboratory Kennemerland (RPHLK) were combined with the MRSA screening database.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>MRSA screening procedures</title><p>At admission, all patients were interviewed and categorized in risk groups. For high and low risk groups screening was performed with either the PCR (when the patient needed an invasive procedure) or culture method (for all other patients). For inpatients and contacts, a MRSA screening set consisted of three (throat, nose and perineum) swabs [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For out- and dialysis patients, a MRSA screening set consisted of two swabs (throat and nose) and one swab (nose) respectively. To limit the burden in the outpatients clinic and for privacy reasons we choose for this culture regime during the study period. When positive, only one positive swab per set was completely characterized. After treatment, a MRSA follow-up test consisted of three negative MRSA sets of three swabs each (throat, nose and perineum). The average time between date of sampling and test outcome for culturing and PCR was considered to be five and one day(s) respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Isolation, treatment of carriers and other additional procedures</title><p>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) was used for nursing the patient in strict isolation as part of the MRSA S&#x00026;D policy [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A complete set of PPE consisted of gloves, a gown and a N95 respiratory mask (covering nose and mouth). Based on observations of the ICD, on average three sets of PPE were used for out- and dialysis patients, per patient, per day. For inpatients, on average fifteen sets each and additionally, twenty extra pairs of gloves and masks were used per patient on a daily basis. For intensive care (IC) patients, 0.5 FTE extra HCWs were employed per isolation day.</p><p>MRSA carriers were treated with rifampicin (twice daily 600 mg, seven days) and an antibiotic treatment following the antibiotic resistance pattern (such as trimethoprim-sulphametoxazole, twice daily 960 mg, seven days or doxycycline, daily 200 mg, seven days) until eradication was achieved [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As part of the eradication treatment, betadine shampoo (75 mg/ml) on day 2 of the treatment, mupirocin ointment (three times a day, five days) and chlorhexidine soap (daily 40 mg/ml, during the complete treatment) were used for disinfection of hair, nose and skin.</p><p>For positive inpatients, a daily additional disinfection and room cleaning procedure was performed as well as after discharge.

They showed that only 1.6% of the inpatients hospitalized abroad and 3.2% of all high-risk inpatients were colonized with MRSA. This means that 96.8% of these inpatients were unnecessarily nursed in isolation. Based on Wassenberg&#x02019;s adjustment, we made a calculation of the expected costs using only PCR or culture screening after adjustment. An assumption was made that the previously expected positive patients were now unexpected (whereby contact tracing is indicated), since these inpatients were not isolated from the start of admission. We assumed that using the PCR screening method, 66% less contacts were screened since in our hospital PCR screened inpatients were on average 2.3 days shorter isolated than culture screened patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Benefits</title><p>In order to estimate the benefits of the S&#x00026;D policy, the number of prevented patients was compared to a hypothetical situation in which the S&#x00026;D policy was never applied.

The average costs and benefits were calculated between 2008&#x02013;2013 and specified per patient group, using the costs from the current situation as actually occurred (when PCR and culture was used combined).

As a consequence of the proposed adjustment, nine non-isolated positive patients (for whom costly contact tracing is indicated) would have been identified. In our hospital, 26% (6/23) of the unexpected (non-isolated) MRSA cases (inpatients) showed nosocomial spread (to patients and HCWs) resulting in two and seven patients with and without nosocomial spread. This leads to higher costs (in case of PCR &#x020ac; 2,599 and culture &#x020ac; 6,031) for this patient group since contact tracing is indicated compared to a situation in which they would have been properly isolated.

From our data it was calculated that the MRSA S&#x00026;D policy did not only save six lives per year, but also costs (at a MRSA prevalence rate of 50%). We expect that this is an underestimation, since higher MRSA mortality rates were reported in relation to MSSA (34% against 27%) [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In our study, a MRSA prevalence rate of 17.3% is considered as break-even point. In fact, countries that do not have a S&#x00026;D policy report MRSA prevalence rates up to 50% [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This means that abandoning the MRSA S&#x00026;D policy (and increasing MRSA prevalence rates) is associated with higher costs than continuing the MRSA S&#x00026;D policy.</p><p>In total, the costs for the MRSA S&#x00026;D policy between 2008 and 2013 were estimated to be &#x020ac; 290,672 (&#x020ac; 48,445 per year). Earlier, three other Dutch studies calculated the annual MRSA S&#x00026;D costs in three different hospitals which resulted in the following costs: &#x020ac; 215,559 (van Rijen et al., 2009), &#x020ac; 1,383,200 (Nulens et al., 2008) and &#x020ac; 280,000 (Vriens et al., 2002) [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. When the S&#x00026;D costs were standardized per 100 patients per year the costs were estimated to be &#x020ac; 65,466 (Kennemer Gasthuis), &#x020ac; 90,953 (van Rijen et al.), &#x020ac; 562,276 (Nulens et al.) and &#x020ac;92,409 (Vriens et al.). A comparison between our study and these three previous studies shows several discrepancies, which may explain the differences in standardized estimated annual costs. First, in the Kennemer Gasthuis no revenue loss occurred since no new admissions were stopped and no surgical procedures were avoided because no major outbreaks had occurred. All outbreaks were manageable since no more than one secondary patient (who was still admitted) was identified among a single index patient. When contact tracing, following the MRSA S&#x00026;D policy was performed among an unexpected MRSA positive patient, and more than one secondary positive patient was found, the Outbreak Management Team (OMT) of the Kennemer Gasthuis decided about closing wards and/or stopping new admissions. The OMT has considered this several times during the study period, but it never resulted in an admission stop. This policy is in line with the Dutch national MRSA S&#x00026;D guidelines where it is stated that the OMT makes a decision about closing wards based on the hospitals patient population and consequences when ongoing transmission is detected. Second, the additional daily isolation costs were much lower in the Kennemer Gasthuis, since no additional HCWs were deployed (on normal nursing wards) for isolated inpatients. For example, Nulens et al. calculated &#x020ac; 406 of isolation costs per isolation day, mainly caused by deployment of extra HCWs. In the Kennemer Gasthuis, the isolation costs were &#x020ac; 18 and &#x020ac; 105 for normal and IC nursing wards. Third, the fixed costs in the Kennemer Gasthuis were much lower since no new isolation rooms (with a negative air pressure gradient of 7.5 Pascal) were built and 0.15 FTE ICP was calculated, instead of 1 FTE by van Rijen et al. Fourth, the prevalence of livestock associated MRSA is low in the region Kennemerland, in comparison to other regions resulting in a lower MRSA incidence rate [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. All together, these discrepancies may explain the difference in costs between the present and the three earlier studies, and emphasize the relevance of performing cost-benefit studies of MRSA S&#x00026;D policies in different hospitals, even in a small country like the Netherlands were a widely supported policy is implemented.</p><p>As shown in <xref rid="pone.0148175.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, the average additional isolation costs per inpatient were considerably higher for the unexpectedly positive patient group. In this perspective, it is essential to adequately identify and isolate high-risk patients to save costs for contact tracing. However, it is alarming to see that 72.1% of the MRSA positive patients had no risk factors, showing that infections and colonization were more frequently found in non high-risk patients. This emphasizes the importance of good basic hygiene (such as maintaining hand washing protocols) that prevents transmission of MRSA (or other MDROs) from unknown positive patients within institutions. When patients are proven MRSA and multi resistant <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> spp. negative, strict isolation measures were changed to contact isolation until patients are proven MDRO negative (which is advised for the other MDROs), instead of lifted (as happened before) [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These other MDRO tests are routinely done by culturing (which is more time consuming compared to MRSA PCR). The proposed cost savings (daily isolation costs) using MRSA PCR have decreased after this guideline change, since patients are still isolated in strict isolation (if <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> spp. result is not yet available) or contact isolation (awaiting for all other MDRO screening results). As shown in our analyses, no cost savings were demonstrated using MRSA PCR instead of culturing. Faster but above all cheaper diagnostics for all MDROs are needed to save (isolation) costs.</p><p>The main characteristic that determines the success of programs like the Dutch MRSA S&#x00026;D policy is a widely supported policy that is feasible. In this context Wassenberg et al. suggested to lift pre-emptive isolation and only isolate patients when they test positive by using fast detection techniques such as PCR and/or chromogenic media [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This proposed adjustment might save costs and unnecessary isolation of patients and thereby strengthen the feasibility and success of the S&#x00026;D policy in the future [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Our data suggest that when only PCR or culture screening would be used, both would be less expensive without pre-emptive isolation saving costs and unnecessary isolation of patients. When comparing the costs after this adjustment, culturing seems to be the preferred method since this was &#x020ac; 36,570 less expensive compared to PCR, even when in the culture method 66% more contacts (because test results were 2.3 days later known compared to PCR) were incorporated. An important drawback of abandoning pre-emptive isolation is the possible transmission of MRSA from non-isolated positive high risk inpatients towards other patients and/or HCWs. In our study this percentage was 26% and should not be ignored by policy and decision makers because outbreaks eventually entail high costs [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The present study also has several limitations. First, the SAB mortality rate was not adequately registered and as a consequence not available for analysis. Therefore, we used the SAB mortality rate of van Rijen et al. as proxy for our own SAB mortality rate [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Second, our benefits estimation could have been overestimated since ample evidence is available on the proportion of addition and replacement of current SAB rates with increasing MRSA prevalence rates, as well as on the Dutch hospital costs for a MRSA bacteraemia (in the present study we used the median hospital costs for patients with a MRSA bacteraemia of Cosgrove et al.) [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148175.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In our study, we assumed (in line with van Rijen et al.) that in the worst-case scenario 100% of the MRSA cases were additional. However, a sensitivity analysis using the Kennemer Gasthuis data showed that in a 21% addition scenario (assuming a MRSA prevalence rate of 50%), the MRSA S&#x00026;D policy in the Kennemer Gasthuis would already been cost effective. Probably, both addition and replacement coexist as was shown in the studies of Wyllie et al. and Wassenberg et al. [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148175.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Third, in our benefits calculation we only included the costs and number of prevented MRSA bacteraemia patients, since this calculation can be performed accurately [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, in practice, rising MRSA prevalence rates will also cause &#x02018;less serious infections&#x02019; such as skin, soft tissue, post-surgical wound and catheter-related infections that also influence the benefits calculation (besides MRSA bacteraemia). When all these types of infections were taken into account, using the Kennemer Gasthuis data (including bacteraemia), 548 extra nosocomial MRSA infections were expected in the period between 2008&#x02013;2013 (assuming 100% addition and 50% MRSA prevalence). Filice et al. calculated the median hospital costs for MRSA infected patients, independent of the site of infection at &#x020ac; 31,168 [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This would imply that the costs/savings in this situation would be &#x020ac; 17,080,064 (548 times &#x020ac; 31.168) which is on average &#x020ac; 2,846,677 euro per year. As a consequence the break-even point would be 1.7% (instead of 17.4%). However, these calculations are highly dependent of the used median hospitals costs for these infections and the assumed percentage of addition and replacement. These calculations must be interpreted with caution since not much evidence is available about the exact hospital costs and percentage of addition and replacement as mentioned earlier. Fourth, our study was performed in a single hospital in the Netherlands limiting the generalizability towards other countries that do not perform a comparable S&#x00026;D policy or have higher prevalence rates. For example, the United Kingdom and United States of America differ largely from the Dutch S&#x00026;D approach since MRSA guidelines do not include strict isolation measures and contact screening among unexpected MRSA positive patients [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148175.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, in some other European countries (Austria, Spain and Italy), no national MRSA control guidelines are available resulting in large differences in hospitals for controlling MRSA [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148175.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, Bootsma et al. suggested that a full or stepwise implementation of S&#x00026;D in high prevalence countries may result in prevalence rates of &#x0003c;1% within 6&#x02013;12 years which would make the policy highly cost effective [<xref rid="pone.0148175.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>One of the strengths of this study is the extensive costs description of the specific components for different patient groups (in- out- and dialysis patients), as well as the stratification of negative and positive test results that allows to study small changes for different patient groups (such as excluding pre-emptive isolation in the inpatient setting) and calculate costs. This enables a comparison of the MRSA S&#x00026;D policy in the Kennemer Gasthuis with policies of other hospitals.</p><p>Our data showed that 72.1% of the MRSA positive patients were found unexpectedly and that only 3.3% of the high-risk patients carried MRSA. Consequently, 96.7% of the patients were unnecessarily isolated. We showed that excluding pre-emptive isolation is less expensive in spite of the assumed increase of the number of unexpected positive patients. For now, faster and cheaper diagnostics (for all MDROs) seem to have the greatest impact on costs and benefits of S&#x00026;D policies. We advise other hospitals to record their infection control activities to study the MRSA costs and benefits as described in this study and expect that regional collaborations are increasingly important in infection control.</p><p>In conclusion, the MRSA S&#x00026;D policy of the Kennemer Gasthuis is beneficial and should be continued to prevent the costs and deaths associated with increasing prevalence rates.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0148175.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Stefani</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>DR</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lindsay</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Friedrich</surname><given-names>AW</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kearns</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Westh</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
