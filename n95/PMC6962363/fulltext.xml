We share the infection prevention measures for surgical procedures during the unexpected outbreak at our hospital. We reviewed all forms of related documents and collected information through interviews with healthcare workers of our hospital. After the onset of outbreak, a multidisciplinary team devised institutional MERS-control guidelines. Two standard operating rooms were converted to temporary negative-pressure rooms by physically decreasing the inflow air volume (&#x02212;4.7&#x02009;Pa in the main room and &#x02212;1.2&#x02009;Pa in the anteroom). Healthcare workers were equipped with standard or enhanced personal protective equipment according to the MERS-related patient&#x02019;s profile and symptoms. Six MERS-related patients underwent emergency surgery, including four MERS-exposed and two MERS-confirmed patients. Negative conversion of MERS-CoV polymerase chain reaction tests was noticed for MERS-confirmed patients before surgery. MERS-exposed patients were also tested twice preoperatively, all of which were negative. All operative procedures in MERS-related patients were performed without specific adverse events or perioperative MERS transmission. Our experience with setting up a temporary negative-pressure operation room and our conservative approach for managing MERS-related patients can be referred in cases of future unexpected MERS outbreaks in non-endemic countries.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Preventive medicine</kwd><kwd>Viral infection</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a serious acute respiratory disease caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the mortality rates in infected patients are estimated at 20&#x02013;40%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Since the first case report in Saudi Arabia in 2012<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, MERS outbreaks have occurred mainly in Middle Eastern countries and a small number of imported cases arose in Europe, Asia, United States, and Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.

However, several MERS-related patients inevitably required emergency operations under anesthesia. Two of the 92-MERS confirmed cases and four MERS-exposed patients underwent surgery. Although there is some literature regarding infection prevention during operative procedures for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, guidelines or references for MERS prevention during perioperative patient care were very limited.

Moreover, there may be very few hospitals that are prepared to provide perioperative care for MERS patients.

Because a negative-pressure operating room is the optimal environment to prevent airborne virus spreading to adjacent areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, two of our 25 operating rooms in the main operating suite of the hospital were temporarily converted into negative-pressure operating rooms to perform surgical procedures on MERS-related patients. Operating rooms no. 16 and 17 were selected because they were connected to each other, but each room had separate atmospheric air inlets and exhaust systems. They also had separate air-conditioning and humidification systems. Of the two connected rooms, one was used as the main operating room and the other was used as the anteroom where healthcare workers (HCWs) applied and removed the personal protective equipment (PPE).</p><p id="Par7">In each room, fresh air was supplied from an inlet duct and discharged outside through the exhaust duct (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Because a constant exhausting air volume was maintained through the outlet duct, negative pressure in the operating room was achieved by decreasing the inflow air volume that entered through the inlet duct. First, the blades of the air volume control damper in the inlet duct were closed as much as possible (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, because the damper was not intended to be air-tight, the inflow volume to the operating room did not decrease sufficiently. Second, as an additional measure to decrease the inflow volume, we opened the access hole in the inlet duct, which was originally used for duct inspection purposes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Finally, a smoke test was carried out to ensure negative pressure. The room pressure was maintained at &#x02212;4.7&#x02009;Pa in the main operating room and at &#x02212;1.2&#x02009;Pa in the anteroom (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>); &#x02212;4.7&#x02009;Pa is below the negative pressure room standard of &#x02212;2.5&#x02009;Pa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>The ventilation system of the operation room.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2019_57216_Fig2_HTML" id="d29e341"/></fig><fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>The temporary negative pressure operating room and the anteroom.

When a MERS-related patient required an urgent or emergency operation, MERS-CoV PCR tests were performed twice with distinct specimens preoperatively, to account for asymptomatic MERS patients or delayed positive conversion in symptomatic MERS-exposed patients.

In principle, standard PPE was applied to HCWs who cared for asymptomatic MERS-exposed patients. Standard PPE includes surgical gloves, surgical gowns, eye shields, and N95 respirators. While managing MERS-confirmed or MERS-exposed patients with MERS-associated symptoms including fever, myalgia, respiratory symptoms, or diarrhea, HCWs implemented enhanced PPE, which included coverall clothes with head cover, shoe covers, goggles, two pairs of surgical gloves, and powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) or N95 respirators. Although we performed preoperative MERS-CoV PCR screening, enhanced PPE was still recommended when managing symptomatic MERS-exposed patients regardless of their PCR results. Anesthesiologists were recommended to apply enhanced PPE (including PAPR from the middle of the outbreak) when managing all MERS-related patients because they were most directly exposed to the aerosol-producing high-risk procedures, such as endotracheal intubation and extubation. Only minimal numbers of HCWs were present in the operating room. Institutional education regarding the precise use of PPE was provided to the all associated HCWs and they were assisted by skilled nurses in the operating room during the PPE donning and doffing processes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Patient transfer for operation</title><p id="Par12">MERS-related patients were transferred directly to the negative-pressure main operating room through an exclusive path and elevator by a physician wearing proper PPE. The walls and the floor of the passageways and the elevator were covered with plastic paper. MERS-related patients wore a surgical mask during transfer. Because only anesthesiologists wore enhanced PPE when in proximity to asymptomatic MERS-exposed patients, 30&#x02009;minutes of room ventilation was performed after anesthetic induction, including endotracheal intubation. The surgical team then entered the main operating room through the anteroom. In the cases of symptomatic MERS-exposed patients or MERS-confirmed cases, all HCWs wore enhanced PPE and the 30-minute ventilation time was not required.</p><p id="Par13">After completion of operation procedures, patients who were moved to the general ward recovered in the main operating room without going through the post-anesthesia care unit. Thirty minutes of room ventilation was performed after tracheal extubation. A physician in the main operating room sent the patient into the corridor, while the other physician outside the main operating room wearing PPE took over and transferred the patient to the general ward directly through the exclusive pathway (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Patients moving to the intensive care unit (ICU) were transferred while remaining intubated. Before transfers, we injected patients with a sufficient amount of intravenous muscle relaxant and sedative drugs to prevent coughing or movement and we applied a portable ventilator or bag-valve mask with a HEPA filter to the patient.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Transfer route for MERS-related patients.

Regarding PPE levels for the HCWs attending these six patients, standard PPE was applied during management of patient A (asymptomatic MERS-exposed patient), while anesthesiologists wore enhanced PPE for high-risk procedures (tracheal intubation). Enhanced PPE was applied to HCWs for patient B because the patient was symptomatic and still within the two-week incubation period, even though both PCR results were negative. Enhanced PPE, including PAPR to reduce risk of MERS-transmission, was applied for patient C who underwent surgery in the middle of the outbreak (phase 2).

The temporary negative-pressure operating room was maintained until June 25, 2015 and was converted back to two ordinary positive-pressure operating rooms after a declaration of the end of the MERS outbreak in our hospital.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par17">MERS, as well as SARS, is associated with coronaviruses, both of which have high affinity for the lower repiratory tract and easily produce severe pneumonia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Although MERS has lower human-to-human transmission potential and has resulted in fewer large outbreaks than SARS, there may be occasional amplification of clusters in healthcare settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Moreover, MERS case fatalities are reported to be much higher than SARS (35&#x02013;45% for MERS and 10&#x02013;15% for SARS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Unlike SARS, ongoing small and large MERS outbreaks in the Arabian Peninsula foster potential future MERS outbreaks in non-endemic countries. However, there is likely to be a very limited number of hospitals that are prepared with negative-pressure operating rooms, except for a few hospitals in Hong Kong that experienced the 2003 SARS outbreak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Almost all hospitals generally have positive-pressure operating rooms and they may experience an outbreak without facilities that are prepared for perioperative management of MERS patients, as our hospital did in 2015.</p><p id="Par18">One of the highlights of our experience during the outbreak was the temporary set-up of a negative-pressure operation room with an adequate pressure gradient (&#x02265;2.5&#x02009;Pa) by modifying two connected operating rooms according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Continuous negative pressure was maintained in the main operating room (&#x02212;4.7&#x02009;Pa) and the anteroom (&#x02212;1.2&#x02009;Pa). This temporary setting was possible because the two adjacent rooms had separate atmospheric air inlets and exhaust systems. Although we could not measure the airflow pattern or dispersion of infectious particles directly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, the cleanliness levels in both operating rooms were 2,500 particles, well below the institutional target cleanliness for general surgery (&#x0003c;10,000 particles).</p><p id="Par19">Although the precise route of MERS-virus transmission is currently not clearly understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, MERS, as well as SARS, is known to spread by direct contact with infectious material, such as large respiratory droplets, and also by airborne routes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Touching contaminated objects may also be a source of transmission; this is different from tuberculosis, which is transmitted by airborne routes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Therefore, when performing procedures that generate aerosols, such as endotracheal intubation, in patients with MERS or SARS, HCWs must wear enhanced PPE, including gloves, a gown, either a face-shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face or goggles, and respiratory protection at least as protective as an N95 filtering face piece respirator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. When removing PPE, care should also be taken not to contact contaminated materials. Considering potential aerosol generation in operating rooms and the transmission risk of MERS-CoV while changing PPE, the temporary modification of an operating room to a negative-pressure room with an anteroom should provide suitable protection for HCWs participating in operations on MERS-related patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">A second highlight of our experience is the highly conservative application of PPE to HCWs. At the time of the outbreak, there were no specific guidelines for perioperative management<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Therefore, we used a conservative approach based on our experience and previous reports. First, although the previous guidelines recommended that asymptomatic MERS-exposed patients be managed as general patients undergoing surgery, we applied standard PPE to HCWs and we performed MERS-CoV PCR screening twice. Although MERS progressed gradually after symptom onset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, we could not exclude the possibility that asymptomatic MERS-exposed patients had the potential to develop symptomatic disease perioperatively. Moreover, we observed development of MERS after the known incubation period of 14 days in an immunocompromised host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>; thus, the possibility of exceptional cases could be considered. Furthermore, a certain proportion of asymptomatic MERS-exposed patients could actually be asymptomatic MERS-infected patients. Approximately 21% of laboratory confirmed MERS patients have been classified as asymptomatic or having nonspecific mild symptoms at the time of testing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The potential for transmission from asymptomatic MERS-CoV PCR-positive person is currently unknown, but there are reports about prolonged viral RNA detection in the upper respiratory tract in asymptomatic PCR-positive person<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Considering these points, it would be reasonable to prepare more conservatively than the existing guidelines call for.</p><p id="Par21">Another point on which our preparations differed from the guidelines was the application of enhanced PPE, which emphasizes full protection of the body surface with a hooded coverall. During the outbreak in our hospital, MERS transmission events occurred among HCWs who were equipped with standard PPE, including N95 masks. Transmission may have occurred after possible contamination of uncovered head or face surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Therefore, if a patient with a MERS contact history had MERS-associated symptoms, applying enhanced PPE (either a N95 respirator or PAPR) during surgery would be appropriate for HCWs because numerous droplets and aerosols may be produced during airway interventions. Because the N95 may fit inadequately if worn for a long time or after movement during surgery, wearing PAPR will be more beneficial. However, unlike HCWs dealing with Ebola virus, impermeable and fluid-resistant gowns are not required because body fluids are not infectious as with Ebola virus diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par22">Our experience was limited in that, as a MERS outbreak outside the endemic country, we did not have an opportunity to perform surgical procedures in actively virus-shedding MERS-infected patients. Additionally, our infection-prevention protocols would be too conservative to apply in MERS-endemic situations. However, considering the potential risk of infected HCWs, preventing MERS transmission is extremely important in the management of a MERS outbreak. Importantly, our experience can be generalized to other non-endemic countries for managing potential outbreaks of emerging respiratory diseases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par23">In the era of globalization, a MERS outbreak can occur in any country outside the Middle East. A very limited number of hospitals are equipped with negative-pressure operating rooms, and therefore, most hospitals are likely to experience a MERS or other outbreak in an unprepared circumstance. We hope that this report will help other hospitals in preparing for future MERS outbreaks and infection control in unexpected conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par24">This study was based on all available data at the Samsung Medical Center from the MERS outbreak and on interviews with HCWs associated with the outbreak. The study was approved by Samsung Medical Center Institutional Review Board. The documents for review included electronic medical records of MERS-related patients who underwent operative procedures and institutional guidelines for perioperative management of MERS-related surgical patients. The MERS guidelines were prepared through multidisciplinary team discussions that were held by our hospital&#x02019;s infection control department during and after the MERS outbreak. The records about the temporary set-up of a negative-pressure operating room were also reviewed. We also collected data through interviews with HCWs who participated in surgery and anesthesia for MERS-related patients.</p><p id="Par25">We defined MERS-related patients as those who were possibly or directly exposed to MERS or who had a previously confirmed MERS diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In brief, patients who had a potential but unconfirmed close contact history with a MERS patient were defined as possibly exposed patients, and they were allowed to continue their normal activities until MERS-like symptoms developed. Directly exposed patients included those who had close contact with a known MERS patient and who did not wear proper PPE; these patients were isolated in their homes or in private negative-pressure rooms at our hospital.</p><p id="Par26">Because the number of MERS-infected patients continuously increased at our hospital, we partially closed the hospital on June 13<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, at which point outpatient-care clinics were closed and the emergency department was only available for life-threatening emergencies. All elective surgeries were postponed if possible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. We defined the early phase of the outbreak (before June 13) as phase 1 and the middle phase of the outbreak (from June 13) as phase 2.</p><p id="Par27">For MERS-CoV PCR tests, either sputum or nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected and sputum samples were preferred if available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Sputum was collected directly into a sterile, leak-proof, screw-capped sputum collection sterile container and nasopharyngeal swab was collected with an eSwab (482&#x02009;C, Copan Diagnostics Inc., Murrieta, CA, USA). Clinical samples were screened by rRT-PCR testing with amplification targeting the upstream E region (upE) and confirmed by subsequent amplification of the open reading frame (ORF)1a using PowerChek&#x02122; MERS real-time PCR kits (Kogene Biotech, Seoul, Korea). All rRT-PCR reactions were performed using the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The PCR reaction was performed in a total volume of 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;L (15&#x02009;&#x003bc;L PCR reaction mixture and 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;L template RNA). Thermocycling conditions included a step at 50&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 30&#x02009;min, followed by 95&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x02009;min and then 40 cycles of 15&#x02009;s at 95&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 60&#x02009;s at 60&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Positive viral template control and no-template control were included in each run. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene was amplified simultaneously as a heterologous internal control to monitor PCR inhibition. A positive test result was defined as a well-defined exponential fluorescence curve that crossed the cycle threshold (Ct)&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;35 cycles for both upE and ORF1a. A sample was considered &#x0201c;equivocal&#x0201d; if the upE result was positive but the Ct value for ORF1a was &#x0003e;35 and &#x0003c;40. We interpreted the result as &#x0201c;indeterminate&#x0201d; if (1) the upE result was positive but the Ct value for ORF1a was undetected or if (2) the Ct value for upE was &#x0003e;35 and &#x0003c;40.</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Institutional review board statement</title><p id="Par28">The study was performed in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki and experimental protocols were revised and approved by IRB at Samsung Medical Center.
