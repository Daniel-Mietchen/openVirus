It becomes imperative to assess the compliance of DR-TB centres to national airborne infection control (AIC) guidelines and explore the provider perspectives into reasons for unsatisfactory compliance.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This mixed methods study (triangulation design) was carried out across all the six DR-TB centers of Karnataka state, India, between November 2016 and April 2017. Non-participant observation using a structured format was carried out at the DR-TB wards (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6), outpatient departments (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6), patient waiting areas outside outpatient departments (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6) and culture and drug susceptibility testing laboratories (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3). Structured interviews of admitted patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;30) were done to assess the knowledge on cough hygiene and sputum disposal. Key informant interviews (KIIs) of health care providers (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;20) were done. Manual descriptive content analysis was done to analyse the transcripts of KIIs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The findings related to compliance in non-participant observation were corroborated by KIIs. All the laboratories were consistently implementing the AIC guidelines. Compliance to hand hygiene, wet mopping and ventilation measures were satisfactory in four or more DR-TB wards. The non-availability of N95 masks in wards as well as outpatient departments was staggering. Sputum disposal without prior disinfection and the lack of display materials on cough hygiene and patient education was common. Patient fast tracking in outpatient department waiting areas and visitor restrictions in wards were lacking. Trainings on AIC measures were uncommon. About half and one-third of patients admitted had satisfactory knowledge regarding sputum disposal and situations demanding mask respectively. The reasons for unsatisfactory compliance to AIC guidelines were poor coordination between programme and hospital authorities leading to lack of ownership; ineffective or non-existent infection control committees; vacant posts of medical officers; and attitudes of health care delivery staff.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Compliance with AIC guidelines in DR-TB centers of Karnataka was sub-optimal. The reasons identified require urgent attention of the programme managers and hospital authorities.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s13756-017-0270-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Infection control</kwd><kwd>Drug-resistant tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>MDR tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>Hospital infections</kwd><kwd>SORT IT</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Department for International Development (DFID), UK and La Fondation Veuve Emile Metz-Tesch (Luxembourg)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par14">Despite Tuberculosis (TB) being a curable disease through the use of standardized drugs, the increasing resistance to these drugs in the form of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), defined as resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin or rifampicin only, is a growing public health problem across the globe. India has the highest burden of MDR-TB patients in the world. An estimated 130,000 MDR-TB patients occur annually in India which includes 79,000 estimated among notified pulmonary cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. India follows programmatic management of drug resistant TB (PMDT) guidelines within the revised national TB control programme (RNTCP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These services have expanded across all the states and union territories of India covering the whole population by 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Under PMDT, patients with MDR-TB are treated primarily on domiciliary basis after a brief period of in-patient care during treatment initiation in Drug Resistant TB (DR-TB) centers (one for every 10 million population). These are located within the premises of a medical college hospital or a tertiary public health facility (catering to patients other than MDR-TB as well), under the auspices of departments of pulmonary medicine or internal medicine (if the former does not exist). Each DR-TB centre has a separate ward for male and female patients, PMDT services [culture and drug susceptibility testing (CDST) and ancillary drugs for management of adverse drug reactions] and availability of relevant specialties or linkages for these services established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Currently there is a network of 143 DR-TB centres across the country which are supported by 54 linked DR-TB centres (decentralized clinical unit under a DR-TB centre which provides treatment services but reporting lies with the parent DR-TB centre) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">In India, the treatment approach for patients with DR-TB concentrates the drug resistant patients under one roof during the initiation of treatment and also during the management of complications. Patients with MDR-TB in these settings pose a potential source of infection to the health care providers and other patients in these facilities who may be immune-compromised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The transmission of the infection can be reduced by implementing effective airborne infection control measures in these settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">The national airborne infection control (AIC) guidelines were drafted in 2010 which proposed standards for AIC across various health facilities including high risk settings like MDR-TB wards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A study assessing the implementation of these guidelines which was carried out across 35 healthcare facilities (these included four MDR-TB wards) in three states of India revealed that AIC practices were poorly implemented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. After rapid expansion of the PMDT services in the country there is scarce information on implementation of these guidelines at DR-TB centres and the barriers faced by the health care providers in complying with these guidelines.</p><p id="Par18">Hence, a study was conducted to assess the compliance of DR-TB centres to National AIC guidelines (2010) and explore the provider perspectives related to the barriers encountered for implementation in the state of Karnataka, India (2016-17).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par19">It was a cross-sectional study involving a mixed-methods approach (triangulation design) where compliance to the implementation of AIC guidelines were assessed through non-participant observation of DR-TB centers, structured interviews of admitted patients and key informant interviews (KIIs) of health care providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study setting</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>General setting</title><p id="Par20">Karnataka is the eighth largest state of India in terms of both area and population and is situated on the western edge of the Deccan plateau.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par36">This study is one of the few studies conducted in India to determine the implementation status of national AIC guidelines at DR-TB centres. The level of compliance with AIC guidelines among the DR-TB centers was sub-optimal when compared to the laid down guidelines (except for the CDST laboratories) at DR-TB wards, OPDs and patient waiting areas. As beneficiaries of the public health programme, there was scope for improving the existing patient knowledge with regard to cough hygiene. The findings related to compliance by non-participant observation were corroborated by KIIs. The recurring theme that emerged was a lack of investment and ownership as well as poor coordination between the national programme (RNTCP) and general health care system in the state as the main reason for unsatisfactory compliance.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par37">Operational research is essential to develop evidence-based policies to improve TB IC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This is the first comprehensive study on the state-wide assessment of the AIC measures in the DR-TB centers in India. This assessment is not routinely done within the programmatic context; therefore it can serve as a baseline study for future research. There was a convergent validity between the findings of the quantitative and qualitative components. This makes our findings robust.</p><p id="Par38">There were some limitations of the study. First, we were not able to get an insight into the pragmatic solutions to address the reasons for unsatisfactory compliance. The staffs were not forthcoming with solutions. It could be because the nursing and housekeeping staffs were not informed a priori about the purpose of the visit. Second, an objective assessment of ventilation using appropriate tools for air flow and air velocity was not carried as we did not have the required scientific and allied resources.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Interpretation of key findings</title><p id="Par39">A key finding in this study is that discrepancies between guidelines, standards and programme implementation with respect to operating processes and procedures can be traced to ambiguities at higher levels owing to a short-term approach to institutional funding and design. These ambiguities percolate down through budgeting, hiring and contracting procedures. These asymmetries are palpable at multiple levels. At the scientific level, the variation of attitudes among doctors and nursing staff is one such asymmetry. At the level of human resource and staffing, short-term contracts compounded by low pay and lacking incentives to retain staff is another asymmetry. At the level of sensitizing staff, the lack of orientation sessions and on-going trainings is another. Finally, at the level of basic consumables, the lack of translating guidelines into budget-supported resources is yet another.</p><p id="Par40">The N95 mask is one of the most important preventive measures for frontline health workers working in a high risk setting and is expected to reduce or even break the transmission cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Unfortunately, the non-availability of N95 masks in wards as well as OPDs was staggering. They were not available as a rule and if available, they were not provided to the nursing or housekeeping staff. The consistent non-availability of N95 masks was also pointed out in another study from South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">On the side of patients, they were encouraged to dispose sputum either in the sink or the toilet without prior disinfection, posing a risk for transmission of MDR-TB, as observed in our study. At a pan-centre level, the lack of display materials on cough hygiene and patient education were not found in the wards and OPD waiting areas in most of the centers. These display boards act as reinforcement for health promoting behaviour and are a low-cost, high-impact way of educating multiple stakeholders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">Patient fast tracking in OPD waiting areas and visitor restrictions are other obvious measures which minimise the exposure of susceptible people to MDR-TB. These practices were not implemented in our setting. This is a major finding. It almost destroys the purpose of having a separate DR-TB ward. Finally, no policy or guideline can be successful without inviting the intelligent investments of key implementing stakeholders: the participants in our study reported that they have not undergone any training on AIC measures. Considering the frequent shifting of the nurses (which is a policy of the hospitals) and attrition among housekeeping staff; this is a vital point that needs to be addressed. Similar findings were reported in other studies from developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">These gaps in AIC were contrary to one of the studies from South Africa where all the facilities assessed were found to have displayed signage to educate patients and health care workers on cough hygiene. N95 mask was uniformly available for use among the health care workers but they were not used. However, the ward visits by the visitors were a common practice similar to that in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">There were two main reasons for unsatisfactory compliance. First, there was poor coordination between RNTCP and general health care system (hospital authorities) leading to lack of ownership among the administrators, nodal officers and medical officers. After the one time grant by RNTCP to implement AIC guidelines in DR-TB centers, roles and responsibilities have been clearly demarcated across human resources. Though, it is clear from the national guidelines that the hospital authorities have to run the DR-TB center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], there was lack of clarity regarding the onus of responsibility for financial resources, for acquiring the consumables such as N95 masks and phenol for sputum disinfection among others. The hospital authorities/ doctors did not consider it as their primary responsibility resulting in gaps in AIC. Vacant posts of medical officer (in four out of six DR-TB centers) could further contribute to this lack of ownership and also might be a deterrent for the on job training of the nursing and housekeeping staff in AIC measures. This is particularly important as the nodal officer is a specialist who also holds additional clinical and faculty positions and may not have the time for day to day on the job training and supervision of nursing and housekeeping staff.</p><p id="Par45">Second, the IC committees were either non-existent or non-functional. Similar findings were observed in studies from India, South Africa and Pakistan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, another South African study reported that about 80% of the DR-TB centers assessed had IC committees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Hospital IC committees are expected to perform risk assessment, prepare facility infection control plan incorporating the AIC component as well. IC committees need to have a realistic budget for carrying out and ensuring implementation of IC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These activities including training of health staff were probably not being carried out resulting in gaps in AIC implementation. The use of simple videos in the local language can easily be rolled out to sensitize staff to how preventive measures are within reach. However, this is the responsibility of IC committees.</p><p id="Par46">Based on the codes generated in our analysis (Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) and the above interpretations, a visual framework of the reasons leading to gaps in implementation (unsatisfactory compliance) of AIC guidelines is depicted in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Visual framework of the barriers leading to gaps in implementation of AIC guidelines in DR-TB centers in Karnataka state, India (2016-17).

</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Recommendations for policy and practice</title><p id="Par47">Based on our study findings, the following recommendations can be drawn. First, the administrators of the hospitals need to reinvigorate the existing infection control committees so that they perform their duties as per the suggested guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The programme needs to routinely incorporate the review of IC meetings held and AIC measures undertaken at DR-TB centers during the quarterly and national review meetings. Second, hospital authorities need to take the ownership of AIC in DR-TB centers and make budgetary allocations towards display of patient education on cough hygiene in prominent locations in the local languages and consumables like N95 masks, sputum cups and phenol for sputum disinfection. Third, standard operating procedures related to AIC for doctors, nurses as well as housekeeping staff should be displayed near their workstations in the local language. Fourth, vacant posts of Medical officers need to be filled up at the earliest by RNCTP and financial mechanisms need to be evolved to increase retention of the medical officers. Further research in deployment of newer technologies and equipments to measure and maintain airflow in the wards has to be prioritized.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par48">Compliance with AIC guidelines in the DR-TB centers of the state of Karnataka, India has a scope for improvement. The reasons for unsatisfactory compliance require urgent attention of the programme managers and hospital authorities, especially the latter, as the DR-TB centers are administratively under them. The gravity of MDR-TB (and the low cure rate of around 54% with the existing drug regimens) underlines the significance of taking long-sighted measures for a potentially dangerous disease that can be controlled with some investment of capital, administrative and scientific resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par55">
