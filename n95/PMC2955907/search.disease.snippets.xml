  <result pre="[ 2– 5]. Accordingly, measures should be taken to limit" exact="influenza" post="virus contamination of the environment to prevent cross-infection among"/>

  <result pre="The aim of this study was to determine both whether" exact="influenza" post="viruses maintain infectivity and survive on the surfaces of"/>

  <result pre="experiments designed to assess the duration of the infectivity of" exact="influenza" post="A viruses on the surfaces of personal protective equipment"/>
  <result pre="baseline data to monitor the changes over time. Aliquots of" exact="influenza" post="A/PR/8/34(H1N1) were deposited and remained on the surface of"/>
  <result pre="MDCK cells in the wells to cause CPE. Since the" exact="influenza" post="virus is able to infect MDCK cells, the appearance"/>

  <result pre="replacement of protective equipment may be responsible for cross-infection of" exact="influenza" post="virus and, therefore, that a frequent replacement of personal"/>
