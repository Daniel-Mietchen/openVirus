We mapped and characterised these high-prevalence areas for young adults (15&#x02013;29 years of age), as a proxy for areas with high levels of transmission, for 7 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa: Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and findings</title><p>We used geolocated survey data from the most recent United States Agency for International Development (USAID) demographic and health surveys (DHSs) and AIDS indicator surveys (AISs) (collected between 2008&#x02013;2009 and 2015&#x02013;2016), which included about 113,000 adults&#x02014;of which there were about 53,000 young adults (27,000 women, 28,000 men)&#x02014;from over 3,500 sample locations. First, ordinary kriging was applied to predict HIV prevalence at unmeasured locations. Second, we explored to what extent behavioural, socioeconomic, and environmental factors explain HIV prevalence at the individual- and sample-location level, by developing a series of multilevel multivariable logistic regression models and geospatially visualising unexplained model heterogeneity. National-level HIV prevalence for young adults ranged from 2.2% in Tanzania to 7.7% in Mozambique. However, at the subnational level, we found areas with prevalence among young adults as high as 11% or 15% alternating with areas with prevalence between 0% and 2%, suggesting the existence of areas with high levels of transmission Overall, 15.6% of heterogeneity could be explained by an interplay of known behavioural, socioeconomic, and environmental factors. Maps of the interpolated random effect estimates show that environmental variables, representing indicators of economic activity, were most powerful in explaining high-prevalence areas. Main study limitations were the inability to infer causality due to the cross-sectional nature of the surveys and the likely under-sampling of key populations in the surveys.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We found that, among young adults, micro-epidemics of relatively high HIV prevalence alternate with areas of very low prevalence, clearly illustrating the existence of areas with high levels of transmission. These areas are partially characterised by high economic activity, relatively high socioeconomic status, and risky sexual behaviour. Localised HIV prevention interventions specifically tailored to the populations at risk will be essential to curb transmission. More fine-scale geospatial mapping of key populations,&#x02014;such as sex workers and migrant populations&#x02014;could help us further understand the drivers of these areas with high levels of transmission and help us determine how they fuel the generalised epidemics in SSA.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Jan Hontelez and colleagues study the spatial distribution of HIV infections among young adults in 7 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Why was this study done?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Previous studies showed that heterogeneity in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence exists among the general population in Eastern and Southern Africa, the geographic area most severely affected by the HIV pandemic.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Whereas HIV prevalence among adults does not reveal when persons have been infected, young adults are most likely recently infected, and therefore high-prevalence areas among this subpopulation can proxy locations of ongoing transmission.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The location and underlying determinants of high HIV prevalence areas among young adults can help to shape spatially targeted and risk-group&#x02013;tailored interventions to reduce transmission.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>What did the researchers do and find?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>We found clear areas of high prevalence in young adults in between vast regions with relatively low prevalence for all 7 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa.</p></list-item><list-item><p>HIV prevalence in young adults was partly explained by an interplay of behavioural, socioeconomic, and environmental (i.e., economic activity) factors, and environmental factors were especially predictive of high transmission locations.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>What do these finding mean?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Our findings, together with the existing evidence, indicate that key population dynamics, especially related to seasonal and economic migration and associated sex work, might play a major role in fuelling HIV transmission.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In further reducing HIV transmission in Eastern and Southern Africa, areas of high HIV prevalence in young adults should be priority areas for tailored HIV prevention interventions towards reaching the fast-track commitments to end the HIV epidemic by 2030.</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by the Dutch AIDS Foundation (P-29702).

The AISs and many DHSs include voluntary HIV testing in adults. Approximately 350 sample locations (primary sampling units) are randomly sampled throughout the country of interest, and at each location residents of about 25 households are sampled. All individuals that were at home during one of the visits and were between 15 and 49 years of age (women) or 54 years of age (men) were eligible for the survey. GPS coordinates of sample locations are randomly displaced up to 2 km for urban and up to 5 km for rural sample locations, to ensure confidentiality of participants. Sample weights are incorporated in the DHS to translate unbalanced sampling into national representative data. In our study, we used these sample weights to estimate national HIV prevalence among adults and young adults for all 7 countries. For the other analyses, we combined data of multiple countries and explored local-level variances and thus did not use the sampling weights. More details on survey protocols and questionnaires can be found on the DHS website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dhsprogram.com/">https://dhsprogram.com/</ext-link>).</p><p>We extracted data from countries in Eastern and Southern African that had a DHS or an AIS conducted and for which behavioural data, geographical coordinates of the sample locations, and HIV biomarker surveys were available. In case of multiple eligible surveys for a country, we selected the most recent one.

The other variables were self-reported by participants via the survey questionnaires.</p><p>We used the following environmental variables at sample locations: urban versus rural classification of the cluster, population density, proximity to highways, proximity to cities with more than 250,000 inhabitants, proximity to border crossings and major ports, enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and global human footprint (GHF). EVI reflects the vegetation in an area, in which low values represent areas with no or little green vegetation (e.g., urban areas) and high values represent areas where vegetation is more abundant (e.g., agricultural land, forests, grassland), and can be used as a proxy for degree of urbanization [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. GHF represents the relative human influence and economic activity, incorporating 9 layers covering infrastructure, land use, population density, and access (coastlines, roads, railroads, navigable rivers). Areas of large human influence and high levels of economic activity are characterised by high GHF values. Population density estimates were originally obtained from WorldPop (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.worldpop.org/">https://www.worldpop.org/</ext-link>), and data from 2010&#x02014;the most recent year&#x02014;were utilised. EVI and GHF were available from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Observatory Group (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/">http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/</ext-link>). EVI data were available for 2010, and GHF data were available for 2005. Because DHS sample locations are, to some extent, randomly displaced, population density, EVI, and GHF at each un-displaced DHS sample location are also made available for each survey. Locations of major cities were extracted from the World Population Review website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldpopulationreview.com/worldcities/">www.worldpopulationreview.com/worldcities/</ext-link>), and highways were derived from GADM national infrastructure shape files (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gadm.org/">http://www.gadm.org/</ext-link>) based on Google Maps.

First, we determined the spatial distribution in HIV prevalence among adults and young adults by interpolating logit-transformed DHS sample location-level HIV prevalence data using ordinary kriging [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Kriging is an interpolation method based on the spatial autocorrelation of variables [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Spatial autocorrelation was measured by means of Moran&#x02019;s <italic>I</italic>, using the inverse distance between sample locations as weights. Spatial autocorrelation structures were obtained through semivariogram modelling, in which the average squared difference in HIV prevalence between each pair of data points (on the y-axis) is plotted against the corresponding distance between the point-pairs (on the x-axis). The overall relation between HIV prevalence and distance was estimated by fitting an exponential curve through these points. We used this to create continuous surface maps of HIV prevalence, in which the HIV prevalence at each 5 km<sup>2</sup> grid cell was estimated using the aforementioned method. The equations and model estimates are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003042.s002">S1 Equations</xref>. To enhance the power of our study, we decided to not stratify the kriging by sex in the main analysis. However, we also present sex-specific maps of kriged HIV prevalence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003042.s011">S9 Fig</xref>). We compared the sex-specific surfaces of HIV prevalence by means of mapping the square root of the squared difference in HIV prevalence (per 5 km<sup>2</sup> grid cell), to illustrate the absolute differences in HIV prevalence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003042.s012">S10 Fig</xref> panel A), and by plotting the predicted HIV prevalence (per 5 km<sup>2</sup> grid cell) of women against the predicted HIV prevalence of men (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003042.s012">S10 Fig</xref> panel C). Both comparisons show that there are only minor differences in terms of the locations of high HIV prevalence for both sexes.</p><p>Second, we developed a series of multiple multilevel logistic regression models to determine to what extent behavioural, socioeconomic, and environmental determinants of HIV can explain individual- and location-level HIV prevalence among young adults. Missing values (up to 2.6%) were checked to be missing at random and, if so, imputed using multiple imputation. First, bivariate associations were tested, and all variables with a <italic>p</italic>-value larger than 0.1 were excluded. We then developed multiple models using a stepwise approach. In the first step, we made an &#x02018;empty&#x02019; model&#x02014;with HIV prevalence as the dependent variable, with only age- and sex-fixed effects, and with location random effects as predictors. In the second step, we used stepwise forward selection to construct 3 separate multiple regression models for behavioural, socioeconomic, and environmental factors, respectively, out of the nested model. Likelihood tests were used to determine whether the addition of a variable improved the statistical fit of the regression models significantly (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). In the third step, we used the same stepwise forward selection to construct a full model containing both behavioural, socioeconomic, and environmental factors. We did not adjust for country-level confounding in the main analysis because we expect the associations between HIV and the predictor variables to be similar across countries. However, we did perform a sensitivity analysis in which we added country-fixed effects to the final model. We compared the marginal and conditional <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of the models at each step. The marginal <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> indicates how much of the HIV heterogeneity is explained by the fixed factors in the model. The conditional <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> represents the amount of heterogeneity explained by both fixed and random factors in the model. By comparing both <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values, we assessed how much of HIV heterogeneity is explained by the fixed factors in the models and how much is additionally captured by the location-level random effect in each model [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We translated variance of random effects into Median Odds Ratios (MORs) as an indicator of geographical heterogeneity. For each model, the MOR would be equal to 1.0 if there were no differences in probability of being HIV infected per sample location, and it can be interpreted as the increase in (median) HIV risk that is associated with moving from a location with a low random effect to a location with a high random effect. See elsewhere for a more detailed explanation [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The MOR equation is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003042.s002">S1 Equations</xref>. The final model is also fitted as modified Poisson (with robust variance) for easier interpretation of the estimates, here as relative risks (RRs) instead of odds ratios (ORs).</p><p>Third, we extracted and compared the location-specific random effect estimates from the empty model, the 3 separate models for behavioural, socioeconomic, and environmental factors, as well as the &#x02018;full&#x02019; regression model. We kriged random effect estimates from the 5 models to visualise to what extent the variables in the different models explain the geospatial HIV heterogeneity and areas with a high HIV prevalence.</p><p>Next to the main analyses, we also performed an internal validation of our regression models and an external validation of our kriging results. The internal validation was done using nonrandom cross-validation [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] to check, for each country individually, how much heterogeneity (indicated by the conditional <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) was explained by the final regression model. For the external validation, we searched peer-reviewed literature reporting on age-stratified HIV prevalence estimates in population-based cohorts, such as those part of the ALPHA network [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], situated in one of the countries of our study.

Educational level, wealth index, and occupation were variables associated with HIV in the final socioeconomic model. The highest level of education was most protective (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.52 [0.26&#x02013;0.78], <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), whereas being from asset quintile 4&#x02014;the second wealthiest quintile&#x02014;was associated with the highest risk of HIV (aOR 1.46 [1.31&#x02013;1.62], <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Several variables were significantly associated with HIV in the environmental model. Young adults living in rural sample locations were less likely to be infected with HIV than those with urban residence: in cities, the overall HIV prevalence among adults was over 7%, compared to below 4% in rural settings. Also, population density, proximity to nearest major city, EVI, and GHF at location of a DHS cluster showed a significant association with HIV. HIV prevalence levels were highest (about 6%) in areas with the highest population density (more than 500 people per km<sup>2</sup>) but was also relatively high (about 5%) in areas with the lowest population density (less than 25 people per km<sup>2</sup>). HIV prevalence levels did not differ considerably between sample locations with different levels of greenness (indicated by the EVI). Living in an area with a relatively high GHF, as a proxy for economic activity, was associated with a high HIV risk (aOR 1.68 [1.41&#x02013;1.94], <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001): HIV prevalence levels for the highest two levels of GHF were almost 7%, compared to around 4% at the lower levels.

Finally, the combined &#x02018;full&#x02019; model was also fitted as a modified Poisson regression model, resulting in adjusted relative risks that were comparable to the aORs from the logistic regression model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003042.s025">S9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003042.s026">S10</xref> Tables).</p><p>The results in <xref rid="pmed.1003042.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> show that 7.2% (marginal <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>: e.g., percentage of heterogeneity explained by fixed effects in the model) of the 26.3% (conditional <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>: e.g., percentage of heterogeneity explained by both fixed and random effects in the model) of the HIV heterogeneity could be explained by age and sex alone (&#x02018;nested&#x02019; model). The remaining variance captured by the model (19.1%) is attributed to location-level random effects. Environmental fixed effects explain most of the heterogeneity in HIV prevalence among young adults (marginal <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> 11.4%, conditional <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> 26.8%), higher than behavioural (marginal <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> 10.2%, conditional <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> 27.8%) or socioeconomic (marginal <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> 8.6%, conditional <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> 25.8%) fixed effects. According to the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of the combined &#x02018;full&#x02019; best-fitting model, HIV heterogeneity could be best explained (marginal <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> 15.6%, conditional <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> 29.6%) by an interplay of sexual behavioural, socioeconomic, and environmental variables. The MOR of the nested model is 2.41, whereas the MOR of the final model is 1.94. This illustrates that, although some of the location-level heterogeneity is captured by the model fixed-effect covariates, almost two-thirds of the heterogeneity in HIV prevalence at sample locations still could not be explained by the covariates in the model. Overall, environmental fixed effects reduce the location-level heterogeneity more than sexual behavioural and socioeconomic fixed effects (MORs of 1.95, 2.35, and 2.30, respectively). Adjusting for country improves the model fit but does not change the importance of the different predictors and does not considerably increase the degree of explained heterogeneity (marginal <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> 17.9%, conditional <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> 29.3%) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003042.s026">S10 Table</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pmed.1003042.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pmed.1003042.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Overview of the heterogeneity (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) explained by the best-fitting multilevel multiple logistic regression models and random-effects MOR.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pmed.1003042.t001g" xlink:href="pmed.1003042.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conditional <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>: total heterogeneity explained by model (%)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Marginal <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>: heterogeneity explained by included fixed effects (%)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Random-effect <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>: location-level heterogeneity captured by model (%)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MOR</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Nested &#x02018;empty&#x02019; model</bold></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.41</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Sexual behavioural model</bold></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.35</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Socioeconomic model</bold></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.30</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Environmental model</bold></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.95</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Combined &#x02018;full&#x02019; model</bold></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.94</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t001fn001"><p><bold>Abbreviation:</bold> MOR, Median Odds Ratio</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The maps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003042.g003">Fig 3</xref> show the interpolated random effects estimates&#x02014;i.e., the unexplained heterogeneity in HIV prevalence&#x02014;for the 5 models.

We found that most estimates are comparable, but our estimates were lower for the Rakai (Uganda) and Manicaland (Zimbabwe) areas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003042.s016">S14 Fig</xref>). Both areas are characterised by well-known high levels of HIV transmission and relatively low numbers of sample locations in the utilised data with varying prevalence levels, leading to underestimation of the HIV prevalence. This indicates that our approach of kriging, in which prevalence at a specific location is estimated by the prevalence in surrounding clusters as a function of the distance between the location and surrounding clusters, may have resulted in an underestimation (i.e. smoothing) of HIV prevalence estimates, especially in high-prevalence areas.</p><p>Our findings that environmental factors were the most important determinants of geospatial heterogeneity is strengthened by the observation that all high HIV prevalence areas among young adults are in locations with known high levels of economic activity: characterised by high production and flow of goods and services [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This suggests that high-risk dynamics (involving seasonal work and commercial sex) in these areas might be important in generating this heterogeneity [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For instance, the fishing communities around Lake Victoria in Uganda (circle 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003042.g003">Fig 3</xref>) have frequently been reported as sites with high levels of transactional sex and HIV [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Furthermore, many high-prevalence areas in our analyses cluster around border crossings, major highways or major ports (e.g. circles 2 to 5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003042.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Long distance truck driving and associated commercial sex have been documented as important contributors to HIV transmission [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In addition, some of the high-prevalence areas are in regions known to have high levels of migration, either work-related (seasonal) migration or other types of migration. For example, the Copperbelt mining area (circle 7 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003042.g003">Fig 3</xref>) or Nchelenge district in Zambia (circle 8 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003042.g003">Fig 3</xref>) in Zambia, which is known for its active fishing industry and a big refugee settlement. Mining and fishing areas have long been recognised as high risk settings for HIV transmission, as domestic or foreign male workers often work long stints, separated from their families surrounded by an active sex industry [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Individual HIV prevalence in young adults was strongly associated with the reported number of lifetime sex partners and reported prevalence of STIs or STI symptoms, providing further evidence that geospatial clustering of HIV is linked to the clustering of risk behaviour, across all countries [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We found that the reported condom use at last sex act was associated with an increased risk of being infected with HIV. This is a well-known counterintuitive finding, and reflects the fact that condom use tends to be higher (yet sometimes insufficient) among people with riskier sexual behaviour, or reflects bias due to the fact that people who are aware of their positive HIV status are more likely to use a condom, to protect their partner [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This finding highlights the need to stimulate condom use, but more importantly increase access to effective HIV prevention interventions more broadly. Our finding that having education beyond the primary level seems to be strongly protective against HIV, is consistent with observations in the literature [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and suggests that structural interventions to improve educational attainment [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] could help reduce HIV transmission in adolescent women.</p><p>Our results have important implications for the planning of prevention and treatment programs. High HIV prevalence areas in young adults are likely areas of high transmission [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], requiring prioritization of tailored prevention interventions. Our key findings that (i) high HIV prevalence areas among young adults are located at economically active or developing areas and (ii) that HIV among young adults is driven by risky sexual behaviour; indicate that preventive interventions targeted at young adults at these specific locations could strongly impact HIV transmission. Prevention programs aimed at improving exposure and uptake of effective prevention interventions for young adults [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]&#x02013;such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], condoms [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], or voluntary male medical circumcision programmes [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]&#x02013;should be prioritized in these areas. Also, intervention programs for young adults should aim at early diagnosis and treatment initiation of those who get infected with HIV, by creating accessible, affordable and youth-friendly HIV testing and counselling services [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Furthermore, governments typically have prior knowledge about future economic developments. Improving the resilience of affected populations against the associated health risks, might be considered an integral part of such development. Moreover, as the population in these areas is likely to be highly mobile [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], effective prevention for young adults in high-prevalence areas may not only affect the local HIV epidemics, but also the wider epidemic. Ultimately, our results demonstrate that the decade-old mantra of &#x0201c;know your epidemic, know your response&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] is still highly relevant for SSA. Our study found important common denominators that are associated with increased HIV risk in areas with high levels of transmission, but it will be essential for policy makers to specifically evaluate the behavioural and socioeconomic context, and the interventions already in place at a specific high-risk setting to tailor interventions appropriately.</p><p>To our knowledge, we are the first to utilise geolocated HIV prevalence data from young adults specifically, to explore geospatial heterogeneity in the HIV epidemics of Eastern and Southern Africa, and identify potential areas with high levels of transmission. Previously, Cuadros <italic>et al</italic> proposed a co-kriging approach to estimate subnational HIV prevalence estimates, incorporating HIV prevalence and environmental determinants [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], yet they did not stratify by age. In addition, Palk and Blower recently showed that places of high HIV prevalence in adults (aged 15&#x02013;49 years) in Malawi are associated with reported higher rates of high-risk sex, defined as the number of lifetime partners [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Our results show that heterogeneity in HIV is associated with a range of sexual behavioural, socioeconomic and environmental variables, and that these are highly affected by age. Therefore, a standardised approach to map heterogeneity of an HIV epidemic should take age stratifications into account, and future studies on geospatial heterogeneity and its drivers should include behavioural, socioeconomic and environmental determinants.</p><p>Our results have limitations. First, DHSs produce cross-sectional data intended to provide a measure of HIV prevalence and behaviour among the general population; and thus, high-risk subpopulations such as female sex workers, men who have sex with men, and mobile populations such as truck drivers and seasonal workers, are thought to be underrepresented in these surveys. Therefore, we cannot make definitive conclusions on economic activity and key populations driving HIV transmission in at these locations. Nevertheless, our analyses showed that high HIV prevalence areas in DHS data, especially among young adults, were almost invariably located near economically active areas suggesting that these key-population dynamics are still visible through general population-based surveys. Extending DHSs with other data sources that allow for mapping of key populations or performing incidence essays on HIV samples will allow for more accurate identification of HIV transmission areas and can further enhance our understanding of the epidemic. Second, DHS sampling locations are randomly selected, based on the underlying population density within a country. Consequently, very few locations were sampled from areas with large nature and wildlife conservation reserves, such as in Northern Kenya, Central Tanzania, and Northern and South-western Mozambique, and our interpolated prevalence estimates for such areas should be interpreted with caution. Designing alternative sampling techniques that over-sample areas with low densities could increase reliability of interpolated survey results. Third, we used survey data from a relatively wide range of years; 2008&#x02013;2009 to 2015&#x02013;2016. This time period in the study coincides with major initiatives to curb the pandemic, in particular the scale-up of antiretroviral treatment, as well as voluntary male circumcision campaigns and other HIV prevention interventions. Although these initiatives were potentially disproportionally targeted at high transmission areas, we expect that the disproportionate impact would not be so extreme that it completely alter the locations of high transmission areas. Furthermore, although the scale-up of these interventions may have reduced HIV incidence, the associations between HIV and the hypothesised main drivers of HIV transmission&#x02013;the (sexual) behavioural, socioeconomic and environmental factors explored in this study&#x02013;likely did not change substantially by these interventions. Fourth, explorative statistical analyses always run the risk of identifying patterns of random noise [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, we believe this risk to be extremely low in our study, due to the very large sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 53,234), the rigid preselection of variables based on substantive knowledge, and the directions and magnitudes of association between the included covariates and HIV found in our study are in line with of findings from previous studies [<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, we performed nonrandom cross-validation by testing the final fitted model for each country separately. Reassuringly we found that, despite the differences in underlying epidemic and scale-up of interventions across countries, the conditional R<sup>2</sup> of the model was strikingly similar for six out of the eight countries in our analysis, ranging between 23.5% and 36.0% (compared to 29.6% in the main analysis). Only the conditional R<sup>2</sup> for Kenya (45.0%) and Zimbabwe (17.6%) deviated a little bit more from the combined model, yet not to an alarming extend (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003042.s027">S11 Table</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we our findings show that consistent clustering of HIV prevalence exists among young adults in seven high burden countries in Eastern and Southern Africa, with clearly identifiable high-prevalence areas. This heterogeneity is driven by an interplay of behavioural, socioeconomic and environmental factors, and the locations of high-prevalence areas suggest that key population dynamics, especially related to seasonal and economic migration and associated sex work, play a major role. In further reducing HIV transmission in Eastern and Southern Africa, areas of high HIV prevalence in young adults could be priority areas for tailored HIV prevention interventions in line with SDG3 and UNAIDS targets to end the HIV pandemic by 2030.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec014"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1003042.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>The RECORD statement&#x02014;Checklist of items, extended from the STROBE statement, that should be reported in observational studies using routinely collected health data.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1003042.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1003042.s002"><label>S1 Equations</label><caption><title>Mathematical equations of our kriging model and MOR calculations.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1003042.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1003042.s003"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Overview of the study area in SSA (top right panel) and the DHS and AIS sample locations (blue dots) for the 7 countries included in this study: Kenya (<italic>n</italic> = 394), Malawi (<italic>n</italic> = 847)<sup>1</sup>, Mozambique (<italic>n</italic> = 270), Tanzania (<italic>n</italic> = 570)<sup>1</sup>, Uganda (<italic>n</italic> = 470)<sup>1</sup>, Zambia (<italic>n</italic> = 719), and Zimbabwe (<italic>n</italic> = 400).</title><p><sup>1</sup>AIS.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1003042.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1003042.s004"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Map presents whether the sample location is classified as urban or rural.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1003042.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1003042.s005"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Map presents the population density for the study area.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1003042.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1003042.s006"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>Map presents the proximity from each sample location to the nearest highway.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1003042.s006.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1003042.s007"><label>S5 Fig</label><caption><title>Map presents the proximity from each sample location to the nearest major city (more than 250,000 inhabitants).</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1003042.s007.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1003042.s008"><label>S6 Fig</label><caption><title>Map presents the proximity from each sample location to the nearest border crossing or major port.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1003042.s008.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1003042.s009"><label>S7 Fig</label><caption><title>Map presents the EVI for the study area.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1003042.s009.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1003042.s010"><label>S8 Fig</label><caption><title>Map presents the GHF for the study area.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1003042.s010.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1003042.s011"><label>S9 Fig</label><caption><p><bold>Maps present the predicted HIV prevalence in women (15&#x02013;49 years) (A) and men (15&#x02013;54 years) (B) for 7 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa.</bold> The maps of HIV prevalence among adults and young adults are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003042.g002">Fig 2</xref>.

For data residing with a third party, authors are required to provide instructions with contact information for obtaining the data. PLOS journals do not allow statements supported by "data not shown" or "unpublished results." For such statements, authors must provide supporting data or cite public sources that include it. </p><p>Please let me know if you have any questions. Otherwise, we look forward to receiving your revised manuscript in due course. </p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Richard Turner, PhD</p><p>Senior Editor, PLOS Medicine</p><p><email>rturner@plos.org</email></p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Requests from the editors:</p><p>Our academic editor commented that the term "hotspot" is not favoured by people with HIV, and we ask you to amend this. </p><p>Also, it was suggested that "the framing could be that by addressing areas of high incidence we are addressing inequities rather than focusing on areas perceived to be driving the epidemic".</p><p>In your abstract, please specify the range of years that the source datasets refer to. Also, please add summary demographic details for study participants. </p><p>Please add a new final sentence to the "methods and findings" subsection of your abstract to summarize the study's main limitations. </p><p>At line 40, please start the "Conclusions" subsection with "In this study, we found that ..." or similar. </p><p>After the abstract, we ask you to add a new and accessible "author summary" section in non-identical prose. You may find it helpful to consult one or two recent research papers published in PLOS Medicine to get a sense of the preferred style. </p><p>In your methods section, please briefly mention the situation with ethics approval (e.g., not required for this analysis). </p><p>Early in the methods section of your main text, please state whether the study had a protocol or prespecified analysis plan, and if so attach the relevant document(s) as a supplementary file (referred to in the methods). Please highlight analyses that were not prespecified. </p><p>Please add a completed checklist for the most appropriate reporting guideline, which may be RECORD, as a supplementary file (again referred to in your methods section. In the checklist, individual items should be referred to by section (e.g., "Methods") and paragraph number rather than by line or page numbers, as the latter generally change in the event of publication. </p><p>When discussing your conclusions, e.g. in the first paragraph of your Discussion section, please ensure that findings are referred to consistently in the past tense (e.g., "alternated" at line 268) with conclusions in the present tense (e.g., "Our findings show ..." at line 266). </p><p>Please avoid claims of primacy (e.g., at line 317), and where used add "to our knowledge" or similar. </p><p>Please remove "(80-)" from reference 17. </p><p>Comments from the reviewers:</p><p>*** Reviewer #1: </p><p>I confine my remarks to statistical aspects of this paper. I have a couple of fairly major issues to resolve before I can recommend publication, but I think there's a good paper here.</p><p>My first question is what was done to avoid finding patterns in pure noise? How can we be sure that these patterns are not just things found by the power of the method?</p><p>The second big thing is the model formation. The authors did bivariate screening followed by stepwise methods. Both of these are problematic. All of the output from such methods is wrong: Parameter estimates are biased away fro 0, p values are too small, standard errors are too small (see Harrell **Regression Modeling Strategies* for lots of details). It would be better to use substantive knowledge to build a model. If the authors insist on not using their knowledge and want an automatic method, the LASSO is probably the best of the readily available methods.</p><p>More minor points</p><p>The authors should list all the variables and how they were measured. Not just the ones that wound up in the model, but all the ones that were available</p><p>Line 139 "Multivariate" should be "multiple"</p><p>Line 144 Age and sex should be fixed effects</p><p>Line 153 and other places R^2 is mistyped as R2</p><p>Line 158 I don't understan how random effects were translated into MOR. First, random effects are usually nuisance variables that you are not particularly interested in. Second, the standard errors for random effects are very poorly estimated (so much that some programs don't even print them) so I think the authors mean fixed effects. Third, I don't know how the translation was done.</p><p>Figure 1 How were the outliers dealt with?</p><p>Peter Flom</p><p>*** Reviewer #2: </p><p>This work attempts to map 'hotspots' for young adults (proxy for higher transmission hotspots for targeting) in seven countries in Eastern and Southern Africa, specifically identify significant clustering and associated determinants potentially explaining the underlying heterogeneity observed. The work I believe makes a sufficient contribution/step forward to the existing body of literature in this area, is well written and should be useful for policy makers in these countries. I have some comments and suggestions below that need to be addressed before the paper can be accepted.</p><p>General: Identifying the hotspots is first natural step as currently presented in the paper. However the current detailed description of explained versus unexplained heterogeneity explained for the larger covariate groupings in the main results text is not in a policy maker friendly format and needs to be revised to maximise the readability/usability of these results. It would be more useful to present key findings highlighting which risk factors or covariates are the most attributable both within and across countries to assist with geographic/locally tailored intervention packages.</p><p>General: It is also important present the spatial hotspot/interpolation surface by gender in addition to overall (e.g. SDG 5: Gender equality) to confirm if the same hotspots are identified for both males and females. It may also be worth considering shared component analysis of the gender specific prevalence surfaces to see to which degree they correlate at finer geographic scale and how this varies within and across the countries.</p><p>General: Apologies if missed it but there is little or no contextualisation of the results with regards to SDG targets for HIV and how these results are relevant to assessing progress towards these targets and assisting with retailoring of intervention packages across the individual countries in this analysis.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The analysis utilised data from DHS/AIS surveys, however there is also a wealth of small geographic scale data in the demographic surveillance sites (DSS) in the region and ongoing HIV work in these sites e.g. ALPHA network. I was wondering if the authors considered using prevalence estimates from these DSS as an external validation source for the applied kriging exercise? i.e. does the model predict well at unsampled locations that potentially overlap with DSS.</p><p>2) Did the authors consider a Bayesian spatial approach/implementation in R-INLA as opposed to ordinary kriging? A spatial Bayesian multivariable formulation including the covariates might then be able to produce uncertaintiy around predictions at unsampled locations and more efficiently adjust for spatial correlation in nearby sampled clusters as per DHS design. I suspect that a Bayesian approach in INLA (which would be computationally tractable) would perform better than the approaches currently employed in the paper.</p><p>3) For the risk factor analysis/modelling I can understand not using the original sampling weights from the DHS/AIS. However when estimating prevalence and generating a smoothed prevalence surface I would suspect that these weights be more important and allow uncertainty intervals (e.g. Figure 1 etc). Did the authors perform a sensitivity analysis to confirm that the surface without weights would be fairly similar to a surface utilising the survey weights? The weights would also be useful if you were to add additional visualisations projecting absolute counts of HIV positive young adults by high versus lower risk clusters. Prevalence without weighted correction may mask underlying population size differences within and across countries.</p><p>4) The environmental covariates if I understand it are homogeneous for all individuals within a DHS survey "cluster" or community while those measured at individual level varying at that level. I wonder if this may impact the variable selection approach, especially if income or SES at household level is linked up with GHF (economic activity component) at cluster level.</p><p>5) Population attributability - it may be worth considering a Poisson model with robust variance to estimate relative risks and the leverage prevalence of exposure to various risk factors to estimate population attributable fractions for each in addition to the effect sizes currently presented. This may reveal some additional subtle differences across the countries and within. Additional a decomposition type approach (e.g. Shapley) using a generalised linear framework could also be used to estimate the relative importance of the various covariates.</p><p>7) Results narrative - i think the explanation of the directionality of association for the environmental covariate e.g. EVI and GHF needs to be improved (e.g. lines 216-217).</p><p>8) If I understand Figure 3 correctly the least heterogeneity is explained in the areas with the highest prevalence among young adults (Figure 2)? This is important and has implication for the conclusions/utility of the results.</p><p>Minor</p><p>1)Risk factor analysis: S2 Table - the coefficient for gender looks incorrect i.e. 0.00? Especially given the highly significant coefficient in S3 Table.</p><p>*** Reviewer #3: </p><p>This well-organized study uses geospatial methods to identify areas of high HIV prevalence among young adults within 7 countries in Eastern and sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, the authors present a regression model that relates epidemiological predictors to HIV prevalence. While the approach is sound, the significance of is more of an incremental contribution rather than a major advance from published geospatial modeling studies of HIV prevalence, such as the works by Cuadros et al and Dwyer-Lindgren et al that are cited in the introduction of the paper. The focus on HIV prevalence among young adults is interesting and could be developed further. </p><p>Major critiques:</p><p>1. The paper focuses on HIV prevalence among young adults, with the claim that young adults represent more recent infection and that high prevalence locations can be prioritized for prevention interventions. This is an interesting focus and could be developed further in the paper. Are the locations of high HIV prevalence in young adults the same as the locations among the general adult population? How do areas of high prevalence among young adults compare with variation in the underlying population age structure? More can be said in the discussion about efforts to prevent HIV infection specifically in this age group.</p><p>2. Line 171-172 and Figure 1. How were the national-level prevalence estimates generated? Are these the weighted means of the clusters values or do they use the estimated HIV prevalence rasters? How do they compare with the published survey reports? It would enhance the results to provide a confidence interval around the estimate.</p><p>3. The nine-year timespan over which the survey data were collected means that the resulting maps are a composite of various survey years. The years represented in the study coincided with a major scale-up of ART and HIV prevention interventions, so the difference in timing could be important. The difference in survey years should be included in the limitations. </p><p>4. The claim in the discussion lines 278-279 that all high prevalence areas were areas with known high levels of economic activity needs to be tested more rigorously. How is the level of economic activity for an area defined in this analysis? Was the level of economic activity assessed over the entire geographic area? Were areas also found that had high economic activity and low HIV prevalence?</p><p>Minor critiques</p><p>1. Please make it clear which years are represented for the covariates that were not directly extracted from the DHS or AIS surveys (eg WorldPop).</p><p>2. Include a justification for why a larger age group was defined as young adults for males than for females.</p><p>3. Line 124 statistical analysis. Please provide the interpolation equations in the supplementary material. </p><p>4. How does the amount of variation explained by the models in this study compare to R2 in other published studies?</p><p>5. Line 300. I do not agree that the findings of this study support the need to increase condom use specifically. Rather, persistently high HIV incidence supports the need to increase access to effective HIV prevention interventions more broadly.</p><p>6. Line 317, "We are the first&#x02026;". Please modify this statement in light of the other published HIV prevalence maps cited in the paper. While this paper's focus on young adults takes a new lens to these data, they are fully utilized in the other studies as well.</p><p>***</p><p>Any attachments provided with reviews can be seen via the following link:</p><p>[LINK]</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pmed.1003042.r002" article-type="author-comment"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pmed.1003042.r002</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response to Decision Letter 0</article-title></title-group><related-article id="rel-obj002" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pmed.1003042" related-article-type="editor-report"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
