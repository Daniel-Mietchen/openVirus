However, the transmission of SLCMV in the areas into which it has recently been introduced remain largely unexplored. Here we have compared the transmission efficiencies of SLCMV by three widely distributed whitefly species in Asia, and found that only Asia II 1 whiteflies were able to transmit this virus efficiently. The transmission efficiencies of SLCMV by different whitefly species were found to correlate positively with quantity of virus in whitefly whole body. Further, the viral transmission efficiency was found to be associated with varied ability of virus movement within different species of whiteflies.

Thanks to its inherent tolerance to abiotic stresses such as drought and infertile soils, cassava is now being widely grown in tropical Africa, Asia and Latin America, making it one of the most important crops in the world (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">El-Sharkawy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Jarvis et al., 2012</xref>). More importantly, in the era of global warming, which is one of the major features of anthropogenic climate change in the near future, cassava is likely to be of increasing importance as a staple food (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Jarvis et al., 2012</xref>). In recent decades, however, cassava mosaic diseases (CMDs) caused by cassava mosaic begomoviruses (CMBs), have emerged as a serious threat to the production of cassava. While significant yield losses have been documented due to CMD outbreaks, spread continues as evidenced by recent CMD emergence in Cambodia, Vietnam and China (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Navas-Castillo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Rey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Uke et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In light of the immediate threat caused by CMDs, research efforts are badly needed to identify the vector species and help to sustain the production of cassava in those affected and often the least developed regions.</p><p id="p0015">So far, 11 CMBs have been shown to be the causal agents of CMDs, among which nine were found in Africa and two, namely Indian cassava mosaic virus (ICMV) and Sri Lankan cassava mosaic virus (SLCMV) were characterized in Asia (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Legg et al., 2015</xref>). As for Asian CMBs, while ICMV was characterized earlier than SLCMV, SLCMV seemed to exhibit a wider geographical distribution and higher infectivity (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Jose et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Patil et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Saunders et al., 2002</xref>). In the last few years, the threat of SLCMV has been evidenced by its rapid invasion of Cambodia, Vietnam and China (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Uke et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). However, the transmission efficiency of SLCMV by different whitefly species remains hitherto unexplored.</p><p id="p0020">Due to the fact that cassava plants are normally vegetatively propagated, inter-regional spread of CMBs entails the transport of infected cuttings (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Legg et al., 2014</xref>). For example, the recent presence of SLCMV in China was attributed to the import of cassava cuttings from Cambodia (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). However, as learned from CMD epidemics in Africa caused by different CMBs, while infected cuttings serve as the initial source of infection, whitefly vectors can contribute to the secondary spread of the virus (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Legg et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Indeed, field surveys conducted in India and Vietnam have both shown that cutting-borne infections constitute a large proportion of CMD incidences in the field, followed by less frequent whitefly-borne infections (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Jose et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Minato et al., 2019</xref>). More importantly, transmission by whitefly will render some control strategies such as roguing and phytosanitary measures less effective, as epidemics are able to establish from a limited source of infection with the aid of whitefly vectors. Therefore, sustainable control of CMBs, including SLCMV, can only be achieved when a detailed understanding of whitefly transmission of CMBs, as well as alternative hosts is gained.</p><p id="p0025">Begomoviruses are known to be vectored by the whitefly <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic>, a species complex consisting of more than 36 genetically distinct but morphologically indistinguishable cryptic species (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">De Barro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). For a given begomovirus, varied transmission efficiencies have been reported for different whitefly species, indicating different whitefly species may play varying roles in the epidemiology of certain begomoviruses (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Beford et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Polston et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Fiallo-Oliv&#x000e9; et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, a detailed exploration on the transmission of begomoviruses by different whitefly species will lead to an improved understanding of the identity of vector species of the corresponding plant viral diseases, which will in turn facilitate the prediction of virus epidemics. This is exemplified by the case of cotton leaf curl Multan virus (CLCuMuV), wherein it was established that disease associated with this virus is primarily spread by Asia II 1, an indigenous whitefly species (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Masood et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2018b</xref>).</p><p id="p0030">In the present study, we characterized the transmission of SLCMV by three whitefly species of the <italic>B. tabaci</italic> complex found in the Asian SLCMV-affected regions (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">G&#x000f6;tz and Winter 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), namely Asia II 1, Mediterranean (MED) and Middle East-Asia Minor (MEAM1), and examined the factors involved.

Furthermore, the capacity of Asia II 1 whiteflies to transmit SLCMV to cassava plants was verified (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Notably, when tobacco plants were used as test plants, the transmission efficiency of SLCMV by MED whiteflies as indicated by PCR was much higher than that as indicated by symptom (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The possible reasons are: 1) at the time point of examination, the quantity of SLCMV in some MED whiteflies-inoculated plants was not sufficient to induce symptoms but enough to be detected by PCR; 2) MED whiteflies only transferred DNA-A of SLCMV to some test plants. For SLCMV, its transmission by whiteflies has to date only been outlined briefly in two reports, the first of which (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Duraisamy et al., 2013</xref>) failed to state the species of whitefly successful in transmitting SLCMV. Another study, wherein only a few test plants were used, showed that MEAM1 whiteflies were able to transmit SLCMV from symptomatic cassava plants to tomato and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Considering the fact that the study by <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2019)</xref> is a disease note reporting the presence of SLCMV, we believe it is reasonable to state that MEAM1 poorly transmit SLCMV as judged from our data.</p><p id="p0105">The limited capacity of MEAM1 and MED whiteflies to transmit SLCMV suggests that in regions where these invasive whitefly species dominate, e.g., South China, whitefly-borne SLCMV epidemic will hopefully not occur following the recent SLCMV introduction due to the lack of efficient vectors (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, the same situation was found for CLCuMuV, which was found in South China in 2006 but no major epidemic has been reported, probably due to the limited distribution of its only known efficient whitefly vector, Asia II 1 (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Masood et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2018b</xref>). Therefore, for the control of SLCMV, in regions where MED and MEAM1 are predominant, thorough implementation of phytosanitary and roguing may be enough to limit the spread of SLCMV. However, in other Asian cassava cultivation areas such as southern Vietnam, multiple indigenous whitefly species including Asia 1, Asia II 1, Asia II 6 have been reported (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">G&#x000f6;tz and Winter 2016</xref>). In this regard, research efforts to further examine the transmission of SLCMV by those indigenous whitefly species are important to assist the development of durable control strategies.</p><p id="p0110">In Africa, where CMBs and whitefly species are found to be different from that in Asia, whiteflies of the <italic>B. tabaci</italic> complex seem to play a rather important role in the CMD epidemics (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Legg and Ogwal, 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Legg et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Legg et al., 2014</xref>). In a field survey conducted in Uganda in the 1990s, higher populations of whiteflies were reported in epidemic-affected than unaffected areas (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Legg et al., 1998</xref>). Later, analysis of data from multiple regions in Africa revealed that the spread of severe CMD epidemic generally came after the appearance of &#x02018;super-abundant&#x02019; whitefly populations (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Legg et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Also, it was established that a distinct whitefly genotype cluster is associated with the epidemic of severe cassava mosaic virus disease in Uganda (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Legg et al., 2002</xref>). The strong association between the increase of whitefly abundance and presence of severe CMD epidemics suggested that CMD epidemics in Africa might be primarily driven by whiteflies (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Legg and Ogwal, 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Legg et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Legg et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Legg et al., 2014</xref>). However, in Asia, whiteflies seem to play a more minor role in the epidemics of CMD. As whitefly-borne infection results in symptom appearance in young upper leaves only and cutting-borne infection results in both young and old leaves, field surveys established that whitefly-borne infection was found to account for only 9.0&#x02013;37.5% and 20.6% of the total incidences observed in India and Vietnam, respectively (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Jose et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Minato et al., 2019</xref>). The reason for the differential role of whitefly in CMD epidemics in Africa and Asia might be the differential transmission of African or Asian CMBs by local whiteflies and/or the abundance of efficient whitefly vectors in regions where CMD occurred. In this regard, a previous study using cassava mosaic geminiviruses and whitefly populations collected from India and Africa established that cassava mosaic geminiviruses from either location are transmitted efficiently only by whitefly populations from their geographical origin (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Maruthi et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the lack of efficient CMB vector populations might account for the limited whitefly-borne infection in Asia.</p><p id="p0115">For the role of whitefly vectors in CMD epidemics, while it has been well established in the African context, much more remains to be explored in Asia (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Legg et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In Cambodia and Vietnam, the outbreaks of CMD caused by SLCMV were found to be associated Asia II 1 whiteflies, the only known efficient vectors for SLCMV as we revealed in the present study (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Uke et al., 2018</xref>). These findings provide valuable insight into the role of whitefly in Asian CMD. However, more studies, which should include detailed comparison of whitefly distribution and abundance in Africa and Asia, and comparative transmission of more different whitefly species-CMB combinations, are necessary to further illustrate the reasons for the differential role of whitefly in the outbreak of CMDs in the two continents.</p><p id="p0120">Further, in order to explore the mechanisms underpinning the differential transmission of SLCMV by different whitefly species, we monitored virus acquisition by and virus transport inside whiteflies. Our findings revealed that the transmission efficiencies of SLCMV by different whitefly species correlated positively with quantity of virus in whitefly whole body, but negatively with that in honeydew. It was also noted that the variation of transmission efficiency was associated with the differing virus transport inside whitefly, particularly across the whitefly midgut. Interestingly, the pattern of differential transmission of SLCMV and underlying mechanisms are similar to that of CLCuMuV and tobacco curly shoot virus (TbCSV) when only Asia II 1 and MEAM1 are considered, suggesting something in common in those three viruses, probably in their coat proteins considering the function of coat proteins (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Briddon et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000f6;Fer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Czosnek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Harrison et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2018b</xref>). For begomoviruses, once they are acquired by insect vectors during feeding, they move long the food canal and then translocate from the gut lumen into the haemolymph and finally into the salivary glands, from where they are introduced back into the plant host during insect feeding (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Czosnek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Hogenhout et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, the information provided here, along with those in previous reports, offers a unique opportunity to further explore the nature of virus transport within whitefly and factors involved, e.g., the motifs of coat protein involved in whitefly-begomovirus interaction, thereby advancing our understanding of whitefly transmission of begomoviruses.</p><p id="p0125">Taken together, here we show that indigenous Asia II 1 whiteflies were able to readily transmit SLCMV and invasive MEAM1 and MED whiteflies can only transmit this virus with very low efficiency. Further analysis revealed that the differential transmission might be due to the differential capacity of SLCMV to be retained by different whiteflies and to transport across the midgut of different species of whiteflies. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the detailed whitefly transmission profile of an Asian CMBs. Our findings identified Asia II 1 whiteflies, but not MEAM1 or MED whiteflies as efficient vectors for SLCMV, which will help to evaluate the potential threat of SLCMV to cassava production in many regions and to facilitate the prediction of virus epidemics.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Author contributions section</title><p id="p0130">Yao Chi: Conceptualization, Methodology, Formal analysis, Investigation, Data Curation, Writing - Original Draft, Writing - Review &#x00026; Editing.</p><p id="p0135">Li-Long Pan: Conceptualization, Methodology, Formal analysis, Data Curation, Writing - Original Draft, Writing - Review &#x00026; Editing.</p><p id="p0140">Sophie Bouvaine: Conceptualization, Validation, Investigation, Resources, Writing - Review &#x00026; Editing, Supervision, Project administration, Funding acquisition.</p><p id="p0145">Yun-Yun Fan: Investigation.</p><p id="p0150">Yin-Quan Liu: Resources, Supervision, Project administration, Funding acquisition.</p><p id="p0155">Shu-Sheng Liu: Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Project administration, Funding acquisition.</p><p id="p0160">Susan Seal: Conceptualization, Validation, Investigation, Resources, Writing - Review &#x00026; Editing, Supervision, Project administration, Funding acquisition.</p><p id="p0165">Xiao-Wei Wang: Conceptualization, Resources, Writing - Review &#x00026; Editing, Supervision, Project administration, Funding acquisition.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Beford</surname><given-names>I.D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Briddon</surname><given-names>R.W.</given-names></name><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>J.K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosell</surname><given-names>R.C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Markham</surname><given-names>P.G.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Geminivirus transmission and biological characterisation of <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> (Gennadius) biotypes from different geographic regions</article-title><source>Ann.
