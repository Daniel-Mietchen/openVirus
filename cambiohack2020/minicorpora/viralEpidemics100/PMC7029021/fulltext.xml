Epidemiological studies have shown that the two hMPV genotypes alternate in predominance worldwide in recent years. Co-circulation of the two genotypes of hMPV was usually observed and there is no study about the interaction between them, such as competitive replication, which maybe the possible mechanisms for alternating prevalence of subtypes. Our present study have used two different genotypes of hMPV (genotype A: NL/1/00; B: NL/1/99) in different proportions in animal model (BALB/c mice) and cell model (Vero-E6) separately. The result showed that the competitive growth does exist in BALB/c mice, genotype B had a strong competitive advantage. However, genotype B did not cause more severe disease than non-predominant (genotype A) or mixed strains in the study, which were evaluated by the body weight, airway hyperresponsiveness and lung pathology of mouse. In cell model, competitive growth and the two genotypes alternately prevalence were observed. In summary, we confirmed that there was a competitive replication between hMPV genotype A and B, and no difference in disease severity caused by the two subtypes. This study shows a new insight to understand the alternation of hMPV genotype prevalence through genotype competition and provide experimental evidence for disease control and vaccine design.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Genotype</kwd><kwd>Infection</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>30800972</award-id><award-id>81371876</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Yao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Natural Science Foundation Progect of CQ and YuZhong District CSTS (Number:cstc2017jcyjAX0043 and 20170403) Chongqing Municipal Colleges and Universities Outstanding Talent Support Program (Number:2017-47-1-11)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), which was first isolated from children with respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in the Netherlands in 2001 and belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family and Pneumovirus subfamily<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, is a leading cause of respiratory infections in children worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. hMPV has been recognized as a causative agent of respiratory infections, including upper respiratory infections, severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia, in all age groups, with more severe disease occurring in infants, elderly people, and immunocompromised hosts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.

The seasonality, clinical manifestations, and age distribution of hMPV infection resemble those of RSV infection, and the alternating pattern of the two genotypes of hMPV shows similar properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. hMPV is a negative sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a genome that is approximately 13&#x02009;kb in length that encodes eight genes and nine proteins, including the following genes and proteins, respectively: N, nucleocapsid; P, phosphoprotein; M, matrix; F, fusion; SH, small hydrophobic; G, glycoprotein; and L, polymerase and M2-1 and M2-2. Based on the genetic variability and phylogenetic analysis of the G gene and the F gene, hMPV is classified as one of two major genotypes, hMPV-A and hMPV-B, which are subdivided into four subgroups (A1, A2, B1 and B2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Epidemiological surveys conducted in many countries, such as China, the USA, France, Australia, Italy, Korea, Brazil, and India, have indicated that strains from both major hMPV groups co-circulate within the same community and that the predominant subgroup shifts progressively from one group to another. Many epidemiological studies have found that A/B genotyping indicated a change in the predominant viral genotype over one to three years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Theo P <italic>et al</italic>. reported that hMPV subtype A was predominant in 2001&#x02013;2003, but this shifted to subtype B in 2004 in Queensland, Australia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>; Wuhua Kong found that genotype A prevailed in the epidemic seasons in 2008&#x02013;2009 and 2012&#x02013;2013, while genotype B prevailed in 2009 in Wuhan, China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>; an article published in Korea in 2016 about an epidemic of hMPV showed that genotype A2a was predominant in 2007 and 2010, genotype B1 was predominant in 2012, and B2 was predominant in 2008 and 2009 and further predicted that genotype A2a would be the predominant hMPV type in 2014 or 2015 in Korea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Despite the common worldwide of hMPV alternating epidemics, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Many researchers have suggested that virus alternating epidemic may be related to the environmental-climate change, host immunity and susceptibility, and the bottleneck effect of the virus transmission process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The above reasons are &#x0201c;external factors&#x0201d; of this alternating epidemic, &#x0201c;internal factors&#x0201d; include virus escape, virus evolution, and interactions between virus subtypes. Co-circulation of the two genotypes of hMPV was usually observed and the interactions between them such as competitive growth might play a role in the formation of alternation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. However, there is no study about it. Most studies of the alternation of the A/B strains during epidemics have been focused on clinical investigations of hMPV strains isolated from symptomatic patients that involved genotyping and statistical analysis, and there was no basic experimental evidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>; We set our study in animal model (BALB/c mice) and cell model (Vero-E6) separately with two different genotypes of hMPV (genotype A: NL/1/00; B: NL/1/99) in different proportions.</p><p id="Par6">This study confirmed that there was a competitive replication between genotype A and genotype B. In animal experiment, subtype B became the predominant strain, but the clinical symptoms caused by type B were not more severe than non-predominant or mixed strain. In cell experiment, type A and B alternately predominated at the first four generations, and A became the predominant strain eventually. This research could offer a new opinion to study alternation of genotype prevalence. Our findings provide important information for treatment research, vaccine development, prevention strategies, and the monitoring of outbreaks of hMPV infection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> competitive growth experiment</title><p id="Par7">To determine whether competitive replication occurred <italic>in vivo</italic>, we divided the mice into six groups.

In summary, studies of the epidemiological distribution, alternation of the genotype predominance and genetic diversity of hMPV have been conducted all over the world, but these studies have mainly involved patients with clinical manifestations of respiratory infection, and no basic research has been conducted to explain the occurrence of this phenomenon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Studies have shown that such alternation may be related to virus-to-host immune escape, and persistent infection or a high viral load is easily detected, which leads to the neglect of low-load subtypes. The differences in the genetic structure of hMPV and immunization against viruses caused a seasonal shift in the predominant genotype and led to the maintenance of infection rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. If we can determine how hMPV genotypes interact, this may be helpful for epidemic detection, treatment and prevention. We try to focus on the virus itself firstly and explore whether the interaction mechanism between A and B subtypes will affect this alternation.</p><p id="Par21">In the present study, we sought to determine whether the competition exist between A and B subtypes <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, and a competitive replication system was used. First, in the mouse model (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), the trend of type A was down-up-down, and genotype B was predominant in the end. Except for when A:B&#x02009;=&#x02009;80:20 during which the starting amount of genotype B was too small, the proportion of B increased slowly in the first 13d and decreased at 17d, and then increased at 20d. There may seem to have a phenomenon that no matter how virus input ratio was used, competition existed between the two subtypes and genotype B predominated in the animal models eventually. We speculated that the competitive advantage of subtype B may be related to its strong virulence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, so we designed experiments to infect mice with A and B subtype or mixed subtypes to detect the severity of disease. However, based on our <italic>in vivo</italic> animal experiment results, the severity of illness was not related to infection with genotypes A and B in terms of weight changes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), viral load (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) airway hyperresponsiveness (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) or histopathological changes in the lungs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This was shown not only for genotype A and B infection alone but also for 50:50, 20:80 and 80:20 mixed genotype infections. Although the results surprised us, previous clinical studies have shown that there is no difference in clinical manifestations between the two subtypes. From 2002 to 2004 in the USA, Apapov E <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> first found that hMPV caused a viral genotype shift, but did not observe a difference in the severity of illness caused by various hMPV isolates. In Italy, from 2003 to 2004, Bosis S <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> found that a high hMPV viral load was correlated with disease presentation, whereas the overall clinical and socioeconomic burden caused by infection with the two hMPV genotypes was similar. From 2006 to 2008 in southern Brazil, Debur MC <italic>et al</italic>. found no correlation between genotype and disease severity in inpatients and outpatients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. In the same period (2006&#x02013;2008) in China, no association was found between hMPV genotypes and disease severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. In summary, we found that hMPV subtypes compete <italic>in vivo</italic>, but virulence is not the reason for its competitive advantages. The specific reasons need to be further explored, but we verified there is a competition between type A and B in animal at the first time, and this competition may play an alternating role in nature.</p><p id="Par22">Then we performed a subtype competitive replication experiment in cells, and wanted to verify this phenomenon <italic>in vitro</italic>. In the cell model (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), different input ratios were used to infect Vero-E6 cells, and the viral titer of the two genotypes were detected. Genotype shifts were observed at input ratios of 50:50, 20:80 80:20, 10:100 and 100:10. The proportion of genotype A rose, fell and finally rose again until genotype B could not be detected. Even when A:B&#x02009;=&#x02009;10:100 and the initial proportion of A was only 1/10 of that of B, it was also possible to gradually obtain a growth advantage and finally for A to become the predominant genotype. In the A:B&#x02009;=&#x02009;100:10 group, due to the absolute initial proportion of genotype A being very large, the proportion of genotype A did not increase and decline but first decreased and then increased. Based on the above, in spite of the A and B genotypes having different initial proportions, the genotype ratio trends were the same; that is, the proportion of A first increased and then decreased and finally predominated. At the same time, the proportion of genotype B decreased, which was followed by an increase, until finally B disappeared at the detection end point. In summary, we observed the competition of the two hMPV genotypes, type A and B were alternately predominant in cell in the first four generations, and subtype A became predominant strain in the end.</p><p id="Par23">There has been a contradictory phenomenon <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>; genotype alternation predominated was observed first and then subtype A became the predominant strain in the cell model, but genotype B predominated in animal experiment. We speculate that the reason for this disparity may be that the cell infected with virus as a simple model, and the final result is only related to the different mixing ratios of the hMPV two subtypes. In animal experiments, even if we control the external environment and diet of each group to be the same, the final result is related to the virus subtype addition ratio and the host immunity. Obviously, in animal experiments, subtype B shows a stronger adaptability. This is inconsistent with the conclusion that subtype A is the dominant strain in human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. It may be that the hMPV dominant strain is different in different populations, or that our experiment time is too short<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. In a word, our experiments showed that the competition exist between the two subtypes and this competition could affect the alternation of genotype prevalence.</p><p id="Par24">Regrettably, there were still several limitations in our experiments. First, we verified the phenomenon using a single model. We used only the Vero-E6 <italic>in vitro</italic> system and BALB/c mice for the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, and additional cell lines and animal models needed to be studied. Second, we monitored the animal model for only 20 days, because in previous studies, we found that the hMPV can only survive in mice for 2&#x02013;3 weeks. If we find a way to extend the survival time of the hMPV in mice, the results may be more consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> results. Third, in animal experiments, host immunity can interfere with the impact of hMPV subtype competition on hMPV alternating epidemics. We tried to use the immunosuppressant cyclophosphamide to suppress the immunity of mice, but the use of the inhibitor caused a large number of deaths in mice. We are still looking for suitable inhibitors to suppress the immunity of mice to verify the effect of hMPV subtype competition on alternating epidemics simply. Fourth, the statistical analysis of hMPV global epidemiology may be incomplete, and some reports did not subdivide the subtypes, which may have led to insufficient data for the statistical analysis. Therefore, the actual relationships between hMPV epidemiology, disease severity and genotype alternation need to be further explored.</p><p id="Par25">In summary, we found and verified that the competition between A and B subtypes exists and this competition may relate to the alternation of hMPV genotype prevalence through cell and animal experiments. Regardless of the proportions of genotypes A and B, there will be a subtype become predominant strain in the end. Subtype A predominant <italic>in vitro</italic> and subtype B <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment, and the genotype alternation observed <italic>in vitro</italic>. There were no statistically significant differences in the severity of disease caused by the two hMPV genotypes, and the severity of disease caused by mixed infection was not worse than that caused by single genotype infection. Our results may improve the understanding of the alternation of the prevalence of hMPV genotypes; perhaps this is a strategy involving genetic structure changes that is used by the virus to seasonally maintain infection rates. This study of hMPV affords us the possibility of another explanation of the hMPV alternation epidemic besides the cause of immunity, environment and climate, and it also provides experimental evidence useful for disease control and vaccine development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="Par26">Vero-E6 (ATCC CRL-1586) cells were maintained in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, USA), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin in an incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Viral culture</title><p id="Par27">hMPV NL/1/00 (virus genotype A) and NL/1/99 (virus genotype B) were kindly provided by Professor Fouchier (Erasmus Medical Center, Netherlands) and were prepared using the reverse genetics method as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>.
