# The problem
Knowledge is a core part of tacking the epidemic.We need every discipline, not just bioscience:

```
physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, materials, statistics,math, engineering , psychology, sociology, 
economics, law, philosophy, literature, art, sport, ...
``` 
Citizens (doctors, parents, local government, business, SMEs, policy makers,,,) fund the scientific literature 
(500 Billion of STEM research/year) and can't get answers. 

## Example
"I want articles/evidence on social distancing in epdimemics".

Go to Taylor and Francis (one of the big 5 publishers)

![TF](../assets/tf_online.png)

and get over 10000 hits

![Closed](../assets/tf_socdist_closed.png)

Note you do NOT have to be an academic to understand these articles. Everyone in the world needs them:

But if you're asn "ordinary citizen" you can only see:

![Open](../assets/tf_socdist.open.png)

Over 90% of the scientific literature is closed. It's the same with other big 5 publishers (Elsevier, SpringerNature, Wiley, T+F, Sage).

**Open Access isn't working**

I assert that:
**PAYWALLS KILL PEOPLE**
