# The problem
Knowledge is a core part of tacking the epidemic.We need every discipline, not just bioscience:

```
physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, materials, statistics,math, engineering , psychology, sociology, economics, law,
phiolosophy, literature, art, sport, 
``` 
Citizens (doctors, parents, local government, business, SMEs, policy makers,,,) fund the scientific literature 
(500 Billion of STEM research/year) and can't get answers. 

## Example
"I want articles on social distancing in epdimemics"
