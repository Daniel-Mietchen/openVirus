    <rel_abs>Background Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on COV-19, and reported to be efficient in Chinese patients infected by this virus. We evaluate the role of Hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads. Patients and methods Patients were included in a single arm protocol to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasal swabs was tested daily. Depending on their clinical presentation azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative control. Presence and absence of virus at Day-6 was considered the end point. Results Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D-6 compared to controls, and much lower than reported average carrying duration of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to Hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination. Conclusion : Hydroxychloroquine is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in patients with COVID-19 and its effect is reinforced by Azithromycin.</rel_abs>
