    <rel_abs>The paper will attempt to estimate factors which determine the variability of case fatality rates of COVID-19 across OCED countries in recent time. The objective of the paper is to estimate the impact of government health policy on fatality rates (Case fatality rates) of COVID-19 in countries while controlling for other demographic and economic characteristics. The analysis is of done using non-parametric regression method, i.e. Quantile regression. The result from quartile regressions analysis shows that a policy of Austerity (health expenditure cuts) significantly increases the mortality rates of COVID-19 in OCED countries. The policy implication of the study is the need for a robust public-funded health system with wider accessibility to deals with a major public health crisis like a COVID-19 pandemic.</rel_abs>
