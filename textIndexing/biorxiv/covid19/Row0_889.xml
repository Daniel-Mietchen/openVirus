    <rel_abs>We analyzed the epidemiological dataset of confirmed cases with COVID-19 in Japan as of 28 February 2020 and estimated the number of severe and non-severe cases, accounting for under-ascertainment. The ascertainment rate of non-severe cases was estimated at 0.44 (95% confidence interval: 0.37, 0.50), indicating that unbiased number of non-cases would be more than twice the reported count. Severe cases are twice more likely diagnosed and reported than other cases.</rel_abs>
