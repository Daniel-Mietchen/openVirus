    <rel_abs>Background: To control COVID-19 outbreak in Japan, sports and entertainment events were canceled in Japan for two weeks from 26 February to 13 March. It has been designated as voluntary event cancellation (VEC). Object: This study predicts the effectiveness of VEC enduring and after its implementation. Method: We applied a simple susceptible-infected-recovery model to data of patients with symptoms in Japan during 14 January to VEC introduction and after VEC introduction to 8 March. We adjusted the reporting delay in the latest few days. Results: Results suggest that the basic reproduction number, R0, before VEC introduced as 2.29 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was [2.19, 2.37] and the effective reproduction number, Rv, after VEC introduced as 1. 99; its 95% CI was [1.71,2.23]. Discussion and Conclusion: No significant effect of VEC was observed.</rel_abs>
