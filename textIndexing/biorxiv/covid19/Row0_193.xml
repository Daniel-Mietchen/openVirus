    <rel_abs>There is an urgent necessity of effective medication against SARS CoV-2, which is producing the COVID-19 pandemic across the world. Its main protease (Mpro) represents an attractive pharmacological target due to its involvement in essential viral functions. The crystal structure of free Mpro shows a large structural resemblance with the main protease of CoV-1. Here we report that CoV-2 Mpro is however 300% more sensitive than CoV-1 Mpro in transmitting tiny structural changes across the whole protein through long-range interactions. The largest sensitivity of Mpro to structural perturbations is located exactly around the catalytic site Cyst-145, and coincides with the binding site of several of its inhibitors. These findings, based on a simplified representation of the protein as a residue network, may help in designing potent inhibitors of CoV-2 Mpro.</rel_abs>
