    <rel_abs>Recent studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes (DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052), but our current work only focus on ACE2, which is insufficient to support the conclusion of this paper. So the authors have withdrawn their manuscript whilst they perform additional experiments and analysis to test some of their conclusions further. Therefore, the authors do not wish this work to be cited as reference for the project.</rel_abs>
