    <rel_abs>The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been growing exponentially, affecting nearly 900 thousand people and causing enormous distress to economies and societies worldwide. A plethora of analyses based on viral sequences has already been published, in scientific journals as well as through non-peer reviewed channels, to investigate SARS-CoV-2 genetic heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dissemination. We examined full genome sequences currently available to assess the presence of sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies in countries with the highest toll of confirmed cases. Although number of-available full-genomes is growing daily, and the full dataset contains sufficient phylogenetic information that would allow reliable inference of phylogenetic relationships, country-specific SARS-CoV-2 datasets still present severe limitations. Studies assessing within country spread or transmission clusters should be considered preliminary at best, or hypothesis generating. Hence the need for continuing concerted efforts to increase number and quality of the sequences required for robust tracing of the epidemic.

Significance StatementAlthough genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are growing daily and contain sufficient phylogenetic information, country-specific data still present severe limitations and should be interpreted with caution.</rel_abs>
