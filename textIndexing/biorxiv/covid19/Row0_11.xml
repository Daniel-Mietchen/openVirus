    <rel_abs>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory tract infection. The standard molecular diagnostic test is a multistep process involving viral RNA extraction and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). Laboratories across the globe face constraints on equipment and reagents during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have developed a simplified qRT-PCR assay that removes the need for an RNA extraction process and can be run on a real-time thermal cycler. The assay uses custom primers and probes, and maintains diagnostic sensitivity within 98.0% compared to the assay run on a high-throughput, random-access automated platform, the Panther Fusion (Hologic). This assay can be used to increase capacity for COVID-19 testing for national programmes worldwide.</rel_abs>
