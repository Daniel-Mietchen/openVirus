    <rel_abs>Most countries are affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and experience rapidly increasing numbers of cases and deaths. Many have implemented nationwide stringent control to avoid overburdening the health care system. This paralyzes economic and social activities until the availability of a vaccine, which may take years. We propose an alternative exit strategy to develop herd immunity in a predictable and controllable way: a phased lift of control. This means that successive parts of the country (e.g. provinces) stop stringent control, and Covid-19-related IC admissions are distributed over the country as the whole. Importantly, vulnerable individuals need to be shielded until herd immunity has developed in their area. We explore the characteristics and duration of this strategy using a novel individual-based model for geographically stratified transmission of Covid-19 in a country. The model predicts that individuals will have to experience stringent control for about 14 months on average, but this duration may be significantly shortened by future developments (more IC beds, better drugs). Clearly, the strategy will have a profound impact on individuals and society, and should therefore be considered carefully by various other disciplines (e.g. health systems, ethics, economics) before actual implementation.</rel_abs>
