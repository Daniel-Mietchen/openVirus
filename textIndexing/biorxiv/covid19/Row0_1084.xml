    <rel_abs>The recent outbreak of the Covid-19 suggests a rather long latent phase that precludes public health officials to predict the pandemic transmission on time. Here we apply mass action laws and chemical transition theory to propose a kinetic model that accounts for viral transmission dynamics at the latent phase. This model is useful for authorities to make early preventions and control measurements that stop the spread of a deadly new virus.</rel_abs>
