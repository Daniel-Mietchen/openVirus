    <rel_abs>The 2019-nCoV outbreak occurred near the Chinese Spring Festival transport period in Wuhan. As an important transportation center, the migration of Wuhan accelerated the spread of 2019-nCoV across mainland China. Based on the cumulative Baidu migration index (CBMI), we first analyzed the proportion of Wuhan's migrant population to other cities. Our results confirm that there is a significant correlation between the export population of Wuhan and reported cases in various regions. We subsequently found that the mortality rate in Hubei Province was much higher than that in other regions of mainland China, while the investigation of potential cases in Wuhan was far behind other provinces in Mainland China, which indicates the effectiveness of early isolation.</rel_abs>
