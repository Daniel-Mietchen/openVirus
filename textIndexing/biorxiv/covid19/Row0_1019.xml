    <rel_abs>In this work, we use a within-host viral dynamic model to describe the SARS-CoV-2 kinetics in host. Chest radiograph score data are used to estimate the parameters of that model. Our result shows that the basic reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 in host growth is around 3.79. Using the same method we also estimate the basic reproductive number of MERS virus is 8.16 which is higher than SARS-CoV-2. The PRCC method is used to analyze the sensitivities of model parameters and the drug effects on virus growth are also implemented to analyze the model.</rel_abs>
