    <rel_abs>Protection of frontline HCPs is paramount. However, PPE is a limited resource and often requires providers to be adaptive and resourceful in a crisis. The inexpensive and simple method of using clear drapes during extubation (and possibly intubation) of COVID-19 patients may be considered by frontline HCPs and infection control specialists as an additional precaution. Modifications of the clear plastics can be adapted for surgical procedures that may be AGMPs.</rel_abs>
