    <rel_abs>The recent outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) require fast, simple, and sensitive onsite nucleic acid diagnostics that can be developed rapidly to prevent the spread of diseases. We have developed a SENsitive Splint-based one-step isothermal RNA detection (SENSR) method for rapid and straightforward onsite detection of pathogen RNAs with high sensitivity and specificity. SENSR consists of two simple enzymatic reactions: a ligation reaction by SplintR ligase and subsequent transcription by T7 RNA polymerase. The resulting transcript forms an RNA aptamer that induces fluorescence. Here, we demonstrate that SENSR is an effective and highly sensitive method for the detection of the current epidemic pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We also show that the platform can be extended to the detection of five other pathogens. Overall, SENSR is a molecular diagnostic method that can be developed rapidly for onsite uses requiring high sensitivity, specificity, and short assaying times.</rel_abs>
