    <rel_abs>Korean public health authorities raised the public alert to its highest level on February 23, 2020 to mitigate the 2019 novel coronavirus disease epidemic. We have identified that the mean delay from symptom onset to isolation was reduced to one day after raising the alert. Vigilance can reduce this interval.</rel_abs>
