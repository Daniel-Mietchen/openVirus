    <rel_abs>After SARS-CoV-2 set foot in India, the Indian Government took a number of steps to limit the spread of the disease in the country. This study involves assessing how the disease affected the population in the initial days of the epidemic. Data was collected from government controlled and crowdsourced websites and then put through analysis and calculations. With a study on age and sex parameters of 413 patients, the median age of the affected individuals was found out to be 36 years (IQR 25-54 years) with 20-39 years males being the most affected group. The number of affected males (66.34%) was more than that of the females(33.66%).Using SIR model, the range of contact rate({beta}) of India was calculated and the role of public health interventions was assessed which proved that the interventions were effective for a little while but the effect reduced due to violations.</rel_abs>
