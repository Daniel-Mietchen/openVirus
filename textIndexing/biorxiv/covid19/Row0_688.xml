    <rel_abs>The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that originated in the city of Wuhan, China has now spread to every inhabitable continent, but now theattention has shifted from China to other epicenters, especially Italy. This study explored the influence of spatial proximities and travel patterns from Italy on the further spread of SARS-CoV-2 around the globe. We showed that as the epicenter changes, the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread change to reflect spatial proximities.</rel_abs>
