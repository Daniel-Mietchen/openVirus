    <rel_abs>In absence of empirical research data, there has been considerable speculative hypothesis on the relationship between climatic factors (such as temperature and humidity) and the incidence of Covid-19. This study analyzed the data from 310 regions across 116 countries that reported confirmed cases of Covid-19 by March 12, 2020, and found that temperature, humidity, and wind speed were inversely associated with the incidence rate of Covid-19 after adjusting for the regional and temporal trend in the incidence of Covid-19, columnar density of ozone, precipitation probability, sea-level air-pressure, and length of daytime.</rel_abs>
