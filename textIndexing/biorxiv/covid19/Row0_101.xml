    <rel_abs>Covid-19 originated in Wuhan and rippled across China. We investigate how the geographical distance of working adults to the epicenter of Wuhan predicts their burnout. Preliminary results of a survey of 308 working adults in 53 cities showed the distance to the epicenter of Wuhan had an inverted U-shaped relationship with the burnout. Such results help to identify regions where people would need more psychiatric assistance, carrying direct implications to healthcare practitioners and policymakers.</rel_abs>
