    <rel_abs>SARS-CoV-2 poses an immediate, urgent and major threat to public health across the globe. Here we report an in-depth molecular analysis to reconstruct the evolutionary origins of the enhanced pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses that are severe human pathogens. Using integrated comparative genomics and machine learning techniques, we identify key genomic features that differentiate SARS-CoV-2 and the viruses behind the two previous coronavirus outbreaks, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, from less pathogenic coronaviruses. The identified features could be crucial elements of coronavirus pathogenicity and possible targets for diagnostics, prognostication and interventions.</rel_abs>
