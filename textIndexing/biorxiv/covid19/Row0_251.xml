    <rel_abs>Aims To explore clinical features and outcome of 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV)-infected patients with high BNP levels Methods and results Data were collected from patients medical records, and we defined high BNP according to the plasma BNP was above &gt; 100 pg/mL. In total,34 patients with corona virus disease 2019(COVID-19)were included in the analysis. Ten patients had high plasma BNP level. The median age for these patients was 60.5 years (interquartile range, 40-80y), and 6/10 (60%) were men. Underlying comorbidities in some patients were coronary heart disease (n=2, 20%) ;hypertesion(n=3;30%);, heart failure (n=1,10%)and diabetes (n=2, 20%). Six (60%) patients had a history of Wuhan exposure. The most common symptoms at illness onset in patients were fever (n=7, 70%), cough (n=3, 30%), headache or fatigue(n=4,40%);. These patients had higher aspartate aminotransferase(AST), troponin I, C reactive protein and lower hemoglobin, and platelet count,compared with patients with normal BNP, respectively. Compared with patients with normal BNP, patients with high BNP were more likely to develop severe pneumonia, and receive tracheal cannula, invasive mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and be admitted to the intensive care unit. One patient with high BNP died during the study.</rel_abs>
