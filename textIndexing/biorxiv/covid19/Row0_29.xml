    <rel_abs>The Crow-AMSAA method is used in engineering reliability world to predict the failures and evaluate the reliability growth. The author intents to use this model in the prediction of the Coronavirus 19 cases by using the daily reported data in Michigan and U.S.A. The Crow-AMSAA model fits the data significantly since the corona virus outbreak, especially for the Michigan infected cases and death.</rel_abs>
