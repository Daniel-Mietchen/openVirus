    <rel_abs>As of 8am 30th January (Beijing Time) 2020, Approximate 8000 cases across the world have been confirmed. It's necessary to simulate epidemic trend of the 2019-nCOV outbreak in Hubei Province, the hardest-hit area. By SEIR simulation, the predicted epidemic peak in Hubei will be within 28th January 2020 to 7th February 2020, up to 7000-9000 infectious cases in total. The estimate above was based on some assumptions and limitations exited.</rel_abs>
