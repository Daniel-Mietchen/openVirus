    <rel_abs>The emergence of the novel coronavirus (a.k.a. COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2) out of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China caught the world by surprise. As the outbreak began to spread outside of China, too little was known about the virus to model its transmission with any acceptable accuracy. World governments responded to rampant minformation about the virus leading to collatoral disasters, such as plunging financial markets, that could have been avoided if better models of the outbreak had been available. This is an engineering approach to model the spread of a new infectious disease from sparse data when little is known about the infectious agent itself. The most sought after estimate is the projected number of people who may be contagious, but still be within the incubation period thus remaining asymptomatic and undetected. This parameter is useful for estimating the extent of outbreak among a population over time and what to expect. It is thus important for common sense decision making by governments, organizations, and even individuals to contain, prepare, prevent, react, and safeguard. A Monte Carlo approach is implemented by using incubation period and a variable, called testing efficiency as variables. The Coronavirus outbreak in USA will be used to illustrate the implementation of this modeling approach. Among others it is demonstrated that imposing early travel restrictions from infected countries slowed down the outbreak in the USA by about 26 days.</rel_abs>
