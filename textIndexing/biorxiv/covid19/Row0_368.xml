    <rel_abs>Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a rapidly spreading pandemic in many countries. The total confirmed cases of Covid-19 are exponentially increasing and many countries are fighting Covid-19 with all strategies. However, there is still lacking consensus for effective strategies. Here, I demonstrate the time dependence of the doubling time in the Covid-19 exponential growths. Tracking the time-dependent doubling time tells how well Covid-19 prevention works, giving an index for successful fighting.</rel_abs>
