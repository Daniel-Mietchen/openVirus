    <rel_abs>Objectives: The main objective is twofold: first, to model the fatality curves of the COVID-19 disease, as represented by the cumulative number of deaths as a function of time; and second, to use the corresponding mathematical model to study the effectiveness of possible intervention strategies. Methods: We applied the Richards growth model (RGM) to the COVID-19 fatality curves from several countries, where we used the data from the Johns Hopkins University database up to April 1, 2020. Countries selected for analysis were China, Italy, Spain, Iran, Germany, and Brazil. Results: The RGM was shown to describe very well the fatality curves of China and Italy, which are respectively in a late stage and in the middle of the COVID-19 outbreak. The model was also successful in describing the trend in the other countries studied and which are at the same or earlier stages of the epidemics as Italy. An analytic formula for the efficiency of intervention strategies within the context of the RGM is derived. Our findings show that there is only a narrow window of opportunity, after the onset of the epidemic, during which effective countermeasures can be taken.</rel_abs>
