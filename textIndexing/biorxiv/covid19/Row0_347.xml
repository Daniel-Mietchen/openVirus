    <rel_abs>Following the recent report of a furin-like cleavage site unique to SARS-CoV-2, we characterized additional amino acid residues, positioned within the crown of the spike (S) glycoprotein, under diversifying selection along the ancestral lineage of currently circulating pandemic strains, and affecting enhanced ability to infect host cells. Molecular dynamic simulations revealed long-range covariant movements of SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein monomer in pre-fusion conformation with furin cleavage, and residue T333, under purifying selection, hinge of such movement. Evolutionary analysis revealed that the current human lineage likely emerged after a recombination event between ancestors in bat and pangolin. Recombination impacted residues located in the binding receptor region of S glycoprotein, identical to pangolin ancestor. Interestingly, several recombination hotspots were detected throughout the genome, with the exception of the S glycoprotein, which exhibits a coldspot in the N terminal region, possibly the result of negative selection against changes that may reduce its optimal fitness.</rel_abs>
