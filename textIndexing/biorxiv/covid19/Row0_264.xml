    <rel_abs>The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global public health concern due to relatively easy person-to-person transmission and the current lack of effective antiviral therapy. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis remain largely unknown. We exploited an integrated proteomics approach to systematically investigate intra-viral and virus-host interactomes for the identification of unrealized SARS-CoV-2 host targets and participation of cellular proteins in the response to viral infection using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from COVID-19 patients. Using this approach, we elucidated 251 host proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 and more than 200 host proteins that are significantly perturbed in COVID-19 derived PBMCs. From the interactome, we further identified that non-structural protein nsp9 and nsp10 interact with NKRF, a NF-[Kcy]B repressor, and may precipitate the strong IL-8/IL-6 mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils and overexuberant host inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients. Our integrative study not only presents a systematic examination of SARS-CoV-2-induced perturbation of host targets and cellular networks to reflect disease etiology, but also reveals insights into the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers cytokine storms and represents a powerful resource in the quest for therapeutic intervention.</rel_abs>
