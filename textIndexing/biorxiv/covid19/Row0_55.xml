    <rel_abs>Abstract Objective: To screen out COVID-19 patients in entrying population from abroad with the minimum number of nucleic acid testing (NAT). Methods: In the first stage, the nasopharyngeal swab samples of the entrying population are numbered and grouped. After the samples in the group are mixed together, one NAT was performed. When the test result is negative, it shows that all of the peple in the group are not infected and the test for the group is complete. On the contrary, when the test result is positive, the group enters the second stage. In the second stage, all samples in the positive group will be tested one by one using the NAT. Results: The advantages and precautions of the method were discussed. The incidence rate of entrying population is the determinant of the number of samples in the group. The lower the incidence rate, the larger the number of samples in the group, and the greater the percentage saved. Conclusion: The method has obvious efficiency and cost advantages in COVID-19 testing. It can also be used to screen other populations such as community populations, high risk of infection populations. Key words: COVID-19, NAT, nucleic acid testing, screening, nasopharyngeal swab</rel_abs>
