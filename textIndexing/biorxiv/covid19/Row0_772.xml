    <rel_abs>European healthcare systems face extreme pressure from COVID-19. We estimate such pressure by relating both country-specific accumulated COVID-19 deaths (intensity-approach) and active COVID-19 cases (magnitude-approach) to measures of healthcare system capacity: hospital beds, healthcare workers and healthcare expenditure. On March 25, 2020 - relative to Italy on March 11- we found Spain, The Netherlands and France to experience the highest pressure using the intensity-approach with a composite measure for healthcare capacity.
