    <rel_abs>Several French regions where COVID19 has been reported currently show a renewed increase in ILI cases in the general practice based Sentinelles network. Here we computed the number of excess cases by region and found correlation with the number of reported COVID19 cases so far. These data suggest larger circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in the French population than apparent from confirmed cases.</rel_abs>
