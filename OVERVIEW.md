# Overview of the OpenVirus project
This document: https://github.com/petermr/openVirus/blob/master/OVERVIEW.md

***particularly relevant to the EU Hackathon this weekend.***

# Vision
Everyone , **not just experts**, wants and needs access to the scientific/medical literature. 
This project makes it simple. We provide quick methods of finding millions of relevant documents and extracting the relevant knowledge.
And making it useful
an play a small 
## EU Hackathon

We've entered a team "ContentMine" for the EU hackathon (2020-04-24:26)on COVID. Team "ContentMine" under http://euvsvirus.org. We believe that our community and its resources can play a small part in this great effort. This document reflects our offering at 2020-04-21 Our system (ContentMine's `getpapers` and `AMI`. The hackathom will generate questions to answer, create and share resources, make personal connections. 
# Methodology
**To download large amounts of Open publications, unify the semantics, filter, annotate, re-use, reaggregate, compute**
More specifically:
* find a number of Open sources (repositories, publishers, theses, NGO gray literature, government pubklications, etc.)
* build crawler/readers for these and translate into universal form (JATS, originally from NIH) widely used in biomedical publications). 
* add semantics so machines can understand the articles.
* search and annotate with a large number of bespoke dictionaries (word liswe ts)
* link everything (bibliography, annotations) to Wikidata

# Non-EN language
We believe there are mnany vital documents not in English. Countries which have suffered epidemics have experience of healthcare and social behaviour which will be critically useful to the world. The Western publishing industry and many in academia often regard non-EN as of minor importance and do not index it.
We wish to explore non-EN resources, such as HAL (FR) and the ES/PT resources in Latin America (Redalyc) . We believe that the basic infrastructure is Unicode-friendly. Wikidata can be used to equivalence terms in many languages. The large NaturalLanguageProcessing packages (e.g. OpenNLP) have support for DE, FR, ES, PT and several more.
We are particularly keen to engage with non-EN citizens who may have national resources of value. 
We welcome volunteers who can take this forward.

# Goals
We want to know **your** problems, to see how the literature can help. Two existing examples:
* **Experience of humans tissue samples and surfaces.**
A collaborator asks:

* **Efficacy of masks.**

# Our Unique Points
This is not a search system like Google or commercial scientific searches. It's a wrapper round several major repositories, some of which are'nt used enough
## Automation
Most search systems give you a list of hits you have to click through. We automate the clicking, up to thousands of hits so you can asks complex questions and either get immediate sample resuts or run queries in the background.
