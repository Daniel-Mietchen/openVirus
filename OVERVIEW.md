# Overview of the OpenVirus project

***particularly relevant to the EU Hackathon this weekend.***

# Vision
Everyone , **not just experts**, wants access to the scientific literature. We hide the complexity and provide simple quick methods of finding millions of relevant documents. Our system (ContentMine's `getpapers` and `AMI`.  
# Methodology
# Goals
We want to know **your** problems, to see how the literature can help. Two existing examples:
* **Experience of humans tissue samples and surfaces.**
* **Efficacy of masks.**

# Our Unique Points
This is not a search system like Google or commercial scientific searches. It's a wrapper round several major repositories, some of which are'nt used enough
## Automation
Most search systems give you a list of hits you have to click through. We automate the clicking, up to thousands of hits so you can asks complex questions and either get immediate sample resuts or run queries in the background.
