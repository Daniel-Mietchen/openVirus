First "blog" post on OpenVirus
------------------------------

I used to have a blog on the Cambridge Chemistry web server but I tailed off 2 years ago about 13 years of blogging - some chemistry, some 
polemics about Open Publishing. Suuprt for new equitable models of publishing and much criticism of current scholarship. I coined
the term "Publisher-Academic Complex" to describe how academia and the publishing industry fuel each other in a narrow
self-centered relationship which disadvantages citizens. That is still the case, maybe even worse.
