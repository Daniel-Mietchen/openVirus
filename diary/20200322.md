First "blog" post on OpenVirus
------------------------------

I used to have a blog on the Cambridge Chemistry web server but I tailed off 2 years ago about 13 years of blogging - some chemistry, some 
polemics about Open Publishing. Suuprt for new equitable models of publishing and much criticism of current scholarship. I coined
the term "Publisher-Academic Complex" to describe how academia and the publishing industry fuel each other in a narrow
self-centered relationship which disadvantages citizens. That is still the case, maybe even worse.


Knowledge is key to our current world, and much of its generation is publicy funded. That should be available to you, the 
citizen, but it isn't. For example:

* 85% of the articles published by Taylor and Francis journals are closed. Unless you're in a rich University to have to pay about 40 uSD.
* A paper in 1983 predicted the Ebola outbreak in Liberia. But it was paywalled and obscure. The Liberian Government was outraged.
