First "blog" post on OpenVirus
------------------------------

I used to have a blog on the Cambridge Chemistry web server but I tailed off 2 years ago about 13 years of blogging - some chemistry, some 
polemics about Open Publishing. Suuprt for new equitable models of publishing and much criticism of current scholarship. I coined
the term "Publisher-Academic Complex" to describe how academia and the publishing industry fuel each other in a narrow
self-centered relationship which disadvantages citizens. That is still the case, maybe even worse.


Knowledge is key to our current world, and much of its generation is publicy funded. That should be available to you, the 
citizen, but it isn't. For example:

* 85% of the articles published by Taylor and Francis journals are closed. Unless you're in a rich University to have to pay about 40 uSD.
* A paper in 1983 predicted the Ebola outbreak in Liberia. But it was paywalled and obscure. The Liberian Government was outraged. 

Yes, We Were Warned About Ebola

By Bernice Dahn, Vera Mussah and Cameron Nutt

    April 7, 2015
    
https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/opinion/yes-we-were-warned-about-ebola.html
   
This is a major part of the philosophy of this site - that there is vital knowledge already out there. All we have to do is
find it and reuse it. And get past publisher paywalls.

Design
------

The idea is simple. If we search the literature for articles containing the words

* "Liberia" "Gambia" "Sierra Leone" and also
* "Ebola" "Marburg" (highly infective viruses)

Then we would have located this paper.

It's as simple as that.

## Tweets
Todays tweets. Is there a better way of scraping them?

TBF, I can see the json format being useful too (e.g. I could use it right away without having to deal with harvesting and converting full texts - which reflects my skill levels :-). But less so to fit in an existing workflow around html/xml.

Yes,
It's horribly fragmented (sigh - 2m distance)
EuropePMC is so wonderful by comparison. If I use CORD19 I shall convert it into a useful format.

For your use case, you should be able to replace the PMC subset from EuropePMC. The Elsevier subset should also be available from PMC/EuropePMC at some point in the near future, as I understand. Which leaves the remaining WHO records and the bioRxiv/medRxiv ones?

We wasted 2 months. Friday RT-PCR instruments form Uni labs sent to test centres.
We could have been abreast of Covid19, rather than 2 deadly weeks behind.
More like political idiocy, than lack of will.

Indeed, the full-text subsets (fragmented according to license, sigh) comprise 29K papers, the metadata file has metadata for 44K. 

My interpretation is that the 44K is for total sourced from the diverse sources, of which a subset is available for full-text download/TDM.

All academic disciplines are relevant to COVID19. When a academic wakes up s/he shold say "what can I and my discipline do that saves lives?"
And let's measure value by public contribution, not citations.

Aparna Nair @DisabilityStor1
Seeing privileged people in academia talk about productivity at a time like this is breathtaking. 
I‚Äôm worried my severely immunocompromised parents in India will contract COVID. 
That I won‚Äôt get to see them. 
Care for them. 
That the worst might happen. 
Get a grip, PLEASE.

unlikely, given how capitalism operates (exploiting the masses for the benefit of the few) that the situation we find ourselves in could hve been prevented. we could tho have anticipated it & put the necessary health care provisions in place thus negating the economic shut down.

Very useful link about how NYers are walking in isolation
Q to #cambridge people: Are there things we could wear or gestures that show we are takling self-isolation seriously.
E.g wearing plastic gloves would be a good sign we cared.

Richard Horton knows what he is talking about.
We should have acted in January and the government (and to some extend the BBC Kuensberg) have failed us.
People will die. Just look at the graphs for Italy. We're no different

richard horton @richardhorton1
It said it took a study from Imperial to understand the likely burden of COVID-19 on the NHS. But read the first paper we published on COVID-19 on Jan 24. 32% admitted to ITU with 15% mortality. We have wasted 7 weeks. This crisis was entirely preventable. theguardian.com/world/2020/mar‚Ä¶

"the science was there in January"
Yes. I'm not an epidemiologist but I understood this then. I trusted that the Government was doing the right thing. 
I wrote publicly when it was clear they weren't

richard horton @richardhorton1
Laura Kuenssberg says (BBC) that, ‚ÄúThe science has changed.‚Äù This is not true. The science has been the same since January. What has changed is that govt advisors have at last understood what really took place in China and what is now taking place in Italy. It was there to see.

Really important posts from @richardhorton1 (unthreaded). The UK cold have stopped the epidemic if they's started in January.
This delay is inexcusable.
It may well mean the difference between life and death for me.

richard horton @richardhorton1
The morning after the dramatic change in strategy to COVID-19 by this govt, I can‚Äôt help but feel angry that it has taken almost two months for politicians and even ‚Äúexperts‚Äù to understand the scale of the danger from SARS-CoV-2. Those dangers were clear from the very beginning.

B/ These post_COVID publishers flourish because 
* scientists want to publish 
* citizens want knowledge
* citizens are increasingly becoming authors and researchers
* public and philianthropic funders realise the value.
Current megapublishers cannot react to these requirements

The leading post-COVID publisher is @Wikimedia 
They have been followed by the #preprints communities

I agree,
Their whole machine is now automated and hardwired into owning content.
It's a revolution like Wapping for printing. I guess they do not even understand what we are saying. I am probably dismissed as a pirate.

Which is more important?
a) That we honour copyright in a narrow defensive fashion and protect the publishing industry.
b) we liberate knowledge in a 21st century form?.
