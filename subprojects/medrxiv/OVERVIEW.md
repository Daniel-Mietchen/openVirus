# medrxiv search tool

## Purpose
To search `medrxiv` , download the hits, and search locally with dictionaries.
To create indexes of articles using dictionaries.

## Benefits
Most citizens do not know of Medrxiv, and certainly not how to search it.
Many scientists will still click through hits one-by-one.

## Timeline
Can we do this and share the news at https://csvconf.com? May 13-14?

# Plan

To build a chain of tools customised for citizens to:
* search `medriv` using their webpage
* download a few hundred hits
* translate PDF to structured form. (might cache this?)
* index with `amidict` s
* analyze and display using `R` or `D3` or similar tools.
* promote the results.
