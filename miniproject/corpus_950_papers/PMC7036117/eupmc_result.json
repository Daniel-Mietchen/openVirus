    "Dengue is an arboviral febrile illness endemic in many tropical and subtropical regions with frequent epidemics. Although most cases are self-limiting, progression into dengue haemorrhagic fever can have dire outcomes. The course can also be complicated by infrequent occurrence of unusual clinical manifestations which are increasingly recognized. We describe the case of a 16-year-old previously healthy girl diagnosed with dengue, who went on to develop severe ischaemic-type central chest pain towards the end of the critical phase of dengue haemorrhagic fever. Urgent investigation revealed acute ST-segment elevations in the high lateral leads of a surface electrocardiogram which completely reverted to normal within 2 hours, associated with elevated cardiac biomarkers but normal findings on transthoracic 2D echocardiography. She was managed with high-dose statins, nitrates, and pain relievers and made an uneventful recovery without any further episodes. The possible explanation for the presentation was focal myocarditis leading to coronary artery spasms."
