To elucidate routes of ZIKV dissemination in the MRT, we here generate microRNA-targeted ZIKV clones that lose the infectivity for (1) the cells inside seminiferous tubules of the testis, or (2) epithelial cells of the epididymis. We trace ZIKV dissemination in the MRT using an established mouse model of ZIKV pathogenesis. Our results support a model in which ZIKV infects the testis via a hematogenous route, while infection of the epididymis can occur via two routes: (1) hematogenous/lymphogenous and (2) excurrent testicular. Co-targeting of the ZIKV genome with brain-, testis-, and epididymis-specific microRNAs restricts virus infection of these organs, but does not affect virus-induced protective immunity in mice and monkeys. These defined alterations of ZIKV tropism represent a rational design of a safe live-attenuated ZIKV vaccine.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">The mechanisms of ZIKV persistence in the male reproductive tract (MRT) are poorly understood.

This resulted in only modest non-specific attenuation compared with a parental virus (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

However, in our study escape mutant analysis was an important tool to precisely map ZIKV spreading routes within the MRT. It appears that the emergence of the escape mutants is a stochastic process that likely depends upon individual and temporal variations in the level of expression of a specific miRNA and the efficiency of interactions of the miRNA silencing machinery with targets inserted into the virus. Thus, suboptimal levels of expression of specific miRNA in a given cell and a prolonged access of the virus to that cell can favor the emergence of escape mutants.</p><p id="Par25">Similar to infection with natural ZIKV isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, the 2&#x000d7;scr virus replication in the mouse testis appeared to be a biphasic process (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Testicular infection with the 2&#x000d7;scr virus during early viremic phase was initiated within the interstitial compartment, which contains blood and lymphatic vessels, implicating the hematogenous/lymphogenous virus spread. The second phase of infection coincided with extensive 2&#x000d7;scr replication in virtually all types of cells comprising the seminiferous tubules (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). This suggests that, during spread from the interstitium, the virus switched host cells and began to efficiently replicate in accessible Sertoli cells and spermatogonia with subsequent infection of other germ cells.

In both organs, virus replication appeared to be a biphasic process. The first phase coincided with virus infection of the interstitial compartment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>), whereas the second phase was associated with infection of the epididymal epithelium (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>).

A biphasic profile of 2&#x000d7;scr replication in both organs of the murine MRT suggests that the virus encountered a structural tissue barrier (such as the peritubular myoid cells and/or basal lamina) which slowed down its dissemination, and/or switched the host cells to replicate more efficiently. This may explain a high variability of 2&#x000d7;scr titers during transition between the two phases of replication (6&#x02013;9 dpi for testis, 6 dpi for epididymis).</p><p id="Par27">We showed that insertion of targets for testis-specific mir-202&#x02013;5p (and mir-465a-3p) selectively inhibited the late phase of ZIKV replication in the testis, when the virus gained access to the cells residing within the seminiferous tubules, but not the first phase when the virus was seeding the testicular interstitium by hematogenous/lymphogenous route (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). These observations are consistent with the abundant expression of mir-202&#x02013;5p in the cells comprising the seminiferous tubules, including Sertoli cells, spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, but not in the cells residing in the interstitium (including those of a hematopoietic origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>). Despite relatively high level of expression in the testis, targeting of ZIKV for mir-449a-5p did not affect accumulation of 2&#x000d7;449a(T) in this organ. Analysis of published data indicated that, compared to other testis-expressed miRNAs used in our study, mir-449a-5p is the least expressed in spermatogonia (but not in spermatocytes and spermatids) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.

If we assume that ZIKV infects the epididymis exclusively via the excurrent ducts from infected testis, then the inhibition of ZIKV replication in the testis should have slowed down or prevented the infection of the epididymal epithelium. However, reduced replication of the Te-2&#x000d7;202(T)-stb virus in the testis was not associated with a comparable reduction of Te-2&#x000d7;202(T)-stb titer in the mouse epididymis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Moreover, deletions that were detected in the Te-2&#x000d7;202(T)-mut virus isolated from the testis were not detected in the virus isolated from epididymis of the same mice at 12 dpi (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). These findings strongly suggest that ZIKV can disseminate to the epididymis by another route, most likely hematogenous/lymphogenous, followed by replication in the interstitium (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>) and subsequent infection of the epididymal epithelium, a cell type that was predominantly infected at 12 dpi (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4j</xref>).</p><p id="Par29">To inhibit a hematogenous route of ZIKV dissemination we selected mir-141&#x02013;3p, which is specifically expressed in epididymal epithelium. Despite its inability to infect epididymal epithelium, the 2&#x000d7;141(T) attained a titer in the epididymis similar to 2&#x000d7;scr. This suggests that ZIKV can be transported to this organ from the testis, which could occur simultaneously with the hematogenous/lymphogenous dissemination. Therefore, we reasoned that: (1) a simultaneous co-targeting for mir-202&#x02013;5p and mir-141&#x02013;3p should result in a significant reduction of ZIKV load in the epididymis; (2) if the epididymal infection is restricted by the presence of targets for mir-141&#x02013;3p, then escape mutations in mir-202&#x02013;5p targets, which sporadically occur in the testis, should be detected in the epididymis. Both these predictions were corroborated experimentally using viruses simultaneously expressing targets for mir-202&#x02013;5p and mir-141&#x02013;3p (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Moreover, using various target combinations for different testis- and epididymis- specific miRNAs, we showed that attenuation of the 2&#x000d7;202/141(T) in the epididymis was not an unique event, but was a common consequence of simultaneous restrictions of both hematogenous/lymphogenous and excurrent testicular routes of infection by dual miRNA targeting (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>).</p><p id="Par30">Restriction of individual dissemination routes for viruses 2&#x000d7;202(T) (testicular) or 2&#x000d7;141(T) (hematogenous) suggests, that compared with 2&#x000d7;scr, there should have been some reduction in the titer of each of these viruses in epididymis. However, this was not detected in our experiments. We speculate that variation between viral titer in the epididymis of different mice at 12 dpi was substantially greater compared with relatively small differences (twofolds), which are expected owing to a restriction of each of the two dissemination &#x000a0;routes. Also, considering that ZIKV reaches maximum titer in the epididymis slightly faster than in testis, we think that restriction of hematogenous pathway by mir-141&#x02013;3p targeting would have more pronounced effect on attenuation of the 2&#x000d7;141(T) virus in the epididymis, if it was assessed during earlier times post infection (6 or 9 dpi) compared with that observed at 12 dpi.</p><p id="Par31">In the context of vaccine research, evaluation of the &#x0201c;worst case scenario&#x0201d; outcomes of ZIKV infection using immunodeficient AG129 model can ensure vaccine safety for all recipients, whose immunological status could be unknown. However, the reliance on this model to study pathogenesis of ZIKV could generate results that might not be fully relevant for an immunocompetent host whose cells might be less permissive to infection. Obviously, ZIKV infection and dissemination in human testis and epididymis remains to be fully elucidated. It would be, therefore, important to evaluate ZIKV dissemination routes in the MRT of non-human primates (NHPs) or in the MRT of recently developed immunocompetent hSTAT2 KI mice using mouse adapted strain of ZIKV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Interestingly, viral dissemination between testis and epididymis of NHPs was demonstrated for another sexually transmitted pathogen&#x02014;simian immunodeficiency virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, suggesting that this route of spreading could be utilized by ZIKV in primates as well. ZIKV has also been detected in the semen of vasectomized men<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> and mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> implicating vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and the prostate as important organs potentially contributing to ZIKV shedding into semen. Future work should be focused on understanding of a relative contribution of the individual MRT organs to the ZIKV infectivity, persistence, and sexual transmission. The miRNA-targeting approach for restriction of ZIKV replication in each component of the MRT individually, and viruses with altered tissue tropisms described here, represent valuable experimental tools to address these and other outstanding questions regarding ZIKV infection of the MRT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par32">The major concern of the miRNAs co-targeting approach for live virus vaccine development continues to be the emergence of escape mutants that are resistant to miRNA-mediated inhibition and the potential for virus reversion to a virulent phenotype.

The most effective ZIKV suppression in the MRT was achieved when two target cassettes for testis- and epididymis-specific miRNAs (mir-141&#x02013;3p and mir-202&#x02013;5p) were inserted into two genome regions (dCGR and 3&#x02032;NCR) of the C/3&#x02032;NCR-mir(T) virus (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This simultaneous miRNA co-targeting of ZIKV genome resulted in improved genetic stability and restricted virus replication in both, the testis and epididymis. In contrast, the deletion-based strategy to attenuate ZIKV, which has been widely used for the development of other live-attenuated flavivirus vaccines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, did not have an effect on specific ZIKV tissue tropism.
