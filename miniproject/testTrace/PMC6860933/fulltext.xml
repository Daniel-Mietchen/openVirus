In Tigray, retreatment cases (aOR, 0.29; 95% CI: 0.16&#x02013;0.53) and MDR-TB cases (aOR, 0.31; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.27) were less likely to show treatment success. However,, HIV co-infected TB cases (aOR, 3.58; 95% CI: 2.47, 5.18) were more likely to show treatment success compared with unknown HIV status. In Zigong, women with MDR TB (aOR, 0.90; 95%CI: 0.24, 0.34) were less likely to show treatment success and women in the age category of 15&#x02013;49 (aOR, 1.55; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.206) were more likely to show treatment success.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Big number of tuberculosis cases and death were observed in Tigray comparing with Zigong.

The gender difference in tuberculosis infection was not well understood. Nevertheless, TB kills more women annually than all the causes of maternal mortality combined [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In recent times, every year, at least 3.5 million women and children develop active TB among these 1.2 million cases died and more were left severely disabled [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Globally implementation of Direct observed treatment [DOTs] were saved 2.2 million of women and children [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] however there are enormous difference on the number of life saved and its factors affecting among regions. Few reports and studies attempts to compare and display the regional difference but the majorities were crude. For instance, WHO categorize Ethiopia and China among high TB burden countries [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. But, its prevalence and treatment success reports were not specific for this group only inform about general population. Thus, the prevalence for Ethiopia was 192/100,000 and 67/100,000 was for China [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219230.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and the treatment success rate was 89% for Ethiopia and 94% for China [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In 2010, there was a regional report from high TB burden countries and out of 22 countries only 10 countries report contain specific data about women and children that time China notified a total of 869 092 TB cases out of this 17% were women and 0.8% were children [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and Ethiopia notified a total of 150, 221 TB cases yet the size for women and children were not specified [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219230.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Tigray which found in Northern part of Ethiopia [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in 2015 notified a total 9,594 TB cases of both sex to a national TB control program. Accordingly 2,043 (21%) were smear positive with the cure rate of 74% (1,235) and 344 (4.2%) TB cases were died [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Zigong which is located in southeastern Sichuan and which is home of large number of TB cases [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219230.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in 2015 notified 1738 TB cases and among this 399(22%) were smear positive with the cure rate of 385 (96%) and among total 22(1.2%) cases were died.</p><p>Factors which identified as causes of unsuccessful treatment outcome for general population were retreatment cases, HIV co-infection, TB type and age in which repeatedly mentioned. However, this factors may not be found equally in all regions [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, the evidence narrated in the above was not indicating the burden of TB in women specifically this implies that the existing study results and reports were crude. Thus, majority countries this time they lack specific proof which shows level of treatment outcomes and its factor affecting among these vulnerable group.</p><p>Declaring the above reasons, re-examining and comparing age and sex-aggregate data maintained by TB programs of these countries will be worth enough to look the profile, burden, treatment success and its factors affecting with in women. Moreover, finding of this study will help in tackling the limitation, shearing experience between countries and devise strategy to improve TB prevention and treatment program.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Study settings and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Tigray region</title><p>This study was conducted in Tigray (Ethiopia) and Zigong (China). Ethiopia is located in the Horn of Africa and is bordered by Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Eritrea, and Djibouti. Administratively, Ethiopia is divided into nine regional states and two city administrative councils. The current population size was estimated 100 million[<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219230.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].Tigray is one of the nine national regional states of Ethiopia which is bordered by Eritrea in north and Sudan in the west. The region is administratively divided into seven Zones and 52 districts.</p><p>In 2010 among total population 2,441,158 (50.7%) were females with the total fertility rate of 5.1, agriculture is the main means of subsistence in the region in which 85% of the population lives in rural area.</p><p>In this region health care services are delivered through one specialized hospital, 15 general hospitals, 20 primary hospitals, 204 health centers, 712 health posts [village clinic] and 500 private health facilities. Then, in the region a total of 8,279 health professionals founds and 226[2.7%] were doctors [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In Ethiopia Directly Observed Treatment (DOTS) was started in 1992 as a pilot and currently achieves 100 percent geographical coverage and recently 92% of public hospitals and health centers offer DOTS [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].The role of health facility in TB prevention and control was not centralized that means all hospitals and majority of health centers which have the diagnostic technology are allowed to diagnosis TB and providing DOTs service[<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219230.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219230.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Though, the role of health posts (village clinics) was limited only they provide health education, refer TB suspects for investigation and collect sputum smears, retrieve absentees/defaulters and in few place they can provide DOTs for case who is very far from health institution[<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Zigong region</title><p>China&#x02019;s National TB control Program started to implement the international recommended directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) strategy in 1991, and expanded the DOTS program to the entire country by 2005 [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Zigong is found in south-west China Sichuan province and currently this county has a total population 3.28 million. The existing health care system was organized into a three-tier health care delivery system and tuberculosis control program is centralized. Thus, the basic unit of TB health care is the specialized County TB dispensary (CTD) with the responsibilities of TB diagnosis, treatment and patient management guided by the National TB control program[<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].Whereas, the non-CTD&#x02019;s role in TB control program is to refer suspected TB patients to CTDs [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] all patient took anti TB drug three times per week [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and DOTs observers get paid 60 Yuan (US$1 &#x02248;CNY7) per TB patient for the standardized treatment regimen of &#x02265;6 months [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The recommended treatment regimen for new TB case and retreated TB cases were the same 2HRZS/4HR and 2HRZSE/6HRE [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Study design, sampling technique and data collection</title><p>Using retrospective cross-sectional study design we reviewed all form of TB cases of women treated in the years of January 2007 to December 2016 in both countries. In Tigray DOTs was not centralized. Hence, all health facilities are allowed to diagnosis TB and provide DOTs. In Zigong DOTs services were centralized and it is provided only in specific government assigned health facility. In Tigray TB patient information was found in log book registered manually whereas in Zigong it was found in digital and manual form. Hence, considering the logistic constraint in Tigray among 16 hospitals eight hospitals that provide DOTs service for ten years and above were randomly selected then trained data collectors and supervisors were assigned to collect the information. Nonetheless, in Zigong there were only six TB treatment centers and information about TB patients were found in digital form. Thus, all data&#x02019;s was extracted from the Excel sheet. Since, sample was fully anonym zed before we accessed and patient informed consent was waved.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Data analysis</title><p>After checking the completeness, data was entered and analyzed using SPSS Version 21. Then, descriptive analysis such as frequency, mean and standard deviation were computed and compared. Additionally, binary logistic regression was executed to examine the association of independent variable with unsuccessful treatment outcomes. Hence, P-value less than of 0.05 was used as significant value. Finally, variables significant in binary logistic regression were analyzed again using multiple logistic regressions to identify variables which augment unsuccessful treatment outcomes in women and children.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Ethical clearance</title><p>The study was passed through the ethical approval procedure of Sichuan University College of public health Chengdu, China and C152 HS/IRB of Mekelle University Ethiopia.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec012"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Socio demographic and clinical characteristic of women</title><p>The past ten years (January 2007- December2016) in Tigray a total of 13,435 and in Zigong 18,423 TB cases were identified.

affects economically active young adults [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219230.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Thus, women of reproductive age are more likely to develop active TB if they encounter TB bacteria and they are less likely to seek help for TB symptoms than men [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In this study the mean age of TB case in Tigray was 36 years with SD&#x000b1;15 and in Zigong was 44years with SD&#x000b1;17. Tigray finding was similar with study done in sidama and Gojjam for general population [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219230.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. But, comparing with Zigong more younger women were get infected in Tigray than Zigong and this could be; the age distributions tuberculosis in Africa has been severely skewed by the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], under nutrition was a major public health problems in Tigray and it has considerable effect in provoking tuberculosis infection [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219230.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and the demographic structural difference between this two country may be other cause large number of old peoples were found in Zigong than Tigray.</p><p>In 2014, globally TB killed 480,000 women [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Correspondingly, in this retrospective study a total of 170 [6%] women in Tigray and 36 [0.8%] in Zigong were died. The death toll in Tigray was higher than the annual report of the Regional Health Bureau for both sex 3.6% [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], retrospective study done in Gojjam for both sex 3.7% and global report of TB death for women and children 4.2% [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219230.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219230.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In cases of Zigong it is similar with the global report for general population [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Comparing with Zigong, more death occurred in Tigray. This difference could be the prevalence of TB/HIV co morbidity was high in sub-Saharan country[<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], poor health care seeking behavior of women in the region which leads to diagnostic delay [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and poor treatment adherence in high TB burden countries[<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] were in favor of high number of deaths in Tigray.</p><p>Treatment success is sum of patients cured and those who have completed treatment. Hence, patient compliance is a key factor in treatment success [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this study, the overall treatment success rate of all TB cases was 92% in Tigray and 96.6% in Zigong. The finding of Tigray was similar with studies done in west Gojjam, Sidama and Addis Ababa 91.5% [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219230.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219230.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] the success rate for both sex. But, higher than the WHO report 89% for both sex [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and the success of Zigong is higher than [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219230.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219230.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Thus, the better treatment success in both countries could be since these studies assess only women and this group have good treatment adherence as a result the percentage of treatment success was better comparing with general population.</p><p>A patient is considered &#x0201c;cured&#x0201d; when sputum smear examination is bacteriologically negative in the last month of treatment and on at least one previous occasion[<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].The cure rate for pulmonary positive cases was 90% in Tigray and 95% in Zigong. So, the finding of Tigray was slightly higher than 2015/16 annual report of the region and study done in west Gojjam [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219230.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219230.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] for general population. But, in case of Zigong it is similar with the WHO global report for Chinese population [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, the reason of less cure rate in Tigray comparing with Zigong could be; the presence of large number of TB/HIV co infected women in the region, high under nutrition level of the region and poor consistency sputum test result of the region were made Tigray region to show less cure rate than Zigong.</p><p>Retreatment case is patient who has been treated for one month or more with anti-TB drugs in the past[<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and many studies indicate that re treatment case have high chance of poor treatment outcome or failure rate. Similarly, in our study re-treatment cases were 79% less likely (adjusted OR, 0.29; 95% CI: 0.16&#x02013;0.53) to have treatment success compared to new cases and this finding was parallel with the study done in Gojjam, Sidama, Tigray and Uganda [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219230.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219230.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219230.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Yet, in Zigong it was not significant. The less treatment successes seen in the retreatment cases in Tigray could be the presence of high number of multidrug resistance TB in retreatment cases and late introduction of drug sensitivity test in the region made the cases to take anti TB drug without knowing there MDR status.</p><p>Globally, an estimated 3.3% of new TB cases and 20% of previously treated cases have MDR-TB [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In Ethiopia 2.7% of the new and 14% of the previously treated TB cases expected to have had rifampicin or multi drug resistant TB [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Report about MDR-TB started in 2011 in both countries. Then in Tigray total of 28(0.4%) MDR-TB cases were reported and majorities were identified in 2016 which is 16(3.7%) cases. Where as in Zigong 16 (0.3%) MDR-TB cases were identified.</p><p>According to global TB report only 50% of MDR-TB patients were successfully treated[<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. But in this study 6(85.7%) women out of 7 MDR TB cases in Tigray and 3 (23%) women out of 13 MDR TB cases in Zigong were not successfully treated. this is consistent with study done in India China and Ethiopia [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219230.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In both study area patients with drug resistant tuberculosis were less likely to have treatment success. In Tigray 69% less-likely (Adjusted OR, 0.31; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.27 and in Zigong 9% less likely (adjusted OR, 0.09; 95% CI: 0.024, 0.34 successful treatment outcome compared with non-drug resistant. But, comparing with Zigong high percentage of women in Tigray were less likely to show treatment success this could be; in Tigray MDR TB diagnoses took long time because the diagnostic center was found only in the capital city, MDR TB patient remain without treatment for long time until the result arrive and the long-term treatment ended many women with adverse effect this all might made the outcome poor and many studies support this finding [<xref rid="pone.0219230.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219230.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Evidence presented in this study shows tuberculosis was one of the major public health concerns for women in both countries. However, poor level of treatment success and high mortality were seen in Tigray compared with Zigong. Besides, factors boost unsuccessful treatment outcome were many in case of Tigray than in Zigong. Hence, national health policy makers of Ethiopia and Tigray regional health office should give due attention to this specific group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0219230.s001"><label>S1 Data Set</label><caption><p>(SAV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0219230.s001.sav"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0219230.s002"><label>S2 Data Set</label><caption><p>(SAV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0219230.s002.sav"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Sichuan University and Mekelle University for guiding me.

You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1: Retrospective analysis of cohorts in two countries were made and data was analyzed. Following points were highlighted during the review:</p><p>Author&#x02019;s appreciation </p><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for careful and thorough reading of this manuscript and for the thoughtful comments and constructive suggestions, which help to improve the quality of this manuscript. Our response follows (the reviewer&#x02019;s comments are in non-italic form). </p><p>1. Significant number of tuberculosis cases and death were observed in Tigray than Zigong region. Highlighting the shortcomings in implementation of TB program in northern part of Ethiopia </p><p>Dear reviewer: I add reasons to explain the short comings in implementation of TB program a Tigray region in each discussion. </p><p>2. Why, No data is available for TB-HIV co-morbid condition in Zigong region.</p><p>Dear reviewer: There was a separate registration form for TB-HIV co-morbid which was not allowed to access. I did many attempts with my professor to have the information but it was not possible. </p><p>3. Factors responsible to unsuccessful treatment outcome in Tigray need to be highlighted at large.</p><p>Dear reviewer: I highlighted many factors responsible to unsuccessful treatment outcome in the discussion part also</p><p>4. Factors responsible for less treatment success in Re-treatment cases needs to be highlighted also,</p><p>Dear reviewer: the reason I highlighted is &#x0201c;The less treatment successes seen in the retreatment cases in Tigray could be the presence of high number of multidrug resistance TB in retreatment cases and with late introduction of drug sensitivity test in the region made the cases to take anti TB drug without knowing there MDR status. </p><p>5. In Line 75,76 stating the lacunae of the study outcomes; Thus, globally this time we lack specific proof which shows level of treatment outcomes and its factor affecting in these vulnerable group:</p><p>Dear reviewer: Many of the study compare men treatment outcome with women. But, there are very few studies which try to compare the treatment outcome among women. Hence, based on this I considered as we luck specific proof which show the level of treatment outcome </p><p>6. Why only these two regions of these two countries are chosen for comparison, as the population, and other demographic conditions of these two countries are totally different. Reason needs to be provided. However, such study needs to be planned to highlight the lacunae in implementation of the national TB control programmer and to study successful treatment outcomes.</p><p>Dear reviewer: The main reason to chooses this regions were ,Tigray region which is located in northern part of Ethiopia has best performance in TB prevention and treatment program and Zigong has the least performance in TB prevention and treatment and little rural among Sichuan provinces. Therefore, select these regions will show as comparable level of treatment outcome of the country. </p><p>Reviewer #2: 1. Whether the study population was native to the said region or migrant population also there needs to be clarified</p><p>Dear reviewer: This study did not consider the cases weather it is migrant or non-migrant because this information was not found in the TB registration logbook of Tigray region where as in Zigong there is but the number of migrant cases is not as significant. </p><p>2. since the occupation of people from Tigray is mentioned. Same needs to be highlighted about the study subjects from Zigong. Also of any correlation is deduced from the same.</p><p>Dear reviewer: I did not mention any occupation in Tigray </p><p>3. Any positive family history of TB in study subjects should also been recorded.</p><p>Dear reviewer: Yes, it was good to record any positive family history. But, both registrations did not indicate any positive family history. Besides, there is column which indicates number of contacts person which used to trace contact weather they are infected or not. </p><p>4. It is mentioned that retreatment or MDR cases showed poor treatment success as compared to those with HIV confection needs to be elaborated upon.</p><p>Dear reviewer: Here is the sentence on line 257-259 which says , HIV co infected TB cases were 1.59 times more likely to have treatment success (95% CI: 2.47, 5.18) compared with Unknown HIV status. In the result part and the reason behind was while The TB/ HIV prevention and treatment guideline indicates that any TB case should be tested for HIV and linked to Pre-ART treatment. But, some TB patent reject the HIV testing offer and delay themselves to take correct treatment protocol as well some health facility forgot to offer the test and delay in linking to ART program this made them to show poor treatment outcome than those known HIV positives </p><p>________________________________________</p><p>6.
