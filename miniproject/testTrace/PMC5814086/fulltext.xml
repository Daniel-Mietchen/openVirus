Region of difference 9 (RD9)-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and spoligotyping was employed for the identification of the isolates at species and strain levels. The spoligotype patterns were entered into the SITVIT database to determine Octal and SIT (Spoligotyping International Typing) numbers for each strain.

In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO, 2016) estimated that 10.4million people developed TB and 1.4million died from it. In addition to the TB epidemic, drug resistant TB has become a global challenge. In 2015, the prevalence of MDR/RR-TB was 3.9% among new cases worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. African countries south of the Sahara, including Ethiopia, are heavily affected by TB. Along with 7 others from Africa, Ethiopia is one of the 30high burden countries for MDR-TB with an annual estimate of 3300 MDR/RR-TB among notified pulmonary cases in 2015 [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193083.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>At the molecular level, the global TB epidemic consists of multiple genotype-specific sub-epidemics resistant to the first line anti-TB drugs. Therefore, the knowledge of molecular epidemiology of MDR-TB is useful in supporting the TB surveillance and control program of countries. Early detection of drug resistant TB is critical to avoid further spread of the disease [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193083.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Nevertheless, data on the molecular epidemiology of drug-resistant TB is still scanty in Ethiopia with only few studies performed in selected regions of the country such as by Tesema <italic>et al</italic>. who recently reported on the molecular epidemiology and transmission dynamics of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> in northwest Ethiopia, and described the gene mutations associated with isoniazid and rifampicin resistance among <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> isolates [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193083.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, drug resistance appears to be on the rise. There is a pressing need for extensive surveillance and establishment of advanced diagnostic facilities for early detection and expansion of second line treatment centers to prevent MDR-TB transmission [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. According to the Federal Ministry of Health second national TB drug resistance survey report, the proportion of MDR-TB was2.3% of new cases; a significant increase from the first-round report of 1.6% [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In 2015, the estimate for MDR/RR-TB was 2.7% [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>A pilot study had previously been conducted to generate preliminary information on the drug sensitivity pattern of a small number of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> isolates from Ambo area [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Because that preliminary study could not provide conclusive information, additional data were needed for use by the TB control program in the area. The present study was conducted to investigate into the epidemiology of TB in and around Ambo Town and to evaluate the drug sensitivity pattern of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> strains isolated from pulmonary TB cases in the study area.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study settings</title><p>This cross-sectional study was conducted in and around Ambo Town, West Shoa Zone, central Ethiopia in Ambo Hospital, and in two nearby private health facilities (Agape Medium Clinic and Ambo Clinic). Ambo is located in the West Shoa Zone of the Oromia Region, west of Addis Ababa, Ambo Town has a latitude and longitude of 8&#x000b0;59&#x02032;N 37&#x000b0;51&#x02032;E and an elevation of 2101 meters. The study area includes the population in and around the major roadside urban center of Ambo town and the adjacent rural towns. Most of the diagnosis and all TB treatment in the area are provided through the DOTS TB clinics.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Study population</title><p>Between May 2014 and March 2015, a total of 105 newly diagnosed smear positive adult pulmonary TB patients who gave written informed consent were enrolled in the study. Socio demographic data and clinical information were collected by trained health professionals using a pre-tested standard questionnaire. Data on HIV (Human Immunodeficiency virus) status was obtained from health facility records. The participants were requested to give three sputum samples (spot-morning-spot). Sputum smears were prepared and examined by an experienced facility laboratory technologist on site. The reading was systematic and standardized to scan at least 100 high power fields before producing a negative result. Sputum samples from acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear positive patients were pooled individually into 50 ml sterile screw capped universal test tubes and stored at the diagnostic centers at -20&#x000b0;C for a maximum of five days until transported on a cold chain to the core laboratory at AHRI.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Mycobacterial culture</title><p>Egg based L&#x000f6;wenstein-Jensen -pyruvate and L&#x000f6;wenstein-Jensen -glycerol media were prepared according to standard procedure [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. All samples were processed and cultured using standard methods. Briefly, the sputum samples were decontaminated by equal volume of 4% sodium hydroxide solution for 15 minutes. The decontaminated samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded and a drop of phenol red solution was added into the supernatant as indicator and the sediment neutralized using 2N hydrochloric acid solution drop by drop. The sediment was inoculated into conventional L&#x000f6;wenstein-Jensen egg medium containing 0.6% sodium pyruvate and glycerol and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for at least 8 weeks, with weekly observation for the presence of mycobacterial colonies. Microscopic examination of the colonies was performed using Ziehl-Neelsen staining method. Colonies from AFB positive isolates were collected into two cryo vial. One vial was used to prepare heat killed cells for molecular typing with bacteria treated at 80&#x000b0;C in a sonicator water bath for one hour. The other vial was stored at -80&#x000b0;C in freezing medium until sub-cultured for drug sensitivity test (DST).</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Region of difference 9 (RD9)-based polymerase chain reaction</title><p>Heat killed cells were used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based deletion typing.

PCR amplification of the mixtures was performed using a Thermal Cycler according to standard procedures [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Briefly, the reaction mixture was prepared and DNA amplified with the cycling condition of 10 min of enzyme activation at 95&#x000b0;C, 1 min of denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C, 0.5 min of annealing at 55&#x000b0;C,2 min of extension at 72&#x000b0;C for, involving a total of 35 cycles, and a final extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. The product was electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gel in 1&#x000d7; triacetate- ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) running buffer. Ethidium bromide at a ratio of 1:10, 100 base pair (bp) DNA ladder, and orange 6&#x000d7; loading dye were used in gel electrophoresis and the gel was visualized using a Transilluminator (BIO RAD Laboratories Inc. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bio-rad.com">www.bio-rad.com</ext-link>).

The direct repeat (DR) region was amplified by a Thermal Cycler using oligonucleotides and primers derived from this region. The reaction mixture was amplified with PCR and the amplified product was hybridized to a set of 43 immobilized oligonucleotides, each corresponding to one of the unique spacer DNA sequences within the DR locus. After hybridization, the DNA was detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence and by exposure to X-ray film as specified by the manufacturer.

The four anti-TB drugs (Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Ethambutol and Streptomycin) were mixed with the media at the recommended concentration and dispensed into 9 wells of the 24 well tissue culture plates and two wells were dispensed with drug free media. A standardized bacterial suspension was prepared and 10&#x003bc;l of the prepared bacterial suspension was dispensed into each of the drug containing and one drug free media.

The findings enrich the pool of available data on the epidemiology and drug sensitivity pattern of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> in the country. Identity and clustering patterns of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> strains were identified by RD9-PCR and spoligotyping. All of the isolates from sputum (86) were <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> strains. The majority (66/86) of the isolates clustered into seven spoligotypes. Twenty spoligotypes were however unique consisting of only a single isolate each. According to the SITVIT database and spoligotyping International Typing (SIT) numbers the most prevalent shared types in the present study were SIT53 and SIT149. This is consistent with previous reports from Ethiopia. Belay <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported SIT53 and SIT149 among the pastoral communities in the Afar Region of Ethiopia. Likewise, SIT 53 was the most frequent spoligotype in Dilla, southern Ethiopia [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, SIT149 was reported to be the leading strain in Eastern Amhara [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The observation of a high degree of clustering and frequency of this <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> spoligotype in the study area could suggest the epidemiological importance of these strains.</p><p>Further characterization of the strains to families using SPOTCLUST software revealed the predominance of three families, namely T1, T3 and CAS. The occurrence and distribution of these families varies from region to region in Ethiopia. Garedew <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported a high proportion of T1 and T3 family strains in Debre Berhan, central Ethiopia. Mihret <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] reported a high proportion of T and CAS family strains in Addis Ababa while, Derbew <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] reported a higher prevalence of T family strains in the southern region of Ethiopia. T1 and CAS families have similarly been reported to be frequent in other African countries such as Tanzania and Uganda [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193083.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This indicates a possible broad distribution of these <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> strains in East Africa.</p><p>Drug resistance among newly diagnosed pulmonary TB cases is a good epidemiological marker to trace the transmission of drug resistant strains in the community [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193083.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In our study, the proportion of mono resistance to any one of the four drugs tested was 23.3%. This is relatively lower than in previous reports from different parts of the country [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For example, a relatively lower (18.4%) prevalence of mono resistance was reported by Abebe <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] from Jimma. Nevertheless, our finding is comparable with that of Seyoum <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] who reported 23%mono resistance from Eastern Ethiopia. The variation in overall prevalence of drug resistant TB among different study settings could be technical (such as due to variation in sample size, laboratory procedures, etc) and/or a true event (higher prevalence due to improper TB case management, delayed diagnosis, poor treatment follow up, poor treatment adherence and similar program failures).</p><p>In our study, the highest rate of monoresistance was observed against INH (4.7%). A relatively higher frequency of monoresistance to INH has been reported from Jimma (13.2%) and Eastern (9.5%) parts of the country [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193083.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Lower rates (2.8%) of INH mono resistance among new pulmonary TB cases has been reported from northwest Ethiopia [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. INH monoresistance recorded by the present study was comparable with those reported from other African countries such as Uganda (5.0%) [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and Nigeria (3.8%) [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The relatively high proportion of INH resistance in several of the sites in Ethiopia could be due to the history of use of INH in the national TB control program over several decades. This condition may result in higher prevalence of MDR-TB if rifampicin resistance increases in frequency. We identified only one case of resistance to rifampicin and this was a strain resistant to all drugs tested. There was no monoresistance to the drug in our study. Although rifampicin resistance appears to be infrequent in the Ambo region, as it was in several places in Ethiopia in the past [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], the frequency of any resistance to RIF (RR) appears to be on the rise in Ethiopia. The prevalence of MDR TB among newly diagnosed pulmonary TB patients was only 1.6% until a few years back when the estimate was upgraded to 2.3% following the second national drug resistance prevalence survey. This was mainly because of the low frequency of resistance against rifampicin despite a higher frequency of INH resistance in the country. A 2012 study from northwest Ethiopia reported zero prevalence of RIF mono resistance but an MDR rate of 5%among 214 <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> isolates from newly diagnosed pulmonary TB patients. Eight of the RR strains were also resistant to other anti-TB drugs (six to five, one to four and one to three) [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Relatively higher RIF monoresistance has been reported from southwestern and eastern parts of the country (0.7%, and 1.7% respectively) [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193083.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The reason for the low RIF mono resistance could be to the relatively recent introduction of RIF into the anti-TB regimen and restricted access to the drug except for anti-TB treatment essentially in a combined fixed dose formulation.</p><p>In this study, the prevalence of MDR-TB among newly diagnosed pulmonary TB cases was found to be lower than the national prevalence rate of 2.3%. Previous reports of MDR-TB among newly diagnosed pulmonary TB cases rangedfrom0%to 3.7% in different study settings [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193083.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193083.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193083.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The prevalence of MDR-TB varies over time and in different populations [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193083.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This could be due to differences in sample size, methodology, or due to some specific characteristics of the studied population. The other possible reason could be due to differences in TB control program effectiveness. Implementation of active TB case finding and DST that leads to early detection and effective treatment of MDR-TB cases might limit the emergence and/or spread of MDR strains.</p><p>In this study association between HIV infection and risk of acquiring MDR-TB was not addressed. In different studies, discordant findings have been reported. Mesfin <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis which concluded that a positive association was observed between HIV/AIDS and primary MDR-TB. In a similar review a positive association was observed between HIV infection and MDR-TB [<xref rid="pone.0193083.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In general, an association of anti-TB drug resistance development and HIV infection could be explained by the fact that people living with HIV may also be more likely to be exposed to MDR-TB patients, due to increased hospitalization in settings with poor infection control. The other possible reason could be poor treatment adherence because HIV/AIDS patients may be subjected to a combination of various regimens including ART resulting in adverse events and unwillingness to continue regular medication. This situation may lead to accumulation of drug resistant strains.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Conclusion and recommendation</title><p>This study provides the first evidence of genetic diversity of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> strains in the Ambo area of Central Ethiopia. The predominant strains circulating in the area seem to be similar to those dominant in different parts of the country (SIT53, SIT149, and SIT25; T1 family followed by T3 and CAS families). Although the prevalence of MDR-TB was low in this study, the high proportion of any resistance to first line drugs suggests that emergence of MDR-TB is probably delayed mainly because of the low resistance rate to rifampicin. This calls for close monitoring of drug resistance in health facilities with increased access to sensitivity testing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0193083.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Raw data.</title><p>(SAV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0193083.s001.sav"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Dr Zerihun Ejo and Dr H/Mariam Dendessa for participating in screening the study participants.
