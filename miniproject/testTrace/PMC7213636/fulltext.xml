With the spread of the epidemic, such cases have also been found in other parts of China and other countries. As an acute respiratory infectious disease, COVID-19 has been included in Class B infectious diseases prescribed in the Law of the People's Republic of China on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, and managed as an infectious disease of Class A. By taking a series of preventive control and medical treatment measures, the rise of the epidemic situation in China has been contained to a certain extent, and the epidemic situation has eased in most provinces, but the incidence abroad is on the rise. With increased understanding of the clinical manifestations and pathology of the disease, and the accumulation of experience in diagnosis and treatment, in order to further strengthen the early diagnosis and early treatment of the disease, improve the cure rate, reduce the mortality rate, avoid nosocomial infection as much as possible and pay attention to the spread caused by the imported cases from overseas, we revised the <italic>Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 6)</italic> to <italic>Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7)</italic>.</p><sec><title>I. Etiological Characteristics</title><p>The novel coronaviruses belong to the &#x003b2; genus. They have envelopes, and the particles are round or oval, often polymorphic, with diameter being 60 to 140 nm. Their genetic characteristics are significantly different from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Current research shows that they share more than 85% homology with bat SARS-like coronaviruses (bat-SL-CoVZC45). When isolated and cultured <italic>in vitro</italic>, the 2019-nCoV can be found in human respiratory epithelial cells in about 96 hours, however, it takes about 6 days for the virus to be found if isolated and cultured in Vero E6 and Huh-7 cell lines.</p><p>Most of the knowledge about the physical and chemical properties of coronavirus comes from the research on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The virus is sensitive to ultraviolet and heat. Exposure to 56&#x000b0;C for 30&#x0200a;minutes and lipid solvents such as ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peracetic acid, and chloroform can effectively inactivate the virus. Chlorhexidine has not been effective in inactivating the virus.</p></sec><sec><title>II. Epidemiological Characteristics</title><sec><title>1. Source of infection</title><p>Currently, the patients infected by the novel coronavirus are the main source of infection; asymptomatic infected people can also be an infectious source.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Route of transmission</title><p>Transmission of the virus happens mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact. There is the possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment for a long-time exposure to high concentrations of aerosol. As the novel coronavirus can be isolated in feces and urine, attention should be paid to feces or urine contaminated environment that may lead to aerosol or contact transmission.</p></sec><sec><title>3. Susceptible groups</title><p>People are generally susceptible.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>III. Pathological Changes</title><p>Pathologic findings from limited autopsies and biopsy studies are summarized below:</p><sec><title>1. Lungs</title><p>Variable consolidation is present in the lungs.</p><p>The alveoli are filled with fluid and fibrin with hyaline membrane formation. Macrophages and many multinucleated syncytial cells are identified within the alveolar exudates. Type II pneumocytes show marked hyperplasia and focal desquamation. Viral inclusions are observed in type II pneumocytes and macrophages. In addition, there is prominent edema and congestion in the alveolar septa which are infiltrated by monocytes and lymphocytes. Fibrin microthrombi are present. In more severely affected area, hemorrhage, necrosis, and overt hemorrhagic infarction are seen. Organization of alveolar exudates and interstitial fibrosis are also present.</p><p>Detached epithelial cell and mucus are present in the bronchi, sometimes mucus plugs are seen.</p><p>Hyperventilated alveoli, interrupted alveolar interstitium, and cystic formation are occasionally seen.</p><p>By electronic microscopy, cytoplasmic 2019-nCoV virions are observed in the bronchial epithelium and type II pneumocytes. Immunostain reveals 2019-nCoV viral immunoreactivity in some alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages and RT-PCR confirms the presence of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Spleen, hilar lymph nodes, and bone marrow</title><p>The spleen is markedly atrophic with a decreased number of lymphocytes. Focal hemorrhage and necrosis are present. Macrophages proliferation and phagocytosis are present in the spleen. Sparsity of lymphocytes and focal necrosis are noted in lymph nodes. CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> immunohistochemistry highlights a decreased number of T cells in the spleen and lymph nodes. Myelopoiesis is decreased in bone marrow.</p></sec><sec><title>3. Heart and blood vessels</title><p>Degenerated or necrosed myocardial cells are present, along with mild infiltration of monocytes, lymphocytes, and/or neutrophils in the cardiac interstitium. Shedding of endothelial cells, endovasculitis, and thrombi are seen in some blood vessels.</p></sec><sec><title>4. Liver and gall bladder</title><p>The liver is dark-red and enlarged. Degeneration and focal necrosis of hepatocytes are found, accompanied by infiltration of neutrophils. The sinusoids are congested. The portal areas are infiltrated by lymphocytes and histiocytes. Microthrombi are seen. The gallbladder is prominently distended.</p></sec><sec><title>5. Kidneys</title><p>The kidneys are remarkable for proteinaceous exudates in the Bowman's capsule around glomeruli, degeneration, and shedding of renal tubules epithelial cells, and hyaline casts. Microthrombi and fibrotic foci are found in the kidney interstitium.</p></sec><sec><title>6. Other organs</title><p>Cerebral hyperemia and edema are present, with degeneration of some neurons. Necrotic foci are noted in the adrenal glands. Degeneration, necrosis, and desquamation of epithelium mucosae of variable degree are present in the esophageal, stomach, and bowel.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>IV. Clinical Characteristics</title><sec><title>1. Clinical manifestations</title><p>Based on the current epidemiological investigation, the incubation period is one to 14 days, mostly three to seven days.</p><p>The main manifestations include fever, fatigue, and dry cough. Nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, myalgia, and diarrhea are found in a few cases. Severe patients develop dyspnea and/or hypoxemia after one week and may progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, multiple organ failure etc. It is noteworthy that for severe and critically ill patients may only present with moderate to low fever, or even no fever at all.</p><p>Some children and neonatal patients may have atypical symptoms, presented with gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, or only manifested as lethargy and shortness of breath.</p><p>The patients with mild symptoms usually do not develop pneumonia but have low fever and mild fatigue.</p><p>Based on our experience, most patients have good prognosis and a small percentage of patients are critically ill. The prognosis for the elderly and patients with chronic underlying diseases is poorer. The clinical course of pregnant women with COVID-19 is similar to that of non-pregnant patients of the same age. Symptoms in children are relatively mild.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Laboratory tests</title><p>General findings</p><p>In the early stages of the disease, peripheral WBC count is normal or decreased and the lymphocyte count is decreased. Some patients have elevated liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), muscle enzymes and myoglobin. Elevated troponin is seen in some critically ill patients. Most patients have elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and normal procalcitonin. In severe cases, D-dimer increases and peripheral blood lymphocytes progressively decrease. Severe and critically ill patients often have elevated inflammatory factors.</p><p>Pathogenic and serological findings</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(1)</label><p>Pathogenic findings: Novel coronavirus nucleic acid can be detected in nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, lower respiratory tract secretions, blood, feces, and other specimens using RT-PCR and/or NGS methods. It is more accurate if specimens are obtained from lower respiratory tract (sputum or air tract extraction). The specimens should be submitted for testing as soon as possible after collection.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(2)</label><p>Serological findings: COVID-19 virus specific IgM becomes detectable around 3&#x02013;5 days after onset; IgG reaches a titration of at least 4-fold increase during convalescence compared with the acute phase.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>3. Chest imaging</title><p>In the early stage, imaging shows multiple small patchy shadows and interstitial changes, more apparent in the peripheral zone of lungs. As the disease progresses, imaging shows multiple ground glass opacities and infiltration in both lungs. In severe cases, pulmonary consolidation may occur. However, pleural effusion is rare.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>V. Case Definitions</title><sec><title>1.

If possible, inhalation of mixed hydrogen and oxygen (H2/O2: 66.6%/33.3%) can be applied.</p></list-item><list-item><p>2.4 Antiviral therapy: Hospitals can try Alpha-interferon (5 million U or equivalent dose each time for adults, adding 2&#x0200a;ml of sterilized water, atomization inhalation twice daily), lopinavir/ritonavir (200&#x0200a;mg/50&#x0200a;mg per pill for adults, two pills each time, twice daily, no longer than 10 days), Ribavirin (suggested to be used jointly with interferon or lopinavir/ritonavir, 500 mg each time for adults, twice or three times of intravenous injection daily, no longer than 10 days), chloroquine phosphate (500&#x0200a;mg bid for 7 days for adults aged 18&#x02013;65 with body weight over 50 kg; 500 mg bid for Days 1 &#x00026; 2 and 500 mg qd for Days 3&#x02013;7 for adults with body weight below 50 kg), Arbidol (200&#x0200a;mg tid for adults, no longer than 10 days). Be aware of the adverse reactions, contraindications (for example, chloroquine cannot be used for patients with heart diseases) and interactions of the above-mentioned drugs. Further evaluate the efficacy of those drugs currently being used. Using three or more antiviral drugs at the same time is not recommend; if an intolerable toxic side effect occurs, the respective drug should be discontinued. For the treatment of pregnant women, issues such as the number of gestational weeks, choice of drugs having the least impact on the fetus, as well as whether pregnancy being terminated before treatment should be considered with patients being informed of these considerations.</p></list-item><list-item><p>2.5 Antibiotic drug treatment: Blind or inappropriate use of antibiotic drugs should be avoided, especially in combination with broad-spectrum antibiotics.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>3. Treatment of severe and critical cases</title><p>3.1 Treatment principle: On the basis of symptomatic treatment, complications should be proactively prevented, underlying diseases should be treated, secondary infections also be prevented, and organ function support should be provided timely.</p><p>3.2 Respiratory support:</p><p>3.2.1 Oxygen therapy: Patients with severe symptoms should receive nasal cannulas or masks for oxygen inhalation and timely assessment of respiratory distress and/or hypoxemia should be performed.</p><p>3.2.2 High-flow nasal-catheter oxygenation or noninvasive mechanical ventilation: When respiratory distress and/or hypoxemia of the patient cannot be alleviated after receiving standard oxygen therapy, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy or non-invasive ventilation can be considered. If conditions do not improve or even get worse within a short time (1&#x02013;2&#x0200a;hours), tracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation should be used in a timely manner.</p><p>3.2.3 Invasive mechanical ventilation: Lung protective ventilation strategy, namely low tidal volume (6&#x02013;8 ml/kg of ideal body weight) and low level of airway platform pressure (&#x0003c;30 cmH2O) should be used to perform mechanical ventilation to reduce ventilator-related lung injury. While the airway platform pressure maintained &#x02264;30 cmH2O, high PEEP can be used to keep the airway warm and moist; avoid long sedation and wake the patient early for lung rehabilitation. There are many cases of human-machine asynchronization, therefore sedation and muscle relaxants should be used in a timely manner. Use closed sputum suction according to the airway secretion, if necessary, administer appropriate treatment based on bronchoscopy findings.</p><p>3.2.4 Rescue therapy: Pulmonary re-tensioning is recommended for patients with severe ARDS. With sufficient human resources, prone position ventilation should be performed for more than 12 hours per day. If the outcome of prone position ventilation is poor, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) should be considered as soon as possible. Indications include: (1) When FiO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e; 90%, the oxygenation index is less than 80 mmHg for more than 3&#x02013;4 hours; (2) For patients with only respiratory failure when the airway platform pressure &#x02265;35 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, VV-ECMO mode is preferred; if circulatory support is needed, VA-ECMO mode should be used. When underlying diseases are under control and the cardiopulmonary function shows signs of recovery, withdrawal of ECMO can be tried.</p><p>3.3 Circulatory support: On the basis of adequate fluid resuscitation, efforts should be made to improve micro-circulation, use vasoactive drugs, closely monitor changes in blood pressure, heart rate and urine volume as well as lactate and base excess in arterial blood gas analysis. If necessary, use non-invasive or invasive hemodynamic monitor such as Doppler ultrasound, echocardiography, invasive blood pressure or continuous cardiac output (PiCCO) monitoring. In the process of treatment, pay attention to the liquid balance strategy to avoid excessive or insufficient fluid intake.</p><p>If the heart rate suddenly increases more than 20% of the basic value or the decrease of blood pressure is more than 20% of the basic value with manifestations of poor skin perfusion and decreased urine volume, make sure to closely observe whether the patient has septic shock, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, or heart failure.</p><p>3.4 Renal failure and renal replacement therapy: Active efforts should be made to look for causes for renal function damage in critical cases such as low perfusion and drugs. For the treatment of patients with renal failure, focus should be on the balance of body fluid, acid and base and electrolyte balance, as well as on nutrition support including nitrogen balance and the supplementation of energies and trace elements. For critical cases, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) can be used. The indications include: (1) hyperkalemia; (2) acidosis; (3) pulmonary edema or water overload; (4) fluid management in multiple organ dysfunction.</p><p>3.5 Convalescent plasma treatment: It is suitable for patients with rapid disease progression, severe and critically ill patients. Usage and dosage should refer to <italic>Protocol of Clinical Treatment with Convalescent Plasma for COVID-19 Patients (2nd trial version).</italic></p><p>3.6 Blood purification treatment: Blood purification system including plasma exchange, absorption, perfusion, and blood/plasma filtration can remove inflammatory factors and block &#x0201c;cytokine storm,&#x0201d; so as to reduce the damage of inflammatory reactions to the body. It can be used for the treatment of severe and critical cases in the early and middle stages of cytokine storm.</p><p>3.7 Immunotherapy: For patients with extensive lung lesions and severe cases who also show an increased level of IL-6 in laboratory testing, Tocilizumab can be used for treatment. The initial dose is 4&#x02013;8 mg/kg with the recommended dose of 400&#x0200a;mg diluted with 0.9% normal saline to 100&#x0200a;ml. The infusion time should be more than 1 hour. If the initial medication is not effective, one extra administration can be given after 12 hours (same dose as before). No more than two administrations should be given with the maximum single dose no more than 800&#x0200a;mg. Watch out for allergic reactions. Administration is forbidden for people with active infections such as tuberculosis.</p><p>3.8 Other therapeutic measures</p><p>For patients with progressive deterioration of oxygenation indicators, rapid progress in imaging and excessive activation of the body's inflammatory response, glucocorticoids can be used in a short period of time (three to five days). It is recommended that dose should not exceed the equivalent of methylprednisolone 1&#x02013;2 mg/kg/day. Note that a larger dose of glucocorticoid will delay the removal of coronavirus due to immunosuppressive effects. Xuebijing 100 ml/time can be administered intravenously twice a day. Intestinal microecological regulators can be used to maintain intestinal microecological balance and prevent secondary bacterial infections.</p><p>Child severe and critical cases can be given intravenous infusion of &#x003b3;-globulin.</p><p>For pregnant severe and critical cases, pregnancy should be terminated preferably with c-section.</p><p>Patients often suffer from anxiety and fear and they should be supported by psychological counseling.</p></sec><sec><title>4.
