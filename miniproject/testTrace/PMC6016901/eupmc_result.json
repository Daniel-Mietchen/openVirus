    "BACKGROUND:Tuberculosis is a major public health problem in Liberia. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the incidence of tuberculosis in Liberia is significantly increasing from year to year. However, little is known about the performance of the programme and the challenges after the 14 years of civil war which ended in 2003.The purpose of the study was to evaluate the performance of the TB programme of Liberia. METHODS:The study utilised mixed research design; both quantitative and qualitative methods were used in this study conducted from 2013 to 2014. For the quantitative part of the study, a questionnaire, laboratory performance and eleven years TB programme data (2003-2013) were used. For the performance of tuberculosis laboratory testing, all the 107 functional tuberculosis microscopy centers in Liberia were included. For the qualitative part of the study, an interview of 10 informants and two focus group discussions (FGDs) were also conducted, each comprising of eight people. Themes and subthemes emerged from the two FGDs. Data was analysed in line with the Donabedian model. Quantitative findings were analysed and presented using both descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS:The study findings pointed out that there was overall improvement in the performance of the tuberculosis control programme in Liberia from 2003 to 2013. The percentage of cured patients was 60% in 2005 and 62% in 2013. Percentage of treatment completed was 16% in 2005 and 21% in 2013. The case detection rate was 57% and treatment success rate 80% in 2013. The default rate was 11% in 2013. Of the 139 participants, 120 (86%) completed TB treatment while 19 (14%) did not. CONCLUSION:Between 2003 and 2013, the National Leprosy and Tuberculosis Control Programme (NLTCP) succeeded in restoring the TB services and improving some of the TB treatment outcomes including the Directly observed treatment short courses(DOTS) coverage. Despite these improvements, the TB treatment, laboratory services and human resource capacity lagged behind. The TB programme of Liberia needs to develop new strategies to address its challenges."
