Understanding FMD virus (FMDV) global movements and evolution can help to reconstruct the disease spread between endemic regions and predict the risks of incursion into FMD-free countries. Global expansion of a single FMDV lineage is rare but can result in severe economic consequences. Using extensive sequence data we have reconstructed the global space-time transmission history of the O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage (which normally circulates in the Indian sub-continent) providing evidence of at least 15 independent escapes during 2013&#x02013;2017 that have led to outbreaks in North Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the Far East and the FMD-free islands of Mauritius. We demonstrated that sequence heterogeneity of this emerging FMDV lineage is accommodated within two co-evolving divergent sublineages and that recombination by exchange of capsid-coding sequences can impact upon the reconstructed evolutionary histories. Thus, we recommend that only sequences encoding the outer capsid proteins should be used for broad-scale phylogeographical reconstruction. These data emphasise the importance of the Indian subcontinent as a source of FMDV that can spread across large distances and illustrates the impact of FMDV genome recombination on FMDV molecular epidemiology.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000277</institution-id><institution>Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SE2943</award-id><award-id>SE2943</award-id><award-id>SE2943</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bachanek-Bankowska</surname><given-names>Katarzyna</given-names></name><name><surname>Di Nardo</surname><given-names>Antonello</given-names></name><name><surname>Wadsworth</surname><given-names>Jemma</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/E/I/00007035</award-id><award-id>BB/E/I/00007036</award-id><award-id>BB/E/I/00007035</award-id><award-id>BB/E/I/00007036</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>Donald P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Knowles</surname><given-names>Nick J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease, which affects both wild and domestic cloven-hoofed mammals. It is regarded as one of the most economically important diseases of livestock due to its potential to infect multiple species, affect animal productivity and its ability to rapidly spread within and between geographical regions. The disease is caused by a virus (FMDV; family <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, genus <italic>Aphthovirus</italic>) which has a non-enveloped virion of icosahedral symmetry encapsulating a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of ~8.4&#x02009;kb. Similar to most other picornaviruses, the FMDV genome contains a single open reading frame (ORF) flanked by 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; untranslated regions (UTRs). The ORF encodes four structural proteins (VP1 to VP4) and 10 non-structural proteins (L<sup>pro</sup>, 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B<sub>1</sub>, 3B<sub>2</sub>, 3B<sub>3</sub>, 3C<sup>pro</sup>, and 3D<sup>pol</sup>) being derived from four precursor polypeptides: L, P1, P2 and P3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The synergic effect of fast replication rates, large virus population and lack of proof-reading by the viral encoded RNA-dependent polymerase results in a rapid virus evolution with the ability to generate new genetic lineages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Seven immunologically distinct serotypes of the virus exist: O, A, C, Southern African Territories (SAT) 1, SAT 2, SAT 3 and Asia 1, with serotypes O and A the most widely geographically distributed. Sequence data analyses of one of the virus capsid proteins (VP1) has been successfully used for monitoring virus outbreaks, tracing transboundary movements of virus lineages and to categorise field strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, the VP1 coding region only comprises ~8% of the FMDV genome and thus by analysing a fragment of the viral genome, a large proportion of the genetic information is not accounted for. With the development of sequencing technologies, obtaining complete or nearly-complete FMDV genome sequences has become more feasible and affordable using both Sanger and Next-Generation sequencing technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Accordingly, whole genome sequence (WGS) data is being more commonly used for fine scale molecular epidemiology investigations, such as reconstruction of outbreak transmission events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, difficulties in obtaining relevant sequence data at the population and geographical levels can affect the resolution reliability of phylodynamic and phylogeographic inferences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage within the Middle East-South Asia (ME-SA) topotype of serotype O was reported in India in 2001<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. This lineage was subsequently classified into four sublineages named <italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>, <italic>c</italic> and <italic>d</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. By 2009, the &#x02018;d&#x02019; sublineage of the O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage (Ind-2001d), became the predominant serotype O virus causing epidemics in India<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and apparently outcompeting the dominant and long-established O/ME-SA/PanAsia lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. After a single outbreak was detected in Iran in 2009<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, the Ind-2001d sublineage was also reported to be the cause of extensive epidemics in North Africa and the Middle East<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> in 2013&#x02013;2014, and in Southeast Asia in 2015<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, proving its ability to not only become established at the endemic level, but also to rapidly spread over long distances.</p><p id="Par5">Using new and publically available sequences of the VP1 coding region (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;424) and the whole genome (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;74) we employed phylodynamics and phylogeographic approaches to trace the global spread of the Ind-2001 lineage, showing the establishment of viral circulations at endemic level outside its initial geographic distribution. We further detailed the evolution and genome structure diversity of the two recently emerging Ind-2001 sublineages (Ind-2001d and Ind-2001e), reporting both evidence of recombination events and of co-circulation of different genetic variants, addressing their impact on molecular epidemiology studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Transmission History and Phylogeography of the O/ME-SA/Ind2001d and O/ME-SA/Ind2001e FMDV Sublineages</title><p id="Par6">Sequences of the VP1 coding region (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;424), including new (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;187) and publically available (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;237) data, of both endemic and epidemic origin were used to reconstruct phylogeographic transitions of the O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d and O/ME-SA/Ind-2001e sublineages across countries (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Subsequent evolution resulted in the divergence of the sublineages into two phylogenetic clades. Thus the Ind-2001e sublineage evolved within the Ind-2001d sublineage within the Indian subcontinent. Since 2008, viruses belonging to both sublineages were found to have been regularly co-circulating in India (PP&#x02009;=&#x02009;1), from where they spread within the Indian subcontinent and, eventually, over longer distances.

Between 2013 and 2015, five independent introductions of the Ind-2001d sublineage have occurred in countries to the west of the Indian subcontinent, followed by two independent introductions of the Ind-2001e sublineage since 2016.

In the first phase (between 2007 and 2008), viruses belonging to Ind-2001d were reported more frequently than the Ind-2001e viruses.

This was followed by a period of increased reporting of the Ind-2001d viruses within the Indian subcontinent (2013&#x02013;2015) and coincided with the initial notification of the Ind2001d virus outbreaks outside the Indian subcontinent (i.e. the introduction to North Africa, four outbreaks in the Persian Gulf, two outbreaks in Sri Lanka and the later introductions to Southeast Asia). Despite a limited number of Ind-2001e viruses reported during this time, phylogenetic analyses indicated an ongoing evolution occurring within the Indian subcontinent in the two year period between 2013 and 2015. These transmission events, for which sequence data is not available, gave rise to the outbreaks due to the Ind-2001e viruses reported since 2016 (i.e. two independent introduction to the Persian Gulf, the outbreaks in the islands of Mauritius and Rodriguez and three independent introductions into Southeast Asia with the subsequent movement into East Asia).

In the phylogeny derived from the VP1-coding region sequences, the two recombinant viruses (O/BAR/15/2015 and O/BHU/3/2016) grouped closely within the Ind-2001d clade. However, in the phylogeny reconstructed using the WGS these viruses were found to form a sister clade sharing coalescence with the Ind-2001d viruses, but distantly related to the Ind-2001e viruses. The resulting ancestry structure of the WGS phylogeny resulted in a shift of the MRCA to an earlier time, estimated at February 2003 (95% BCI February 2001 to January 2005). This did not overlap with the 95% BCI for the MRCA derived from the VP1 data. Multiple possible topologies were revealed from the 386 trees which were in general agreement with the phylogenetic histories derived from the WGS and VP1 sequence data. However, MRCAs estimates varied within a wide time frame (from August 1995 to May 2008) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

Pandemics due to single FMDV lineages seldom occur. However, the globalisation in livestock trade and the increased access of developing countries to the global export markets increase the risk that emerging FMDV lineages are likely to be introduced into previously unaffected regions. A previous example was the global spread of the O/ME-SA/PanAsia lineage which emerged from the Indian subcontinent into the Middle East, Southeast Asia, North and South Africa, and into Europe with dramatic economic consequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par17">In this study, we describe the global spread of two sublineages - the Ind-2001d and Ind-2001e within the O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage of FMDV, and establishment of three new centres of circulation in North Africa, the Gulf States of the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Similar to O/ME-SA/PanAsia, the Ind-2001 lineage emerged from the Indian subcontinent (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal). However, virus movement reconstruction within the subcontinent or inference of the geographical source of outbreaks outside of the mainland Indian subcontinent, can be biased by the preferential sampling present in the sequence data analysed due to sparse availability of these data in the public domain. In a number of ways, the spread of this new lineage has parallels with the earlier pandemic distribution of the O/ME-SA/PanAsia FMDV lineage: the emergence from the Indian subcontinent initially westwards into the Middle East/Persian Gulf and North Africa regions, and followed later by an eastward expansion into Southeast Asia and the Far East. The introduction of the virus to FMD-free countries and the long-distance spread (e.g. to the islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues) demonstrates the unpredictable nature of viral epidemics. While many outbreaks of the Ind-2001d and Ind-2001e sublineages were due to single independent introductions of the virus into new regions, some became established within different geographic areas, providing further sources for onward transmission. For example, such events were initially observed in North Africa and more recently in Southeast Asia from where the virus spread further to countries in East Asia. The exact routes of spread is less certain as indicated by lower PP values. However, this extensive spread of the Ind-2001d and Ind-2001e sublineages and their appearance in diverse and distant geographic regions might be linked to increased or altered trading routes, as well as movement of people. Although the data is not yet available, it is also likely that virus-specific factors such as replication and/or transmission fitness across susceptible host species have played an important role in the establishment of this lineage. Similar to the O PanAsia lineage viruses, the Ind-2001 sublineages have also been associated with infection in a wide range of host species, including large (cattle, yak and water buffalo) and small ruminants (sheep and goats), pigs, as well as wildlife (mountain gazelle)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, a characteristic which might be favourable for the adaption of this lineage to different ecological systems.</p><p id="Par18">Even though deletions within the coding and non-coding regions of the FMDV genome have been previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, the co-circulation of different deletion variants within a single FMDV lineage has not been widely reported.

However, due to the ad-hoc nature and sampling biases of the sample collection, some of the variants were represented by a single sequence or shared by closely related isolates collected from the same outbreak. However, a deletion within the s-fragment that has arisen in the viruses introduced into North Africa was evident by 2014 and continued to be sustained presumably as an adaptation to the local ecological niche. The recombinant variants (containing the Ind-2001d capsid-coding region within an unidentified FMDV lineage background) was likely a result of reshuffling genome regions from two different parental FMDV lineages co-infecting livestock populations of the Indian subcontinent ecosystem, an evolutionary process that has been previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.

In contrast to phylogenies built using both the non-coding and non-structural protein-coding regions, topologies based on sequences of the capsid proteins were similar to each other. Structural constraints of the FMDV capsid are likely to reduce the virus potential to produce recombination breakpoints within the capsid-coding region. Different genome regions of the Ind-2001d and Ind-2001e sublineages have evolved according to different phylogenetic histories, either influenced by recombination events or other evolutionary processes such as genetic drift. Thus, no single tree topology can accurately capture the true evolutionary relationship of the sampled sequences.

While the cyclical occurrence of FMDV serotypes might be driven by herd immunity against individual serotypes and introduction of viruses into naive animal populations, the evolutionary basis underpinning the cyclical occurrence of different genetic clades (and presence of several genomic variants) within a single sublineage is more difficult to explain, although the paucity of publically available sequence data from India from 2014 to date may have influenced these analyses due to sampling biases.</p><p id="Par22">With this study, we aimed at describing the global emergence of the two sublineages of the O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage and resolve its evolutionary history traced across different geographical regions of the world. In addition, we characterised new centres of circulation outside of the Indian subcontinent, in North Africa as well as in the Gulf States and Southeast Asia. The virus was shown to invade geographical areas where multiple FMDV lineages are already present, as well as to FMDV-free areas. The evidence for co-circulation of multiple Ind-2001 genomic variants is provided, including a recombination event involving an unidentified parental strain, presumably derived from different FMDV lineage or serotype endemically co-infecting the livestock population of the Indian subcontinent. Direct comparison of phylogenies based on WGS and VP1-coding sequence data indicates differences in the resolution of these two analytical approaches. As analyses based on WGS data can lead to misrepresentation of the tree topology, and a potential confounding effect for resolving phylogenetic histories, reconstruction of virus movement across and within complex epidemiological systems is recommended to be performed also using structural protein coding sequence data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Sequence Data</title><p id="Par23">Sequences of FMDV whole genome (WGS) and of the VP1 coding region were either generated <italic>de novo</italic> from virus isolates held within the repository of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) World Reference Laboratory for FMD (WRLFMD) at the Pirbright Institute, United Kingdom, and FGBI-ARRIAH, Russia, or obtained from GenBank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).
