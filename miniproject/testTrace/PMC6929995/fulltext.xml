Optimal drug formulations are made possible based on precise particle composition, structure, shape and size. Through the creation of rod-shaped particles of defined sizes reflective of native LA drugs, theranostic probes can be deployed to measure particle-cell and tissue biodistribution, antiretroviral activities and drug retention.</p><p><bold>Methods</bold>: Herein, we created multimodal rilpivirine (RPV) <sup>177</sup>lutetium labeled bismuth sulfide nanorods (<sup>177</sup>LuBSNRs) then evaluated their structure, morphology, configuration, chemical composition, biological responses and adverse reactions.

This is made possible by changing pharmacological management to affect drug efficacy. Such approaches eliminate the requirements for lifelong daily pills. Nonetheless, a number of challenges exist to implement such regimens. These include, but are not limited to, required dosing volumes, frequencies of injection, untoward side effects, and maintenance of antiretroviral efficacy.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Even more importantly, only two LA ARVs are currently in the pipeline.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Such limitations in drug choices preclude alternative therapies when required by either developed resistance mutations or adverse events.

Thus, we sought to engineer nanoparticles that mimicked LA ARV particles in shape and morphology while optimizing size and design. To these ends, the use of bismuth (Bi) and sulfur (S) proved to be a natural choice as the components add a heavy metal detector, proven bioimaging capabilities and rapid oxidative decompositions required for human translation.<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Intrinsically-radiolabeled <sup>177</sup>lutetium (<sup>177</sup>Lu) bismuth sulfide nanorods (<sup>177</sup>LuBSNRs) were created as multimodal imaging particles to serve as probes for drug biodistribution of LA nanoformulated rilpivirine (NRPV). RPV, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), was chosen as a model for other LA ARVs based on its highly hydrophobic and protein binding properties as well as extended plasma half-life.<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> We used <sup>177</sup>LuBSNRs as imaging probes to mirror the structure, morphology, biological properties and atomic configuration of the <sup>177</sup>LuBSNRs of LA NRPV. Biodistribution of <sup>177</sup>Lu/BSNRs/RPV into lymphoid tissue macrophages was demonstrated in Balb/c mice using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The BSNRs/RPV particles demonstrated potent antiretroviral activities in cell-based assays. These data, taken together, demonstrate that these multimodal particles can be effective imaging probes for assessing LA NRPV biodistribution. The work demonstrates their translational application for determining LA ARV PK and pharmacodynamics (PD).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Creation of <sup>177</sup>LuBSNRs particles</title><p>Chelator-free, <sup>177</sup>LuBSNRs nanocrystals were first synthesized by solvothermal precipitation of bismuth neodecanoate and thioacetamide in the presence of oleic acid, oleylamine and ethanol. The crystallinity, monodispersity, shape, and size of the particles were monitored during synthesis, and optimized by varying time intervals and molar ratios of bismuth and thiol precursors. During synthesis, oleyl amine served as ligand and solvent with bismuth.<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The prepared <sup>177</sup>LuBSNRs were dispersed in cyclohexane and converted to a freely dispersed hydrophilic solution in the aqueous phase. To ensure biocompatibility, the hydrophobic <sup>177</sup>LuBSNRs particles were coated with biocompatible lipids. Lipid coated <sup>177</sup>LuBSNRs were synthesized by a simple film hydration technique to make uniform preparations more appropriate for biological use than uncoated hydrophobic particles. L-&#x003b1;-phosphatidylcholine and DSPE-PEG<sub>2000</sub> were used to functionalize the particles. An experimental outline is presented in the schematics diagram (<bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S1</xref> top panel</bold>). The plain, non-lipid coated and non-radiolabeled BSNRs were characterized by various techniques. Low power TEM revealed that the plain non-radiolabeled BSNRs nanocrystals had a rod shape, of approximately 12 nm in diameter by 70 nm in length <bold>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A)</bold>. High resolution (HR)-TEM images <bold>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B-C)</bold> show the lattice fringes with spacings of 0.356 and 0.194 nm. These are in accord with spacing planes of [130] and [431] of the atomic configuration of BSNRs. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the BSNRs are shown by simulation indexation (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D</bold>). The lines correspond to the rod's interplanar spacing.<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> High-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) illustrate bismuth (Bi) (red) and sulfur (green) (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E</bold>). The XRD shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>F</bold> reveals that all peaks are indexed into an orthorhombic crystal (JCPDS no. 01-089-8963), indicating high quality of crystallization. The XRD patterns of the BSNRs match with reported values in the literature.<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>-<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> BSNRs present peaks that are assignable to the orthorhombic structure (JCPDS no. 01-089-8963). BSNRs are elongate along the [130] direction, representing the crystal plane of the longitudinal direction <bold>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C)</bold>. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis demonstrated &#x0201c;Bismuth&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;sulfur&#x0201d; signals were detected in the BSNRs; whereas the copper peaks originated from the TEM grid <bold>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>F)</bold>. The percent metal ions distributed in single particles are 81.68 and 18.32 weight percent of bismuth and sulfur, respectively, as seen in the inset of <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>F</bold> (Right top panel) and these results were similar to X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis results <bold>(Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">figure S3</xref>)</bold>. The mean hydrodynamic size of BSNRs by laser-light scattering is illustrated in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>G</bold>. The size is ~ 205 nm and equivalent to that of NRPV <bold>(Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S1</xref>).</bold><xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Phantom near infrared (NIR) fluorescence images of particles are shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>G</bold>. Synthesis and characterization results indicate that <sup>177</sup>LuBSNRs could be employed to design a potential multi-modal theranostics agent that integrates SPECT and NIR imaging for a real-time non-invasive visualization of the virus sanctuary sites, which may provide more complementary, effective, and accurate information on progress of HIV-I spread with delivery drugs at the sanctuary sites. Non-radioactive LuBSNRs and BSNRs-RPV particles synthesis and characterization results were similar to that of radioactive particles <bold>(Supplementary SR1 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">figure S2</xref>, S4-5)</bold> and <bold>Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.</bold></p></sec><sec><title>Radiolabeling stability assessment</title><p>In order to accurately localize our nanoparticles by SPECT imaging, we verified that the radiolabel remained stably associated within the nanoparticle to preclude false positive signals in the SPECT scans that would result if the radiolabel dissociates from the particle. We developed a process of intrinsically doping <sup>177</sup>Lu atoms into the crystal lattice structure (formed by regular repeating units of bismuth and sulfur) of the BSNRs, creating a unique radiolabel nanoprobe for <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. The stability results are summarized in <bold>Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref></bold>. <sup>177</sup>LuBSNRs were incubated for 3 days at 4&#x000ba;C or 37&#x000ba;C in either PBS (pH 7.4) or rat plasma. Every 24 hours, the percent radioactivity left in the nanoparticles was calculated. Over the course of 72 hours in PBS at 4&#x000ba;C or 37&#x000ba;C, nanoparticles lost approximately 30% of their radioactivity, with 72% and 66% remaining, respectively. In 4&#x000ba;C and 37&#x000ba;C plasma, particles lost approximately 50% radioactivity, with 51% and 56%, remaining, respectively. <sup>177</sup>BSNRs particles lost approximately 30% of their radioactivity when incubated in PBS for 72 hours. This can be attributed to the fact that some sample is lost (about 10-15%) each time the nanoparticles are pipetted, as the BSNRs particles &#x0201c;stick&#x0201d; to the inside of the pipette tip during these experiments. The greater loss of radioactivity in plasma can be attributed to the association of BSNRs with lipids and lipoproteins present in the rat plasma. We believe this to be the most likely explanation because we intrinsically doped the BSNRs particles. In this system the <sup>177</sup>Lu ions exist in a tight coordination with bismuth and sulfur atoms within the core of nanoparticle which is shielded by an external lipid layer.<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> These nanoparticles, along with other lipid coated nanoparticles are known to form associations with lipids and proteins both <italic>in vivo</italic> and when incubated in plasma <italic>in vitro</italic>. These lipids and lipoproteins do not pellet when subject to the centrifugation applied in this experiment and instead remain floating atop the supernatant. Typically, lipids and lipoproteins will not pellet unless subjected to ultracentrifugation.<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> This leads to a higher reading in the supernatant (due to floating, lipid bound BSNRs particles) and a lower reading in the pellet, potentially masking the true stability of the radiolabel to the particle. Overall, these results demonstrate that <sup>177</sup>Lu-labeled particles are stable, with half-lives that mirror the expected decay of <sup>177</sup>Lu intrinsically doped within nanoparticle cores.</p></sec><sec><title>MDM particle uptake, retention and release assessments</title><p>Time-dependent uptake of the BSNRs-RPV particles at 12.5 and 25 &#x000b5;g/mL by human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) was observed over 8 hours<bold> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A left panels).</bold> As expected, treatment with 25 &#x003bc;g/mL of BSNRs-RPV provided increased particle uptake compared to the 12.5 &#x003bc;g/mL treatment. Intracellular bismuth and RPV levels were 11.78 &#x003bc;g/10<sup>6</sup> cells for bismuth and 3.51 &#x003bc;g/10<sup>6</sup> cells for RPV with the lower concentration treatment and 19.32 &#x003bc;g/10<sup>6</sup> for bismuth and 8.28 &#x003bc;g/10<sup>6</sup> cells for RPV with the higher concentration treatment at 8 hours. With particles left in the cell culture media, the cellular uptake reaches equilibrium within 8 hours. In retention studies, removal of particles from the media led to gradual diminution of intracellular particles <bold>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A right panels).</bold> The amount of bismuth and RPV remaining in MDM treated with 25 &#x003bc;g/mL of particles after five days was 51.5% and 54.5%, respectively. Fluorescence characteristics of BSNRs-RPV and BSNRs particles in cells were assessed by measuring the relative fluorescence emission intensity in MDM suspended in PBS. Fluorescence spectra of BSNRs-RPV in MDM showed a higher intensity compared to BSNRs. However, both particles were taken up in MDM, and fluorescence intensity correlated with the concentration of particles <bold>(Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S10</xref>D).</bold> We hypothesized that with treatment with BSNRs-RPV particles, uptake and retention of bismuth in MDM would correlate with the amount of drug (RPV) taken up and retained by the cells. <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B</bold> shows the two-parameter Pearson's correlation between bismuth and RPV cell concentration for uptake (top) and retention (bottom). Comparisons were performed at each time point and the uptake of bismuth positively correlated with the uptake of RPV, with an &#x0201c;r&#x0201d; value of 0.9690. For retention, the correlation between bismuth and RPV was lower (r = 0.8093), most likely due to the longer period of time over which the cells were analyzed (details for the <italic>in vitro</italic> correlation study are available in the <bold>supplementary results SR3 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S9</xref></bold>).</p><p>To qualitatively examine the intracellular uptake of BSNRs-RPV particles and the microstructure of the cells, we added 25 &#x003bc;g/mL of BSNRs-RPV particles to MDM for 8 hours, collected the cells and fixed them in a fixative buffer.<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Nanoparticle loaded cells were examined by confocal microscopy (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C</bold>), TEM (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D</bold>), and validated by NIR fluorescence using NIR microscopy <bold>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>E).</bold> TEM images show BSNR particles endocytosed by MDM with higher magnification showing large numbers of BSNRs-RPV particles in vesicles, observed as black clusters distributed within lysosomes and other microvesicles (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D</bold>). These results were confirmed by May-Gr&#x000fc;nwald Giemsa staining that showed particles in the cells clearly visible by light microscopy <bold>(Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S10</xref>A-C).</bold> We assessed the surface topography of treated cells by AFM to determine characteristic morphological changes compared to control cells. BSNRs treated macrophages displayed a surface pseudopodium like morphology compared to control cells. AFM results demonstrated that particles were taken up in the cells with a slight change in cell surface morphology (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>F</bold>).</p><p>Antiretroviral activity was assessed in MDM to determine the activity of BSNRs-RPV and NRPV particles. Cells were pre-treated with 12 or 25 &#x003bc;g/mL of NRPV and BSNRs-RPV for 8 hours before being challenged with HIV-1<sub>ADA</sub>, a macrophage tropic strain, at days 1, 3, 5 and 8 after treatment. Ten days after infection, culture supernatants were collected and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) activity was assessed as a measure of viral replication (<bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S11</xref></bold>). The remaining cells were fixed and HIV-1 p24 staining was used as a qualitative measurement of viral infection (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>). Treatment with 12.5 or 25 &#x003bc;g/mL of BSNRs-RPV showed a notable reduction in HIV-induced multinucleation of macrophages at days 1, 3, 5, and 8 compared to positive control (HIV infected macrophages). These results paralleled RT activity measurements while demonstrating comparable antiretroviral responses for NRPV. The antiretroviral activity of BSNRs-RPV (98% HIV-1 inhibition) was similar to that of NRPV (98% viral inhibition) after 8 days of infection without any apparent difference of the BSNRs-RPV concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Biodistribution and cellular localization of particles by SPECT, LA-ICP-MS and TEM imaging</title><p>Our laboratory has been developing a theranostic, nanoparticle-based imaging platform that can be used to predict the long-term biodistribution of these medications by use of MRI and SPECT imaging early in the treatment regimen.<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> We hypothesized that a rod-shaped nanoparticle (termed &#x0201c;nanorods&#x0201d;) approximately the same size as our long-acting RPV nanocrystals, created from safe, (bismuth and sulfur) non-toxic &#x0201c;green elements&#x0201d;<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> could serve as an accurate predictor of RPV long-term biodistribution by intrinsically doping the BNSRs with <sup>177</sup>Lu, a gamma-emitting radioisotope.

For G3 (BSNR plus NRPV 45mg/kg) animals, RPV concentrations in spleen were twice that of the liver RPV concentrations on all days with values of 22,020.1 &#x000b1; 3971 ng/g RPV on day 2, 569.2 &#x000b1; 215.4 ng/g on day 5, and 67.7 &#x000b1; 11.04 ng/g on day 28.

However, the RPV content of lymph nodes from animals treated with RPV loaded BSNRs (BSNRs-RPV) was lower than that in G2 animals on day 2 (7.1 &#x000b1; 4.4 ng/g) and remained constant thereafter through day 28 (5.4 &#x000b1; 1.8 ng/g).</p><p>Bismuth concentrations in tissues over time from animals in G3 (BSNRs plus NRPV), G4 (BSNRs-RPV) and G6 (BSNRs only) were determined by ICP-MS analysis. The results for liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and kidneys are shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>D and E</bold>. For G6 animals, bismuth concentration in the liver increased significantly (P&#x0003c;0.05) from day 2 to day 5, from 183.3 &#x000b1; 26.19 &#x003bc;g/g to 237.2 &#x000b1; 19.41 &#x003bc;g/g and decreased slightly to 200.7 &#x000b1; 17.88 &#x003bc;g/g by day 28. Bismuth content in the livers of G3 animals showed a similar pattern with a significant increase in bismuth concentration from day 2 to day 5 (200.0 &#x000b1; 26&#x003bc;g/g bismuth to 246.7 &#x000b1; 18.3 &#x003bc;g/g bismuth) followed by a non-significant drop to 223.9 &#x000b1; 19.3 &#x003bc;g/g on day 28. Again, a similar pattern was observed in G4 livers in terms of bismuth concentration. On day 2, liver concentration was 181.9 &#x000b1; 36.4 &#x003bc;g/g bismuth followed by a significant accumulation by day 5 (251.6 &#x000b1; 42 &#x003bc;g/g) and a non-significant decrease by day 28 (241.1 &#x000b1; 13.7 &#x003bc;g/g).</p><p>The concentration of bismuth in spleens showed a pattern of non-significant accumulation between days 2 and 5, followed by a significant increase in concentration between days 5 and 28 for each of the three groups of animals that received BSNRs (G3, G4, and G6). The concentration of bismuth in G3 spleens increased from 72.4 &#x000b1; 7.0 &#x003bc;g/g to 117.4 &#x000b1; 11.2 &#x003bc;g/g from day 2 to day 5 and then further increased to 137.8 &#x000b1; 7.6&#x003bc;g/g by day 28. For G4 spleens a similar pattern was observed, with a non-significant increase from 109.7 &#x000b1; 4.9 &#x003bc;g/g to 134.4 &#x000b1; 4.8 &#x003bc;g/g bismuth from day 2 to day 5 followed by a larger, significant increase to 170.6 &#x000b1; 13.1 &#x003bc;g/g by day 28. Bismuth concentration in G6 spleens followed the same pattern with measured values of 97.5 &#x000b1; 10.3 &#x003bc;g/g, 109.5 &#x000b1; 13.7 &#x003bc;g/g, and 162 &#x000b1; 13.1 &#x003bc;g/g bismuth on days 2, 5, and 28, respectively.</p><p>Concentrations of bismuth in lymph nodes of G3, G4, and G6 animals were lower than that in the spleen and liver. However, lymph node concentrations of bismuth did not change significantly over the course of 28 days for any of the three groups. For G3, bismuth concentration in the lymph nodes on day 2 was 1.84 &#x000b1; 0.001 &#x003bc;g/g with concentrations on day 5 and day 28 of 0.89 &#x000b1; 0.2 &#x003bc;g/g and 0.35 &#x000b1; 0.5 &#x003bc;g/g, respectively. The bismuth concentration in the lymph nodes of G4 animals was similar to that in G3 animals with values of 0.88 &#x000b1; 1.3 &#x003bc;g/g, 0.34 &#x000b1; 0.07 &#x003bc;g/g, and 0.64 &#x000b1; 0.7 &#x003bc;g/g on days 2, 5, and 28, respectively. G6 animals received only BSNRs and the bismuth concentration in lymph nodes was 0.31 &#x000b1; 0.3 &#x003bc;g/g on day 2, 0.89 &#x000b1; 0.7 &#x003bc;g/g on day 5, and 0.36 &#x000b1; 0.1 &#x003bc;g/g, on day 28. Overall the concentration of bismuth in the lymph nodes of all animals remained relatively constant over the 4 weeks post-treatment. Bismuth concentration was also measured in the kidneys of G3, G4, and G6 animals by ICP-MS <bold>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>E, left panel)</bold>. Again, all groups followed a similar pattern of Bismuth concentration over time. Between days 2 and 5, the concentration of bismuth changed non-significantly from 3.34 &#x000b1; 0.35 &#x003bc;g/g to 3.65 &#x000b1; 0.21 &#x003bc;g/g, 4.35 &#x000b1; 0.3 &#x003bc;g/g to 2.82 &#x000b1; 0.15 &#x003bc;g/g, and 6.17 &#x000b1; 0.2 &#x003bc;g/g to 9.24 &#x000b1; 0.05 &#x003bc;g/g for G3, G4, and G6 animals respectively. From day 5 to day 28 all groups saw a significant accumulation of bismuth in the kidneys with concentrations of 9.60 &#x000b1; 1.2 &#x003bc;g/g, 8.09 &#x000b1; 1.07 &#x003bc;g/g, and 9.24 &#x000b1; 0.70 &#x003bc;g/g for G3, G4, and G6, respectively.</p><p>RPV concentrations were assessed over time for groups that received NRPV (G1, G2, G3) or BSNRs-RPV (G4) <bold>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>E, center and right panels)</bold>. On day 1 RPV concentration in G1 plasma was 520.0 ng/mL and declined rapidly to 76.7 ng/mL by day 7, then remained fairly constant until day 28 at 61.9 ng/mL <bold>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>E, center panel)</bold>. Plasma concentration of RPV in G3 animals followed a similar pattern over time. On day 1, RPV concentration in G3 plasma was 1229.1 ng/mL and then decreased to 5.25 ng/ml at day 7. From day 7 to day 28 there was a very slow decrease in plasma concentration to 1.4 ng/mL.</p><p>For G2 animals, RPV concentration was 137.6 ng/mL at day 1 and declined to 17.8 ng/mL by day 5 <bold>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>E, right panel)</bold>. From day 5 until day 28, plasma RPV concentration slowly declined to 10.8 ng/mL. For G4 animals treated with BSNRs-RPV, plasma RPV concentration on day 1 was relatively low, 3.1 ng/mL, but increased to 18.4 ng/mL by day 14. From day 14 to day 28 the plasma RPV concentration remained constant and on day 28 plasma RPV was 10.2 ng/mL. These results suggest a slower release of RPV into the plasma from BSNRs-RPV than from NRPV alone, potentially prolonging its effects in the body. <italic>In vivo</italic> treatment with BSNRs, BSNRs-RPV, NRPV, and combinations of BSNRs plus NRPV produced no observed toxicity in liver, kidney, or pancreas as determined by serum chemistry and histological analysis results <bold>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Supplementary figures 20</xref> and 21).</bold></p></sec><sec><title>Metadata analysis</title><p>LA ARVs could overcome limitations in HIV/AIDS therapeutic regimens that limit optimal clinical outcomes.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The ability to sustain plasma and tissue drug levels beyond the plasma 90% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>90</sub>) for months would reduce pill burdens, increase regimen adherence and reduce adverse events that plague current medications.

Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated for group comparisons of RPV concentrations, bismuth concentrations, SPECT ROI <bold>(Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">figure S13</xref>),</bold> and gamma scintillation counts from excised organs.

These parameters included RPV concentration (UPLC-MS/MS), bismuth concentration (ICP-MS), SPECT signal, and gamma counts for excised organs. To assess the predictive value of the BSNRs to estimate long-term biodistribution of LA ARVs such as NRPV, we used Pearson's correlation analysis for 2 parameter comparison on averaged data collected from different groups on the same day. Correlation &#x0201c;r&#x0201d; values were generated for each comparison and statistically significant correlations with r &#x0003e; 0.5 were plotted. For same day comparisons in the liver, the highest degree of correlation was between RPV and bismuth on day 2 (r = 0.9796). Additionally, G1 RPV concentration in the liver correlated significantly with bismuth concentration in G4 animals treated with BSNRs-RPV (r = 0.9412). Interestingly, the lower dose of NRPV (G2) correlated extremely well with our BSNRs-RPV (G4) in terms of RPV concentration even to 28 day with r = 0.8536. These data demonstrated that RPV loaded BSNRs reflected the biodistribution of NRPV. Gamma scintillation analysis of G5 livers excised 5 days post-treatment correlated with bismuth concentration (r = 0.9005). Furthermore, gamma counts of excised day 5 livers correlated with RPV concentration on the same day (r = 0.8264). Most importantly, we observed that SPECT signal and RPV concentration on day 5 were strongly correlated (r = 0.8676). In spleen, RPV concentration (G2) correlated with bismuth concentration, gamma scintillation counts, and SPECT signal (r = 0.9412, 0.8361, and 0.5593, respectively). SPECT signal (G5) in spleen also significantly correlated with bismuth concentration on day 2 (r = 0.8993) for animals treated with BSNRs-RPV (G4). In lymph nodes, SPECT signal (G5) correlated with RPV concentration on day 2 from multiple groups including G1, G2, and G3 with r = 0.5259, 0.5416, and 0.6936, respectively <bold>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Supplementary figure 19</xref> graphs A, C and E)</bold>.

Day 5 lymph node SPECT signal also correlated with bismuth concentration (r = 0.7283), providing evidence that the SPECT signal could be used to predict RPV concentration <italic>in vivo</italic>. Gamma scintillation counting was also closely associated with bismuth and SPECT signal (r = 0.8545 and 0.9731 respectively).</p><p>The data, <italic>in toto</italic>, demonstrates that SPECT signal reflects RPV drug concentrations. We also looked at the associations between various different data combinations (e.g., RPV vs Bismuth) acquired at different times to determine the predictive value of the BSNRs platform. In the lymph nodes, we observed that SPECT signal at 2 days post-treatment was predictive for RPV concentration on day 28, for both high dose NRPV group (G1) and RPV-BSNRs (G4) with strong correlation values (r = 0.7709 and 0.7830, respectively). SPECT signal from day 2 was also predictive for day 28 bismuth concentration in the lymph node (r = 0.7643). In the spleen, SPECT signal from days 2 and 5 could be predict bismuth concentration on day 28 (r = 0.9255 and 0.9044, respectively), while day 2 bismuth concentrations correlated with day 28 RPV concentration (r = 0.987). In liver, gamma scintillation counts from day 5 provided the best correlative values in terms of RPV and bismuth content on day 28. Day 5 gamma scintillation counts correlated with RPV concentrations from G1, G2, and G3 (r = 0.8591, 0.9142, and 0.6801, respectively). Group correlations for spleen parameters were also determined and are illustrated in <bold>supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">figures S17</xref>-19</bold>.

To achieve this goal, theranostic particles were made of identical size and morphology (&#x0201c;rod-shaped&#x0201d;) as LA ARVs that are used currently in phase III treatment paradigms.<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref> This was achieved in step-wise fashion. <italic>First</italic>, we created lipid coated <sup>177</sup>LuBSNRs as a multimodal imaging particle for non-invasive and real-time imaging. <italic>Second</italic>, LA RPV (NRPV) was deployed to model drug biodistribution.

This observation matched SPECT results that indicated highly particle uptake and deposition in tissues with large numbers of macrophages and other immune cells. Such multifunctional imaging (<sup>177</sup>LuBSNRs) and therapeutic particles (NRPV) will facilitate rapid screening of antiviral drug tissue distribution.</p><p>Each imaging technology that was or can be employed in future research has its own inherent limitations.<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref> Information attained from single imaging modality tracking nanoparticles typically cannot satisfy the requirement to directly visualize infection sites and quantify the amount of drug at those sites.

Second, 100 mg L-&#x003b1;-Phosphatidylcholine and 50 mg of DSPE-PEG<sub>2000</sub> were placed in a round bottom flask, chloroform and hexane were added along with RPV in same flask. The solvent was removed by rotavaporation to create a uniform thin lipid film. The film was left to dry in a desiccator vacuum overnight to ensure the removal of any trace solvent. Third, 100 mg of <sup>177</sup>Lu/BSNRs particles were dispersed in cyclohexane and sonicated for 30 min until completely mixed. Then, 10 mL of 2% (v/v) tween 80 was added and the mixture was sonicated to form a turbid emulsion. Fourth, cyclohexane was removed by rotavaporation and afterwards, particles were transferred into the round bottom flask with RPV-lipid film for coating process. The flask was steadily rotated in warm water with gentle sonication to ensured complete dissolution and coating of lipid film. The BSNRs-RPV particles were purified by centrifugation of the suspension at 270 xg (500 rpm) for 10 minutes. Supernatant containing particles was used for particle size, drug loading quantitation and radioactivity analysis. Metal content was analyzed by ICP-MS. For drug quantification from nanoparticles, ~50 mg of lyophilized nanoparticles was dissolved in 10 mL of DCM: methanol (1:1 v/v) mixture. The mixture was then bath sonicated for 30 minutes followed by centrifugation at 35,1315&#x000d7; g for 30 minutes. The supernatant was collected and DCM was evaporated at room temperature.

Low-resolution TEM images of BSNRs are illustrated in (A). The BSNRs dimensions were approximately 12 nm in diameter by 70 nm in length. High-resolution TEM images of twin BSNR particles with lattice planes are shown in (B) with corresponding electron diffraction patterns. These are illustrated through the drawing of [4 3 1] and [1 3 0] space groups in the vector directions (C). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of BSNRs are shown by simulation indexation. The indexation-detected lines correspond to characteristic interplanar spacing of the BSNR's single crystal structure in (D). The bismuth (red) and sulfur (green) element mapping showed element localization within the particles by corresponding high-angle annular dark-field electron microscopy in (E). XRD patterns, correlations with HR- TEM, SAED and simulated data sets confirmed the particle's structural configurations (F left panel). Quantitative measurements of particle element distribution were made by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (F right panel). The hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties of the lipid coated particles are shown in the inset. The vial BSNRs were dispersed in cyclohexane. The vials contain mixtures of cyclohexane. The third vial shown illustrates the BSNRs particle hydrophilic properties produced by lipid coatings. These were dispersed in water. The schematic diagram of the particle's configuration is shown on the vial top. The hydrodynamic size distribution of lipid-coated drug loaded particles as determined by DLS was compared against NRPV (G left panel). Excitation and emission spectra of BSNRs (g middle panel) are illustrated. BSNRs NIR fluorescence imaging is shown (G right panel).

Serial dilutions of particles plus tissues homogenate mixture were used to create a calibration curves from LA-ICP-MS imaging spots. Bismuth was detectable in tissue mimics at all calibration points. Fifty micrometer resolution is needed to properly observe subcellular distribution. Distribution of particles in spleen slices was determined on days 2 and 5 after injection of BSNRs and BSNRs-RPV particles in mice (C). The distribution of the particles in the spleen was monitored with high spatial resolution and sensitivity using LA-ICP-MS imaging. Bismuth signal in spleen sub regions after injection of particles (D) showed a heterogeneous distribution pattern. Higher distribution in the macrophage-rich marginal zone compared to white pulp and red pulp was observed (D). The uneven particle distribution pattern observed across the structural architecture of the spleen and confirmed by quantitative measurements by LA-ICP-MS can be explained by higher macrophage populations in marginal zone that are specialized for uptake and storage of particles.
