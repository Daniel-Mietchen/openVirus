Epidemiological data of the H7N9 confirmed cases and their close contacts were obtained through interviews and reviews of medical records. Of the four patients in these two family clusters, two cases had mild symptoms, one had severe symptoms, and one died. Three of the four patients had a history of exposure to live poultry or contaminated environments. The complete genome sequences of the H7N9 viruses from the same family cluster were highly homologous, and the four isolated viruses from the two family clusters exhibited the virologic features of the H7N9 virus, in terms of transmissibility, pathogenicity, host adaptation, and antiviral drug resistance. In addition, our findings indicated that the A/Fujian/18/2015 viral strain contained an additional hemagglutinin G225D substitution, which preferentially binds &#x003b1;2,6-linked sialic acids. The results of this study demonstrate that one family cluster was infected through common exposure to live poultry or contaminated environments, and the other was more likely to be infected through the human-to-human route.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Viral infection</kwd><kwd>Epidemiology</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The first confirmed case of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus infection was detected in Eastern China on March, 2013, and the infection spread rapidly across the eastern provinces of China, causing worldwide concern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

</p><p id="Par6">The first family cluster comprised two persons with confirmed H7N9 infections (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). The index patient (the son) was a 54-year-old man with a fever of 40&#x02009;&#x000b0;C at the onset of illness on January 5, 2014, and he saw a countryside doctor. However, his fever did not improve after 4 days of treatment. On January 13, the son was admitted to Putian Municipal No. 1 Hospital (Putian, China) because he experienced more severe coughing and shortness of breath. He was diagnosed with pneumonia of unknown origin and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the H7N9 virus was detected in his throat-swab samples by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Oseltamivir was given as an antiviral treatment against H7N9 infection; however, the son, unfortunately, died on January 15. The second patient was the index patient&#x02019;s 77-year-old mother, who was confirmed to have an H7N9 virus infection through monitoring and testing of close contacts with the confirmed index patient. On January 5, she saw a countryside doctor because of coughing and dizziness, and her physical condition improved following a 2-day treatment. She was investigated because of her close contact with her son, and her throat-swab specimen was collected and analyzed on January 15. On the following day (January 16), she was confirmed to have an H7N9 virus infection, and she was transferred to the Affiliated Hospital of Putian University (Putian, China) and placed in an isolated ward. Her vital signs and a routine blood test were normal during her stay in the hospital; however, oseltamivir was administered and she was not discharged from the hospital until two consecutive PCR assays of her throat-swab specimens were negative on January 22. The index patient lived with his mother in a two-floor house in Putian city, Fujian Province, where live poultry were freely bred in the backyard, which was full of chicken feathers and feces. According to the recollections of the patient&#x02019;s family members, most of their neighbors bred live poultry, and some of the poultry died prior to his reported illness. Before the son became ill on January 5, his mother lived in extremely close contact with him, including feeding chickens, sitting, and eating together until January 13.</p><p id="Par7">The second family cluster included a grandfather and his grandson with confirmed H7N9 virus infections (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>) in Xiamen, Southeast China. The index patient (the grandfather) was a 58-year-old man that had a headache and chills with a normal body temperature at the onset of illness on January 6, 2015. At dusk, the grandfather visited a rural hospital and received an antondin injection and traditional Chinese medicine (no exact details are available). During the period from January 7 through 13, he had recurrent clinical manifestations, including weakness, coughing, shortness of breath, and fever, and his highest body temperature was 39.6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Then, he visited Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University (Xiamen, China), and he was given cefotaxime treatment for 3 days. Because of the development of a more severe shortness of breath, the grandfather was hospitalized on January 15, and a routine blood test revealed a 2.75&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L white blood cell (WBC) count, which comprised 81% neutrophils and 16% lymphocytes. Oseltamivir, cefotaxime, doxycycline, and other symptomatic treatments were given for anti-infective therapy. He was diagnosed with pneumonia of unknown origin by consultation with multi-disciplinary experts on the morning of January 16, and his throat-swab specimens were collected and transferred to the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention to detect the H7N9 virus. On the afternoon of January 16, he was confirmed to have an H7N9 virus infection. Because his physical condition improved, he was discharged from the hospital on February 4. The second patient was the index patient&#x02019;s 2-year-old grandson, who was admitted to Zhongshan Hospital because of facial paralysis. Because of his close contact with his grandfather, the grandson was investigated, and his throat-swab specimens were sampled on January 16. He was confirmed to have an H7N9 virus infection by RT-PCR on January 17, and he had a fever of 39&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in the afternoon. Then, he was transferred to the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University (Xiamen, China) and placed in an isolated ward. A routine blood test revealed a 1.04&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>10</sup>/L WBC count, comprising 71% neutrophils and 13% lymphocytes. After the virus failed to be detected in the throat-swab specimen, the grandson was discharged from the hospital on January 23. The grandfather frequently visited a live poultry market near his house prior to the onset of his illness. After the grandfather became ill on January 6, he had close contact with his grandson (from January 10 to 14), including sitting and eating together, as well as kissing and hugging. The grandson did not visit any live poultry market, and he did not have any direct contact with live poultry.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Phylogenetic characteristics of the genomes of viruses isolated from the two family clusters</title><p id="Par8">H7N9 viral strains were successfully isolated from the four patients, and all the virus genome sequences were obtained through DNA sequencing. To investigate the phylogenetic and genetic characteristics of the H7N9 viruses from these two family clusters, their complete genome sequences were analyzed and compared with several representative genome sequences available in the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gisaid.org">www.gisaid.org</ext-link>). Based on the temporal distribution of the H7N9 viral strains, 41 complete genome sequences of H7N9 viruses from the four epidemic waves were selected for phylogenetic analysis, and eight gene segments were closely related to each other, with &#x02265;93.4% homology (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The viral strains isolated from the patients in the same family cluster shared high sequence similarities (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), and all eight gene segments clustered together in the phylogenetic trees, with &#x02265;99.9% (cluster 1) and &#x02265;99.8% (cluster 2) identities in all eight gene segments at the nucleotide level. High sequence similarities were also observed between the complete genome sequences of the A/British Columbia/1/2015 viral strain from Canadian patients and the A/Fujian/18/2015 (the first patient from cluster 2) and A/Fujian/22/2015 viral strains from Xiamen, Fujian Province, China (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), suggesting that two Canadian travel-associated cases became infected with the H7N9 virus in Xiamen.

To date, the virus has caused four outbreaks in humans, and most cases occurred during winter and spring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The H7N9 virus is a low pathogenic avian influenza A virus, and it does not cause identifiable illness or death in poultry, whereas humans act as sentinels for the presence of these viruses in avian infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Currently, humans get infected with the H7N9 virus predominantly through contact with asymptomatic poultry, and sporadically via direct contact or exposure to environments that are contaminated with infected poultry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. However, there are increasing reports of clusters of human cases infected with the H7N9 virus, among which some cases have close contacts and some share common exposure to live poultry or live poultry markets, thereby resulting in difficulty in identifying viral transmission routes (either via common exposure or human-to-human transmission)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. However, close, persistent, and unprotected contacts with symptomatic cases with H7N9 virus infections may cause human-to-human transmission, although this transmissibility is limited and non-sustainable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is important to examine the likelihood of efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission of the H7N9 virus. Here, we reported the epidemiological, clinical, and virologic characteristics of two family clusters with H7N9 virus infections in Southeast China to clarify the transmission and pathogenicity of the virus.</p><p id="Par13">A phylogenetic analysis showed that all eight gene segments of H7N9 viruses in the same family cluster shared high sequence similarities and clustered together in a single branch of a phylogenetic tree, which suggests that the index patients and secondary patients from the family clusters were infected via human-to-human transmission or through exposure to common live poultry or contaminated environments. We collected specimens from live-poultry markets neighboring the patients&#x02019; houses, and H7N9 viruses were detected in the poultry washing water and cage surface cleaning wipes by RT-PCR (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>); however, it was unfortunate that the H7 and N9 gene sequences were not obtained at that time. It was estimated previously that the mean incubation period of the H7N9 virus is 3.3 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 5.7 days), with a 0.76 coefficient of variation (95% CI, 0.1 to 5.5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The onset of H7N9 infection-like syndromes occurred on the same day in the two patients from cluster 1 (January 5, 2015), and the time required for human-to-human transmission was not met, implying a simultaneous or common route of infection. For cluster 2, the index patient visited a live poultry market frequently prior to the onset of his illness (January 6, 2015), with close contact with the secondary patient from January 10 to 14. The secondary patient became ill on January 17 without exposure to any live poultry market or direct contact with any poultry. Therefore, we believe that the most likely route of infection was human-to-human transmission for cluster 2.</p><p id="Par14">Gene mutations of the H7N9 virus have been demonstrated to change its pathogenicity, transmissibility, host adaption, and drug resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Amino acid substitutions in the PB2 protein (L89V, K526R, Q591K, E627K, and D701N), PB1-F2 protein (N66S), M1 protein (N30D and T215A), and NS1 protein (P42S and D92E) increased H7N9 virulence in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, and amino acid substitutions in the HA protein (G186V and Q226L), PB2 protein (D256G and K702R), PA protein (V100A, K356R, and S409N), and NS1 protein (N205S and G210R) altered species-associated signature positions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown that the PB1 I368V mutation may increase the transmissibility of the H7N9 virus in ferrets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, and the PB1 L589P mutation and the PA L336M mutation increase H7N9 viral replication in mammalian cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In addition, the NA mutations E119V, I22K/R, and R292K resulted in a reduction in the sensitivity of the H7N9 virus to NA inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, and the M2 S31N mutation may cause the H7N9 virus to become resistant to adamantine-derived drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par15">To analyze the virulence, transmissibility, drug-resistance, and antigenicity of the H7N9 virus from the family clusters, we performed an in-depth analysis of the genetic characteristics of the four H7N9 viruses. The four viral isolates from the two family clusters showed the features of the avian influenza A (H7N9) virus as reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, in terms of their transmissibility, pathogenicity, host adaptation, and antiviral drug resistance. In addition, our data indicated that the A/Fujian/18/2015 virus contained an additional HA G225D substitution (the receptor binding site), which binds preferentially to &#x003b1;2,6-linked sialic acids and may increase the likelihood of viral upper respiratory tract transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. It was reported that the HA G225D mutation in the H1N1 virus potentially contributes to the specificity of HA for the sialic acid receptor Sia(&#x003b1;2-6) Gal, thereby enabling the replication and transmission of the virus within and among humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. In addition, we found that all four isolates were resistant to amantadine and rimantadine because of the S31N substitution in the M2 protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. However, no substitutions were detected in the enzyme-active functional domains of the NA protein, suggesting that it is sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir. Thus, early clinical suspicions or confirmed cases of H7N9 virus infection and early administration of oseltamivir may help to reduce the severity of the disease. Since 2013, the HA and NA proteins of the H7N9 virus have maintained stable potential glycosylation sites, indicating that glycosylation may not be the factor affecting viral evolution and virulence.</p><p id="Par16">Our study has several limitations. First, the epidemiological data were collected primarily from the patients&#x02019; family members, which may cause a potential recall bias. Second, detailed exposure information is unavailable, such as the duration, frequency, and intensity of the exposure. Third, we detected the H7N9 virus in the poultry washing water and cage surface cleaning wipes sampled from the live-poultry markets that were close to the patients&#x02019; houses; however, the H7 and N9 gene sequences were not obtained, and, therefore, they were not available for the phylogenetic analysis of the H7N9 virus. Finally, paired serum samples should have been collected during the acute and convalescent stages of the patients and their contacts for further assessment of the potential for secondary human-to-human H7N9 virus transmission, including the potential identification of asymptomatic infections.</p><p id="Par17">In summary, the results of this study demonstrate that one family cluster was infected with H7N9 through exposure to the same live poultry or contaminated environments, and the other was more likely to be transmitted through the human-to-human route. Until now, there has been no stable and effective human-to-human transmission of H7N9 viruses; however, increasing evidence shows that the H7N9 virus has become better adapted to mammalian infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is of great importance to strengthen the surveillance of the H7N9 virus among poultry and humans, confirm the source of infections, trace and investigate close contacts with confirmed cases, complete viral isolation from H7N9 patients quickly, and emphasize individual protective interventions. In addition, virologic analyses to assess genetic changes of the H7N9 virus are of great value to determine the viral transmissibility among humans, as well as the pandemic potential.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p id="Par18">This study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the Fujian Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (FJCDC-20150001).
