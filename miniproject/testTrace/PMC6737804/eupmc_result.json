    "Background:HIV is a chronic disease with inflammatory reactions involving numerous elements of the immune system, resulting in an increased risk for other physical and psychiatric morbidities. Micronutrients, some of which possess anti-inflammatory properties, may help prevent the development of psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression in people living with HIV disease. Objectives:This study examined the profile of viral load, CD4 cell count, C-reactive protein, anxiety, and depression among highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-naive HIV-positive patients receiving micronutrient supplementation over a 6-month period. Materials and Methods:A total of ninety HAART-na√Øve HIV-infected patients completed the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale. Their blood samples were taken for serum viral load, CD4 cell count, and C-reactive protein at baseline. They all received a micronutrient supplement for 6 months, and 68 participants who remained in treatment at 6 months were reassessed with the same parameters. Results:After 6 months of micronutrient supplementation, the participants were found to have statistically significantly lower mean scores on the anxiety (t-test = 2.970, P = 0.003) and depression (t-test = 3.843, P = 0.001) subscales. They also had statistically significantly lower median CD4 cell count (P = 0.00) and C-reactive protein serum measures (P = 0.04). The median viral load decreased although the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion:Micronutrient supplementation may reduce inflammatory reactions, anxiety, and depression in HAART-naive HIV-infected persons."
