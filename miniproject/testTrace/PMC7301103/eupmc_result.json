    "Highlights • We document price reaction, volatility timing and performance of investment funds.• The price reaction reveals positive abnormal returns for social funds.• Our evidence suggests that social entrepreneurship funds exhibit volatility timing.• The performance metrics depicts resilience of this category of funds. In this paper we assess the price reaction, performance and volatility timing of European investment funds during the outbreak of Covid-19. We analyze the time period between January and June 2020 and demonstrate that while most of the investment funds exhibit stressed performance, social entrepreneurship funds endured resilience. This remained robust during various stages of the evolution of this contagion. The social funds also demonstrated volatility timing that was absent for most of their counterparts. We attribute the overall stability of these funds to their niche investments in social enterprises that specialize in providing innovative solutions for social issues."
