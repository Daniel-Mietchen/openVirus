Here, we developed a new simple qPCR mediated by high-fidelity (HF) DNA polymerase. The new method utilizes an HFman probe and one primer. Fluorescent signal was generated from the 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; hydrolysis of HFman probe by HF DNA polymerase before elongation initiation. Mismatches between probe/primer and template have less influence on the amplification efficiency of the new method. The new qPCR exhibited higher sensitivity and better adaptability to sequence variable templates than the conventional TaqMan probe based-qPCR in quantification of HIV-1 viral load. Further comparison with COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test (v2.0) showed a good correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.79) between both methods in quantification of HIV-1 viral load among 21 clinical samples. The characteristics of tolerance to variable templates and one probe-one primer system imply that the probe/primer design for the new method will be easier and more flexible than the conventional method for highly heterogeneous viruses. Therefore, the HF DNA polymerase-mediated qPCR method is a simple, sensitive and promising approach for the development of diagnostics for viral infectious diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Sensors and probes</kwd><kwd>Biotechnology</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was developed in early 1990s for the detection and quantification of nucleic acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, which is widely used in almost all fields of biomedical research, agriculture, food and environment sciences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.

RT-qPCR is usually accomplished by using either double-stranded DNA-binding dyes (e.g. SYBR green I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and SYTO9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> or fluorescence-based probes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The dsDNA-binding dyes are cheaper than reagents used in the probe-based methods; however, their non-specific binding to dsDNA may result in false positive results, and inaccurate quantification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, and thus limits their use in qPCR for qualification of gene expression and molecular diagnosis. There are three main types of fluorescence-based probes in qPCR, including hydrolysis probes (often called as TaqMan probes)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, hybridization probes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and molecular beacons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Some other types of probes, such as scorpion primers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, light upon extension (LUX) primers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and Amplifluor primers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> were also developed for qPCR. Among these new probe types, the TaqMan probes were the most widely used for the detection and quantification of nucleic acids, and often developed into commercial kits for clinical diagnosis. Molecular beacons were more often used in the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The detection and quantification of pathogens requires high sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. For qPCR, high sensitivity and specificity depend on the well-designed primers and probe that all bind to the highly conserved genomic regions of target pathogens. If the primers or probe bind to non-conserved genomic (e.i. highly variable) regions, amplification efficiency will be greatly reduced, which is a major reason for low detection sensitivity and specificity for some viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Currently, emerging and reemerging infectious diseases are a serious threat to global public health. More than 70% of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases are caused by viruses, and vast majority of human viruses (especially RNA viruses) have higher mutation rates than bacteria, fungi and other pathogens (e.g. mycoplasma and chlamydia). Because of high genetic variability, some viruses (e.g. HIV-1, HCV) are divided into genotypes or subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is more difficult to find highly conserved regions shared by all genotypes or subtypes of the same virus. It is harder to design and select appropriate qPCR primers and probes for virus detection with high detection sensitivity and specificity than for bacteria, fungi and other pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the qPCR requires a pair of primers and a TaqMan probe, and the probe length usually requires more than 25 nt to ensure relatively high Tm value (68&#x02013;70&#x02009;&#x000b0;C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, which further increase the difficulty of primer and probe design. Although MGB (minor groove binder) modification had been demonstrated to increase the stability of duplexes formed by probe and target, and allows shorter probes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, it is still a big challenge for the development of qPCR methods for high-efficient detection and quantification of all genotypes/subtypes of highly heterogenetic viruses such as HIV-1 and HCV.</p><p id="Par4">In this paper, we developed a new simple qPCR method that is mediated by high-fidelity DNA polymerase and utilizes a primer and a fluorescent primer (called as HFman probe). The new method allows the presence of mismatches between the 3-ends of the HFman probe/primer and the target sequence, it has better performance in quantification of gene expression and viral load than the conventional TaqMan probe-based qPCR. Tolerance to mismatches between primer/probe and target and the one primer-one HFman probe system simplified the method, improved the sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification of gene expression, and diagnosis of various pathogens (especially for viruses with high heterogeneity).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The principle of the novel real-time RT-PCR mediated by high-fidelity DNA polymerase</title><p id="Par5">High-fidelity DNA polymerase has a 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity to remove the mismatched bases from the 3&#x02032;-end of a newly synthesized DNA strand or primer. Various chemical modifications (e.g. phosphorylation, amination, and dideoxy nucleotide) at 3&#x02032;-end base or the 3&#x02032;-OH of the primer do not influence the removing (proof-reading) activity of the HF DNA polymerase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. A fluorescent probe (e.g. TaqMan probe) often contains a fluorophore and quencher group at 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; end of an oligonucleotide, respectively. The fluorophore- or quencher-modified base can be removed from the probe by HF DNA polymerase when the 3&#x02032;-base forms a mismatch with the template (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In fact, some HF DNA polymerase can non-specifically remove the 3&#x02032; modified or unmodified base and start extension even though no mismatch occurs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The removal of the fluorophore or quencher group from the probe results in the release of the fluorescent signal. Therefore, a probe can be used directly as a primer to initiate PCR amplification under the HF DNA polymerase and the emitted fluorescence during the amplification can be monitored during a real-time PCR amplification (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We call the new method as HF DNA polymerase mediated real-time PCR and defined the probe as HFman probe or fluorescent primer (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Compared with the conventional qPCR that requires a pair of primers and a probe, the new method needs only one HFman probe and one corresponding primer.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The principle of the novel real-time fluorescent PCR.

</p><p id="Par6">To prove the viability of the new method, we designed an HFman probe (N9-probe-1) and a primer for amplification of neuraminidase (NA) gene of H7N9 virus, and performed the new RT-qPCR assay. The N9-probe-1 has a fluorophore group at the 5&#x02032; end. As expected, an S-shape amplification curve was observed in the positive reaction but not in the negative control (data not shown), indicating the new method works.</p><p id="Par7">In the conventional qPCR, because the cleavage of TaqMan probe is from 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; by Taq DNA polymerase, the fluorophore group is usually labelled at the 5&#x02032; end of the probe to increase the emission of fluorescence. For HFman probe, fluorophore group is allowed to be labelled at either 5&#x02032; end or 3&#x02032;end. However, because only bases at the 3'-end of HFman probe can be removed by HF DNA polymerase, a 3&#x02032; fluorophore labelling is thought to be more efficient than a 5&#x02032; fluorophore labelling. To prove this hypothesis, we designed N9-probe-2 that has a fluorophore group at the 3&#x02032; end, and performed a comparison between N9-probe-1 and N9-probe-2. The result showed that the reaction with N9-probe-2 had an earlier amplification curve with stronger fluorescence signal than that with N9-probe-1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), supporting a HFman probe with a 3&#x02032;-fluorophore group is more efficient than that with 5&#x02032;-fluorophore group.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Performance of the novel method using probes labelled by different fluorescent dyes.

</p><p id="Par8">RT-qPCR can be carried out in singleplex or multiplex formats. Multiplex RT-qPCR has more widespread application than a singleplex format in molecular diagnostics of infectious diseases (especially for co-infection and multiple infections). To test the possibility of using the new qPCR method in a multiplex format, we designed a <italic>&#x003b2;-actin</italic>-specific HFman probe&#x000a0;that was labelled individually with four different fluorescent dyes at 5&#x02032; end.

The four dyes can emit fluorescence signals at different wavelengthes that are monitored in different fluorescent channels, and are widely used in the Multiplex RT-qPCR assay. Four good amplification curves were observed in different fluorescent channels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), indicating that HF DNA polymerase recognize HFman probe labelled with different fluorophore and quencher groups. These results imply that the new qPCR can be developed into a multiplex format.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Optimization of the reaction system</title><p id="Par9">To assess the performance of various HF DNA polymerases and select the best one for the new qPCR method, we tested seven different commercially available HF DNA polymerases. Although various enzymes have different fidelities, all seven HF DNA polymerases worked in the new qPCR system (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The Q5 enzyme was selected for subsequent experiments because of more rapid amplification (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">To obtain the best performance of the new qPCR, we first optimized the concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub> by adding 0 to 4 mM of MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The results showed that increasing amount of MgCl<sub>2</sub> enhanced the total fluorescence signal intensity at the amplification plateau period, but did not improve the amplification efficiency (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2a</xref>). We selected 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> for subsequent analysis. We further optimized the concentration and proportion of HFman probe to the primer. The concentrations of HFman probe and primer were from 0.1&#x02013;0.4&#x02009;&#x000b5;M and 0.2&#x02013;0.4&#x02009;&#x000b5;M, respectively, and the proportions of HFman probe to the primer were from 1:1 to 1:4 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2b</xref>).

About 70% infectious diseases are caused by viruses that have higher mutation rates than bacteria and other non-viral pathogens. Therefore, it is difficult to find absolutely conserved genomic regions of some viruses (e.g. HIV-1) for primer and probe design. The presence of mismatch between primer/probe and template reduces the amplification efficiency and sensitivity of RT-qPCR, although the use of degenerate primers can slightly improve the assay. The principle of the new qPCR method mediated by the HF DNA polymerase requires the presence of mismatch to initiate the 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; exonuclease activity of HF enzyme for removing the 3&#x02032; fluorophore- or quencher-modified base from the probe. Therefore, the new RT-qPCR is essentially resistant to mutations existent in templates.</p><p id="Par12">To address this hypothesis, we designed and constructed several mutant <italic>&#x003b2;-actin</italic> RNA templates that form mismatches with the 3&#x02032;-end of the HFman probe or primer (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). All mutants and wild-type can be amplified with a slightly different efficiency (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The template without mismatch and with one mismatch at the 3&#x02032;-last base of the probe showed slightly higher amplification efficiency than those with a mismatch at the second last 3&#x02032;-base of the probe. The templates forming mismatch with HFman probe have slightly higher efficiency than those forming mismatch with the reverse primer, possibly due to the mismatch between reverse primer and RNA templates which limits the speed of reverse transcription. To further test the effect of various mismatches between HFman probe and template on amplification efficiency, we synthesized four HFman probe with different bases at 3-end (Probe-A, -G, -C, and -T), and constructed four RNA templates that completely match to each of the probes (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). The probe has HEX and BHQ1 in the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; end, respectively.

To increase the comparability, the forward primer of the conventional method shares identical sequence with the HFman probe, and an additional TaqMan probe was designed for the conventional method. For the wild template, although the curve of the new method appeared slightly earlier and had stronger fluorescent signal than that of the conventional method, the amplification curves produced by both methods are close to each other (Ct: 23.56 vs. 27.58), supporting the idea that both methods are comparable. When the mutant template was used, the curve (Ct&#x02009;=&#x02009;17.98) produced by the new method was obviously earlier and the fluorescent signal was substantially stronger than that by the conventional method (Ct&#x02009;=&#x02009;26.35) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). In particular, the new method produced similar curves between wild and mutant templates (Ct: 17.11 vs 17.98), while the conventional method produced an obviously later curve (Ct&#x02009;=&#x02009;26.35) with lower fluorescent signal for mutant template than for wild template (Ct&#x02009;=&#x02009;18.77) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).

We designed two allele-specific HFman probes (ALDH-probe-G and ALDH-probe-A) and a reverse primer for the detection of SNP rs671 of ALDH2.

According to the principle, the RT-qPCR with ALDH-probe-G can amplify the mutant type (AA), but not or inefficiently amplify the wild type of ALDH2 (GG). In contrast, the reaction with ALDH-probe-A can amplify the wild type (GG), but not or inefficiently amplify the mutant type of ALDH2 (AA). Both reactions can amplify the heterozygous type (GA). Comparison of the amplification curves showed that the curve with ALDH-probe-A was obviously earlier than that with ALDH-probe-G for homozygous allele GG, later for homozygous allele AA and similar to each other for heterozygous GA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).

Rapid diagnosis of involved pathogens plays a crucial role in the prevention and control of infectious diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Various new methods were developed for the detection and diagnostics of infectious diseases in the last two decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. However, because of low sensitivity, low specificity, time-consuming and labor-consuming, and high costs, the practical application and commercial development of most methods are limited. To date, TaqMan probe-based qPCR is still the most robust method used in the detection and diagnostics of infectious diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">Conventional TaqMan probe-based qPCR is mediated by Taq DNA polymerase and requires a pair of primers and a probe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. To archive highly sensitivity and broad spectrum for highly heterogenetic viruses, the primers and probe should target the most conserved genomic regions of the involved viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the TaqMan probe-based qPCR often limits the amplicon length between 50&#x02013;150&#x02009;bps to achieve high amplification efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. For highly heterogenetic viruses, however, it is very difficult to find three completely conserved regions in a relative short genomic region that satisfy the criteria of primer and probe design. Although degenerate primers and MGB-modified probe were used to reduce the influence of mismatches of primer or probe with target on amplification efficiency, to develop highly accurate, sensitive and board spectrum detection method for highly variable viruses is still a big challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par22">In this study, we developed a novel, simple real-time qPCR mediated by high-fidelity DNA polymerase. Different from the conventional qPCR, the new qPCR only needs one primer and an HFman probe (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The generation of fluorescent signal was mediated by HF DNA polymerase that separates the fluorophore and quencher by the 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; hydrolysis of HFman probe. In principle, the HF DNA polymerase only removes the mismatched nucleotide from the primer or probe by its 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; exonuclease activity (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, majority of the HF DNA polymerases show non-specific 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; exonuclease activity and also remove the completely matched 3&#x02032;-base of HFman probe possibly due to the modification of fluorophore or quencher activate the 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; exonuclease activity of HF DNA polymerase (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Therefore, regardless of match or mismatch between HFman/primer and target template, the new qPCR exhibits similar amplification efficiencies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), indicating that the new method adapts well to the amplification of various mutation templates. These imply that the new HFman probe-based method is more efficient for the detection of highly variable viruses than the conventional TaqMan probe-based qPCR. Additionally, the new method has similar amplification efficiencies for different sizes (from 55 to 250 bps) of amplicons (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>), and does not require an HFman with 10&#x02009;&#x000b0;C higher Tm value than that of primers (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). These make the primer and probe design easier and more flexible because the new method requires one HFman probe and one primer, whereas the conventional qPCR method requires one TaqMan probe and a pair of primers (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). One major limitation in the primer and probe selection for the new method is that it does not allow the formation of primer dimers which may result in non-specific result.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The comparison of the HFman probe-based qPCR with Taqman probe-based qPCR.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Features</th><th>Taqman probe-based qPCR</th><th>HFman probe-based qPCR</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Primer and probe</td><td>One pair of primers and one probe (TaqMan)</td><td>One primer and one probe (HFman)</td></tr><tr><td>Enzyme</td><td>Taq DNA polymerase</td><td>High fidelity DNA polymerase</td></tr><tr><td>Tolerance to mismatch between primer/probe and template (variable templates)</td><td>No, not allow mismatch</td><td>Yes, the mismatch initiates better elongation.</td></tr><tr><td>Optimal amplicon size (bps)</td><td>50&#x02013;150 bps</td><td>55&#x02013;250 bps</td></tr><tr><td>Optimal length of probe</td><td>25&#x02013;32 nt</td><td>20&#x02013;30 nt</td></tr><tr><td>Tm value of Taqman probe</td><td>68&#x02013;70&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (at least 10&#x02009;&#x000b0;C higher than that of the primers)</td><td>&#x0003e; 55&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (similar to that of the primer)</td></tr><tr><td>Primer dimers</td><td>Allowance</td><td>No allowance</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

All these samples could be detected by the Roche kit (VL: from 189 to 6010000 copies/ml) and our new method (VL: from 110 to 3781285 copies/ml) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>), and a good correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.79) was observed between both methods (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). In particular, our method detected 12 sample with higher viral loads than the Roche kit, possibly due to the well adaptation of our method to various variants.
