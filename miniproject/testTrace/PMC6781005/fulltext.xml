MAYV was first described in 1954 in Trinidad (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Causey and Maroja, 1957</xref>) and now circulates in the Caribbean Islands and South America (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Causey and Maroja, 1957</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Pinheiro et al., 1981</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Azevedo et al., 2009</xref>). MAYV infection causes an acute febrile illness that initially is indistinguishable from other arboviruses, including chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue, and Zika viruses. A study of a MAYV outbreak in Brazil showed a high incidence of severe arthralgia (55%) and myalgia (49%), which can persist for months to years (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Mour&#x000e3;o et al., 2012</xref>). There are no vaccines or therapeutics available for the prevention or treatment of MAYV infection.</p><p>MAYV is transmitted principally by <italic>Haemagogus</italic> species mosquitoes among primates in a sylvatic cycle, with intermittent spillover to human populations. However, there is concern that even single mutations in MAYV could lead to changes in vector competence, as occurred with CHIKV in La Reunion Island in 2006. In that case, CHIKV acquired the ability to infect <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes more efficiently, which resulted in an urban transmission cycle (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Tsetsarkin et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes can be infected by MAYV, although the levels of virus in blood required for transmission from viremic humans are considered insufficient for epidemic transmission (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Brustolin et al., 2018</xref>). In comparison, four different <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes can transmit MAYV (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Brustolin et al., 2018</xref>). As these species are native to distinct geographic regions (Africa, Asia, and North America), they could facilitate the global spread of MAYV.</p><p>The MAYV genome encodes for four nonstructural proteins (nsp1&#x02013;nsp4) and five structural proteins (capsid, E3, E2, 6K, and E1). Alphavirus envelope glycoproteins associate in the endoplasmic reticulum and form a heterotrimer comprised of the E3, E2, and E1 proteins (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Carleton et al., 1997</xref>). E3 is cleaved by furin-like proteases during the maturation process in the trans-Golgi network (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Heidner et al., 1996</xref>). The mature alphavirus virion is &#x0223c;700 &#x000c5; in diameter and contains a lipid bilayer with 240 E2&#x02013;E1 heterodimers assembled into 80 trimeric spikes with T = 4 icosahedral symmetry (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Paredes et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kostyuchenko et al., 2011</xref>) and a nucleocapsid containing a single copy of genomic RNA. As the E1 and E2 glycoproteins are displayed prominently on the viral spike, they are targets of antibody responses.</p><p>Although mAbs that specifically bind the envelope glycoproteins of MAYV have not yet been described, others generated in the context of immunization with CHIKV antigens have shown cross-reactivity and cross-neutralizing activity with MAYV (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 2015</xref>). In the context of human polyclonal antibody responses to MAYV, antibody responses to E1 and E2 proteins have been detected, with greater cross-reactivity among those recognizing E2 (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). However, these studies have not fully elucidated the epitopes and mechanisms by which antibodies against MAYV are protective in vivo.</p><p>Here, we produced and characterized a panel of 18 neutralizing anti-MAYV mAbs after immunizing mice with infectious virus and recombinant MAYV E2 protein. 11 of these anti-MAYV mAbs showed exceptional potency in cell culture with half-maximal effective inhibitory concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of &#x0003c;10 ng/ml. All but two of these antibodies were capable of neutralizing 11 different strains of MAYV that we tested. Several anti-MAYV mAbs cross-neutralized related arthritogenic alphaviruses, including CHIKV, Una virus (UNAV), Ross River virus (RRV), and O&#x02019;nyong&#x02019;nyong virus (ONNV), whereas others were MAYV specific. Our neutralizing anti-MAYV mAbs generally blocked infection at a postattachment step, preventing fusion of virus&#x02013;host membranes and impairing viral egress. Epitope mapping analyses revealed that 16 of the mAbs bound epitopes in the B domain of the E2 glycoprotein, with two others recognizing a site in the E1 glycoprotein proximal to the fusion loop (FL) peptide. A subset of the strongly neutralizing mAbs protected mice from lethal MAYV challenge and virus-induced joint swelling and dissemination. Despite the potent neutralizing activity observed in cell culture, protection required fragment crystallizable (Fc) effector functions, since isotype-switched or aglycosyl variants with less or no capacity to interact with the complement component C1q or activating Fc-&#x003b3; receptors (Fc&#x003b3;R) lost protective activity in vivo. Our results in mice suggest that strategies to induce highly protective antibodies against MAYV may require designs that optimize both neutralizing activity and Fc effector functions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s02"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03"><title>Generation of anti-MAYV mAbs</title><p>We inoculated BALB/c mice with MAYV strain CH and boosted twice with recombinant, bacterially produced MAYV E2 ectodomain (amino acids 1&#x02013;340) in Freund&#x02019;s incomplete adjuvant and then one additional time with MAYV-CH (see Materials and methods), as we did to generate anti-CHIKV mAbs (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Pal et al., 2013</xref>). Serum had neutralization titers in cell culture of &#x0003e;1/10,000 against MAYV-CH. After a final intravenous boost with MAYV-CH, we performed splenocyte-myeloma fusions from four mice. Subsequently, 151 anti-MAYV mAbs were subcloned and isolated. Supernatant from 18 of these hybridomas contained antibodies that reduced MAYV infection by &#x0003e;80% in Vero cells. These mAbs were isotyped (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and purified by protein A affinity chromatography.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Anti-MAYV mAbs</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col width="8%" span="1"/><col width="6%" span="1"/><col width="8.081%" span="1"/><col width="7.919%" span="1"/><col width="7%" span="1"/><col width="7%" span="1"/><col width="7.071%" span="1"/><col width="6.929%" span="1"/><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="8.083%" span="1"/><col width="7.917%" span="1"/><col width="7%" span="1"/><col width="7%" span="1"/><col width="7%" span="1"/><thead><tr><th align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Antibody</bold></th><th align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Isotype</bold></th><th align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>K<sub>D, equilibrium</sub></bold></th><th align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>CH</bold></th><th align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>BeH407</bold></th><th align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>FSB0311</bold></th><th align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>IQU2950</bold></th><th align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>OBS2209</bold></th><th align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Uruma</bold></th><th align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>BeH343155</bold></th><th align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>BeH506151</bold></th><th align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>TRVL15537</bold></th><th align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>BeH473130</bold></th><th align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>BeH428890</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MAY-115</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">IgG2a</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n.b.</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>2 (1&#x02013;4)</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>2 (1&#x02013;3)</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>5 (3&#x02013;9)</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>7 (4&#x02013;14)</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>9 (5&#x02013;17)</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>1 (1&#x02013;3)</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">166 (93&#x02013;102)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">33 (14&#x02013;67)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">32 (17&#x02013;61)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">64 (36&#x02013;115)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">92 (54&#x02013;146)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MAY-116</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">IgG1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20 &#x000b1;

These strains exhibit a high degree of amino acid sequence identity in the E1 (94&#x02013;100%; Fig. S2) and E2 (96&#x02013;100%; Fig. S3) glycoproteins. Only a single strain in the N genotype exists (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Auguste et al., 2015</xref>), and it was not available to us for evaluation. 11 of the 18 mAbs potently inhibited infection of MAYV-CH (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>) and the majority neutralized a range of MAYV strains from the D and L genotypes. Only two mAbs showed a complete loss of neutralization activity against one or more MAYV strains (MAY-133: Uruma strain; and MAY-140: FSB0311, OBS6443, and BeH473130 strains; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For others, a &#x0003e;10-fold decrease in inhibitory activity against different MAYV strains compared with MAYV-CH was observed with 13 of the 18 mAbs. Only mAbs MAY-116, MAY-122, MAY-131, MAY-146, and MAY-151 maintained potency (&#x0003c;10-fold reduction in EC<sub>50</sub> values compared with CH strain) across all tested MAYV strains (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We also performed neutralization assays with MAYV-BeH407 in C2C12 myoblast and embryonic fibroblast cells and observed similar inhibitory activity (Fig. S1). Because our vaccination strategy included boosting with recombinant E2 protein, we measured antibody affinity to E2 protein using biolayer interferometry (BLI; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and S2). The K<sub>D, equilibrium</sub> (equilibrium dissociation constant) rate for the mAbs ranged from 3 to 243 nM, with eight demonstrating high-affinity monovalent binding of &#x0003c;20 nM. MAY-115 and MAY-131 had no detectable binding to E2, suggesting they recognized a different structural protein (i.e., E1) or a quaternary epitope on E2 displayed exclusively on the virion. MAY-122, likely the most consistently potent neutralizing antibody across all MAYV strains, had the second highest affinity, with a K<sub>D</sub> of 4 nM.</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Anti-MAYV mAbs neutralize strains from both D and L genotypes</bold>. <bold>(A)</bold> Viral strains were subjected to next-generation sequencing.

All anti-MAYV mAbs tested potently inhibited infection when added before virus attachment to cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>), as expected. The mAbs also had similar EC<sub>50</sub> values when added after virus attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). As these results suggested that mAb inhibition occurred after virus binding to cells, we assessed their capacity to block viral fusion. We performed fusion-from-without (FFWO) assays (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Edwards and Brown, 1986</xref>). MAYV was bound to target cells at 4&#x000b0;C before addition of mAbs.

After pH neutralization, cells were incubated in medium supplemented with 20 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl to prevent MAYV fusion via canonical endosomal pathways. After 18 h, cells were stained for intracellular MAYV E2 proteins. As expected, neutral pH medium did not result in expression of MAYV E2 antigen, as plasma membrane fusion did not occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). However, a short exposure of cell surface&#x02013;adsorbed virus to acidic pH resulted in viral fusion and MAYV E2 antigen expression, and 16 of the 18 mAbs blocked this, whereas the isotype control mAbs did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>).</p><p>We evaluated whether anti-MAYV neutralizing mAbs could block viral egress, presumably by binding to structural glycoproteins on the plasma membrane and inhibiting assembly or budding (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Vero cells were transfected with RNA isolated from MAYV-infected cells.

At 1 h, the levels of viral RNA in the supernatant were at the limit of detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 G</xref>), indicating an absence of de novo synthesized and secreted virions. By 6 h, however, a 10,000-fold increase in encapsidated viral RNA was observed in the supernatant of the isotype control mAb&#x02013;treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 G</xref>). All of the mAbs tested, except MAY-125 and MAY-133, diminished the amount of viral RNA in the supernatant at doses of 10 &#x000b5;g/ml, suggesting a capacity to block MAYV egress. The potency of this inhibition was variable among the mAbs tested, as 11 of the 18 mAbs lost the ability to inhibit egress when a concentration of 0.1 &#x000b5;g/ml was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s06"><title>Epitope mapping of anti-MAYV mAbs</title><p>Our BLI data indicated that the majority of mAbs bound to the E2 protein (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and S2).

Of the 18 mAbs tested, 16 bound to the E2 B domain by ELISA (Fig. S4, A and B). We used two methods to map these B domain&#x02013;specific mAbs at the amino acid level: (1) mAb binding to recombinant E2 proteins produced with substitutions in predicted solvent-exposed amino acids in the B domain (based on the CHIKV pE2-E1 structure; PDB: <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="3N42">3N42</ext-link>) from nonconserved residues present in other alphaviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A&#x02013;C</xref>; and Fig. S4 C); and (2) alanine scanning mutagenesis of the E2 B domain in the context of the full-length structural polyprotein (C-E3-E2-6K-E1). 293T cells were transfected with plasmids containing a single alanine substitution in residues 173&#x02013;231 of the E2 protein, except at position 227, when the alanine was substituted to serine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, D&#x02013;F</xref>; and Fig. S4 D). The 16 mAbs mapped to three regions within the E2 B domain: residues 181&#x02013;190 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A, D, and G</xref>; blue), 205&#x02013;211 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, B, E, and G</xref>; red), and 214&#x02013;218 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, C, F, and G</xref>; green). A majority of the mAbs bound to one of two loops (amino acids 179&#x02013;186 and 212&#x02013;218) that are predicted to protrude from the E2&#x02013;E1 heterodimer. We made additional charge substitutions in these loops to determine if secondary structure was important for mAb binding. Whereas mutations to residues T212 and T213 impacted protein expression and could not be evaluated, the remaining mutations in these loops led to decreased binding of the mAbs mapping to these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, D and F</xref>; and Fig. S4 D). In several instances, charge mutations led to loss of mAb binding when alanine mutations did not. Likely, the mAbs do not recognize these residues directly but rather the chemical properties of the amino acid side chains maintain the architecture of the loop and preserve the epitopes.</p><fig id="fig4" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Mapping of neutralizing anti-MAYV mAbs to sites within E1 and E2 proteins</bold>. <bold>(A&#x02013;C)</bold> Solvent-exposed residues on the MAYV E2 B domain were changed to the indicated amino acids.

Because the protective IgG2a mAbs against MAYV bound avidly to viral antigens on the surface of infected cells (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), we hypothesized that optimal in vivo activity required Fc effector functions of the antibody and recognition of viral proteins on the plasma membrane. To begin to evaluate the contribution of Fc effector functions to protection, we tested the ability of anti-MAYV mAbs to promote neutrophil and monocyte-dependent phagocytosis of beads coated with recombinant MAYV E2 protein; we were unable to express MAYV E1 protein and thus could not interrogate anti-E1 mAbs for these studies. Several of the protective anti-MAYV E2 mAbs (e.g., MAY-122, MAY-133, and MAY-134) promoted phagocytosis of MAYV antigen&#x02013;coated beads in murine neutrophils and monocytes (Fig. S5, A and B).

We also cloned the variable regions of MAY-115 and MAY-134 as human IgG1 antibodies, which have comparable binding to mouse Fc&#x003b3;R I and Fc&#x003b3;R IV as mIgG2a (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Dekkers et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, we generated an aglycosyl variant of human IgG1 (N297Q) that abrogates binding to Fc&#x003b3;R and C1q (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Tao and Morrison, 1989</xref>). We first tested the binding of the isotype-switched mAbs to mouse and human Fc&#x003b3;Rs by ELISA; we observed little or no binding of mouse IgG1 and human IgG1-N297Q antibodies to mouse Fc&#x003b3;R I, mouse Fc&#x003b3;R III, mouse Fc&#x003b3;R IV, human Fc&#x003b3;R I, and human Fc&#x003b3;R IIIa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>). Human IgG1 mAbs bound to mouse Fc&#x003b3;R I and Fc&#x003b3;R IV similarly to mouse IgG2a but showed less binding to mouse Fc&#x003b3;R III. FRNT assays confirmed that isotype-switched mAbs retained neutralizing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, C and D</xref>).

When switched from mouse IgG2a to IgG1, both MAY-115 and MAY-134 lost their ability to fully protect mice, with 60% of animals succumbing in each case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, F and H</xref>). Human IgG1 isotype-switched variants of MAY-115 and MAYV-134 exhibited slightly reduced activity in vivo compared with mouse IgG2a but were more protective than mouse IgG1 or human IgG1-N297Q mAbs. Combination therapy experiments showed decreased efficacy when one of the two mAbs was a human IgG1-N297Q variant, suggesting that protection depends on effector functions of both mAbs (Fig. S5 D). In the musculoskeletal disease model, all isotype-switched mAbs reduced joint swelling in the ipsilateral foot compared with isotype control mAbs, although differences were apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, G and I</xref>). Whereas mouse IgG2a and human IgG1 forms of MAY-115 and MAY-134 mAbs prevented swelling completely, mouse IgG1 and human IgG1-N297Q variants showed only partial decreases in swelling. We observed roughly equivalent half-lives of all of the isotype-switched mAbs we tested (Fig. S5, E&#x02013;J), which indicated that the decreased protection observed with particular mAb variants was not due to more rapid clearance in vivo.</p><p>Even though many of our IgG1 mAbs had similarly potent neutralizing activity against MAYV compared with IgG2a mAbs, they failed to protect against lethal challenge. To corroborate a key role for IgG subclass in protection against MAYV, we switched the isotype of MAY-117 and MAY-130, two nonprotective neutralizing mAbs, from mouse IgG1 to human IgG1, which engage Fc&#x003b3;Rs weakly and strongly, respectively. The isotype-switched mAbs had similar neutralization activity against MAYV BeH407 as the parental mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, J and K</xref>). As expected, uniform mortality was seen in MAYV-infected mice treated with the mouse IgG1 forms of MAY-117 or MAY-130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 L</xref>). In contrast, we observed significant protection against lethal MAYV challenge when mAbs MAY-117 or MAY-130 of the human IgG1 isotype was administered. These experiments confirm that effector functions contribute to optimal antibody-mediated protection of mice from lethal MAYV infection.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s10"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our goal was to produce type-specific and broadly neutralizing mAbs that have therapeutic utility and can shed light on the requisite components of a protective humoral immune response against MAYV. We generated 151 hybridomas and identified 18 that produced mAbs with potent neutralizing activity. Of these, 11 had &#x0201c;elite&#x0201d; activity, with EC<sub>50</sub> values against the immunizing MAYV strain of &#x0003c;10 ng/ml. 16 of these mAbs neutralized the closely related UNAV, with a smaller subset showing a breadth of inhibitory activity against the more distant CHIKV, RRV, and ONNV.</p><p>Although many mAbs neutralized a broad spectrum of MAYV isolates from both the D and L genotypes, there were exceptions. MAY-133 had no neutralizing activity against MAYV-Uruma, and MAY-140 lacked activity against MAYV-FSB0311, MAYV-OBS6443, and MAYV-BeH473130. This observation was unexpected, because both mAbs engage residues (for MAY-133: Q183, Q184, I190, G209, T210, I217, N218, and D223; for MAY-140: Q183, I190, G209, T210, I217, and D223) on the E2 protein that are shared by other mAbs that neutralized all MAYV strains and even some other alphaviruses. Indeed, these interaction residues are conserved across all MAYV strains that we tested. Although further studies are warranted, we hypothesize that the display of particular residues on E2 varies in a strain-dependent manner, which could affect neutralization by a given antibody. Thus, substitutions in the envelope proteins of Uruma, FSB0311, OBS6443, and BeH473130 strains of MAYV could affect epitope exposure, as has been described for flaviviruses (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Austin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Goo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez et al., 2018</xref>). Analysis of the virion structures of these different MAYV strains and the display of their structural glycoproteins may elucidate why certain antibodies fail to neutralize individual viruses even though their binding residues appear conserved.</p><p>The neutralizing mAbs that we characterized all blocked virus entry at postattachment steps. Only mAbs MAY-117 and MAY-122 showed nominal blocking of viral binding to cells, and these mAbs also blocked postattachment entry steps. The majority of the mAbs, with the exception of MAY-120 and MAY-122, inhibited plasma membrane fusion. These results are similar to studies with other alphaviruses, including CHIKV (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), Venezuelan equine encephalitis (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Porta et al., 2014</xref>), and eastern equine encephalitis virus (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2019</xref>), indicating that potently neutralizing mAbs may share a common mechanism of action. Indeed, all of the strongly inhibitory mAbs we analyzed bound to regions in E2 and E1 that are proximal to the FL peptide. While entry blockade likely contributed to the potency of virus neutralization, 16 of the 18 mAbs also inhibited viral egress. This activity may occur as a result of cross-linking of adjacent E protein complexes at the cell surface and/or conformational shifts induced by anti-B domain antibodies (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) that prevent budding from infected cells. As the regions in E1 and in the B domain of E2 to which our mAbs mapped are conserved among MAYV strains, they could be targeted by vaccines to induce broadly inhibitory humoral responses against MAYV and closely related viruses.</p><p>Although all of the neutralizing E2-specific anti-MAYV mAbs that we mapped localized to the B domain, it is likely that that neutralizing epitopes also exist in the A domain. Neutralizing mAbs that bind to the A domain of E2 of CHIKV (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2015</xref>) and eastern equine encephalitis virus (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2019</xref>) have been described. Furthermore, vaccine-generated anti-MAYV-neutralizing antibodies preferentially bound to epitopes within the A domain of E2 (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2019</xref>). Our isolation of B rather than A domain mAbs may be a product of our vaccination strategy. Although the initial immunization and the final boosts were performed with infectious virus, we boosted with recombinant E2 protein, which may have skewed the immune response toward B domain antibodies. Analysis of the antibody responses of different mouse strains or naturally infected humans will be necessary to establish the immunodominance of neutralizing epitopes in the MAYV envelope proteins.</p><p>The neutralizing mAbs showed disparate levels of protection in mice. Although many had exceptional neutralizing potency in cell culture, only 8 of the 18 mAbs conferred significant protection in vivo. In this subset, there were differing levels of protection ranging from partial to complete protection (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), and there was no correlation with the shape of the neutralization curve or presence of a resistant fraction. The most protective anti-E2 mAbs bound viral antigen on the surface of infected cells with high avidity and promoted phagocytosis of E2 protein&#x02013;coated beads by both neutrophils and monocytes. These results are consistent with prior studies with the related Sindbis and Semliki Forest viruses, which showed that nonneutralizing mAbs can protect against lethal infection (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Schmaljohn et al., 1982</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Wust et al., 1987</xref>). We observed a preliminary correlation with protection in vivo and dominant afucosylated, digalactosylated, and sialylated glycan specifies (sialic acid: G2S2 and G2S1). The cytotoxic function of afucosylated glycans, which enhance Fc-effector function, coupled to enhanced galactosylation/sialylation, which dampen inflammation (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kaneko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anthony et al., 2008</xref>), may promote optimal viral clearance and minimize pathology. Further glycan analysis and protection data with a larger panel of anti-MAYV mAbs is needed to corroborate these results, as was performed with anti-Ebola virus mAbs (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Saphire et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Antibody protection against lethal challenge and musculoskeletal disease required Fc effector functions, albeit the latter to a lesser degree. Our 18 neutralizing mAbs were composed of two IgG subclasses: 10 IgG1 and 8 IgG2a. Remarkably, only the IgG2a anti-MAYV mAbs conferred substantial protection against lethal challenge. Mouse IgG2a antibodies not only interact with more Fc&#x003b3;Rs on immune cells but also bind specific receptors (e.g., Fc&#x003b3;R I) with higher affinity than IgG1 (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Mancardi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Dekkers et al., 2017</xref>). The capacity for an IgG subclass to engage Fc&#x003b3;Rs correlated with in vivo activity, as MAY-115 and MAY-134 were more protective as IgG2a than IgG1 antibodies even though their neutralizing activity in vitro and half-lives in vivo were essentially equivalent. The dependence of protection on effector function was corroborated by comparing isotype-switched anti-MAYV human IgG1 variants with and without (N297Q) heavy-chain N-linked glycosylation. Moreover, nonprotective mouse IgG1 mAbs (MAY-117 and MAY-130) became protective when they were switched to a human IgG1 subclass, which engages activating Fc&#x003b3;Rs more efficiently. The contribution of Fc&#x003b3;Rs to anti-MAYV-mediated protection was confirmed through challenge studies in mice lacking all activating Fc&#x003b3;Rs. Antibody recognition of MAYV or other alphavirus antigens on the cell surface may be an important mechanism for clearance of infected cells through Fc effector&#x02013;function dependent phagocytosis or cytolysis by specific myeloid cell subsets (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 2019</xref>). Studies are planned to define the dominant effector functions and individual Fc&#x003b3;Rs that contribute to mAb protection in our MAYV models, as has been performed to varying degrees with antibodies against influenza (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">DiLillo et al., 2014</xref>), hepatitis B (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>), human immunodeficiency virus (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hessell et al., 2007</xref>), West Nile virus (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Vogt et al., 2011</xref>), and CHIKV (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 2019</xref>). Experiments are needed to determine if other IgG subclasses (e.g., mouse IgG2b, human IgG2, and human IgG3) confer protection against MAYV in these models and whether there is an impact of C1q, which differentially binds IgG subclasses, on protection. Finally, our combination therapy studies with MAY-115 and MAY-134, which bind discrete epitopes on E1 and E2 proteins, suggest that inclusion of multiple mAbs in a cocktail likely will confer greater protection than either constituent alone. This effect could be due to synergy of neutralization, effector functions, or the control of resistance against either of the two individual mAbs (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Pal et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Antibodies with similar neutralization profiles and mechanisms of action did not protect mice from MAYV infection equivalently. Thus, the importance of IgG subclass and effector function activity likely should be optimized for vaccines or therapeutic antibodies against MAYV and other alphavirus infections. Three candidate MAYV vaccines have been described, including a chemically inactivated virion (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al., 1976</xref>), a live-attenuated virus (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Weise et al., 2014</xref>), and a DNA plasmid vaccine (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2019</xref>). Although all protected in mice, the antibody repertoires were not fully analyzed. Whereas the DNA plasmid vaccine produced IgG2a antibodies in mice, the majority were against epitopes on E1 and E2 not identified in our screens. Our results in mice suggest than immunization strategies that use protein scaffolds (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Correia et al., 2014</xref>) and specific T<sub>H</sub>1-skewing adjuvants could target regions in the B domain of E2, the FL of E1, and possibly other sites to generate neutralizing antibodies that block viral fusion and egress and optimize Fc effector functions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s11"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s12"><title>Animal ethics statement</title><p>All animal experiments and procedures were performed in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.

Briefly, mAbs were purified using protein G magnetic beads (New England Biolabs) and then treated with IdeZ protease (New England Biolabs) to release the antibody Fab portion. The Fc-attached beads were washed, and N-glycans were removed from the Fc domains and labeled with 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (APTS) using the GlycanAssure APTS Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), as described in the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. Labeled glycans were loaded onto the 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peaks for differentially galactosylated, fucosylated, bisected (GlcNAc), and sialylated structures were identified (13 peaks were reproducibly observed). The relative abundance of each glycan structure was determined by calculating the area under the curve, normalized for equal amounts of loaded APTS dye, of each peak divided by the total area of all peaks.</p></sec><sec id="s36"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical significance was assigned with P values &#x0003c;0.05 using GraphPad Prism version 7.0.
