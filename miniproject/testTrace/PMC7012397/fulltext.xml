We paired epidemiological data from public health investigations with analysis of mumps virus whole genome sequences from 201 infected individuals, focusing on Massachusetts university communities. Our analysis suggests continuous, undetected circulation of mumps locally and nationally, including multiple independent introductions into Massachusetts and into individual communities. Despite the presence of these multiple mumps virus lineages, the genomic data show that one lineage has dominated in the US since at least 2006. Widespread transmission was surprising given high vaccination rates, but we found no genetic evidence that variants arising during this outbreak contributed to vaccine escape. Viral genomic data allowed us to reconstruct mumps transmission links not evident from epidemiological data or standard single-gene surveillance efforts and also revealed connections between apparently unrelated mumps outbreaks.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>A study of recent mumps outbreaks in the United States reveals transmission patterns within and between Massachusetts communities and highlights the importance of combining detailed genomic and epidemiological data, both locally and nationwide.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19AI110818</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54GM088558</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lewnard</surname><given-names>Joseph A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007753</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4576-8772</contrib-id><name><surname>Byrne</surname><given-names>Elizabeth H.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Funding was provided by: NIH NIAID U19AI110818 (Broad Institute); NIH NIAID U54GM088558 (J.A.L.); Howard Hughes Medical Institute (P.C.S.); Harvard University Burke Global Health Fellowship (P.C.S.); Amazon Web Services Cloud Credits for Research (P.C.S.).

In the prevaccination era, mumps was a routine childhood disease, with over 150,000 cases reported in the US annually [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. After the mumps vaccine was introduced in 1967, mumps incidence declined by more than 99% [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Case counts rose again briefly in the mid-1980s and then continued to decrease after a national outbreak of measles prompted the recommendation of 2 Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine doses in 1989 [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the early 2000s, only a few hundred cases of mumps were reported annually in the US [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], attesting to the success of vaccination, possibly combined with decreasing clinical suspicion. This apparently low nationwide incidence was interrupted by an outbreak of &#x0003e;5,000 cases in the Midwestern US in 2006 [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], followed by a period of low incidence with minor outbreaks until 2016. This recent resurgence in mumps is partially explained by waning vaccine-induced immunity [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], but the extent to which genetic changes in circulating viruses have contributed is not yet clear.</p><p>In Massachusetts, over 250 cases were reported in 2016 and over 170 in 2017, far exceeding the usual state incidence of &#x0003c;10 cases per year [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As seen in other recent outbreaks, most cases were associated with academic institutions [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and other close-contact settings, including prisons [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and tightly-knit ethnic and religious communities [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Mumps was reported to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) by 18 colleges and universities in the state, including Harvard University (Harvard), University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass), and Boston University (BU)&#x02014;the 3 institutions with the largest numbers of reported cases.

These full genomes provide substantially more data than sequences of the small hydrophobic (SH) gene alone (accounting for &#x0003c;3% of the genome), which is conventionally used for classifying mumps virus [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For the Massachusetts samples, epidemiological data (including university affiliation and vaccination status) and contact tracing data collected by the MDPH and local universities were also available (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000611.s012">S1 Table</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000611.s015">S1 Data</xref> for full line list). We note that 2 of the individuals in the Massachusetts data set had paired samples from 2 timepoints; in both cases, we excluded the genome from the later sample in subsequent analyses, leaving 201 genomes from unique patients. Of these 201 individuals from Massachusetts, 72% had known vaccination status, of whom 93% had 1 or more MMR doses. We also sequenced 29 PCR-negative samples from suspected mumps cases; in only one was there limited evidence for mumps virus, but we did identify 4 other viruses (one in each of 4 of these samples; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000611.s014">S3 Table</xref>), 2 of which are known to cause parotitis [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], a characteristic symptom of mumps [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The viral whole genome data led to 2 key findings about the origin and spread of the recent outbreaks. First, our analysis revealed that the outbreaks&#x02014;in Massachusetts and also more broadly in the US&#x02014;were largely the product of a single mumps lineage and that this lineage was responsible for most if not all US mumps outbreaks since at least 2006. This lineage belongs to mumps virus genotype G [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] as do all but 1 of the 201 genomes from unique patients in our data set. Unless otherwise stated, all subsequent analyses refer only to these 200 genotype G genomes (<xref rid="pbio.3000611.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Phylogenetic analysis of these 200 genomes, along with the other 25 publicly available genotype G genomes, shows that almost all (192 of the 200 samples in our data set; 211 of the 225 total) belong to a single lineage within genotype G, despite having been collected from all over the country (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000611.g001">Fig 1A</xref>; also supported by a principal component analysis; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000611.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). This lineage descends from the US mumps outbreak in 2006. Single-gene data (see discussion of SH gene below) show no evidence for extensive transmission of this lineage outside the US, suggesting that most mumps cases in the US since 2006 are the result of ongoing transmission of a single lineage within the United States; specifically, this connects previously unassociated cases (with published genomes) between 2006 and 2016 [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This also suggests that unreported infections may be common and may be driving ongoing transmission [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The distribution of cases within the phylogenetic tree further suggests geographic movement of mumps virus on short time scales. For example, clade I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000611.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) contains virus genomes collected in 2015 through 2017 from Massachusetts, from elsewhere in the Northeast, from the South, and from the Midwest. The date of the most recent common ancestor of this clade was most likely in 2013 or later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000611.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000611.s014">S3 Table</xref>), which implies that the virus spread to all of those regions in less than 5 years. Similarly, clade II contains genomes from all of those regions as well as one from the western US, all collected during the same time period. Clade II likely dates from no earlier than 2014, suggesting spread to these regions occurred in an even shorter amount of time. Together, these observations provide strong evidence for regional circulation in the Northeast, coupled with at least occasional movement to more distant geographic regions. Further sampling of these other regions may reveal additional long-distance dispersal events, which would indicate widespread geographic movement of mumps. This would not be surprising if transmission frequently occurs through college students, many of whom reside in close-contact settings and also travel long distances to return home.</p><p>The second key finding about the recent spread of mumps virus relates to its origins in Massachusetts. Although this 2006 lineage dominated the Massachusetts outbreak, the outbreak was not caused by a single introduction of mumps virus into the state but rather is comprised of at least 6 distinct viral clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000611.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Several of these were sublineages of the dominant 2006 lineage, including the 2 largest, Clades I and II, which comprise more than 90% of samples from Massachusetts (13% and 77%, respectively). These 2 clades diverged before the 2016 outbreak began (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000611.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000611.s013">S2 Table</xref>), indicating that they independently contributed to it. The remaining 4 clades (0-UM, 0-HU, 0-BU, plus one genotype K genome) likewise represent independent introductions, one of which (0-BU) also falls within the 2006 lineage. Such multiple introductions, indicating widespread transmission of mumps virus, have been observed elsewhere in the US [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and are also seen in this data set within individual universities: samples from UMass span 2 clades (II and 0-UM), Harvard samples span 3 clades (I, II, and 0-HU), and BU samples span 3 clades (I, II, 0-BU) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000611.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). This emerging pattern of complexity, which has only become apparent with viral genomic data, provides a previously inaccessible look into the degree to which mumps is moving within and between states and communities in the US.</p><p>Epidemiological investigation showed that each of the 4 minor clades described above contains at least one sample from a patient with foreign travel history during the incubation period of the virus (12&#x02013;25 days before symptom onset [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000611.s015">S1 Data</xref>). Together, the genomic and epidemiological data suggest that most mumps virus cases in the US belong to the primary 2006 lineage but that small clusters of cases can be attributed to repeated importation of the virus from outside the country. These imported cases do not appear to be important contributors to the overall burden of mumps in the US.</p><p>The finding that a single mumps lineage has been successful in a highly vaccinated population [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], despite repeated introductions of other lineages, raised the possibility that mutations within this lineage have contributed to its success, perhaps by enabling vaccine escape. Because mutations contributing to the success of the entire lineage necessarily occurred early in the evolution of that lineage, we note here the differences between fixed mutations in our data set and the strain used in the mumps vaccine.</p><p>We found that there were numerous fixed differences between samples from the 2016 outbreak and the Jeryl Lynn vaccine strain in regions of immunological significance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000611.s004">S4A Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000611.s019">S1 Text</xref>), consistent with a recent similar analysis [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein, the primary target of neutralizing antibodies [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we observed 32 sites with fixed amino acid substitutions between our sequences and the Jeryl Lynn strain. Thirty of these sites were conserved between our sequences and a cell-passaged clinical strain that was isolated from Iowa in 2006 (accession: JX287385), near the beginning of mumps resurgence in the US. The Iowa 2006 strain was previously shown to be neutralized by sera from both vaccinated and naturally infected individuals, but to a lower degree than neutralization of the Jeryl Lynn strain itself [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], raising the possibility that some of these mutations may confer partly reduced neutralization susceptibility. In addition, we observed 2 positions at which our sequences differed from both the Jeryl Lynn and the Iowa 2006 strains. At these 2 positions, the variant observed in our sequences was also present in most other genotype G sequences published to date, including in sequences from a recent study from the Netherlands [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Further studies are warranted to test the neutralization susceptibility of strains containing these variants, because the Iowa 2006 sequence may not be fully representative of most currently circulating genotype G viruses.</p><p>We also looked for any evidence of ongoing adaptation to the vaccine during the outbreak. We considered this as a possibility because the vaccine was introduced relatively recently in the history of the mumps virus, recently enough that the virus could still be adapting to it. Additionally, in the absence of widespread natural infection, vaccination now constitutes the largest immunological selective force on mumps virus in the US. To investigate this, we paired genomic data with vaccination records to look for any evidence of changes in the mumps virus genome during the outbreak that led to antigenic variation from the Jeryl Lynn vaccine strain.</p><p>We first tested whether nucleotide substitutions in genomes from the Massachusetts outbreak clustered by time since vaccination, or whether vaccinated individuals clustered on certain branches of the phylogenetic tree; neither was the case (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000611.s004">S4B and S4E Fig</xref>). Second, we looked for signals of positive selection (using the d<italic>N</italic>/d<italic>S</italic> statistic) in the 225 genotype G genomes in our data set; a signal here would suggest that nonsynonymous mutations in a particular gene were being favored by ongoing selective pressure. We found no evidence for selection in any gene or at any specific site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000611.s004">S4C and S4D Fig</xref>). Thus, we did not find direct evidence of genetic variants arising within this outbreak that contributed to vaccine escape, although we note that both tests have quite limited statistical power in this data set. This finding is consistent with a recent study that proposed waning vaccine-induced immunity as a driving factor in recent US mumps outbreaks [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; this hypothesis is also supported by our own data, in which we find that time since vaccination differs between Massachusetts individuals testing positive and negative for mumps virus by PCR in 2016 through 2017, with longer times since vaccination observed in mumps-positive patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000611.s005">S5 Fig</xref>).</p><p>Understanding transmission routes can be crucial in guiding the public health response to an outbreak&#x02014;for example, whether efforts should be directed toward controlling mumps spread within a university or preventing virus importation. In the Massachusetts mumps outbreak, detailed genomic data allowed us both to confirm connections suggested by public health investigation and to identify new links between cases. The phylogeny described above shows that mumps samples from different Massachusetts universities were genetically similar and fell within the 2 primary clades (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000611.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), consistent with the epidemiological interpretation that these contemporaneous cases were part of 1 large mumps outbreak in 2016 through 2017. It also showed an unexpected connection between mumps cases in a local, nonacademic community (Clade II-community) and those at Harvard: the II-community cases fall within the predominantly Harvard Clade II, suggesting a spillover event from the university into the wider community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000611.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Cases in these 2 clades were classified as distinct outbreaks during initial public health investigation based on epidemiological data [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], different demographic makeup of the 2 populations (older adults with no obvious university connection versus mostly college-aged students), and a 5-month gap between the last confirmed cases at Harvard and the cases in the local community. However, the genomic data clearly suggests a connection, supported by additional epidemiological investigation that identified 3 individuals affiliated with both Harvard and the local community who could have acted as transmission links.</p><fig id="pbio.3000611.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.3000611.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Epidemiological modeling and transmission reconstruction.</title><p>(A) Zoom view of Clade II-community and its ancestors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000611.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).

We first used an epidemiological model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000611.s006">S6 Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] without genomic data to estimate transmission within the university, but it did not permit us to distinguish between a single mumps introduction followed by high transmission and multiple introductions followed by low transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000611.g002">Fig 2B</xref> left). We then modified the model to incorporate the number of viral lineages (Clades 0-HU, II-community, and 2 subclades within Clade II) observed within Harvard. This markedly improved our ability to distinguish these scenarios, supporting an estimate of 5 (95% CI: 4&#x02013;18) distinct introductions to Harvard and an effective reproduction number (R<sub>E</sub>) of 1.70 (95% CI: 1.50&#x02013;1.91; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000611.g002">Fig 2B</xref> right). An R<sub>E</sub> well above 1.0 means that the outbreak could be self-sustaining, which highlights the importance of controlling on-campus transmission during mumps outbreaks.</p><p>The high-resolution data from Harvard allowed us to estimate transmission links between individual cases, which can aid in targeting containment efforts aimed at high-risk individuals or groups. For this purpose, we focused on Clade II-outbreak because it was largely contained within a single institution (Harvard) and had dense sampling. When we attempted to link individual mumps cases within this clade using contact tracing data alone, we could only infer direct mumps transmissions (&#x0201c;contact links&#x0201d;) between 2 pairs of individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000611.g002">Fig 2C</xref> left). We then used the genomic data to validate genetic distance as a proxy for epidemiological linkage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000611.s007">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>) and, based on these results, used genomic data and sampling dates to reconstruct possible mumps transmissions. The reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000611.g002">Fig 2C</xref> right, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000611.s007">S7C Fig</xref>), which estimates and assigns a probability to direct transmission links, supports 1 of the 2 pairs of direct mumps transmissions as well as 2 &#x0201c;shared activity links&#x0201d; (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec003">Materials and methods</xref>) and also suggests many new links between individuals without any known contacts. Indirect links, however, are difficult to identify using genomic data alone, illustrating the complementary contributions of genomic and epidemiological data for reconstructing detailed transmission, which can guide response efforts for mumps and other outbreaks in close-contact settings.</p><p>Conventional sequence-based mumps surveillance has been limited to the SH gene. The SH gene is a small (316-nucleotide), convenient target for sequencing [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and is thus the region for which the most sequence data are available. We used the 3,646 publicly available SH sequences from mumps cases around the world (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000611.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) to assess whether SH sequences would be adequate to distinguish the lineages and transmission patterns identified above. To do this, we constructed the mumps phylogeny using the SH sequence alone and compared it to the whole genome phylogeny. There was limited variation within each genotype (genotype G shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000611.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), and neither of our main phylogenetic conclusions based on whole genome data could be ascertained from SH alone: we could not determine the relationship between the spillover into the local community and its source in Harvard (other than that they belonged to the same clade), and we were unable to determine the relationship between the 2016 and 2017 outbreak and the 2006 lineage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000611.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Our other key findings, such as the detailed picture of transmission within Harvard and a refined R<sub>E</sub> estimate, rely on these 2 conclusions. Nevertheless, SH data were sufficient to resolve population structure on a global scale and to confirm that the 11 known clinically relevant genotypes are associated with particular world regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000611.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

Given the high-quality genomic data we were able to produce from mumps clinical samples, as well as the limited information that can be gleaned from SH sequencing, it is worth considering whether future public health surveillance of mumps should incorporate whole genome sequencing. The collection of these detailed data, which we have made available to the community (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec003">Materials and methods</xref>), was only possible through extensive collaboration between state and national public health agencies, academic researchers, and affected universities throughout the greater Boston, Massachusetts area. We hope that these partnerships, fostered in response to a surge in mumps cases in Massachusetts in 2016 and 2017, will facilitate real-time genomic and epidemiological data generation, analysis, and sharing in future outbreaks of any pathogen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec003"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the MDPH, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Institutional Review Boards (IRB) (MDPH IRB 00000701, project 906066).

Because of the possibility of contamination, we prepared a second, independent sequencing replicate on all PCR-negative samples with evidence for mumps or another virus and required both replicates to contain reads matching the virus detected in the sample. We found no evidence of pathogenic viruses other than mumps in PCR-positive samples.</p><p>We required the total raw read count for any genus in any sample to be twice (in practice, 7 times) that in any negative control from any sequencing batch. For any sample that had one or more pathogenic viral genera that passed this filter and had deduplicated reads well distributed across the relevant viral genome, we attempted contig assembly: we used viral-ngs to filter all sample reads against all NCBI GenBank [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] entries matching the identified species and then de novo assembled reads using Trinity [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] through viral-ngs and scaffolded against the closest matching full genome identified by a blastn query [<xref rid="pbio.3000611.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].

This threshold was based on the maximum number of unambiguous bases (2,820) observed in negative controls across all uncontaminated sequencing batches. One sequencing batch showed evidence of contamination: we were able to assemble 7,615 unambiguous mumps bases from a water sample, with a median coverage of 4x.

</p><p>Dear Dr Sabeti, </p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript entitled "Combining genomics and epidemiology to track mumps virus transmission in the United States" for consideration as a Research Article by PLOS Biology.</p><p>Your manuscript has now been evaluated by the PLOS Biology editorial staff as well as by an academic editor with relevant expertise and I am writing to let you know that we would like to send your submission out for external peer review.</p><p>However, before we can send your manuscript to reviewers, we need you to complete your submission by providing the metadata that is required for full assessment. To this end, please login to Editorial Manager where you will find the paper in the 'Submissions Needing Revisions' folder on your homepage. Please click 'Revise Submission' from the Action Links and complete all additional questions in the submission questionnaire.</p><p>*Please be aware that, due to the voluntary nature of our reviewers and academic editors, manuscripts may be subject to delays during the holiday season. Thank you for your patience.*</p><p>**Important**: Please also see below for further information regarding completing the MDAR reporting checklist. The checklist can be accessed here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://plos.io/MDARChecklist">https://plos.io/MDARChecklist</ext-link>
</p><p>Please re-submit your manuscript and the checklist, within two working days, i.e. by Jul 26 2019 11:59PM.</p><p>Login to Editorial Manager here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology</ext-link>
</p><p>During resubmission, you will be invited to opt-in to posting your pre-review manuscript as a bioRxiv preprint. Visit <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/preprints">http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/preprints</ext-link> for full details. If you consent to posting your current manuscript as a preprint, please upload a single Preprint PDF when you re-submit. </p><p>Once your full submission is complete, your paper will undergo a series of checks in preparation for peer review. Once your manuscript has passed all checks it will be sent out for review. </p><p>Feel free to email us at <email>plosbiology@plos.org</email> if you have any queries relating to your submission.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Lauren A Richardson, Ph.D</p><p>Senior Editor</p><p>PLOS Biology</p><p>==================</p><p>INFORMATION REGARDING THE REPORTING CHECKLIST:</p><p>PLOS Biology is pleased to support the "minimum reporting standards in the life sciences" initiative (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/9sm4x/">https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/9sm4x/</ext-link>). This effort brings together a number of leading journals and reproducibility experts to develop minimum expectations for reporting information about Materials (including data and code), Design, Analysis and Reporting (MDAR) in published papers. We believe broad alignment on these standards will be to the benefit of authors, reviewers, journals and the wider research community and will help drive better practise in publishing reproducible research. </p><p>We are therefore participating in a community pilot involving a small number of life science journals to test the MDAR checklist. The checklist is intended to help authors, reviewers and editors adopt and implement the minimum reporting framework. </p><p>IMPORTANT: We have chosen your manuscript to participate in this trial. The relevant documents can be located here:</p><p>MDAR reporting checklist (to be filled in by you): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://plos.io/MDARChecklist">https://plos.io/MDARChecklist</ext-link></p><p>**We strongly encourage you to complete the MDAR reporting checklist and return it to us with your full submission, as described above. We would also be very grateful if you could complete this author survey:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://forms.gle/seEgCrDtM6GLKFGQA">https://forms.gle/seEgCrDtM6GLKFGQA</ext-link>

</p><p>Please note that your completed checklist and survey will be shared with the minimum reporting standards working group. However, the working group will not be provided with access to the manuscript or any other confidential information including author identities, manuscript titles or abstracts.

</p><p>Dear Dr Sabeti,</p><p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "Combining genomics and epidemiology to track mumps virus transmission in the United States" for consideration as a Research Article at PLOS Biology. Your manuscript has been evaluated by the PLOS Biology editors, an Academic Editor with relevant expertise, and by several independent reviewers.</p><p>As you will read, the reviewers appreciate many aspects of your study. However, they also raise some concerns that will need to be addressed in a revision. Of particular note, Reviewers #2 and #3 both believe that further evidence that vaccine escape is not contributing to the outbreak is needed. Reviewer #2 and the Academic Editor also believe that the scope of the results and title should be tempered to reflect the region where samples were obtained. </p><p>In light of the reviews (below), we will not be able to accept the current version of the manuscript, but we would welcome resubmission of a much-revised version that takes into account the reviewers' comments. We cannot make any decision about publication until we have seen the revised manuscript and your response to the reviewers' comments. Your revised manuscript is also likely to be sent for further evaluation by the reviewers.</p><p>Your revisions should address the specific points made by each reviewer. Please submit a file detailing your responses to the editorial requests and a point-by-point response to all of the reviewers' comments that indicates the changes you have made to the manuscript. In addition to a clean copy of the manuscript, please upload a 'track-changes' version of your manuscript that specifies the edits made. This should be uploaded as a "Related" file type. You should also cite any additional relevant literature that has been published since the original submission and mention any additional citations in your response. </p><p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available.

Grubaugh, signed review</p><p>Wohl et al. provide an excellent investigation of the 2016-17 mumps virus outbreak in Massachusetts using genomic epidemiology. While I didn't have access to previous reviews and author responses, this version reads very well and tells a very interesting and complete story. The analyses all seem appropriate and the figures look nice and are mostly clear. I highly recommend this for publication and provide only a couple minor comments about the figures.</p><p>1. It wasn't until I read the main text did I really understand figure 2 (and I typically look at all of the figures before reading). There is a lot of important info buried in the legend, especially to explain B and C. Could the authors add a label to show that the left panels are estimates made from epi data and the right panels include genomic data? If this is clear from the start, the figure would be much clearer and more powerful.</p><p>2. Given the space in the main text, I would recommend brining some of the very nice and informative supplemental figures to the main text. The authors can choose, but I would recommend S1, S4 (but update the title to make it clear that this was used to investigate vaccine escape, then perhaps simplify it to showcase the main points), and S9.</p><p>--------------</p><p>Reviewer #2: </p><p>Wohl et al. present a molecular epidemiological analysis of recent mumps outbreaks in Massachusetts during 2016-17. Using whole genome viral data, they are able to reconstruct the spread of mumps between neighboring communities including several universities in the region and connect these local outbreaks to larger-scale transmission patterns in the United States. They also explore whether mumps has undergone antigenic evolution to escape vaccine-based immunity, but do not find any genetic changes that can be correlated with vaccination patterns.</p><p>While this paper reports a perfectly valid molecular epidemiological analysis, the viral sequence dataset they analyze is limited to only ~200 samples collected mainly in MA from 2016-17. Thus authors conclusions about mumps circulation in the larger U.S. are therefore somewhat suspect, and I believe the authors over interpret what such sparsely collected data can tell them (see main criticism below) about larger circulation patterns. </p><p>Main criticism:</p><p>1) Results Lines 102-103: The authors find that a single mumps lineage has dominated in the US since 2006 and then argue that this &#x0201c;implies that continuous and extensive geographic movement of mumps virus, rather than isolated outbreaks, underlies mumps in the US&#x0201d; &#x02014;&#x0003e; I don&#x02019;t actually see evidence for this claim in the phylogeny shown in Figure 1. If anything there is a fair amount of clustering in the phylogeny by region and lineages sampled in MA and NE one year are most closely related to lineages sampled in the those regions the previous year. It&#x02019;s therefore possible that the G genotype spread slowly throughout the US and the virus is now persisting locally in each region.</p><p>2) The possibility that mutations may have allowed for vaccine escape is of major interest, but no mutations were found to strongly correlate with vaccination status or show signs of positive selection (dN/dS &#x0003e; 1). But classic dN/dS ratios would be very underpowered to detect selection here (Kryazhimskiy et al, PLoS Genetics, 2008) since there has presumably not been enough time for the multiple mutations needed to produce a signal of positive selection under these tests to accumulate. In light of this, maybe it would be better to plot the frequency of each mutation among sampled viruses over time and look if any mutations in antigenic regions have dramatically increased in frequency?</p><p>Minor remarks:</p><p>Line 544: &#x02018;e-i(t)&#x02019; &#x02014;&#x0003e; I&#x02019;m guessing this should be e^{-lambda_i(t}?</p><p>--------------</p><p>Reviewer #3: Christophe Fraser, signed review</p><p>The authors generate approximately 200 new genomes of mumps virus circulating during an unusually large epidemic in and around Boston universities. They show that the virus consists of multiple widely circulating lineages. They highlight the increased resolution into transmission. Using the SH gene, they compare their sample to viruses circulating globally, and make the case for a persistent US-European lineage causing most cases. They demonstrate that the virus has an effective reproductive number RE well above one, and that control measures need to focus on blocking local transmission. A lot of work went into this impressively comprehensive analysis. </p><p>This study is well executed. The case that there is a lot of local transmission is convincing, and the finding of multiple closely related lineages circulating is surprising.</p><p>The authors also address the question of whether the virus has mutated to escape vaccine, and conclude that waning immunity is a more likely explanation for persistent transmission. I was less convinced by the robustness of this section of the paper. I was not convinced about the power of the dN dS analysis to detect escape from the vaccine selection pressure. At least, it was not clearly motivated what assumptions or hypotheses were being tested. </p><p>Perhaps more could be made of the data on time since vaccination, comparing negative and positive samples, and also formally testing whether subtitutions are associated with time since vaccination. </p><p>The data sharing statement should refer both to the sequences and to the associated metadata; currently the authors only propose to share sequences. </p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Introductory paragraph, lines 46-56. How sure are the authors that temporally changing patterns of reporting might not affect these observations?</p><p>Line 60. &#x02018;academic institutions and other close contact settings.&#x02019; Please use more specific language. What is a &#x02018;close contact setting&#x02019;? Does this include a household? </p><p>Line 60, and repeated several times later. Where possible, avoid open ended ranges such as &#x02018;at least 18&#x02019;, and instead use ranges and estimates. </p><p>Line 65. I am not convinced that &#x02018;phylogenomic analysis&#x02019; is a thing and think &#x02018;phylogenetic analysis&#x02019; would be clearer.</p><p>Line 76. The number of genomes is variously 201 (here), 200 (line 96), and 203 (Line 220 and Figure S1). Please check to make this consistent, or specify if slightly different samples were used for different analyses. </p><p>Line 81. &#x02018;Median sequencing depth&#x02019;. Also specify 95% range. </p><p>Line 81. &#x02018;All genomes were at least 82% complete.&#x02019; This is not a fair description of the sequencing success rate, if I understand correctly the information provided in Fig S1. The authors generated 203 genomes from 259 samples. So 56 samples (22%) were excluded, because of low viral loads associated with late collection of the samples. This is relevant information for readers interested in assessing the sequencing method used here. It is also possibly relevant as a sampling bias to consider in the discussion. </p><p>Lines 91-95. Whilst I am convinced that this conclusion is likely correct from the paper, I don&#x02019;t see how you can conclude this from the analysis of the genomes (Figure 1). It rather seems to be a conclusion of the partial genes (Figure 3). To conclude this, you need to place the diversity in your sample in the context of the full global diversity, which you can only do with the SH gene. If you agree, then it seems you may need to present Figure 3 before Figure 1. I can see this is awkward since you want to showcase the genome trees &#x00026; data, but you could make a case for the broad level information from a conventional SH analysis, and then zooming into the much higher resolution whole genome data. </p><p>Lines 129-139. To me, this was the most opaque section of the paper. First on dN/dS: Why is a dN/dS analysis appropriate for addressing the question of vaccine escape? Why would vaccine selection produce higher dN than non-vaccine immunological selection? Is the study powered for this comparison? It is not clear to me that a codon-by-codon analysis, as shown in Fig S4A or B is valid without correcting for multiple testing, and I don&#x02019;t understand what conclusion, if any, the authors are drawing from this analysis. In terms of the substitutions, the authors conclude that most mutations fixed here were already present in an ancestral sample (Iowa 2006), and thus that immune escape is unlikely (lines 991-998). The authors should make explicit the assumption of some kind of additive model here: why is not plausible that one of the two mutations identified, 336 and 474, could alone be responsible for vaccine escape? Without further wet-lab neutralisation assays, it must be hard to tell. Overall, I can see why the authors did the analyses, the question is interesting. But the conclusions seem vague at this stage. </p><p>Lines 158-181. This is a convincing analysis, and really highlights the power of the whole genome data. </p><p>Methods. The authors use well-established in-house viral genomics methods and publicly available phylogenetic software. </p><p>BEAST analysis: could you show the estimated skygrid plots for effective population size (Ne.tau)?</p><p>PCA analysis (lines 478-481). Does this add anything to the paper?</p><p>Stochastic model. The branching process approach looks sensible. The model estimates for lines 581-586 seem interesting, but I can&#x02019;t see any estimates in the paper? </p><p>Table S1. Please include the time since vaccination for both the positive and negative samples. Could more not be made of a comparison between the two?</p><p>Lines 1005-1010. This seems an orphan paragraph. Could you add a sentence to place these findings in context?</p><p>Lines 1013-1045. These are interesting findings on lack of diversity in host, though paragraph 1035-1045 seems very speculative given the data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pbio.3000611.r003" article-type="author-comment"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.3000611.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response to Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pbio.3000611" related-article-type="editor-report"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>

Rather I would say there is strong evidence for regional circulation (e.g. in MA and the NE) with occasional long-distance disperal to more distance regions of the U.S. After all, there is relatively strong clustering even from regions like the Midwest that were very under-sampled. Of course, more sampling from different regions may in fact reveal long-distance dispersal is common, I just don't feel that this should be assumed without evidence.</p><p>---------------</p><p>Reviewer #3: Christophe Fraser, signed review</p><p>The authors have done a great job responding the comments. They have strengthened their conclusions on waning immunity. They have clarified both the motivations for the different linked analyses, and highlighted limitations where appropriate.
