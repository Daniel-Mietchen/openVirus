The virus is causing an outbreak, which started in the metropole Wuhan, but was seeded through travellers across China with ongoing secondary chains of transmission in a wider geographical area. As at 10 February 2020, 40,553 confirmed cases including 910 deaths have been reported worldwide with an increasing number of cases being reported in Europe [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. So far, instances of secondary spread from international travellers have been limited, but clusters of human-to-human transmission have been reported involving persons with close contact to confirmed cases [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A key knowledge gap is the efficiency of community transmission of 2019-nCoV, including the contribution of mild or asymptomatic cases. On 30 January 2020, the Word Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) because of these uncertainties, the ongoing seeding of the virus internationally, and the need for preparedness across the world in order to track and control the epidemic. WHO highlighted the crucial role of early detection of cases to interrupt virus spread and emphasised that countries need to put in place strong measures to detect and laboratory-confirm cases early [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Here, we assessed the required expertise and diagnostic capacity in specialised laboratories in 30 European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries.</p><sec sec-type="other1"><title>Survey</title><p>A questionnaire was designed to assess the capacity, quality and operational specifics related to 2019-nCoV diagnostics, as well as barriers against their implementation in laboratories that are part of the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC)-associated European expert laboratory network for emerging viral diseases (EVD-LabNet) and/or the European Reference Laboratory Network for Human Influenza (ERLI-Net). The survey was sent on 22 January 2020 to the Operational Contact Points representing 81 laboratories in, among others, 30 EU/EEA countries. The survey subsequently closed on 29 January 2020 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).

The questionnaire was send out before the first 2019-nCoV cases appeared in Europe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) and positive clinical specimens were assumed to be not available to the European laboratories. Therefore, the level of validation for clinical sensitivity was not assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Positive control</title><p>Three of 38 laboratories that had implemented diagnostics did the implementation without a positive control.

Multiple modelling studies estimated the risk of 2019-nCoV introduction to Europe as high [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Pullano et al. indicated the United Kingdom, France and Germany as being at the highest risk, followed by Italy, Spain and the Netherlands [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Indeed, all but one country (the Netherlands) have reported cases. The study reported that the occurrence of 2019-nCoV importation from Beijing and Shanghai, both cities with high numbers of travellers to Europe, would likely lead to an even higher and widespread risk for Europe.</p><p>This rapid assessment of the readiness of EU/EEA laboratories for molecular detection of 2019-nCoV demonstrated a fast implementation of molecular diagnostics by the European specialised laboratory networks with a good geographical coverage for testing. Among both laboratory networks in this study, protocols were shared rapidly and there was an early availability of positive controls and CoV specificity panels via EVAg. Furthermore, the survey indicated a great willingness of laboratories to provide international diagnostic support [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and to share sequences to contribute to the monitoring of virus evolution and trace transmission chains.</p><p>However, although the first protocols suggesting primer/probe sequences were available fast through the WHO website (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) and validation panels were made available through the EVAg portal soon after [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the availability of primers, probes and positive controls were indicated as most important initial obstacles for test implementation. In addition, lack of sufficient personnel to implement and validate was a barrier, as had been observed in response to the Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in the Americas and the related PHEIC [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This suggests that the challenges faced by specialised laboratories when responding to emerging events are of structural nature.</p><p>Capacity-wise, the survey indicates that European specialised laboratories are prepared for the current situation, and suggests that a more sensitive case definition than currently in use [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] would not create an immediate bottleneck. However, it remains to be seen how realistic the estimates are, particularly in view of the coinciding seasonal epidemic peaks of other respiratory pathogens such as influenza viruses. This will depend on the epidemiological developments in the 2019-nCoV outbreak and on whether the current worldwide control strategy of containment with active case finding [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] will be sustained and the indicated laboratory capacity will suffice. If the outbreak turns into a pandemic, specialised laboratories&#x02019; efforts would refocus to reference activities like confirmatory testing, laboratory surveillance including virus characterisation, provision of reference materials and advice, while general testing for 2019-nCoV would shift to first-line hospital laboratories that currently do not have this capacity. This would require a roll-out of tests from the specialised laboratories as was done during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic.</p><p>The survey showed that proper validation of specificity was lacking in a vast majority of the laboratories that had implemented testing while very few laboratories indicated to have implemented tests without availability of a positive control. The important assessment of the clinical sensitivity of the implemented tests was not possible in this very early phase of laboratory response due to the, at the time, absence of positive clinical materials in Europe. The three laboratories without a positive control will also not have assessed the analytical sensitivity of their tests. The legal possibilities (General Data Protection Regulation; GDPR) for sharing and the willingness to share positive clinical material among the network laboratories now that the first 37 cases have been confirmed in the EU/EEA will determine the speed with which laboratories can address the clinical sensitivity of their implemented tests while the number of cases in the EU/EEA is still limited.</p><p>To properly assess the actual capability of the laboratories to detect (sub)clinical 2019-nCoV cases and to provide directions for corrective actions, proficiency testing by external quality assessment (EQA) is essential and urgently needed. The importance of EQA was illustrated in the European ZIKV response where timely implementation was not matched by an overall good capability [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Forty of the 47 responding laboratories in this study indicated that they will participate in such an assessment. Currently activities are ongoing to assess the actual capabilities within both laboratory networks by EQA.</p><p>In conclusion, while molecular testing for 2019-nCoV was quickly implemented in EU/EEA countries there is still room for improvement especially in the aspect of clinical validation of specificity and sensitivity, as could be expected considering the survey was taken in the very early phase of the laboratory response. Capability testing based on proficiency panels is needed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank all survey participants: Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Sciensano, Brussels, Belgium; National Center of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases, Sofia, Bulgaria; University Hospital for Infectious Diseases Dr. Fran Mihaljevic&#x000b4;, Zagreb, Croatia; Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics, Nicosia, Cyprus; University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus; Ostrava Institute of Public Health, Ostrava, Czech Republic; National Institute for Public Health, Prague, Czech Republic; Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark; Health Board Laboratory of Communicable Diseases, Tallinn, Estonia; University of Helsinki and HUSLAB, Helsinki, Finland; Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland; Aix Marseille University, Marseille, France; Institute Pasteur, Paris, France; Institut f&#x000fc;r Virologie, Marburg, Germany; Institute of Virology, Charite - Universit&#x000e4;tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany; Department of Microbiology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece; Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Athens, Greece; Nemzeti N&#x000e9;peg&#x000e9;szs&#x000e9;g&#x000fc;gyi K&#x000f6;zpont, Budapest, Hungary; Landspitali- National University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland; National Virus Reference Laboratory-U.C.D., Dublin, Ireland; Istituto Superiore di Sanit&#x000e0;, Rome, Italy; Padova University Hospital, Padova, Italy; National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani IRCCS, Rome, Italy; Amedeo di Savoia Hospital, Torino, Italy; Policlinico Militare &#x0201c;Celio&#x0201d; Roma, Rome, Italy; National Microbiology Reference Laboratory- Riga East University, Riga, Latvia; National Public Health Surveillance Laboratory, Vilnius, Lithuania; Laboratoire National de Sant&#x000e9;, Dudelange, Luxembourg; Mater Dei Hospital, Malta; Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway; Cantacuzino National Military-Medical Institute for Research and Development, Bucarest, Romania; Military Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Pulawy, Poland; National Institute of Public Health-National Institute of Hygiene, Warsaw, Poland; National Institute of Health, Lisbon, Portugal; Public Health Authority of the Slovak Republic, Bratislava, Slovakia; University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia; National Laboratory for Health, Environment and Food, Ljubljana, Slovenia; Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain; Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain; Public Health Agency of Sweden, Solna, Sweden; National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, the Netherlands; Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands; Public Health England, London, United Kingdom; West of Scotland Specialist Virology Centre, Glasgow, United Kingdom; Public Health Wales, Cardiff, United Kingdom.
