CHIKV has been emerging globally, while neither a vaccine nor antiviral medication is available. The anti-parasitic drug suramin was previously shown to inhibit CHIKV replication. In this study we aimed to obtain more detailed insight into its mechanism of action. We found that suramin interacts with virions and can inhibit virus binding to cells. It also appeared to inhibit post-attachment steps of the infection process, likely by preventing conformational changes of the envelope glycoproteins required for fusion and the progression of infection. Suramin-resistant CHIKV strains were selected and genotyping and reverse genetics experiments indicated that mutations in E2 were responsible for resistance. The substitutions N5R and H18Q were reverse engineered in the E2 glycoprotein in order to understand their role in resistance. The binding of suramin-resistant viruses with these two E2 mutations was inhibited by suramin like that of wild-type virus, but they appeared to be able to overcome the post-attachment inhibitory effect of suramin. Conversely, a virus with a G82R mutation in E2 (implicated in attenuation of vaccine strain 181/25), which renders it dependent on the interaction with heparan sulfate for entry, was more sensitive to suramin than wild-type virus. Using molecular modelling studies, we predicted the potential suramin binding sites on the mature spikes of the chikungunya virion. We conclude that suramin interferes with CHIKV entry by interacting with the E2 envelope protein, which inhibits attachment and also interferes with conformational changes required for fusion.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CHIKV</kwd><kwd>alphavirus</kwd><kwd>antiviral</kwd><kwd>suramin</kwd><kwd>E2 envelope protein</kwd><kwd>attachment</kwd><kwd>fusion</kwd><kwd>drug repurposing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-12-00314"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging alphavirus that is transmitted by <italic>Aedes sp.</italic> mosquitoes and has caused several large outbreaks in the past 15 years. Before 2013 CHIKV was circulating mainly in Africa and Asia [<xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], but following its introduction into the Caribbean it has now become endemic in Latin America as well [<xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Acute CHIKV infection is associated with fever, rash, muscle pain, and general malaise. Furthermore, the virus often causes a debilitating joint pain that can last for months to years [<xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Prophylactic or therapeutic treatment for CHIKV infections is still not available on the market, and vector control measures do not provide the ultimate solution [<xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although progress is being made in CHIKV vaccine and antiviral drug development [<xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], we would still be poorly prepared in the face of a new CHIKV epidemic.</p><p>We and others have previously shown that the antiparasitic drug suramin inhibits CHIKV replication by targeting an early step in the viral replication cycle [<xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, the compound also inhibits CHIKV replication in a mouse model [<xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These findings show the potential for the (off-label) therapeutic use of suramin for the treatment of chronic chikungunya fever, and possibly also for its prophylactic use during severe CHIKV outbreaks.</p><p>CHIKV has a 11.8-kb single-stranded (ss) RNA genome of positive polarity, which is capped, poly-adenylated and packaged into an icosahedral nucleocapsid that is surrounded by an envelope containing 80 projections (spikes), each consisting of three E1-E2 (envelope proteins) heterodimers [<xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The E2 protein is involved in the interaction with the host cell and therefore is an important determinant of pathogenicity, cellular tropism [<xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and immunogenicity [<xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The viral replication cycle begins with attachment of the virion to the cell surface through interactions with glycosaminoglycans, such as heparan sulfate [<xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Subsequent binding to a receptor, like the recently identified Mxra8 protein [<xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] will lead to uptake of the virion via receptor-mediated endocytosis [<xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Endosomal acidification causes structural rearrangements in the virion that induce E1 protein-mediated fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane [<xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This leads to nucleocapsid release and its disassembly in the cytoplasm to liberate the RNA genome. Subsequently, the genome is translated into a polyprotein that is processed into the non-structural proteins nsP1 to 4 that (together with host factors) assemble into membrane-associated replication and transcription complexes (RTCs). The structural proteins (capsid, E3, E2, 6k/TF and E1) are expressed from a subgenomic RNA in the form of a second polyprotein. After autoproteolytic release of the capsid protein, the remainder of the structural polyprotein traffics through the secretory pathway, during which it is cleaved by host cell proteases and undergoes post-translational modifications like glycosylation. Ultimately, the mature envelope proteins will reach the plasma membrane. Here, interaction between nucleocapsids and the cytoplasmic sides of the envelope proteins are essential for the budding process and the formation of new virus particles [<xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The work presented here provides insight into the mode-of-action of suramin, through specific analysis of virus binding and fusion, and by selecting and characterizing suramin-resistant CHIKV variants, which contained N5R and H18Q mutations in the envelope protein E2. Moreover, we found that a virus with the G82R mutation in E2, which renders the virus dependent on heparan sulfate binding for infectivity and was implicated in attenuation of vaccine strain 181/25 [<xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], was more sensitive to suramin than wild-type CHIKV. Molecular docking studies provided more insight into suramin&#x02019;s inhibitory activity, since the compound was predicted to bind to virus particles at positions that could interfere with conformational changes in the envelope proteins that need to occur during entry.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-12-00314"><title>2.

Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec3dot1-viruses-12-00314"><title>3.1. Suramin Inhibits Viral Attachment and Fusion by Interacting with the Chikungunya Virion</title><p>Several experiments were carried out to analyze the impact of suramin on the early events of infection, i.e., virus attachment, internalization, and fusion. <sup>35</sup>S- or DiD-labeled CHIKV [<xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] were used in virus binding assays, in the presence or absence of suramin, at 4 &#x000b0;C. Active endocytosis does not occur at temperatures below 18 &#x000b0;C [<xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and therefore suramin was expected to remain in the extracellular environment. Virus attachment to the cell surface probably involves electrostatic interactions with the GAGs or other plasma membrane factors (receptors, adhesion molecules) and infections can be synchronized by placing cells at 4 &#x000b0;C. By directly measuring the amount of radioactively- or fluorescently-labeled virus in the presence of increasing concentrations of compound, we found that suramin inhibited CHIKV attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00314-f001">Figure 1</xref>a,b) in two distinct cell lines and with two different experimental readouts. Binding of <sup>35</sup>S-labelled SFV was even more strongly inhibited by suramin (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00314">supplemental Figure S1a</xref>), which is in line with suramin&#x02019;s previously observed lower EC<sub>50</sub> for SFV compared to CHIKV [<xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, suramin (30 &#x003bc;M) completely inhibited pyrene-labeled CHIKV from fusing with liposomal membranes at pH ~5.5 in the absence of host proteins, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00314-f001">Figure 1</xref>c [<xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Because suramin is known to bind to positive charges on the surface of proteins, we suspect that suramin binds directly to the envelope proteins, thereby preventing the conformational changes that are required for fusion. In contrast to Ho et al., who studied the effect of suramin on surface-expressed envelope proteins in insect cells that were subsequently triggered to fuse at low pH, we studied the effect of suramin on membrane fusion in the context of whole virions. The ~100-fold lower EC<sub>50</sub> in the fusion assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00314-f001">Figure 1</xref>c) compared to the binding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00314-f001">Figure 1</xref>a) makes it tempting to conclude that suramin inhibits fusion much more than binding, but these differences might very well be due to the very different experimental setup of the (in vitro liposome-based) fusion and the (cell-based) binding assay.</p><p>To confirm the interaction of suramin with virions, we incubated purified CHIKV (lacking serum proteins as these are known to strongly bind suramin; [<xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]) with <sup>3</sup>H-labeled suramin. Compared to a control supernatant from mock-infected cells (which bound 3000 CPM of suramin) purified CHIKV bound over 30,000 CPM of <sup>3</sup>H-suramin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00314-f001">Figure 1</xref>d), confirming that the compound did interact with virus particles. <sup>3</sup>H-suramin also interacted with SFV (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00314">Figure S1c</xref>), and more specifically with the (native) E proteins on the surface of intact virions, since treatment with proteinase K or heat denaturation severely decreased the quantity of bound radiolabeled suramin. For other viruses like enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) it was also found that suramin blocked their access to cellular receptors by directly interacting with virions [<xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Surprisingly, when SFV particles were pre-attached to cells (at 4 &#x000b0;C, in the absence of compound) and treated with suramin at 37 &#x000b0;C, only a minor non-significant inhibition of virus uptake was observed, even at high suramin concentrations (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00314">Figure S1b</xref>). Hence it is possible that at physiological temperature, pre-attached viruses cannot be displaced from their receptors by the compound, implying that the receptor- and suramin-binding sites overlap or the entry process might be too fast to be inhibited by suramin. When evaluating these direct binding studies, it should be noted that it remains unclear what fraction of the bound virions will actually lead to a productive infection. </p><p>The inhibitory effect of suramin on the binding of virus particles to the cell surface could be due to its direct interaction with virions and/or with cellular receptors. The direct binding assays with radiolabeled or fluorescently labeled viral particles clearly showed that suramin inhibits binding/fusion of both CHIKV and SFV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00314-f001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00314">Figure S1</xref>). This is in contrast with our earlier study [<xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], in which we concluded that suramin inhibits an early step, but not attachment. In that study, we relied on an RT-qPCR assay to quantify cell-bound CHIKV. However, this is an indirect measurement and the majority of the detected RNA molecules do not represent infectious particles, as we and others found that genome copy to PFU ratios of commonly used virus stocks were generally over 1000:1 [<xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. At least in part, this is due to the fact that virus stocks are generally harvested when extensive cytopathic effect (CPE) has occurred, which leads to the release of viral RNA not associated with infectious virus particles, e.g., in the form of naked RNA, nucleoprotein complexes or nucleocapsids. Therefore, we no longer consider RT-qPCR an appropriate assay to study CHIKV binding when standard, non-purified CHIKV specimens are used.</p><p>To evaluate whether the effect of suramin on CHIKV binding could be reliably measured by an improved RT-qPCR-based assay, we have used a PEG-precipitated virus stock to improve the CHIKV RNA to PFU ratio. After titration on Vero E6 cells, the ratio ranged from 7632:1 in the non-purified stock to 68:1 in the PEG-precipitated stock. Clearly, even after this procedure, the number of CHIKV RNA molecules still strongly outnumbers the number of infectious particles. Subsequently, we repeated the qPCR-based measurement of virus binding at 4 &#x000b0;C in the presence and absence of suramin (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00314">Figure S2</xref>), for both non-purified and PEG-precipitated virus stocks. While for the former there was an unexpected increase in detected CHIKV RNA in the presence of suramin, the PEG-precipitated stock showed a slight decrease, confirming that the quality of the virus stock strongly influences the experimental outcome and conclusions.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-viruses-12-00314"><title>3.2. Suramin-Resistant CHIKV Variants Acquired Mutations in the Envelope Protein E2</title><p>Repeated passaging of CHIKV in the presence of increasing suramin concentrations that do not fully inhibit replication (from 25 up to 300 &#x000b5;M) yielded variants that could grow to titers above 10<sup>5</sup> PFU/mL in the presence of 150 &#x000b5;M suramin. By passage 5 (P5) and passage 7, drug concentrations of 150 and 300 &#x000b5;M, respectively, were tolerated, concentrations that reduced wild-type virus titers by at least 2 logs [<xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Genotyping of the P5 virus revealed the presence of three nonsynonymous mutations in the CHIKV nsP1, nsP3 and E2 proteins. Two passages later (P7), the suramin-resistant variant had acquired several additional mutations in the same 3 proteins (<xref rid="viruses-12-00314-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>To pinpoint which of these mutations is/are responsible for the suramin-resistant phenotype, they were all reverse engineered into our CHIKV full-length cDNA clone [<xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], either alone or in combination. For each of the reverse-engineered viruses, the plaque phenotype and sensitivity to suramin were determined and for several mutants the growth kinetics were also compared. </p><p>Viruses with the R171Q and opal524R mutations (CHIKV mutants S4.1, S4.3 and S5) were found to produce larger plaques on Vero E6 cells, suggesting they could be linked to cell culture adaptation. Both R171Q and opal524R had been previously reported in CHIKV isolates such as MADOPY1, StBI and StVE (GenBank accession numbers KP003808.1, KP003811.1, and KP003810.1 respectively) which all had been passaged in cell culture prior to sequencing [<xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The mutation opal524R in the nsP3-coding region was reported also by Mounce et al. in the context of resistance selection against the compound DFMO [<xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], alongside with other nsP mutations. In the case of CHIKV and other alphaviruses (SFV, ONNV), evolutionary pressures have maintained both variants (stop and arginine codon) as it offers a fitness advantage when switching between vertebrate and invertebrate hosts [<xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The combination of the R171Q and opal524R mutations was also found independently during the selection of CHIKV variants that were resistant to an unrelated compound [<xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and they merely appear to reflect adaptation to repeated passaging in mammalian cells (under stress). </p><p>In contrast, the T301K mutation in nsP1, causing a small-plaque phenotype, and the two mutations in E2 (N5R and H18Q) that did not alter the plaque phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00314-f002">Figure 2</xref>a), have to our knowledge not been previously identified in other isolates. However, the T301 residue was found to be changed to an I in the CHIKV 181/25 vaccine strain, that was attenuated by repeated passaging in MRC-5 cells, and was accompanied by mutations T12I and G82R in E2, C42F in 6K and A404V in E1 [<xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It was later proven that T301I was not related to the attenuated phenotype of the vaccine strain, but that the two E2 mutations were responsible [<xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Reverse engineering of the N5R and H18Q mutations in E2 produced CHIKV variants with an increased tolerance to suramin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00314-f002">Figure 2</xref>a), as an increase in EC<sub>50</sub> was observed when both mutations were present (S5 and S9 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00314-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). This suggested that the two E2 mutations cause the suramin-resistant phenotype, identifying E2 as the target of the compound. The N5R mutation alone (S7) already provided suramin resistance, while H18Q (which appeared later in resistance selection) on its own (S8) had a less pronounced effect on resistance. However, as discussed below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00314-f003">Figure 3</xref>a), in another more direct assay there is a cumulative positive effect when the H18Q mutation is introduced in a virus that already contains the N5R mutation (S9).</p><p>The replication kinetics of relevant mutants, S4.3 (containing mutations in nsPs only), S9 (containing only the E2 mutations), and S5 (containing all mutations) were slightly faster than that of the wt control, reaching slightly higher titers by 24 h p.i., but similar titers by 36 h p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00314-f002">Figure 2</xref>b). Despite its faster replication, S4 is as sensitive to suramin treatment as the wt virus, with a 3-log reduction in titers upon treatment with 200 &#x003bc;M suramin. The S9 and S5 mutants, on the other hand, exhibited a titer reduction of only 1 log (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00314-f002">Figure 2</xref>c,d). These findings indicate that the nsP mutations (the S4 variant) were not involved in suramin resistance and that the E2 mutations alone were responsible for the resistant phenotype. </p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-viruses-12-00314"><title>3.3. The N5R and H18Q Mutations in E2 Enhance CHIKV Entry</title><p>To understand how the E2 mutations affect CHIKV infectivity in the presence of suramin, we analyzed the early steps (attachment, uptake, fusion) of infection, using a plaque number reduction assay in which virus and compound were present only during the first hour. We also reverse engineered a virus with a G82R mutation in E2, as this mutation was previously shown to render CHIKV fully dependent on HS binding for infection and is responsible for the attenuated phenotype of CHIKV vaccine strain 181/25 [<xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Among all E2 mutant viruses tested, the G82R mutant was extremely sensitive to suramin, as its uptake and infectivity were almost abolished in the presence of 50 &#x000b5;M suramin, whereas this concentration merely caused a 40% reduction for wt virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00314-f003">Figure 3</xref>a). The S7 and S9 mutants were indeed more resistant to suramin than wt virus, as their entry was not significantly inhibited by the presence of 50 &#x000b5;M suramin, while that of wt and S8 was. In the presence of 200 &#x000b5;M suramin, the uptake of wt virus, mutant S7 and mutant S8 was reduced to 40% of that of untreated cells, while the uptake of mutant S9 remained at ~60%, confirming that the presence of both E2 mutations leads to an increased resistance. The binding of mutant S9 at 4 &#x000b0;C, however, was inhibited to the same extent by suramin as that of wt virus, suggesting the N5R and H18Q mutations do not offer resistance to the compound during the attachment step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00314-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). This finding was corroborated by a time-of-addition assay where the pre-treatment of cells with suramin inhibited wt and mutant S9 to the same extent. However, if treatment was started at the moment of infection or later, the S9 mutant replicated better than the wt virus (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00314">supplemental Figure S3</xref>). Therefore, it seems that the two mutations allow the virus to overcome the inhibitory effect of suramin at a post-attachment step, such as fusion.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-viruses-12-00314"><title>3.4. Molecular Modelling Predicts Suramin to Bind between Two Adjacent E2 Proteins in a Mature Spike</title><p>The observations on the involvement of E2 mutations in suramin resistance prompted us to explore the interaction between the viral envelope protein and compound in more detail, by using a molecular docking approach. We employed a molecular docking approach using suramin and the E2 protein structure on its own, in the form of the E1-E2 heterodimer or as present within a mature CHIKV spike. Our initial attempts of docking suramin to an isolated E2 protein structure or to the E1-E2 heterodimer (PDB ID 3N42) revealed that the compound could interact with a region lacking a clear secondary structure (a groove between domains A and C and linked to the flexible N-terminal part of E2). The N5R mutation that was implicated in suramin resistance maps to this flexible region in the N-terminal domain of E2. Based on this predicted binding, the introduction of negative charges at position 6 and 160 (F6D, T160D) were expected to repel the binding of suramin to that area. To test whether this was indeed the case, these mutations were reverse engineered. The recombinant viruses had a plaque size similar to the wt CHIKV, but in CPE reduction assays they were more or equally sensitive to suramin, with EC50 of 54.5 &#x000b5;M (for F6D) and 16.7 &#x000b5;M (for T160D), compared to 55.5 &#x000b5;M of wt CHIKV. Previously Ho et al. have also docked suramin to the E1-E2 heterodimer and predicted that suramin would bind in a region between the two proteins [<xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. </p><p>In a more recent publication, a structure for the mature CHIKV spike was obtained by modeling the crystal structures of the E1 and E2 proteins into the cryo-EM image of a CHIKV VLP [<xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Due to this novel information, we now consider the earlier docking studies to be less representative for the natural situation, since in the context of a virion the suggested suramin binding sites would not be exposed in mature spikes, which are formed by E1-E2 heterotrimers (See <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00314">supplemental Figure S4</xref>). Therefore, to refine our understanding of the possible electrostatic interactions between suramin and the surface of CHIKV, we employed a molecular docking approach based on the more relevant model of the envelope heterotrimer. </p><p>In this model, suramin (depicted in yellow) interacts (&#x00394;G &#x02212;96.97 kcal/mol) with a very flexible loop in the N-terminal region of one E2 molecule, while it extends towards the middle of domain A of an adjacent E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00314-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). Moreover, several suramin molecules are predicted to bind the same spike. Because domain A is involved in receptor recognition, as well as being the target of neutralizing antibodies, it has a pivotal role in the viral replicative cycle [<xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>By analyzing the charge distribution on the surface of the CHIKV spike, it became clear that the N-terminal loop of E2 harbors positive charges (K at positions 3 and 10). By acquiring the mutation N5R, there was a clear increase in the positive charges (differences indicated with black rectangles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00314-f004">Figure 4</xref>b,c), probably leading to a stronger interaction with suramin and perhaps pulling it away from another area of the spike. Counterintuitively, because one would expect that a resistance mutation would prevent the interaction with suramin, we speculate that the N5R mutation actually attracts the compound thereby changing the binding mode. Perhaps the N5R mutation directs suramin away from the center of domain A, which is known to be involved in receptor recognition and is also the target of neutralizing antibodies [<xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>According to our molecular modelling prediction, the H18Q mutation, which is located in a region across from the E1 fusion loop, might enhance the effect of the N5R mutation by stabilizing the flexible N-terminal loop to achieve a better interaction with the compound or could cause some other structural changes in the heterotrimer leading to a decreased affinity for suramin. Additionally, H18Q could also facilitate fusion by aiding in the conformational rearrangements required for exposure of the fusion loop. Combined, the N5R and H18Q mutations might change the binding geometry of suramin, perhaps sidetracking it from the core of the E1/E2 heterodimer/spike and/or facilitating fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00314-f004">Figure 4</xref>c). </p><p>Our hypothesis that suramin is attracted to the center of domain A is further supported by the observation that the CHIKV variant that is completely dependent on heparan sulfate interactions for infectivity [<xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] has a G82R mutation in E2. In CPE-based assays, the G82R mutant is more sensitive to suramin than wt CHIKV, since 15 &#x000b5;M suramin still gave 85% protection, resulting in an EC<sub>50</sub> 15 &#x000b5;M for suramin, while the G82R mutation did not influence the EC<sub>50</sub> for the unrelated compound 6-aza-uridine. Interestingly, residue G82 is located at the center of the spike, where the A domains of the three E2 subunits are found (highlighted in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00314-f004">Figure 4</xref>a), and maps to the area that interacts with Mxra8, a receptor which was recently found to promote CHIKV entry [<xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The introduction of a positive charge at position 82 of E2 could increase the affinity for suramin at the center of the spike and block cell attachment.</p><p>These results suggest that suramin could have more impact on the infection when it is attracted to the center of the spike, while more distant positive charges could direct it away from this important region, allowing attachment and interaction with specific receptors, which could explain why the observed the suramin-resistance mutations emerged.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-viruses-12-00314"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>The aim of our study was to understand how suramin inhibits the early steps of the replicative cycle of CHIKV and other alphaviruses. We have shown that suramin can interact with CHIKV in vitro, and inhibits attachment of the virus to the host cell. Moreover, it could prevent conformational rearrangements in the viral spike glycoproteins that are required for fusion. We were able to select suramin-resistant CHIKV variants and demonstrated that the N5R and H18Q mutations in E2 were responsible for resistance. These mutations did not offer the virus a major advantage during the binding to cells in the presence of suramin. The benefit of these mutations appears to play a role in overcoming suramin&#x02019;s inhibitory effects during later stages of entry, perhaps allowing the suramin-bound (mutant) spikes to undergo conformational changes required for fusion and progression of the infection. Although CHIKV is able to acquire resistance mutations to the compound, suramin is still an interesting drug candidate as the level of resistance is rather low and required repeated passaging. Additionally, suramin protected human primary dermal fibroblasts from CHIKV-induced CPE with an EC<sub>50</sub> of approx. 95 &#x000b5;M, proving its efficacy in a more relevant cell model for arbovirus infection.</p><p>Regarding its use in humans, suramin could be explored as prophylactic in the context of an outbreak, since it is a compound with one of the longest known half-lives in humans [<xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In previous clinical studies, concerning the treatment of AIDS and certain types of cancer, multiple and serious side effects were attributed to the long-term use of suramin [<xref rid="B45-viruses-12-00314" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, this concerned seriously ill patients and long-term treatment. Such an extended regimen is not required for the treatment of parasitic infections for which suramin has proven to be effective and much better tolerated. Therefore, we believe that also for the short-term treatment or prevention of chikungunya virus infections, suramin would be an interesting drug to evaluate. </p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Laura A.

Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) 2018.10 (Chemical Computing Group, 2018) and Maestro (Schr&#x000f6;dinger, 2017) were used as molecular modelling software. The CHIKV E2-E1 glycoprotein heterodimer and trimeric complex structures were downloaded from the PDB data bank (<uri xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/">http://www.rcsb.org/</uri>; PDB code 3N42 and 3J2W). The proteins were preprocessed using the Schr&#x000f6;dinger Protein Preparation Wizard by assigning bond orders, adding hydrogens and performing a restrained energy minimization of the added hydrogens using the OPLS_2005 force field. The missing N-terminal residues at the start of the E2 protein (residues 1&#x02013;6) were manually introduced and energy minimized. Suramin structure was built with MOE and then prepared using the Maestro LigPrep tool by energy minimizing the structures (OPLS_2005 force filed), generating possible ionization states at pH 7 &#x000b1; 2, generating tautomers and low-energy ring conformers. SiteMap tool in Maestro was used to individuate a potential binding area in proximity of the important mutations, N5R and H18Q. The selected area was used as binding site for the molecular docking studies. For the trimeric complex, three different, one for each heterodimer, 36 &#x000c5; docking grids (inner-box 10 &#x000c5; and outer-box 46 &#x000c5;) were prepared using as centroid a threonine residue localized at the spatial center between the N5 and H18 of two adjacent E2 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00314-f0A1">Figure A1</xref>). In the case of the isolated E2 unit, the same binding area for grid generation was defined selecting as centroid a dummy atom, manually positioned at equal distance from N5 and H18. Molecular docking studies were performed using Glide SP precision keeping the default parameters and setting 5 as number of output poses per input ligand to include in the solution. The output database was saved as mol2 file. The docking results were visually inspected for their ability to bind the active site. The electrostatic potential surface was obtained using the Surfaces and Maps toll in MOE after splitting the molecule in multiple chains.
