Youth living with HIV demonstrate the poorest care outcomes, compared to other age groups.</p><p><bold>Objectives</bold>: To systematically evaluate evidence on the effects of decentralising facility-based HIV care on care outcomes for youth living with HIV in low- and middle-income countries.</p><p><bold>Methods</bold>: A systematic review was conducted through 12 electronic databases of peer-reviewed articles, conference abstracts, and grey literature; contacting relevant experts; and hand-searching references. Records were included if they were published after 1 January 1996 (advent of triple-drug ART) and reported health outcomes for decentralised and centralised care, separately, or evaluated the effect of decentralised care on care outcomes. Two authors independently screened search results. When age-disaggregated data (10&#x02013;24 years old) were required for inclusion, we contacted study authors for data abstraction. Implementation fidelity of decentralisation, study quality, and risk of bias was assessed using the TIDieR checklist, CASP checklists, and ROBINS-I tool, respectively.</p><p><bold>Results</bold>: Of 11 potentially eligible studies, two studies from sub-Saharan Africa met inclusion criteria after data disaggregation by age. The studies and abstracted data were insufficiently homogenous in implementation and study design to justify meta-analysis. However, evidence suggests the potential for decentralised care to result in at least equivalent attrition-related outcomes (retention in care and mortality) for youth within decentralised HIV care. Limited sample size and significant selection and allocation bias confound clear, generalisable conclusions for youth living with HIV in resource-limited settings.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: There is a paucity of evidence for the effects of decentralising HIV care for youth living in resource-limited settings, particularly recent evidence reflective of the current HIV care landscape. Further work is required to rigorously analyse the effects of decentralising HIV care to inform policymakers and care providers, particularly as demand for HIV care in this population grows.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>antiretroviral therapy</kwd><kwd>decentralisation</kwd><kwd>youth</kwd><kwd>healthcare</kwd><kwd>facility-based</kwd><kwd>adolescents</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Economic and Social Research Council</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100000269</named-content></funding-source><award-id>ES/J500112/1</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Economic and Social Research Council</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100000269</named-content></funding-source><award-id>Advanced Quantitative Methods Studentship</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Economic and Social Research Council</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100000269</named-content></funding-source><award-id>IAA-MT13-003</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">FP7 Ideas: European Research Council</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100011199</named-content></funding-source><award-id>FP7/2007-2013/ERC grant agreement no 313421</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Leverhulme Trust</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100000275</named-content></funding-source><award-id>PLP-2014- 095</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Clarendon Fund</named-content></funding-source><award-id>Clarendon Fund Scholarship</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>RH is jointly funded through the Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J500112/1] and the Clarendon Fund [Clarendon Fund Scholarship].

In the third decade of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the disease burden has shifted to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which currently house 90% of the world&#x02019;s HIV-infected population [<xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>]. The efficacy of ART has also turned HIV infection into a manageable, long-term illness, such that perinatally infected children are able to survive through to adolescence and adulthood [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>].</p><p>Adolescents and youth represent 37% of new global infections and have consequently been described as the &#x02018;centre of the epidemic&#x02019; [<xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]. As children survive to adolescence and youth, they experience increasing ownership of their health and medicine-taking practices, in a crucial transition phase. Yet, compared to other age groups, adolescents and youths living with HIV demonstrate the lowest rates of ART adherence, poorest health outcomes under care, and lowest access to and utilisation of health-care services [<xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]. Adolescents are the only age group for which AIDS-related deaths are not decreasing [<xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref>]. AIDS remains the leading cause of death among adolescents in Africa, and the number of AIDS-related deaths has tripled since 2000 [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>].</p><p>Even when enrolled in care, HIV-positive adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa demonstrate particularly poor health outcomes, as compared to adults [<xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref>]. In a cohort study using routinely collected data from 160 HIV clinics in Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Rwanda, youths aged 15&#x02013;24 had the highest attrition in care rates (31.1%) compared to all other age groups, including early adolescents and adults [<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>]. Longitudinal cohort studies have confirmed these findings: a study using data from 1999 to 2006 in southern Africa reported lower adherence rates for adolescents compared to adults after 12 months on ART (14.3% vs. 27.6%) [<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]. Similarly, a study from rural Uganda reported that only 65% of adolescents on ART were retained in care from 2006 to 2011 [<xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>]. Further, longitudinal studies in South Africa and southern Africa have reported that adolescents (11&#x02013;19 years old) are less likely to achieve viral suppression and more likely to experience shorter time to viral rebound, compared to adults [<xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>].</p><p>In LMICs, improved survival of HIV-positive children, combined with high new HIV infection rates among youth, has created a large, growing population of youth requiring ART [<xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>]. In parallel, UN guidelines have called for massive efforts to scale up ART initiation and treatment maintenance globally. Guidelines also call for ART initiation at increasingly earlier stages of infection, such as the enrolment of all HIV-infected persons on ART by 2030 [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>]. To achieve such levels of scaled-up care with limited resources, LMICs began decentralising HIV care in the mid-to-late 2000s, in alignment with recommendations from the World Health Organisation [<xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0022">22</xref>].</p><p>The primary goals of decentralisation are to expand healthcare accessibility and availability by shifting the majority of care from centralised hospitals to primary care clinics [<xref rid="CIT0023">23</xref>]. Thereby, decentralisation increases the number of facilities and health-care professionals within them that can provide basic care within them &#x02013; such as monthly antiretroviral provision [<xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0025">25</xref>]. Additionally, decentralisation brings care closer to patients for whom hospitals in urban centres may be inaccessible. Although decentralisation theoretically allows for a greater number of people to access HIV care, it also requires patients to engage with a new type of healthcare &#x02013; including different facilities with fewer resources and different care providers, generally with lower levels of training.</p><p>Decentralisation of HIV care is a mode of differentiating HIV care, wherein stable patients are down-referred to lower-level health-care facilities such as community health centres or primary care clinics [<xref rid="CIT0026">26</xref>]. Alongside the scale-up of ART initiation, WHO guidelines have emphasized the need to scale-up differentiated service delivery [<xref rid="CIT0027">27</xref>]. Hence, decentralising facility-based HIV care is both a form of differentiating care, and further differentiated care can be delivered within decentralised care, considering the particular care needs for specific patient populations [<xref rid="CIT0028">28</xref>]. For instance, in South Africa, even patients adopting further decentralised adherence strategies such as central chronic medicine dispensing and distribution (CMDD) programmes must engage with facility-based decentralised care through regular clinical appointments for examinations and blood tests at primary care clinics [<xref rid="CIT0028">28</xref>].</p><p>One systematic review of decentralising HIV treatment among adult and paediatric populations in LMICs suggested the non-inferiority of this care delivery model [<xref rid="CIT0026">26</xref>]. Similarly, two systematic reviews reported at least comparable outcomes when comparing routine care to task-shifted ART delivery for adults and children from physicians to non-physician health-care workers in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="CIT0029">29</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0030">30</xref>]. Task-shifting care is often a key component of decentralisation, but these two interventions can be implemented separately or together. However, none of these reviews specifically examined outcomes among adolescents or youth as a distinct category, so their findings may not apply to young people.</p><p>To date, there have been no systematic reviews published in English that evaluate the effects of facility-based decentralisation of ART care among HIV-positive adolescents and youths in LMICs. This gap in evidence is particularly concerning given that facility-based decentralisation is currently being scaled up throughout LMICs as a strategy for improving ART coverage and maintenance. Evidence on the efficacy of this mode of delivery for youths living with HIV is required to understand how best to optimise care delivery and outcomes. The importance of this research is further underscored by the fact that HIV-positive youth continue to demonstrate the greatest difficulty in accessing and maintaining HIV care.</p><p>Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate the effects of decentralising HIV care on health outcomes for adolescents and youths living with HIV in LMICs, compared to those receiving centralised care. This review systematically assesses evidence for the effectiveness of decentralising ART care delivery on health outcomes of HIV-positive adolescents and youth in LMICs.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a systematic review of the evidence following Cochrane Collaboration guidelines, according to a registered protocol (PROSPERO Registration #CRD42016051907) [<xref rid="CIT0031">31</xref>].</p><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Inclusion criteria for the review were the following:

In a subsequent search, we updated all 12 searches for publications between October 2016 and the new search date (15 February 2019).

</p><p>Both studies were designed as retrospective cohort analyses of decentralising ART initiation and management, with task-shifting of care integrated into both interventions. Significant differences in the implementation of decentralisation &#x02013; and any co-interventions &#x02013; are further discussed below. Both studies recruited participants using registration records from included facilities, including all HIV-positive patients enrolled in care from facility inception. Analysed data were comprised of clinical records extracted from patient records and HIV registers. Data coverage for both studies began in 2004, but collection ended in December 2008 for the Malawian study [<xref rid="CIT0038">38</xref>] and September 2009 for the Ugandan study [<xref rid="CIT0037">37</xref>]. For adolescents and youths, available outcomes for analysis were attrition in care (including mortality) for the Ugandan study [<xref rid="CIT0037">37</xref>] and retention in care and mortality, separately, for the study in Malawi [<xref rid="CIT0032">32</xref>].</p><p>In the Iganga District of eastern Uganda, decentralisation of ART maintenance began by shifting care from the public general hospital in town to four rural health centres between December 2005 and May 2007 [<xref rid="CIT0037">37</xref>]. In February 2007, both ART initiation and management were decentralised to these health centres, with provision of the necessary physical resources and care provider training. These health centres were open once or twice a week and outfitted to provide HIV-positive patients with 30-day supplies of ARVs. Health centres also provided HIV testing, one ART register per facility, and equipment for routinely weighing patients, although no CD4 counting equipment was available in the district. Drug supplies at health centres were delivered by the National Medical Store under the Ugandan Ministry of Health. At the health centres, care was provided by clinical officers, nurses, or midwives who had undergone the standardised national training course for comprehensive HIV care and ART provision. Study authors evaluated clinical records retrospectively in an observational study, without involvement in the delivery of decentralised care [<xref rid="CIT0037">37</xref>].</p><p>In southern Malawi&#x02019;s Zomba District, the decentralisation and scale-up of ART care was facilitated through the Malawian Department of HIV and AIDS, with assistance from Dignitas International, a Canadian humanitarian NGO [<xref rid="CIT0032">32</xref>]. In the district, decentralised ART management beyond the single tertiary hospital began in March 2007. Decentralisation of ART initiation began in April 2008. At the 16 decentralised rural health centres in the study, ART care was delivered with the co-intervention of an integrated primary care model unique within Malawi, such that HIV services were integrated into routine outpatient services. To facilitate both scale-up and integrated care, Dignitas International provided intensive physical and human resources, including staffing at facilities as well as biweekly supervision, monthly mentorship, and training support for lower-cadre Ministry of Health healthcare workers. Across the 16 decentralised health centre sites, care was provided by 2 physicians visiting on a monthly basis, 5 clinical officers, 20 medical assistants, 70 nurses, 16 ART clerks, and 16 ART counsellors [<xref rid="CIT0032">32</xref>]. Further details about the implementation of decentralisation in the two studies, including the breakdown of staffing across the 16 facilities, are provided in Additional File 2.</p><p>Overall, considerable heterogeneity was observed in the design and implementation of decentralisation between the two studies. Notably, the study in Malawi delivered decentralised care alongside an integrated primary care model with intensive support from Dignitas International. Furthermore, age-disaggregated data from both studies were significantly limited in scope and depth. Age-disaggregated data for the Uganda study only provided comparative findings on one of the three outcomes in the full study &#x02013; attrition. Age-disaggregated data provided for the Malawi study were only uncontrolled summary data for outcomes in the two study arms. Without individual-level data for covariates, adjusted analyses or meta-analysis between studies was not possible.</p></sec><sec id="S0003-S2002"><title>Assessment of study quality and risk of bias</title><p>Following assessments via checklist for cohort studies, both studies were judged to have fair methodological quality. The study in Malawi by Chan et al. had a large sample of adolescents and youths aged 10&#x02013;24 that allowed for precise estimates (n = 1062) [<xref rid="CIT0032">32</xref>]. However, the study in Uganda by Scheibe et al. had limited data available for the same age group (n = 56), resulting in low precision of youth-specific outcomes [<xref rid="CIT0037">37</xref>]. The two cohort studies provided limited controls for baseline differences between the decentralised and centralised patient arms &#x02013; such as baseline viral load or CD4 count, which would have reflected differences in immunovirological function at the study onset. Chan et al. adjusted analyses only using WHO stage at ART initiation [<xref rid="CIT0032">32</xref>]. Scheibe et al. controlled analyses for most recent WHO stage, which most likely reflects a morbidity outcome, rather than a baseline characteristic for adjustment [<xref rid="CIT0037">37</xref>]. Additionally, the latter study applied complete-case analysis, excluding 16 youth patients missing any form of data, and potentially significant differences from included participants were not evaluated [<xref rid="CIT0037">37</xref>].</p><p>Finally, through using only retrospective review of clinical records to identify care-terminating outcomes, both studies face significant threats to the validity of measurements of mortality and, consequently, attrition from care. Previous studies in sub-Saharan Africa have indicated that mortality reporting within health-care facilities is often incomplete, requiring follow-up tracing for greater accuracy [<xref rid="CIT0047">47</xref>]. Thus, the true rates of mortality in both cohorts were likely higher than those reported, based on facilities&#x02019; vital registry data [<xref rid="CIT0048">48</xref>]. Additionally, in measuring retention in care, Chan et al. did not account for possible transfers to other facilities when patients were considered lost to follow-up (LTFU) [<xref rid="CIT0032">32</xref>]. By contrast, Scheibe et al. corrected rates of attrition for documented instances of patient transfers to different facilities [<xref rid="CIT0037">37</xref>].</p><p>Both studies were judged to have serious risk of bias, particularly in two domains. Baseline confounding due to biased allocation into study arms, without sufficient controls for baseline differences, was a source of bias for both studies. Additionally, the Ugandan study had serious risk of selection bias for participation in the study, due to excluding potential participants who did not have patient files (16.9% of the sample, across all ages) [<xref rid="CIT0037">37</xref>]. The study in Malawi also faced serious risk of bias from delivering the integrated primary care co-intervention, the effects of which could not be separated from those of decentralising ART care [<xref rid="CIT0032">32</xref>]. Alongside decentralising HIV care, Chan et al. were assessing the effects of integrating primary care into HIV care at lower-level facilities, with provision of physical resources and staff training to implement this integrated care model. Full details of authors&#x02019; judgment for risk of bias for each domain are available in Additional File 3.</p></sec><sec id="S0003-S2003"><title>Study findings</title><p><xref rid="T0002">Table 2</xref> summarises the characteristics and main findings of included studies, restricted to adolescent- and youth-specific data. For comparison between decentralised and centralised arms, neither study reported youths&#x02019; outcomes beyond attrition-related data. While Chan et al. presented retention and care and mortality outcomes separately, Scheibe et al. reported on overall attrition, which is comprised of both loss to follow-up and mortality [<xref rid="CIT0037">37</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0038">38</xref>].

</p><p>In Uganda, a total of 63 participants included in the study were aged 10&#x02013;24 at baseline, among whom the median age was 19 years (IQR 13&#x02013;22) [<xref rid="CIT0037">37</xref>]. Decentralisation status was determined by the site of ART initiation, with 47 (74.6%) initiating at the hospital and 16 (25.4%) initiating at a health centre. Because ART was available at the hospital before the health centres, the median time on ART was longer for centralised adolescents and youths (p &#x0003c; 0.001). Attrition from care was defined as not attending the facility at least once during the 90 days prior to the audit in September 2009 (including mortality), except for documented transfers to another facility. In the centralised arm, attrition from care was observed for 26/47 (55.3%) youths, of whom 13 (50%) had passed away and 8 (30.8%) had been officially classified as lost to follow-up. By contrast, in the decentralised arm, 6/16 (37.5%) demonstrated attrition from care according to the study definition. However, in a multivariate Cox regression, decentralised care did not significantly predict attrition from care (aHR 0.79 [95%CI 0.26&#x02013;2.40], <italic>p</italic>= 0.681), controlling for sex, most recent WHO stage, and time from HIV test to ART start. Only 56 participants were included in this analysis, because complete-case analysis was applied and 7 participants were missing at least one datapoint included in the regression.</p><p>In Malawi, among the 1062 participants aged 10&#x02013;24 at baseline in the study, median age at initiation was 21 (IQR 14&#x02013;23) [<xref rid="CIT0032">32</xref>]. Decentralised patients were designated as those receiving ART management at a health centre rather than the central hospital (n = 436, 41.1%). Study authors provided data on the total number of participants in each arm who reached the final outcomes of all-cause mortality and defaulting from care. Defaulting was defined as not attending the facility for &#x0003e;3 months since the last scheduled visit, censored to the end of data collection. Testing for uncontrolled between-group differences via Chi-square test, decentralised participants were significantly less likely than centralised participants to have passed away (OR 0.14 [95%CI 0.07&#x02013;0.29], <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c; 0.001) and less likely to have defaulted from care (OR 0.37 [95%CI 0.26&#x02013;0.55], <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c; 0.001). However, because individual-level data were not available for the 10&#x02013;24-year-old subsample, we were not able to calculate adjusted odds ratios for outcomes, accounting for other covariates such as gender, WHO stage at initiation, or duration on ART.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S0004"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although decentralised ART has been rolled out across LMICs, we identified only two studies that reviewed its effectiveness for adolescent and youth health outcomes. Both were retrospective cohort studies from sub-Saharan Africa that analysed clinic-based records for all ART patients at those facilities, across all ages.</p><p>After disaggregating data for participants aged 10&#x02013;24, findings in both studies were limited to attrition-related outcomes, such as retention in care and mortality. The heterogeneity in implementation of decentralisation and limited availability of age-specific data between the two studies did not allow for meta-analysis. Furthermore, the studies approximated attrition using non-interchangeable definitions. While the study in Uganda evaluated overall attrition (inclusive of all-cause mortality but adjusting for facility transfers), the study in Malawi defined defaulting from care separate from all-cause mortality (without adjusting for facility transfers). Because both studies relied solely on retrospective review of facilities&#x02019; vital registries to determine mortality, both likely underestimate the amount of attrition due to mortality [<xref rid="CIT0048">48</xref>]. By accounting for transfers, Scheibe et al. provided a more conservative and realistic estimate of true attrition from care in Uganda, while Chan et al. likely overestimated attrition by not accounting for transfers in Malawi.</p><p>Nevertheless, results from these two studies indicated the potential for decentralised HIV care to result in at least equivalent attrition-related outcomes as routine, centralised care for adolescents and youth. Both studies reported low rates of overall retention in HIV care for this population &#x02013; consistent with findings from previous studies &#x02013; but decentralising ART delivery seemed to provide a sustainable model for servicing a growing patient population in resource-limited settings [<xref rid="CIT0049">49</xref>]. However, to maintain safe and efficacious delivery of care, the actual implementation of decentralisation is critical.</p><p>In achieving at least equivalent outcomes on decentralised care, Chan et al. particularly note the significance of differentiating care across primary versus tertiary sites based on patient stability and care needs [<xref rid="CIT0038">38</xref>]. In theory, decentralisation should allow for patient mobility across care levels, such that patients presenting with complications at a primary clinic, including new opportunistic infections or treatment failure, should be able to return to tertiary care until reaching stability again [<xref rid="CIT0026">26</xref>]. Hence, these studies confirm the importance of proper selection of patients suitable for decentralised care at primary sites.</p><p>Furthermore, both studies highlight the need to consider service and supply factors within decentralised care, beyond the relocation of stable patients to primary care sites. In particular, both studies note that differences in performance between decentralised and centralised sites may be more dependent on clinical staff-related factors such as staff retention and turnover as well as supply-side factors like consistent availability of antiretroviral drugs and laboratory services [<xref rid="CIT0037">37</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0038">38</xref>].</p><p>However, the quality and sample sizes of data do not permit clear conclusions to be drawn for this population in LMICs, particularly as both studies did not sufficiently match the control groups or account for potential biases.</p><p>The study in Uganda reported that decentralised patients were significantly less likely to die or drop out of care. However, the application of complete case analysis excluded potential participants without patient files. Because hospital-based patients were found to be more likely to lack patient files, this mode of analysis introduces potential survivorship bias, likely towards null or favouring decentralised outcomes [<xref rid="CIT0037">37</xref>]. Additionally, analyses did not sufficiently adjust for baseline differences between decentralised and centralised groups. The higher morbidity and longer duration in care within the centralised arm could also have biased results towards null. Similarly, Chan et al. noted that there was significant selection bias in allocation to study arms, whereby stable patients were more likely to receive decentralised care. This selection bias introduces bias towards positive outcomes for decentralised youths. Because of the limited data available for adolescents and young people specifically, between-group comparisons for rates of mortality and retention in care could not be adjusted for baseline clinical staging or other covariates, as was done in the full sample.</p><p>Indeed, most studies on the effectiveness of decentralised care in paediatric and adult cohorts are limited by similar challenges in between-group controls [<xref rid="CIT0050">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0052">52</xref>]. Some studies controlled for differences in baseline health profiles of study arms by adjusting for CD4 values, but adjustments were limited by incomplete coverage of CD4 testing, often disproportionately in the decentralised arm [<xref rid="CIT0022">22</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0042">42</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0053">53</xref>]. However, one of the more rigorously designed cohort studies &#x02013; which controlled for baseline BMI, history of ART use, CD4 count, and WHO stage &#x02013; found higher mortality and attrition among centralised adults on ART in rural Malawi, compared to decentralised adults [<xref rid="CIT0039">39</xref>].</p><p>Generalizability of findings from included studies is further limited by the narrow feasibility and applicability of the decentralisation model tested in Malawi, given the intensive, frequent NGO support [<xref rid="CIT0037">37</xref>]. In the early years of decentralisation rollout, including the years of data collection, substantial NGO support was frequent in order to build capacity and test feasibility for this new model of care [<xref rid="CIT0054">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0056">56</xref>]. However, in recent years, such intensive NGO support has become increasingly uncommon in public facilities and varies across and within countries, making interventions run with substantial NGO support non-representative [<xref rid="CIT0057">57</xref>]. Since 2010, although the number of patients receiving decentralised HIV care has increased, responsibility for delivering sustainable decentralised care has significantly shifted towards public facilities themselves [<xref rid="CIT0058">58</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0059">59</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless, this review identifies an important gap in knowledge about the effects of this widespread public health approach for this particularly vulnerable population, which has already been rolled out in many LMICs. Several cohort studies trace the health outcomes of adolescents and young persons receiving decentralised care. However, this review found only two that allowed for the comparison of their health outcomes while in decentralised versus centralised care, which would inform how best to optimise care for this population [<xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0060">60</xref>]. The literature gap identified here has several key implications for future research and practice.</p><p>Although 11 potentially eligible studies included adolescents and youths within their cohorts, only 2 studies were able to disaggregate data for them. In part, the limited data available for this population is because the WHO and many other organisations have summarised adult and paediatric data as &#x02265;15 years and &#x0003c;15 years categories, respectively [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]. Consequently, national data specific to health outcomes for this population are frequently unavailable. Due to recognition of the importance of this vulnerable population in recent years, countries have been requested to disaggregate data for this population. However, most countries lack sufficient health system infrastructure to do so. This review contributes to the literature indicating the urgent need for strengthened health systems that allow for this more granular focus on adolescents and youths within routine health monitoring programming [<xref rid="CIT0061">61</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0062">62</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, this review highlights another key gap in the literature: the scarcity of studies evaluating the effects of decentralised HIV care within the past 5&#x02013;8 years. More recent studies would reflect the current reality of decentralisation, rather than the landscape in its early years. In fact, of the 11 studies whose authors were contacted for age-disaggregated data, only 4 had any post-2011 data [<xref rid="CIT0043">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0046">46</xref>]. Thus, this review indicates the urgent need for more up-to-date studies evaluating decentralised HIV care as it is currently being implemented, using recent &#x02013; and therefore relevant &#x02013; health outcome data.</p><p>Finally, across studies evaluated for this review, outcome data were most comprehensive for attrition-related measures, including mortality and loss to follow-up. Very few studies of decentralisation, across all ages, evaluated health outcomes beyond &#x02018;end-of-care&#x02019; events, such as virological, immunological, or morbidity outcomes. Only 3 of the 11 potentially eligible studies for this review included any outcomes beyond mortality, loss to follow-up, and transfers out of care [<xref rid="CIT0039">39</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0043">43</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0046">46</xref>]. This review highlights the need for studies to rigorously evaluate the effects of decentralisation on these non-terminal outcomes, which provide a more comprehensive understanding of the lived experience of ART patients and their outcomes while within care.</p><p>This review provides a comprehensive assessment of the effect of decentralising HIV care for adolescents and youths living in LMICs. It is the first systematic review to focus on this model of care delivery for this population. Strengths of this review include its inclusive search strategy, including grey literature and multiple databases and allowing for the age disaggregation of data for studies including the target population. Additionally, this review provided rigorous critical appraisal of included studies&#x02019; quality and risk of bias. However, limitations include restriction of the search to English-language studies, which may have omitted evaluations published in other languages. An additional limitation is suboptimal reporting of outcome data for adolescents and youths in the included studies, which did not allow for meta-analysis of findings and subsequently for clear conclusions to be drawn.</p></sec><sec id="S0005"><title>Conclusions</title><p>As decentralised ART care continues to scale up globally, further primary research is urgently required to evaluate the effects of decentralising HIV care delivery for adolescents and young people in LMICs, particularly using recent data that reflects the current landscape of health systems&#x02019; care burdens. Although decentralised ART delivery is already being implemented worldwide, further research is required to evaluate the efficacy of this approach for HIV-positive youth in order to identify opportunities for optimising care outcomes. Importantly, more rigorous study designs are required to truly examine the effect of decentralisation, as well as evaluations of outcomes beyond attrition that characterise health progression within care. Existing evidence is limited in both quantity and quality. The evidence base on decentralisation is largely limited to adult and paediatric populations, with very few studies able to provide adolescent- and youth-specific data that would allow for an understanding of how this mode of care delivery affects one of the most vulnerable populations living with HIV.</p></sec></body><back><bio id="B0001"><p>Study conception: RH, LC; Study design: RH; Search strategy: RH; Study screening: RH, JS; Appraisal of studies: RH; Manuscript drafting: RH; Manuscript review and finalization: RH, JS, LC.

Youth demonstrate the worst HIV outcomes of all age groups. This systematic review evaluates the effect of decentralising HIV care on youth health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. Two studies met inclusion criteria. Both were out-dated and poorly controlled, limiting implications for the present context. This review highlights the urgent need to better understand how decentralising HIV care may affect this vulnerable population.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS</collab></person-group>
