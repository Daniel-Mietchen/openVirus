    "BACKGROUND:Although human-to-human transmission of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome phlebovirus (SFTSV) via direct contact with body fluids has been reported, the role of specific body fluids from SFTSV-infected hosts has not been investigated in detail. METHODS:To demonstrate the virus transmission kinetics in SFTSV-infected hosts, we adapted the ferret infection model and evaluated the virus shedding periods, virus titers, and transmission modes from various specimens of infected ferrets. RESULTS:Large amounts of infectious SFTSV are shed through nasal discharge, saliva, and urine from SFTSV-infected ferrets. Virus could be detected from 2 dpi and persisted until 12 dpi in these specimens, compared with the relatively short virus-shedding period in sera. Further, transmission studies revealed that SFTSV can be transmitted to close direct and indirect contact na√Øve animals through various mediums, especially through contact with serum and urine. Further, ferrets contacted with human urine specimens from SFTSV-positive patients were successfully infected with SFTSV, suggesting that urine specimens could be a source of SFTSV infection in humans. CONCLUSIONS:Our results demonstrate that the SFTSV can be shed in various body fluids for more than 12 days and that these specimens could be a source for direct or indirect transmission through close personal contact."
