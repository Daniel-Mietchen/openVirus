The entire humanity has to fight in this war against the unexpected and each and every individual role is important. Healthcare system is doing exceptional work and the government is taking various measures that help the society to control the spread. Public, on the other hand, coordinates with the policies and act accordingly in most state of affairs. But the role of technologies in assisting different social bodies to fight against the pandemic remains hidden. The intention of our study is to uncover the hidden roles of technologies that ultimately help for controlling the pandemic. On investigating, it is found that the strategies utilizing potential technologies would yield better benefits and these technological strategies can be framed either to control the pandemic or to support the confinement of the society during pandemic which in turn aids in controlling the spreading of infection. This study enlightens the various implemented technologies that assists the healthcare systems, government and public in diverse aspects for fighting against COVID-19. Furthermore, the technological swift that happened during the pandemic and their influence in the environment and society is discussed. Besides the implemented technologies, this work also deals with untapped potential technologies that have prospective applications in controlling the pandemic circumstances. Alongside the various discussion, our suggested solution for certain situational issues is also presented.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="ab0010"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p><fig id="f0050" position="anchor"><alt-text id="al0070">Unlabelled Image</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="ga1_lrg"/></fig></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0015"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="l0030"><list-item id="li0030"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0030">The technology shift occurred in society during the COVID-19 pandemic and its influence.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0035"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0035">Technology-based strategies in controlling the pandemic and to support the society.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0040"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0040">Key technologies include Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning, supply chain, communication and surveillance.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0045"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0045">Potential roles of IoT, Drone &#x00026;Robotic technologies and mobile applications.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0050"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0050">Influence of existing technologies, challenges and future impacts on society.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Technology</kwd><kwd>Society</kwd><kwd>Environment</kwd><kwd>Healthcare system</kwd><kwd>Artificial intelligence</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0055">The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) had originated from China as the first case was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Eventually, it started to spread in various regions throughout China and on 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) (<xref rid="bb0690" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2020a</xref>) which later became a global pandemic. As of 7 April 2020, the WHO Situation report-78 indicates more than 1.2 million confirmed cases and deaths greater than 72,000 globally (<xref rid="bb0695" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2020b</xref>). The infection is spreading day by day and the healthcare system struggles to take care of every infected individual especially in excessively infected countries such as USA, Italy, Spain and the list goes on. Though the characteristics of this novel coronavirus are not well known, we can infer its behavior from the statistics such as rapid rate of spread, vulnerability is higher for low immune, diabetic and aged people, widely different pattern of recovery rate and other information we have is that it spreads by a human to human transmission through droplets or by direct contact and the incubation period for the infection has been estimated as 2&#x02013;14&#x000a0;days (<xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0060">To encounter the situation, healthcare systems have put their tremendous efforts in treating the infected individuals and also for testing the public for coronavirus diagnosis. Governments are doing their best to mitigate the infection and also to meet the requirements for the healthcare system. Moreover, unfortunately, there is neither a medicine for the cure nor a vaccine for prevention of this novel coronavirus as of 10 April 2020. But countries have been trying various treatment methods and usage of different suitable medicines (without proper confirmation). The preventive measures defined by the WHO is to wash the hands frequently with soap and water or with an alcohol-based hand rub, following social distancing, and practicing respiratory hygiene (<xref rid="bb0700" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2020c</xref>). Masks will also play a role in safeguarding people from infection and it is mandatory to know when and how to use the mask. Apart from it, the only way to stop the infection from spreading is by staying at home and avoiding social gathering, following social distancing and isolating us from infected people or people subjected to quarantine. Hence, to stop the spread, it requires a combined effort from all social bodies such as the healthcare system, government and more importantly from the public. And they can be controlled only to a limited extent. Besides, the extensive utilization of potential technologies together with effective healthcare treatment and strong governance will be astonishing that would strengthen the defense line to fight against COVID-19.</p><p id="p0065">Technologies have been consistently developing day-by-day but during an unexpected circumstance as of COVID-19 pandemic, the role of these technologies to support humanity in various means is substantial. It is ofcourse acknowledged that the credits for the healthcare system is exceptional in tackling the situation but the part of technologies in supporting the healthcare system, government and also public remains unnoticed. The contribution of these technologies in fighting against novel coronavirus may be either directly impacting or indirectly impacting. The former refers to the technology by the implementation of which the spread of the infection is mitigated or the difficulties of the healthcare system have been buckled down. The latter involves those technologies that have been helpful in supporting the government and the public to deal with the situation.</p><p id="p0070">The prime objective of our study is to investigate various technology-based strategies that assist the environment in controlling the pandemic and also other viable technologies that have the potential to be used. The outcome of our study is to make the readers, professionals and scholars to understand the contributions of the technologies in controlling the epidemic and further, to encourage the implementation of these technologies in near-future.

</p><p id="p0095">This work mainly consists of seven sections apart from the introduction. The first section shows the framework of our study and the following section explains the changes that the environment and the society have been through in handling the pandemic situation from different social bodies aspects such as government, healthcare system, public, industries, and also from an environmental and energy point of view. The next section deals with the technological strategies that are implemented to control the pandemic which includes Information communication, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and supply chain strategies. And the subsequent section gives an insight of indirectly impacting technological strategies whose purpose is to support the confinement of the society during pandemic crisis. This section comprises the sub-domains such as work from home, distance learning, and surveillance. These two sections altogether cover the directly and indirectly influencing technologies in controlling the pandemic and are also backed up with few practical illustrations. Then, the prospective technologies that are less used but have immense potential in supporting the society during epidemic difficulties is also discussed. Then, the subsequent section gives some essential guidelines to follow during this pandemic period as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and at last, a critical discussion of the influence created by these technologies, the existing challenges and predicted future impacts accompanied by the conclusion is presented.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Frame work</title><p id="p0100">We authors decided to contribute our support to the society to tackle COVID-19 by investigating various implemented technologies as well as the potential technologies that would help in controlling the pandemic and subsequently presenting our investigation as a manuscript. We sought guidance from medical and technical professionals as a result of which the topics need to be covered in this study is figured out. In order to write the manuscript in this novel theme, one need to know what is happening around and requires tedious surveying of online information from verified sources together with literature survey for supporting the feasibility of the approach disclosed in the online sources. The literature survey is primarily done by using platforms such as Google scholar, Elsevier, PubMed and IEEE. Firstly, the initial screening is done by analyzing the title of the work and then according to the sections in our study, the identified work is sorted. The scrutinizing stage 1 is performed by scanning the abstract of the work sorted and decision of scrutinization of each work is carried out jointly by the authors. The scrutinizing stage 2 filters the irrelevant work which is done by skimming the whole content of the work. Further, while writing the manuscript if the scrutinized work content doesn't seem to fit or the information in the work is already covered in some other considered study, then the work is eliminated. For instance, to gather the information in the field of Artificial Intelligence, the keyword &#x02018;Artificial Intelligence in healthcare&#x02019; is used for searching in Elsevier platform from which the initial screening is performed by analyzing the title whether it is relevant to our study or not. Then, the abstract of the identified works is scanned to scrutinize it and further the content of the work is skimmed to scrutinize it as well as to grasp the necessary information which constitutes the scrutinizing stages 1 and 2 respectively.</p><p id="p0105">The online sources from which information is extracted mainly include World Health Organization (WHO), and reputed information reporting sites such as World Economic Forum, Stats, MIT Technology Reviews and news reports. For online sources, we provide keywords as an input to google search engine from which the initial screening is done by analyzing whether the source provides trustable pieces of information. Then, the scrutinizing stage 1 is done by scanning the content of the source whether it is relevant to our study or not. Besides, the stage 2 scrutinization is performed by analyzing the quality of the information. As a whole, out of around 1500 works resulted from the searches using different keywords, we sorted 806 works after initial screening from which 172 work is finalized after subjected to scrutinizing stages. So, after shaping the manuscript, we obtained a total number of references of about 155 that include 32 online sources and 123 Journal papers. The <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>

In this section, we will discuss the changes that the society had undergone to mitigate the spreading of the infection. The changes can be broadly viewed from healthcare, government, public, industries, environment, energy and also its impact in future. The <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>

Starting from testing to treatment, various innovations have been implemented and experimented. For instance, the testing procedures for COVID-19 have been carried out in different phases from short time results with less accuracy to high accuracy testing in tradeoff with time. Generally, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test is used for the diagnosis of COVID-19 which is quite an accurate method as it detects the presence of viral RNA. Other techniques include serologic testing, antigen testing etc. (<xref rid="bb0645" ref-type="bibr">Verdict Medical devices, 2020</xref>). Testing a voluminous population is necessary to give a big picture of the infection status and thus, the demand for the testing kits is in peak. The technique adopted for testing might vary from place to place, for populous countries antibody tests can be effective for initial screening to know the immune nature of the population and to map the infection. Moreover, they can yield results in a short period and rapid antibody testing would consume around 15&#x02013;30&#x000a0;min to give the results (<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">India Today, 2020</xref>). Bosch developed an innovative quick test to produce the results in two and a half hours and claims that it is one of the world's completely automatic molecular diagnostic tests (<xref rid="bb0645" ref-type="bibr">Verdict Medical devices, 2020</xref>). AI and ML have been contributed in many ways which is discussed in upcoming sections. They changed the way of approach in interacting and handling the patients, provides insight in predicting the infection spreading rate, innovative approaches in diagnosing the disease and identify those who would develop serve symptoms, and whatnot. Another new approach by a group of researchers and engineers of San-Francisco called Cough for the Cure which uses trained model to identify COVID-19 with the audio samples of the patient's cough (<xref rid="bb0645" ref-type="bibr">Verdict Medical devices, 2020</xref>). Though it might not seem to be effective as it is not clear whether COVID-19 cough is unique but the approach is novel. And the usage of telehealth services has exponentially risen during the pandemic period.</p><p id="p0120">The point of view from the government is not easily perceived as much complexity prevails in every action they take. The decision making, managing public, satisfying the requirements of the healthcare system and to have a future plan are the prime functions of the government during the pandemic period. The changes that are commonly seen in governance is that they are guiding other tech giants to collectively focus on COVID issues and imparting broad awareness among the people. These social bodies can control the extent to which technology can be used like experimenting with new techniques for diagnosis. At a certain point, the privacy of an individual is at stake in order to track the super spreaders in the society and these measures are carried out for the sake of people health. Governments is also launching schemes, supporting scientific projects and initiatives that will assist in communication with the public regarding health crisis (<xref rid="bb0715" ref-type="bibr">World Economic Forum, 2020a</xref>).</p><p id="p0125">Regarding the public, cooperating with the government is the only way to reduce the infection. During the quarantine period, people might have been psychologically depressed from the constant exposure to the same environment. The streaming industries, cellular technology, broadband connectivity is some without which the public cannot consistently follow quarantine orders. Work from home strategies and <italic>E</italic>-learning makes the society to function as quite normal during the quarantine period. But, the whole system from healthcare to the public themselves depends on the actions of the people and their cooperation.</p><p id="p0130">From an industry point of view, the factories have been closed to mitigate the infection spread but some industries and companies have been indulged in producing products that are required for health care system by following strict social distancing. Automotive industries have modified their production lines to produce ventilators, plastic face shields, 3D printed products and so on (<xref rid="bb0470" ref-type="bibr">NS Medical devices, 2020</xref>). Fashion brands have changed their manufacturing from clothing and fashion products to prepare masks and other products they are capable of producing. Alcohol-based companies, distillers have indulged in producing disinfectants, hand sanitizers, plastic products and so on. Also, many other tech companies are providing a helping hand in terms of developing software, to improve computing power, and supporting the research groups (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Autodesk-Redshift, 2020</xref>).

Vendors and small business are suffering from short-term revenue losses. The major problem that every brand is facing now is the shipping problems. A report on COVID-19 survey (<xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">Klaviyo, 2020</xref>) shows 40% of the brands encounter shipping problems and 56% of the brands are having problems in their supply chain and increased number of brands are spending more on ads. Yet still, 28% of the respondents have claimed to have increased sales. Another study shows US unemployment fillings had peaked and Spain had almost cut 900,000 jobs as the country imposed strict enforcement of social distancing to fight against the coronavirus as on 2 April 2020 (<xref rid="bb0725" ref-type="bibr">World Economic Forum, 2020c</xref>). Also, air traffic has been tremendously reduced owing to COVID-19 pandemic. The data from the Flightradar24 website shows a 64% reduction in air traffic from 6 March to 6 April 2020 (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Flighttradar24, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0140">Considering the environmental aspects, the lockdown has made the public to stay at home which resulted in less air pollution owing to less industrial activities, and vehicular movement. India houses about 21 cities of the 30 most polluted cities in the world and have reported a reduction in air pollution as well as the people are experiencing cleaner air during the lockdown. One day curfew in India have resulted in lowest average levels of nitrogen dioxide and other pollutants such as PM 2.5 and PM 10 had also dropped significantly according to the experts at Center of Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">CREA, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0145">From energy aspects, we can expect a drop in power consumption due to lockdown as many companies, shops have been shut down. Only residential load and industries running for supplying basic needs for the society would draw power from the grid. As a case study, we have analyzed the power consumption data for the southern region of India from 20 March to 29 March 2020 (<xref rid="bb0505" ref-type="bibr">POSOCO, 2020</xref>). The reason for choosing this period is that only during this period, India announced the complete lockdown in two stages. Initially, on 22 March, one-day curfew was established and then, a complete lockdown for 21 subsequent days was executed from 25 March 2020. The graph below (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>
) shows the variation of power consumption in the Southern region of India from 20 March to 29 March 2020. From the graph, we can notice a drop in power demand on 22 March corresponding to the one-day curfew and similarly, the power demand decreases during complete lockdown period which was initiated from 25 March. As a whole, on 20 March 2020, the power demand was 533.01 Mega Units (Mu) whereas on 29 March 2020, the power demand was 394.67 Mega Units (Mu) which is almost 26% reduction in the demand power.<fig id="f0015"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Variation of power consumption in the Southern region of India from 20 March to 29 March 2020.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0015">Fig. 3</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr3_lrg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>4</label><title>Technological strategies to control the pandemic</title><p id="p0150">As people, we know how crucial role the technologies play in our day-to-day lives but the perspective of technology in assisting the mitigation of infection and in controlling the situation like the COVID-19 pandemic is something we fail to notice. Therefore, we authors conceptualized the aspects of technology utilization as various strategies to provide a helping hand in an epidemic state of affairs. For overcoming the epidemic circumstances, the contribution of various technologies can be identified as directly influencing and indirectly influencing. Directly impacting technologies are the ones that help in framing strategies to reduce the infection, to assists in health care facilities and to support the society to function as one. In a society, it is found that the following sections: Information communication, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Supply chain are the sound areas where technologies are extensively used and explored whose application has been actively supporting the society in a pandemic situation.</p><sec id="s0025"><label>4.1</label><title>Information communication</title><p id="p0155">The COVID &#x02013; 19 is a rapidly transmitting disease primarily due to human-to-human interaction and it is given a status of the pandemic. The necessary information like disease nature, how it is transmitted, involved risks, precautions and government policies are required to inform the people at the right time. For assisting this, mass media and social networking are crucial in transferring information from source to the user end. All the updates that are occurring related to pandemic were broadcasted globally via radio, television, newspapers and the internet. And social media carries special attention in spreading news across different platforms throughout the globe. Now, arises the question of a communication challenge, how to effectively communicate, the extent of risk perception by the people after the info is communicated, the truthfulness of information perceived. We will answer these questions from the management aspect.</p><sec id="s0030"><label>4.1.1</label><title>Information communicating challenges</title><p id="p0160">The people in a pandemic-circumstances need to have clarity on government decisions, policies, travel bans, quarantine periods, and other such important updates. The communication should impart awareness among the public for such an emerging infection and should be clear regarding what the health care system knows and that does not about COVID 19. The information must be updated as soon as verified by the authorities and at the same time, risk perception of the public should also be considered depending on the dose of the information. The challenge can be overcome by carefully addressing the information to the mass public in such a way that the information does not increase the panic among the people. For example, if the quarantine period is extended for an additional 2&#x000a0;weeks, then the information should also carry a solution for by how people can access the basic need. This will favor in reducing the panic among the people.

. This is an upgraded communication model of one presented by <xref rid="bb0765" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref> with a message &#x02013; centered approach. The model comprises of four interaction medium that is the healthcare system &#x02013; experts, government &#x02013; experts, government &#x02013; public, and expert &#x02013; public. Here the government is the supreme decision-maker in controlling the activities and the decision will have an impact on the public which can be observed from their behavior as feedback. The government&#x02013;public communication is typically an external communication and the information to be conveyed must be complete and accurate. The public must remain optimistic to cooperate with the government and perceive the importance of the information conveyed by the government. The actual public response is compared with expected one and needs to be evaluated for effective communication (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Charlebois and Summan, 2015</xref>) and often the government is frustrated by unrealistic public demands (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Covello et al., 1987</xref>). Also, the public's feedback would help the government to reshape its communication strategies (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Covello et al., 1987</xref>; <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">European Food Safety Authority, 2017</xref>). The government &#x02013; expert communication is the key for the whole risk management and decision-making policies and it acts as internal communication. The expert panel consists of expertise in professional knowledge, management, and technology. They are empowered by the government bodies and they give the data, evidence for the risk communication. They assess the risk and help in making a rational decision which best benefits the society (<xref rid="bb0530" ref-type="bibr">Renn, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bb0560" ref-type="bibr">Savage, 1951</xref>; <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">French, 2012</xref>). Expert &#x02013; healthcare system communication is the source for assessing the risk or potential impact the identified problem would cause and is regarded as internal communication. Healthcare system is the one which accurately knows the seriousness of the epidemic, what health facilities it requires, how much time it needs, precaution steps to tackle the situation. This is communicated to experts which in turn to government to raise the fund towards the need, making decisions, or informing the public. The expert &#x02013; public communication is required to bridge the gap between them and it depicts an external communication. The public usually fails to understand the complexity of the risk analyzed or involved. Thus, experts can play a role to convey the issue in a more simple and explicit way to make the public understand and act according to the facts (<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Gesser-Edelsburg et al., 2015</xref>). In general, risk communication management should neither be too centralized nor be too de-centralized (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Conrow, 2003</xref>).<fig id="f0020"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of risk communication process.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0020">Fig. 4</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr4_lrg"/></fig></p><p id="p0175">Another important lesson learnt from affected countries like China and Italy is that the risk communication should initiate as soon as possible from the instant the risk is identified and evaluated (<xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Lundgren and McMakin, 2013</xref>). For a case of an unknown disease, the communication should be abrupt without any sort of conclusions and once the proper shreds of evidences are gathered to prove it as a novel case, the information should be disclosed immediately to the public with appropriate remedial strategies. Any delay in such instances will cause an unexpected consequence.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>4.1.3</label><title>False information</title><p id="p0180">Even though effective communication is important, the false information would result in an unpredicted consequence. The filtration of false news especially in social media is impractical but steps have been taken consistently to reduce the same. Moreover, it's a decentralized way of information communication and hence, its control on spreading false information is in the hands of users. It is highly recommended to the public to follow a reputed or official page where verified information is provided. It is reported that Facebook blocked all the health pronouncements related to COVID-19 except official sites and Pinterest made all of its search related to COVID 19 posts, created and approved by WHO (<xref rid="bb0525" ref-type="bibr">Ratzan et al., 2020</xref>). Matteo Cinelli et al. analyzed mainstream platforms such as Instagram, Twitter and YouTube and also some regulated social media platforms and from their analysis, they suggest that the spreading of information is due to the interaction of specific patterns of a group of users engaged with the topic (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Cinelli et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, study related to social dynamics caused by the consumption of false content is needed to control the misinformation spreading among different mainstreams.

It is reported that an AI-based start-up BlueDot uses an infection-surveillance system all around the clock which scans for more than 100,000 online articles across the globe in 65 languages for every 15&#x000a0;min. On 30 December 2019, the algorithm noted an unusual bump in &#x02018;pneumonia cases&#x02019; with &#x02018;unknown reason&#x02019; in Wuhan, China and it alerted the outbreak of disease much before it has officially identified as COVID 19 (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Diginomica, 2020</xref>). Thus, these eye-opening technologies can predict such epidemics and alert humanity to take the necessary advanced measures. Companies like BlueDot and Metabiota employs natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to perform analysis of health-care reports in different languages and their predictive tools can also be employed to trace the potential infection hubs from the air-travel data. For instance, public report of Metabiota listed the countries which include China, Italy, Iran and the US will likely to report new cases and the reality isn't differed much (<xref rid="bb0440" ref-type="bibr">MIT Technology Review, 2020a</xref>). A data-based analysis by Constantinos Siettos et al. forecasted the outbreak in Hubiei, China up to 29 February 2020, considering the data reported between 11 January and 10 February 2020. They forecasted that a minimum infection would be 45,000 and the death count will be around 2700. And the infected number was around 67,000 and the death count was in the 2800&#x000a0;s which is close (<xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">ITN, 2020a</xref>). From these incidents, we can infer that AI and ML can be used for predicting the situation and based on which we can act accordingly to reduce the intensity of outbreaks. Data classification along with prediction is significant because it can give a clear idea of how to deal with the data. For example, during the outbreak, there is a demand for identifying the extent of infection cases from mild to critical illness. One such analysis was carried out by Xiangao Jiang et al. in which the AI framework was used to find the COVID outbreak and the patients at critical illness based on the data from two hospitals in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China (<xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>). The predictive model developed was 70% to 80% accurate with the predicted critical cases.

Also, to treat infected persons, hospitals need ventilators in a massive quantity. To meet such demands, several solutions have been carried out. Dyson Ltd., a British tech company has partnered with The Technology Partnership (TTP) designed a brand-new ventilator named CoVent and it meets the standards of the clinical specification (<xref rid="bb0590" ref-type="bibr">Techcrunch, 2020</xref>). It might be challenging for industries using complex technologies for manufacturing their products to adapt for producing ventilators but several automotive industries have successfully repurposed their factory to produce different products to strengthen the health care system. Brewers and distillers were restructured their production system to produce hand sanitizer and alcohol-based disinfectants and other suppliers purchases new injection molds for producing test kits (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Autodesk-Redshift, 2020</xref>). Fashion brands such as Gucci, Prada, Zara have transformed their production lines to make millions of masks (<xref rid="bb0470" ref-type="bibr">NS Medical Devices, 2020</xref>). All these infer the adaptable nature of manufacturing technology used and their crisis response is satisfying the health care system needs. Also, 3D printing techniques have provided support by manufacturing some key small parts. For instance, Isinnova, an Italian 3D printing company was able to 3D print a valve designed by Decathlon that connected the mask to the conventional hospital respirator (<xref rid="bb0720" ref-type="bibr">World Economic Forum, 2020b</xref>). In the hospital, purchasing of medicines, stocking of medicinal products, handling waste, all have to be managed by health care workers. As the number of patients rises, it is better to apply AI technology to handle the data (<xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Jordona et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="p0265">In the view from people's end, technologies such as telehealth services have been helpful. And in this pandemic, the health system is reported to have an exponential increase in the use of telemedicine technology (<xref rid="bb0580" ref-type="bibr">STAT, 2020</xref>) and the health system is also using technologies such as chatbots, video consultations etc. to minimize the load on the hospital. During the quarantine period, there exists a problem of getting basic needs for the people in order to survive especially food ingredients. This can be dealt with by opening the markets at a specific range of time in which limited people at a time can buy things they need by strictly following social distancing. For severely affected area, the supplies can be provided by the workers with protective equipment. We propose a system that can be effectively followed by the people to support social distancing. Initially, the information of available markets in an area should be collectively gathered and uploaded in a website run by some private, public or government agencies. The people can access the website and choose the market and then can give a request for their need. The people will be allotted a slot with specific time range (like between 9 and 10&#x000a0;am) along with a token number corresponding to the slot. The shopkeeper will be in touch with the website request and act accordingly to pack the listed things. After verifying the token number and slot timings, the things can be handover to the buyer. By implementing this, one can run the market throughout the day and this will help the mobs to effectively follow the social distancing. For the areas prone to serve infection, service may be extended to deliver them to the address provided. The <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>

So, if the society functions as usual, the spreading will be at its peak and hence, every company which doesn't necessarily need the presence of employees at the working spot is shut down during quarantine period. And these companies can get the job done by implementing work from home strategy which is widely employed all over the world. The basic requirements for an individual to work from home are a computing device, internet accessibility and cam if needed. Meeting and conferences can be conducted remotely through video conference. With the advancement of communication technology and network connectivity, remote working has been functioning well.

In Singapore, the government launched a mobile application namely, TraceTogether. It utilizes the Bluetooth technology of the cellphones to identify any potential carries of coronavirus that they might have been in closer contact with other people.

Integration of technologies in market, production and supply chain handling can be effectively improved by the development of mobile applications which also influences the digitalization to some extent. Farmers are mostly affected by the logistics problem in pandemic crisis. Proper connectivity with the market with the aid of government can help the farmers to identify the demand location for their products and the subsequent supply chain requirements can be met. All these can be controlled through a mobile application effectively (<xref rid="bb0475" ref-type="bibr">Nuanmeesri, 2019</xref>). As an advanced application, the usage of augmented reality is encouraged. Even shopping can be assisted with the utilization of augmented reality during lockdown period (<xref rid="bb0415" ref-type="bibr">McLean and Wilson, 2019</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0140"><label>7</label><title>Guidelines for different social bodies to fight against COVID-19</title><p id="p0360">Here we will provide some essential guidelines to follow for various social bodies to encounter the novel coronavirus.

</p></sec><sec id="s0145"><label>8</label><title>Discussion and conclusion</title><p id="p0465">The outbreak of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has widely affected people all over the world and radically changed the routine functions of humanity. As a species on this earth, we have to use our gifted intelligence to encounter this novel coronavirus. Using technology, proper governance, healthcare service, coordinated public behavior can help a lot in mitigating the risk. The support of technology in handling this situation is irreplaceable. So, in this section, we will summarize the key aspects of each section and analyze the current challenges associated with it.</p><p id="p0470">The first section presents the technological changes that the society and the environment have been through from different aspects. The healthcare facilities have rapidly been modified for increasing their patient intake capacity and also improving the telehealth facilities to reduce the load on the hospitals. The testing methods and facilities are technologically enhanced to diagnose a large number of test samples in this pandemic situation. Government role in a society is important and it satisfies the needs of the healthcare system and simultaneously, helps the public in accessing the basic needs and monitoring them. Public viewpoint is to coordinate with the government and follow the social distancing and other preventive measures correctly. Industries have aligned themselves to help in meeting the demands of the healthcare system and regarding energy aspects, the power consumption by the people during the lockdown was significantly lower when compared to the time of before lockdown period. Other insights about the economical viewpoint of the society and environmental changes involving a drop in air pollutants are discussed.</p><p id="p0475">The core investigation is presented in the sections of technological strategies to control the pandemic and support the society during pandemic which is followed by viable prospective technologies. The technological strategies that aids in controlling the pandemic play around information communication, AI, ML and supply chain technologies that have a direct influence on mitigating the spreading. When considering communication, information transfer to the public is much more important to control the mass public for which media and social media creates a pathway. Then, risk perception by the people will affect the societal response to the pandemic. Hence, proper communication should be conveyed by the government to the people and it is mandatory to eliminate the rumors or false information that is potentially taking place in social media streams for which many steps have been taken by companies and government jointly. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are the promising technologies that can help in numerous ways in tackling the situation. They are being adopted in the prediction of outbreaks, and in the healthcare systems for the diagnosis of disease through scans, classification of medical data, handling big data of patients, assisting in treatments and so on. Other aspects where AI is implemented in COVID-19 period are for supporting chatbots, developing apps for tracking infected people and in creating a huge database for accumulating all published SARS-Cov-2 related researches. In this situation, supply chain technologies address the production and transportation issues of prior products required by the health care system. This explains how different industries adapted their production lines to produce ventilators, masks, hand-sanitizers and other products. And this is possible only by use of technology. Further, supply chain of the basic needs required by the public also has some vacant space where tech can be implemented to avoid crowding in certain places. The technological strategies supporting the society during pandemic focusses on the implemented strategies that are helpful in supporting the public, government and health care system to make them stay at home. These strategies include work from home, distance learning and surveillance. Work from home and distance learning gives people some purposes for staying at home whereas the surveillance technologies help the government to monitor the general public and track the same. The section, viable prospective technologies deals with the potential technologies that are used less and their utilization can effectively enhance the various processes in healthcare facilities, surveillance and in avoiding direct contact with the infected persons. These technologies comprise of AI, ML and IoT, drone technology and robot technology. The various application of AI has been listed in the table along with the discussion of the possibility of their use in the current situation. Also, IoT is a crucial technology in automation which can assist in supply chain technologies to transform it to be completely automatic with the given requirements. Drone and robot technology are high tech field which had tremendously improved in recent years. Drone technology will be most appropriate for applications such as the delivery of goods, samples, surveillance and so on. Whereas, the robot technologies can have a significant impact on the healthcare facilities in numerous aspects which have been discussed briefly. And finally, we provide some essential guidelines for various social bodies to mitigate the spreading of the infection.</p><p id="p0480">The emergence of COVID-19 has pushed the limits of the technologies and many alternatives have been proposed to encounter the pandemic. This had accelerated the innovations taking place in technologies in almost every field. The online experience that the people come across during this period might have a long-term influence in online shopping, <italic>E</italic>-learning, digital payments, telehealth facilities and mobile entertainment. The core technologies that would get a boost include artificial intelligence, machine learning, Internet of Things, location and navigation technologies, augmented and virtual reality, drone technology, robotics, cloud and entertainment technologies. The situation has caused to search for alternatives and innovative technologies. For instance, the ban of biometrics for the welfare of the people during pandemic have a potential to shift the tech to other options such as facial and iris recognition technologies (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">GCN, 2020</xref>). The data-driven applications and responses regarding the ongoing situation will encourage the development of IT systems to enhance the tracking, detection and analysis. The telehealth technologies have been improved to handle telehealth consults which have gone up multiple folds since the pandemic. Global quarantine has put a strain on the maintenance of energy and water demands and other utilities. Hence, these utilities need monitoring of the variations in the usage patterns and thus, the supply can be redirected wherever required. Apart from it, these data can be useful to take advance actions in future outbreaks.</p><p id="p0485">The innovations are rolling out using various prospective technologies and many start-ups have come up with different solutions. But these need robust testing before deployment in a practical environment. Apart from these, the government has to give approval for such innovations (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Financial Express, 2020</xref>). It is neither possible to survive with existing technologies nor to analyze the full potential of such an innovative approach as the infection will get worse with the delay. Hence, there should be a balance in considering these innovations. Some reports suggest that digital transformation will accelerate and the cybersecurity risk might be a problem within a shorter term (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">CIO, 2020</xref>). Also, the adopted changes might have an influence on how we will live and work in near-future.</p><p id="p0490">To conclude, it is certain that humanity will fight its best and heal from the pandemic. But the concern is regarding how soon we can eradicate this viral infection meaning that the humanity is racing with time. Thanks to the healthcare workers and researchers. The utilization of technologies will strengthen the defense line against the infection but it is purely in the hands of humans to mitigate the spread. The government should deploy tech-based solutions. Apart from the technologies, management and governance are key factors in facing this crucial situation and how we deal with it, will showcase the intelligence of human species. The technology will be a pioneering weapon in this war against the unexpected.</p></sec><sec id="s0150"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0495">This work did not receive any external funding.</p></sec><sec id="s0155"><title>CRediT authorship contribution statement</title><p id="p0500">
