It was recently introduced, for the first time, into North America and outbreaks have occurred again in multiple countries within Europe as well. To assess the properties of various diagnostic assays for the detection of PEDV infection, multiple panels of porcine sera have been shared and tested for the presence of antibodies against PEDV in an inter-laboratory ring trial. Different laboratories have used a variety of &#x0201c;in house&#x0201d; ELISAs and also one commercial assay. The sensitivity and specificity of each assay has been estimated using a Bayesian analysis applied to the ring trial results obtained with the different assays in the absence of a gold standard. Although different characteristics were found, it can be concluded that each of the assays used can detect infection of pigs at a herd level by either the early European strains of PEDV or the recently circulating strains (INDEL and non-INDEL). However, not all the assays seem suitable for demonstrating freedom from disease in a country. The results from individual animals, especially when the infection has occurred within an experimental situation, show more variation.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwd0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>ELISA</kwd><kwd>Porcine coronavirus</kwd><kwd>PEDV</kwd><kwd>Ring trial</kwd><kwd>Serology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="par0030">Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is a member of the <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> genus within the family <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>. Infection of swine by this virus causes disease characterized by diarrhoea and vomiting which can lead to severe dehydration and results in high (90&#x02013;100%) mortality in newborn piglets (<xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">Stevenson et al., 2013</xref>). Older animals (&#x02265;14&#x000a0;days) normally recover from the infection and seroconvert against the virus. The disease was initially identified within the United Kingdom (UK) in 1971 and the detection of the aetiological agent, PEDV, was first achieved in Belgium (<xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978</xref>); afterwards the virus spread within Europe and also to Asia (reviewed in <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Jung and Saif, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Lee, 2015</xref>). In 2013, outbreaks of the disease occurred for the first time in the USA (<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2014</xref>) and rapidly spread within both North and South America. About 7 million piglets died in a single year as a result of the outbreaks in the USA alone (<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Jung and Saif, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Lee, 2015</xref>).</p><p id="par0035">The genome of PEDV, like other coronaviruses, is a single-stranded positive sense RNA of about 28&#x000a0;kb. The virus produces a number of sub-genomic mRNAs which encode the various structural and non-structural proteins within infected cells. The virus particles include the spike (S) protein, the envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) protein and the nucleocapsid (N) protein (<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Brian and Baric, 2005</xref>). The spike protein is exposed on the virus surface and gives the virus particles their characteristic morphology. A number of different variants of PEDV are known (see <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Lee, 2015</xref>). The early European viruses are represented by the CV777 strain (these are sometimes classified, on the basis of the S gene sequence, as being within genogroup 1a) while two different variants of PEDV (classified, on the same basis, within genogroups 1b and 2b) have been identified within the USA. The US PEDVs are also referred to as &#x0201c;INDEL&#x0201d; (e.g. OH 851, from the genogroup 1b) and &#x0201c;non-INDEL&#x0201d; (e.g. MN, 1A1 and 1A2 strains from 2013, in genogroup 2b); these differ by the presence of certain deletions and insertions within the S gene sequence (<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Lee, 2015</xref>).</p><p id="par0040">Within infected pigs, antibodies are generated against the PEDV proteins and these can be detected by a variety of methods including ELISA, immunoblotting and immunostaining of infected cells.</p><p id="par0045">The recent reappearance of PEDV (closely related to the INDEL OH 851 strain) infections within Europe, including in Germany, France, Italy, Portugal, The Netherlands and Slovenia (<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Hanke et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Grasland et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Boniotti et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Mesquita et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">Toplak et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">EFSA, 2014</xref>), has led to the need for an assessment of existing diagnostic assays for the detection of PEDV infections. The PEDV can be identified by RT-PCR (e.g. <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2014</xref>) in faecal or intestinal samples from acutely infected animals and a low level of viremia has also been observed in serum from acutely infected pigs (<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Lohse et al., 2016</xref>). However, the virus is only present in infected animals for a limited period (typically less than 1 month, see <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Lee, 2015</xref>) while the serological response can be expected to be much longer lasting (<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Crawford et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="par0050">Extensive serological screening of swine (2500 samples/yr) within Denmark during the period 2000 to 2006 did not detect any sign of PEDV infection. More recently, following the disease outbreaks in the USA, additional Danish sera (2400 samples in 2014 and 3960 samples in 2015) were also tested and, again, all gave negative results. It is important to ensure that national diagnostic laboratories are able to detect PEDV infection efficiently when outbreaks of disease occur. For PEDV-free countries, like Denmark, Sweden and UK, or when planning to export animals from PEDV negative herds it is also important to be able to declare freedom from disease. Therefore, assays with both high sensitivity and high specificity are needed. Different laboratories use a variety of &#x0201c;in-house&#x0201d; assays; in addition, commercial tests for the detection of antibodies to PEDV are available. However, the properties of these different tests have not been analysed, in parallel, previously. An assessment of a range of tests, performed in different reference laboratories from Denmark (DK), Italy (IT), France (FR), The Netherlands (NL), Sweden (SE) and the UK using shared panels of porcine sera, collected from animals in the field and from experimental infection studies, has now been undertaken and the results of these analyses are presented.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><label>2</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Description of porcine serum panels</title><p id="par0055">Panel 1 included 54 sera collected in different countries including known positive sera (diluted or neat) from pigs experimentally infected with the Br1/87 or CV777 early European strains of PEDV, negative control sera plus field sera from farms with PED clinical disease (in the US and Canada,) and also field sera from farms without clinical disease (in DK, FR and SE).</p><p id="par0060">Panel 2 included 8 sera collected in DK from experimentally infected pigs at either 14 or 28&#x000a0;days post inoculation (dpi) with either the early European (Br1/87 strain) or a recent &#x0201c;non-INDEL&#x0201d; US strain of PEDV (described in detail by <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Lohse et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="par0065">Panel 3 included 20 sera from finisher pigs from a single herd in Italy that had experienced clinical signs of PED a few weeks prior to sampling; they were collected in 2015.

One set of 40 sera was collected from 6 different farms that had each experienced clinical signs of PED and from which PEDV (very closely related to the INDEL OH 851 strain) had been identified. The second set of 40 samples was collected from 5 other Italian farms, localized in PEDV-free areas, that had no history of enteric signs, and which had tested negative by a PEDV specific RT-PCR and using a PEDV-Ab ELISA (see below) (note: due to limitations in availability of sera, this panel was only tested in two different laboratories using three separate assays).</p></sec><sec id="sec0020"><label>2.2</label><title>&#x0201c;In house&#x0201d; blocking ELISA (DK); ELISA 1</title><p id="par0075">The presence of anti-PEDV antibodies in sera was determined (as in <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Lohse et al., 2016</xref>) using an &#x0201c;in-house&#x0201d; blocking ELISA (analogous to that used for PRRSV (<xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">S&#x000f8;rensen et al., 1997</xref>)) using antigen prepared from PEDV (Br1/87, closely related to CV777)-infected Vero cells.

We used non informative priors for sensitivity (uniform distributions) and mildly informative priors for specificities, considering that the expected specificities of the serological test would be &#x0003e;0.4 with 95% certainty and with a mode equal to 0.9 according to relative specificities that we estimated between the different tests. For true prevalence, we estimated that the prior distribution should represent a prevalence &#x0003e;0.4 with 95% certainty and mode equal to 0.6 according to the previous information we had on sera (experimental or field sera from a farm without any report of clinical disease). The same methodology, as described by <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Branscum et al.

Parameter estimates were based on analytical summaries of 10,000 iterations of the Gibbs sampler with a burn-in phase of 1000 iterations. Three parallel chains were run with different starting values randomly chosen from uniform distributions (0,1). Confirmation of the lack of convergence was required before the posterior distributions produced by the Gibbs sampler could be used.

The different assays that were used comprised a mixture of &#x0201c;in-house&#x0201d; tests (ELISAs 1-3) and a commercial test (ELISA 4). The samples included known positive samples (from experimentally infected pigs), field samples collected from countries never known to have had cases of PEDV infection (SE and DK) and also field samples from herds in the US and Canada known to be infected with PEDV. It should be noted that the sera from SE had been selected following pre-screening using the ELISA 4 and found to be negative in this assay (<xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 1B</xref>). In addition, some samples from FR were field samples that were specifically selected because they were collected at the beginning of 2014 from clinically normal herds but (with one exception) had given unexpected positive results in the ELISA 4 (see below). These selected sera were collected prior to the re-appearance of PEDV in FR (<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Grasland et al., 2015</xref>) and are not considered representative of pig sera from FR in general. The results of all the tests are presented in <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1A, 1B</xref>.</p><p id="par0120">The ELISA 1 identified anti-PEDV antibodies in the sera of 7 experimentally infected pigs (inoculated with an early European strain of PEDV, either Br1/87 or CV777) and still obtained a positive result when such sera were diluted 50, 200 or even 400 times. In addition, known positive field sera from the US and Canada also tested positive in this assay. In contrast, negative control sera, from the field or experimental studies, collected in DK (5 samples) and SE (17 samples), which have never experienced cases of PED, all proved negative. Furthermore, the 10 selected field sera, collected from clinically normal pigs from France, also all tested negative in this assay.</p><p id="par0125">The same samples were also tested using ELISA 2. When testing sera from animals infected with early European strains of PEDV, two different laboratories, correctly identified 4/4 sera from pigs experimentally infected with the Br1/87 strain of PEDV (see <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1A</xref>, <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 1B</xref>) but did not efficiently detect the pre-diluted (50&#x02013;400&#x000d7;) samples of such sera. Furthermore, both of these laboratories obtained a positive result with either 6 or 7 of the 7 sera from CV777-infected pigs (from FR). Negative results were obtained on all 22 known negative sera in one laboratory but 2 of these negative sera (DK13 and DK17) were scored positive in another. Some 7 sera from pigs infected with US or Canadian strains of PEDV were also tested with ELISA 2 and 4 or 5 of them scored positive in the two laboratories. There was a greater disparity using the selected FR field sera, there was a single positive reaction in one lab however, 7 were scored positive in the other using this assay system.</p><p id="par0130">A subset of these panel 1 samples, including sera from the Br1/87-infected pigs, was also tested using ELISA 3, another &#x0201c;in house&#x0201d; blocking assay, as described in Materials and Methods, (see <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1A, 1B</xref>). This assay successfully identified each of the undiluted pig sera that were from animals experimentally infected with PEDV as being positive. However, when the sera were diluted (50&#x02013;400&#x000d7;), prior to assay, then negative results were obtained in each case. Sera from animals infected with both the early European strains of PEDV and the recent INDEL US strain (from DK experimental studies and field sera from the US and Canada) were scored as positive, except for one serum (GVB/04) from a pig experimentally infected with the CV777 strain, but the 6 others were correctly identified. Of the 10 selected French field sera, 5 were scored positive while 5 were negative, including GVB/16, which was scored as negative in most of the other tests including the ELISA 4 (see below).</p><p id="par0135">A commercial assay (ELISA 4) was used in 3 separate laboratories to test the whole panel of sera (<xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1A, 1B</xref>). This system successfully identified (in 18 of 21 tests) the sera from 7 pigs experimentally infected with the CV777 strain but, unexpectedly, was less efficient (only 4 of 12 tests of the undiluted sera were positive) at detecting the infection in 4 pigs by the Br1/87 strain that is very closely related to CV777 (these two strains had the same origin but have been passaged separately over time). The ELISA 4 did not detect antibodies in any of the pre-diluted sera from experimentally infected pigs. Sera from 7 pigs infected with the recent US strain of PEDV were successfully detected as positive (in 19 out 21 tests using this assay). However, using 5 sera from uninfected pigs in DK (with no history of PEDV infection), in the 15 tests using ELISA 4, some 5 were scored positive, 1 test was inconclusive and only 9 were scored negative. The 10 selected French field sera, collected from herds without clinical signs of PED, included 9 samples that had unexpectedly scored positive in this test during initial testing in one of the laboratories. A very similar pattern of results (8 or 9 positive) was obtained for these 10 sera when tested in this assay in each of the 3 laboratories (<xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 1B</xref>, ELISA 4(a, b, c)) but these data contrast with the negative results obtained using ELISA 1, see <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 1B</xref>.

Median estimates were not very different between the various models and were not strongly modified when non informative priors were used (data not shown). The option presented (using non-informative priors for sensitivities) was a good compromise in terms of precision of the estimates and the informative characteristics of the priors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0075"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="par0200">In this study, multiple panels of porcine sera, collected from the field and from experimental studies within different countries from Europe and North America, have been analysed for the presence of anti-PEDV antibodies using 3 different &#x0201c;in house&#x0201d; ELISAs and a widely used commercial ELISA. Overall, it is apparent that, on a &#x0201c;herd-basis&#x0201d;, each of the assays is able to successfully detect infection by both the old European strains and also by the two, more recent, strains (non-INDEL and INDEL) that have infected herds within the USA in 2013/2014. The INDEL PEDV strain has also occurred in a number of European countries in 2014 and 2015. However, there can be significant differences in the detection of antibodies in individual animals by the different serological assays, and so it is clearly necessary to test several animals from a herd to ensure that successful detection of an infection of the herd is achieved. This should not be a problem since it can be considered best practice to test a representative sample and it is known that the virus spreads rapidly through an infected herd.</p><p id="par0205">In general, it seems that infection in the field generates a higher level of anti-PEDV antibodies than is achieved within experimental studies. This is well demonstrated by the panel of 20 sera collected from a herd that had recently been infected PEDV (see <xref rid="tbl0020" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The majority of sera were scored as positive in the assays used here, especially with the ELISAs 1 and 3. However, in contrast, using sera from experimentally infected pigs, the proportion of positive tests was much lower with some assays (see <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). It was also apparent that the level of antibody blocking observed with the ELISAs 1, 2 and 3 was higher with the field sera than with the experimental sera. This may reflect the route, level and frequency of the virus exposure that occurs in the field compared to that used experimentally.</p><p id="par0210">In practice, it might be requested to use serological assays to demonstrate freedom of a country or herd from PED. For this purpose, it is particularly important that the assays demonstrate high specificity; otherwise &#x0201c;false-positive&#x0201d; reactions can require a lot of work to prove freedom from PED. It appears that the commercial ELISA 4 produces some false positive results. In <xref rid="tbl0030" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, it is shown that 2 out of 40 sera from uninfected herds scored positive. These sera scored negative in both the ELISA 1 and ELISA 3 &#x0201c;in house&#x0201d; assays. Similarly, a group of 10 sera from France were selected for testing in the ring trial on the basis of unexpected positive reactions in the ELISA 4 (<xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1A, 1B</xref>) since they were all collected from herds with no clinical signs of PED. These samples all tested negative in the ELISA 1. These were collected at the beginning of 2014 prior to the introduction of the OH 851- related (INDEL) PEDV into France that was first detected in December 2014. Some of these sera also tested positive in other assays (ELISAs 2 and 3) and thus it may be that the pigs have been infected with another agent that cross-reacts, to some degree, in these assays. It should be noted that the ELISA 4 detects antibodies to the PEDV nucleoprotein only whereas the other assays are based on the use of whole virus preparations.</p><p id="par0215">The ELISA 1 has been used on over 20,000 field sera from Denmark and there have been no positive reactions suggesting a high level of specificity for this assay; the statistical analysis presented in <xref rid="tbl0035" ref-type="table">Table 6A, B</xref> confirms this. It seems unlikely that the non-specific reactions in certain other assays could be due to porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) infection as this is widespread in Europe, including in DK, and thus would be expected to give positive results in a larger proportion of sera than has been observed here.</p><p id="par0220">To declare a herd or region free of PED, a high level of sensitivity is required. The ELISA 1 appears to have the highest analytical sensitivity since it was the only one capable of detecting a positive reaction using pre-diluted serum samples (<xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1A, 1B</xref>). However, it was found that the antibody response to the experimental infection with the US PEDV did not induce a very strong antibody response, as determined by ELISA 1, and indeed the overall result was inconclusive in 1 of the 2 infected animals tested. For the sera from the experimentally infected pigs, it was possible, using this ELISA, to follow the generation of the immune response throughout the course of 28&#x000a0;days post-infection and it is clear that seroconversion did occur in each of the US PEDV inoculated pigs (see <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Lohse et al., 2016</xref>). The ELISA 2 and ELISA 3 also had difficulty in detecting the immune response in the animals experimentally infected with the US PEDV (see <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The ELISA 4 was better in this respect (see <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In contrast to these results, using field sera, there was a very high degree of agreement between the ELISA 1 and ELISA 3 (see Tables 3&#x02013;5) and 39 of 40 sera from the OH 851-related PEDV-infected herd in Italy all scored positive in both of these tests (<xref rid="tbl0025" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) while 40 sera from uninfected herds, also in Italy, were all negative in both assays.</p></sec><sec id="sec0080"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="par0225">There was a high degree of consistency in the performance of ELISA 4 when used in different laboratories (see <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1A, 1B</xref>) but its overall performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity is sub-optimal (see <xref rid="tbl0035" ref-type="table">Table 6A, B</xref>). ELISA 2 performed with good specificity (<xref rid="tbl0035" ref-type="table">Table 6A</xref>) although with sub-optimal sensitivity. It was found that this assay can detect PEDV infection at a herd level. Both the ELISA 1 and ELISA 3 performed very well and exhibited both high sensitivity and specificity.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0005"><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Best</surname><given-names>N.G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Cowles</surname><given-names>M.K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Vines</surname><given-names>S.K.</given-names></name></person-group><chapter-title>CODA Manual</chapter-title><year>1995</year><publisher-name>MRC Biostatistics Unit</publisher-name><publisher-loc>Cambridge, UK</publisher-loc></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0010"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Boniotti</surname><given-names>M.B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Papetti</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lavazza</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Alborali</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sozzi</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Chiapponi</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Faccini</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bonilauri</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Cordioli</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Marthaler</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and discovery of a recombinant swine enteric coronavirus, Italy</article-title><source>Emerg.
