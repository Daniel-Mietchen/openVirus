However, how opioid impacts the immune system is still barely characterized systematically. In order to understand the immune modulatory effect of opioids in an unbiased way, here we perform single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from opioid-dependent individuals and controls to show that chronic opioid usage evokes widespread suppression of antiviral gene program in naive monocytes, as well as in multiple immune cell types upon stimulation with the pathogen component lipopolysaccharide. Furthermore, scRNA-seq reveals the same phenomenon after a short in vitro morphine treatment. These findings indicate that both acute and chronic opioid exposure may be harmful to our immune system by suppressing the antiviral gene program. Our results suggest that further characterization of the immune modulatory effects of opioid is critical to ensure the safety of clinical opioids.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Over 100 million of opioid prescriptions are issued yearly in the USA alone, but the impact of opioid use on the immune system is barely characterized.

Part of the problem is caused by the rapid increase in the number of opioid prescriptions written by medical practices starting from the late 1990s. From 1999 to 2017, overdoses related to prescription opioids have dramatically increased in the United States with overdose deaths found to be five times higher in 2017 compared to 1999 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>). In addition, opioids affect not only the central nervous system (CNS) but also the peripheral immune system through the expression of a variety of opioid receptors on different immune cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, the effect of opioids on the peripheral immune system is complicated and involves various mechanisms. Studies have shown inconsistent results, where some suggest opioid usage is immunosuppressive while, in contrast, others suggest opioids are immunoactivating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Most of these studies focus on a particular immune cell subpopulation and a few candidate genes. Interestingly, epidemiological studies suggest that opioid usage is associated with increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, HIV, and pneumonia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Given the extensive use of prescription opioids and the global opioid epidemic, it is important to understand how opioid usage modulates different cell types in the immune system.</p><p id="Par4">Next-generation sequencing technologies such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) have become standard for querying gene expression in tissues and cells. Yet gene expression levels obtained through such ensemble-based approaches generate expression values averaged across large populations of cells, masking cellular heterogeneity. Primary cells such as peripheral blood immune cells or tissue samples from patients usually comprise heterogeneous cell populations. It is therefore highly time consuming and labor intensive to separate and study the individual cell types and generally not feasible given the limited input material from patient samples. Recent experimental advances have allowed the isolation of RNA from a single cell and the generation of cDNA libraries that can be sequenced from small amounts of RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we are now able to determine expression profiles in single-cell resolution. ScRNA-seq is a powerful tool to identify and classify distinct cell populations, characterize rare subpopulations, and trace cells along dynamic cellular stages, such as during differentiation or disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.

We sequenced these single cells to an average depth of 21,801 reads per cell and detected on average 805 genes and 2810 transcripts per cell.

Our findings suggest a potential adverse effect from opioid usage on the defense response towards viral infection in the immune system. This may explain in part the higher susceptibility to viral infection in opioid users observed in epidemiological studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In addition, our in vitro findings also demonstrate that the observed suppression of antiviral pathway from our ex vivo experiments does not arise from needle sharing or presence of hepatitis C virus infection in these injection opioid users. Given that most recreational opioid users inject drugs and many prescription opioid users are post-surgery or cancer patients under chemotherapy treatments, they are already more prone to infection; therefore, suppression of antiviral genes with opioid usage brings clinical relevance and demonstrates the importance of carefully examining each individual case to avoid any possibility of comorbidity.</p><p id="Par11">Acute and chronic opioid use has been shown to modulate the immune system and increase risk of opportunistic infections. This is supported by both epidemiological studies and animal studies where the variable from sharing of contaminated needles can be eliminated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Previous reports using in vitro cell culture model and in vivo opioid treatment rodent models have shown that opioids affect both the innate and adaptive immune function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. For example, morphine has been shown to reduce <italic>IL6</italic> and <italic>TNF&#x003b1;</italic> expression in macrophages and reduce <italic>IL8</italic> expression in neutrophils while demonstrating increases in Th1 cell death and Tbet activity in T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In addition to the peripheral immune system, studies have suggested that opioids create a neuroinflammatory response in the CNS through MOR-independent pathways. Reports from Hutchinson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> have shown that morphine activates the TLR4 receptor through a MOR-independent pathway in glial populations in the CNS and contributes to drug reinforcement. Opioid antagonist, &#x003b2;-funaltrexamine also has been shown to inhibit <italic>NFkB</italic> signaling and chemokine expression in human astrocytes and inhibit LPS-induced neuroinflammation in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, these studies usually focus on a few genes and in a particular cell type. Furthermore, very few of these immune function characterization studies were performed using primary immune cells directly from opioid-dependent patients. There is currently no study that provides a systems level and genome-wide view of the immune system from chronic opioid usage. Our study represents the first genome-wide and single-cell level transcriptomics study to characterize peripheral immune cell populations directly from chronic opioid users. Furthermore, we have identified stimulus-specific and cell-type-specific dysregulation of the immune response gene regulatory circuitry upon chronic opioid usage and acute opioid treatment. Our results provide potential systems level molecular explanation to the widely observed higher susceptibility to opportunistic infection in opioid using individuals from epidemiological studies.</p><p id="Par12">Opioid-induced immune modulation is mainly thought to occur through opioid receptors present on peripheral immune cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, the presence of opioid receptors in peripheral immune cells is controversial. While several studies have shown that classical opioid receptors such as MOR are expressed on various peripheral blood immune cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, other studies evaluated the presence of opioid receptors in PBMCs in which they failed to detect mRNA transcripts for all opioid receptors except for the nonclassical receptor NOR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Due to the nature of single-cell assays such as scRNA-seq, the expression level of opioid receptors at a single-cell level was very low or not detectable. Therefore to clarify whether opioid receptors are present in peripheral immune cells, we looked at the expression of opioid receptors in population level RNA-seq data from PBMCs of healthy individuals from a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. We found that the classical opioid receptor MOR is expressed in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, monocytes, and NK cells, but not in B cells, while the other two classical opioid receptors DOR and KOR are very low in expression or undetectable (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">22</xref>). The nonclassical receptor NOR is expressed in all immune cell types and is higher expressed in monocytes (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">22</xref>). We anticipate the immune modulatory effect we observed from in vivo opioid usage and in vitro opioid treatment potentially occurs through both MOR and NOR receptors.</p><p id="Par13">The stimulation of toll-like receptor 4 <italic>TLR4</italic> by LPS induces expression of innate immune response genes previously categorized into three gene modules: antiviral, peaked inflammatory, and sustained inflammatory genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

We have observed strong suppression of the antiviral gene program in response to LPS in PBMCs of opioid-dependent individuals (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

We anticipate that LPS induction of the three innate immune response gene pathways by <italic>TLR4</italic> activation occurs mainly in monocytes; this leads to the expression of autocrine and paracrine factors such as <italic>TNF&#x003b1;</italic> and <italic>IFN&#x003b1;</italic>/<italic>IFN&#x003b2;</italic> which then induce expression of the innate immune response gene modules in other immune cell types through the activation of <italic>TNF</italic> receptors and <italic>IFN&#x003b1;</italic>/<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> receptors as shown by the expression of these receptors in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells. In addition, <italic>IFN&#x003b2;</italic> activates the antiviral gene program directly through the <italic>IFNAR</italic> receptors in each of the immune cell types (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>) given its ubiquitous expression (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref> for <italic>IFNAR1</italic> and <italic>IFNAR2</italic> expression). Since we did not observe suppression of the antiviral gene program in response to direct <italic>IFN&#x003b2;</italic> treatment (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>), we speculate the modulatory effect of opioids are affecting a component in the the <italic>TLR4/TRIF</italic> signaling cascade in both the naive and LPS-treated conditions primarily in monocytes, which could explain the observed suppression of the antiviral gene program in response to LPS (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par14">Furthermore, our study demonstrates the utility of scRNA-seq as an unbiased tool to assess cell-type-specific and stimulus-specific genome-wide transcriptomic phenotype from limited quantity of patient samples. Upon a stimulation condition, such as LPS treatment, the opioid-induced phenotype is much more pronounced and resembles the signal amplifying effect from electronic amplifiers. We anticipate this type of signal amplification method coupled with single-cell transcriptomics will be of broad interest and can be applied to many other disease models where disease relevant stimuli can be used to activate na&#x000ef;ve PBMCs isolated from patients that are otherwise quiescent to amplify signal over noisy background and thus reveal the phenotype of the disease.</p><p id="Par15">Our finding of opioid-induced widespread suppression of antiviral gene program upon LPS treatment may suggest that in addition to the adverse effects of addiction behavior, opioid usage might increase susceptibility to opportunistic viral infection.

Our finding suggests that &#x000a0;deeper understanding&#x000a0;of the immune modulatory effect of opioid&#x000a0;in the context of these clinical conditions is needed and that precaution is needed by clinicians when prescribing opioids to patient groups that are already more susceptible to opportunistic infections.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>PBMCs from opioid-dependent individuals</title><p id="Par16">Frozen vials of PBMCs prepared from the fresh blood of opioid-dependent (mostly heroin dependent), and non-dependent neighborhood control individuals were collected in the Comorbidity and Trauma Study (CATS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and subsequently obtained from the biorepository of National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA, Rockville MD).

Hashtagged cells were then washed, diluted to 1000 cells/&#x003bc;L, and pooled before being used to perform the 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3&#x02032; method. Briefly, 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of 1000 cells/&#x003bc;L PBMC suspension from each subject/condition were combined, and 33.8&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of cell suspension (total cell number&#x02009;=&#x02009;33,800) was mixed with 66.2&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of RT reaction mix before being added to a chromium microfluidics chip already loaded with 40&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of barcoded beads and 270&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of partitioning oil. The chip was then placed within the chromium controller where single cells and barcoded beads were encapsulated together within oil droplets. Reverse transcription was then performed within the oil droplets to produce barcoded cDNA. Barcoded cDNA was isolated from the partitioning oil using Silane DynaBeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dynabeads MyONE Silane, Cat# 37002D) before amplification by PCR. Cleanup/size selection was performed on amplified cDNA using SPRIselect beads (Beckman-Coulter, SPRIselect, Cat# B23317) and cDNA quality was assessed using an Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer and the High-Sensitivity DNA assay (Agilent, High-Sensitivity DNA Kit, Cat# 5067-4626). Sequencing libraries were generated from cleaned, amplified cDNA using the 10X Chromium Kit&#x02019;s including reagents for fragmentation, sequencing adaptor ligation, and sample index PCR. Between each of these steps, libraries were cleaned and size selected using SPRIselect beads. Final quality of cDNA libraries was once again assessed using the Agilent BioAnalyzer High-Sensitivity DNA assay, and quality-confirmed libraries were sequenced using Illumina&#x02019;s NextSeq platform.
