Chest radiography revealed diffuse opacities and consolidation. One of these patients died. Sequence results revealed the presence of a previously unknown &#x003b2;-CoV strain in all five patients, with 99.8% to 99.9% nucleotide identities among the isolates. These isolates showed 79.0% nucleotide identity with the sequence of SARS-CoV (GenBank NC_004718) and 51.8% identity with the sequence of MERS-CoV (GenBank NC_019843). The virus is phylogenetically closest to a bat SARS-like CoV (SL-ZC45, GenBank MG772933) with 87.6% to 87.7% nucleotide identity, but is in a separate clade. Moreover, these viruses have a single intact open reading frame gene 8, as a further indicator of bat-origin CoVs.

There are six CoVs known to infect humans, including two &#x003b1;-CoVs (229E and NL63) and four &#x003b2;-CoVs (OC43, HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]-CoV).<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> All human CoVs are zoonotic as a distinguishing characteristic.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> In particular, bats are regarded as a key reservoir of CoVs, and many human CoVs are believed to have originated from bats.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Since the beginning of this century, two zoonotic CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, have been identified to cause severe human diseases.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> The outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2003 was responsible for 8096 cases and 774 deaths worldwide.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Since its discovery in Middle Eastern countries in 2012, MERS-CoV has infected 2494 people with a current case fatality rate of 34.4%.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> These outbreaks have raised public health concerns of the potential for the emergence of another novel zoonotic CoV.</p><p>Here, we report a previously unknown bat-origin CoV causing severe and fatal pneumonia in five patients from Wuhan, China. Sequence results revealed that this virus, harboring a single open reading frame gene 8 (ORF8), is phylogenetically closest to bat SARS-like CoV, but is in a separate lineage. Furthermore, the amino acid sequence of the tentative receptor-binding domain (RBD) of this new CoV resembles that of SARS-CoV, indicating that they might use the same receptor.

A 50-&#x003bc;L elution was obtained from each sample. The DNA/RNA concentrations were measured by a Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The sequencing library was constructed by a transposase-based methodology and sequenced on an Illumina sequencing platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). At least 25 million single-end 76-bp reads were generated for each sample on the Illumina NextSeq platform.

The whole-genome sequences of the viruses were obtained by a next-generation sequencing approach from all five patients, demonstrating overwhelmingly dominant viral reads in the BAL samples. Among the five novel CoV genome sequences, the nt identities reached up to 99.8% to 99.9%. The viruses successfully isolated from the patients could also be effectively recognized by serum from a convalescent patient. These findings primarily indicate that the novel CoV is associated with the pneumonia that developed in these patients. However, it remains to be determined whether this novel CoV is capable of causing similar diseases in experimental animals.</p><p>Sequence homology analysis of the viral genome showed that the CoV identified in this study is distinct from any of the known human CoVs, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The most closely related known viruses are two bat SL-CoVs (GenBank accession nos. MG772933, 772934) identified in 2005 in Zhoushan, Zhejiang, China, which is geographically distant from Wuhan<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>; however, the nt identities among the viruses are only 87.6% to 87.7%. Phylogenetic analysis showed that this virus forms a single clade. Collectively, these data indicate that this CoV should be considered a new species. The outbreak of SARS in 2003 largely boosted awareness of threats caused by emerging CoVs. Consequently, great efforts have been made to monitor novel emerging CoVs and to trace their origins so as to establish a risk assessment and alert system for preventing potential epidemics in the human population. Clarification of the coronavirome in animals, particularly in bats as a key reservoir of a wide range of CoVs, should be a priority for any task force.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup></p><p>A few striking features of these novel CoVs indicated that they are of bat-origin. First, the genome sequences of the novel CoVs show high similarity with that of bat SL-CoV ZC45. Second, the phylogenetic analysis indicated that these viruses are evolutionarily close to bat SL-CoVs ZXC21 and ZC45. Third, all of these novel CoVs contain ORF3 and intact ORF8 gene regions, which are characteristic features of bat-origin CoVs.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> Moreover, the aa sequences of the N-terminal domains (NTDs) of the novel CoVs were very similar to those of ZC45 and ZXC21, whereas the RBD of the novel CoV showed higher aa sequence identity to that of SARS-CoV than to those of ZC45 and ZXC21, suggesting that a recombination event might have occurred at the region between the NTD and RBD of the S gene, facilitating the interspecies transmission.</p><p>Owing to the lack of epidemic information at present, the transmission modes of the novel CoV remain obscure. It is notable that three of the five patients had a history of recent exposure to a seafood market in Wuhan. However, the origin of infection is unknown at the time of manuscript preparation. It is assumed that the zoonotic CoV jumped to humans through an intermediate host; for example, camel is suspected as the intermediate host of MERS-CoV, whereas the palm civet may have contributed to the interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV to humans.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> Bat CoVs may evolve to adapt to using humans as a host during their circulation in a mammalian host, thereby enabling them to effectively infect humans.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> However, two of our patients did not have a history of exposure to the seafood market. Therefore, further investigation will be needed to determine the potential of multiple infection sources responsible for this uncommon outbreak.</p><p>One of the most striking and concerning features of this virus is its ability to cause severe respiratory syndrome. The disease progressed rapidly with a major presentation of lower respiratory pathology. Notably, no obvious upper respiratory tract symptoms such as a sore throat and rhinorrhea were present in these patients. Therefore, further exploration is needed on the distribution of the viral receptor in the organs to potentially account for pathogenesis development. In addition, the possibility of unrecognized mild infections or subclinical infections should be clarified, as identification of such infections is critical to control spread of the disease. Development of serological assays would be largely beneficial to detect such types of infection at the population level.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified a novel bat-borne CoV associated with a severe and fatal respiratory disease in humans. The emergence of this virus poses a potential threat to public health. Therefore, clarification of the source and transmission mode of these infections is urgently needed to prevent a potential epidemic.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Dr. Chen Wang, Dr. Zhen-Dong Zhao, Dr. Fei Guo (Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences &#x00026; Peking Union Medical College), and Dr. Ming-Kun Li (Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences) for critical reading of the manuscript and helpful discussions.
