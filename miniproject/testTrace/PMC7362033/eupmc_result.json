    "BACKGROUND:COVID-19 had a great impact on medical approaches among dermatologist OBJECTIVE: This systematic review focuses on all skin problems related to COVID-19, including primary and secondary COVID-related cutaneous presentations and the experts recommendations about dermatological managements especially immunomodulators usage issues METHOD: Search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Embase and ScienceDirect. Other additional resources were searched included Cochrane, WHO, Medscape and coronavirus dermatology resource of Nottingham university. The search completed on May/03/2020. 377 articles assigned to the inclusion and exclusion groups RESULT: Eighty-nine articles entered the review. Primary mucocutaneous and appendageal presentations could be the initial or evolving signs of COVID-19. It could be manifest most commonly as a maculopapular exanthamatous or morbiliform eruption, generalized urticaria or pseudo chilblains recognized as \"COVID toes\" (pernio-like acral lesions or vasculopathic rashes). CONCLUSION:During pandemic, Non-infected non-at risk patients with immune-medicated dermatologic disorders under treatment with immunosuppressive immunomodulators are not needed to alter their regimen or discontinue the therapies. At-risk and infection-suspected patients needed to dose reduction, interval increase or temporary drug discontinuation (at least 2 weeks). Patients with an active COVID-19 infection should hold the biologic or non-biologic immunosuppressives until the complete recovery occur (at least 4 weeks). This article is protected by copyright.
