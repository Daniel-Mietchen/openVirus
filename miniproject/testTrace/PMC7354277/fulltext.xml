Population genetic analysis could be useful for investigating the origin and evolutionary dynamics of COVID-19. However, due to extensive <bold>sampling bias</bold> and existence of <bold>infection clusters</bold> during the epidemic spread, direct applications of existing approaches can lead to biased parameter estimations and data misinterpretation. In this study, we first present robust estimator for the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) and the mutation rate, and then apply the approach to analyze 12,909 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2. The mutation rate is inferred to be 8.69&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> per site per year with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [8.61&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, 8.77&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>], and the TMRCA of the samples inferred to be Nov 28, 2019 with a 95% CI of [Oct 20, 2019, Dec 9, 2019]. The results indicate that COVID-19 might originate earlier than and outside of Wuhan Seafood Market. We further demonstrate that genetic polymorphism patterns, including the enrichment of specific haplotypes and the temporal allele frequency trajectories generated from infection clusters, are similar to those caused by evolutionary forces such as natural selection. Our results show that population genetic methods need to be developed to efficiently detangle the effects of sampling bias and infection clusters to gain insights into the evolutionary mechanism of SARS-CoV-2.

COVID-19 is the third pandemic caused by coronavirus in the last 20&#x000a0;years; and it has resulted in more than 4,993,470 infections and claimed nearly 327,738 lives as of May 22, 2020, exceeding any other epidemic caused by betacoronaviruses in the human history, for example, SARS in 2002&#x02013;2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/2019-ncov-background-disease" id="ir010">https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/2019-ncov-background-disease</ext-link>). Among the extensive studies conducted on COVID-19, one essential question is to trace the origin and transmission between humans, shedding light on the molecular mechanism underlying epidemiological and pathological characteristics of the virus.</p><p id="p0010">Population genetic methods are often used to reconstruct evolutionary history of viral infectious diseases, which supplements our knowledge of epidemic or pandemic dynamics <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. High evolutionary rates, which are typical of RNA viruses (10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> nucleotide substitutions per year) <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and large genome size of betacoronaviruses (~30&#x000a0;kb) leave sufficient amount of genomic polymorphisms within the time frame of epidemic outbreaks <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. By interrogating the genomic data sampled at different time points of outbreaks, it is possible to estimate fundamental parameters of the evolutionary process, including evolutionary rate, population expansion rate, and the time when all sampled virus strains shared the most recent common ancestor (MRCA), and to test the different hypotheses of evolutionary mechanism. There are limitations on directly applying existing population genetic approaches to estimate the viral evolutionary history. First, virus samples are often collected by different agencies during the process of infectious outbreak, which may incur spatial and temporal sampling biases. Second, transmission of infectious diseases is commonly seen to happen in infection clusters or outbreak clusters, <italic>i.e.</italic>, a sudden burst of infected cases in the same place around the same time. One example of an infection cluster is the COVID-19 outbreak in the Diamond Princess cruise <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Both sampling bias and presence of infection clusters cause genomic polymorphism patterns similar to those generated by evolutionary effects, such as natural selection <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Most population genetic methods are under the assumption that samples are collected uniformly and randomly from one or multiple populations. A direct application of existing population genetic approaches without taking into account of sampling bias and presence of infection clusters could lead to biased parameter estimations and data misinterpretations.</p><p id="p0015">In this study, we illustrate extensive sampling biases in the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence data. We further investigate two other prominent polymorphism patterns found in the genomic data: a highly homozygous haplotype group or an over-sized node in the haplotype network graph, and a substantial allele frequency difference between two spatial and temporal samples (<italic>e.g.</italic>, the Wuhan and the non-Wuhan samples). Such data patterns are widely considered in population genetic studies as evidence of natural selection <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Nevertheless, we propose that such patterns in the SARS-CoV-2 genomic data should result from sampling bias and presence of infection clusters during epidemic and pandemic spreads. To reduce the estimation bias, we present a robust estimator of the mutation rate and the time to MRCA (TMRCA), which disentangles the effect of sampling bias and presence of infection clusters. The performance of our proposed estimator is compared with the results from a Bayesian evolutionary analysis package, BEAST <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, via simulation studies. We subsequently apply the method to analyze 12,909 genomic sequences collected before May 4, 2020.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Results</title><sec id="s0015"><title>Polymorphic pattern of genomic sequences</title><p id="p0020">The dataset used for this study includes 12,909 genomic sequences as of May 4, 2020, of which 487 genomes are from China (15 provinces and regions) and 12,422 genomes are from 72 other countries of the world. The sampling dates range from December 24, 2019 to May 4, 2020 with a time interval of 132&#x000a0;days.

Most patients had direct contact with Wuhan Seafood Market (WSM), but virus sequences from other areas of Wuhan, if present, were absent from these samples. In addition, these samples were collected in a short period. The first sample date was Dec 24, 2019. On Dec 30, 2019, 21 samples were collected on the same day, among which 8 were from patients with severe symptom of the same clinical site (Jinyintan Hospital), and the rest with no information available on the collection site. Eight additional samples were collected between Jan 1, 2020 and Jan 2, 2020. The sample collection might be spatially biased toward WSM strains, since the early diagnosis protocol of COVID-19 required a direct contact of the patient with WSM. Virus samples of other areas of Wuhan might be absent or underrepresented.</p><p id="p0040">Second, from Jan 10, 2020 to Feb 29, 2020, only 11 out of the 718 samples in the public databases, <italic>i.e.</italic>, 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR) <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), were collected from Wuhan.

Notably, we observe multiple large nodes in the haplotype network. This pattern indicates a very common phenomenon in the spread of an infectious disease, known as an infection cluster or outbreak cluster. Infection clusters occur at a specific location with a sudden burst of infected cases during a short time interval. Genomic sequences of virus samples collected from the infected cases in an infection cluster are identical or highly similar, creating an over-sized node in the network graph.</p><p id="p0055">Six nodes with sequence count &#x0003e;10 are presented in the zoomin (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The H1 and H2 nodes are the major L and S lineages. Fifteen of the 68 (22.06%) H1 haplotypes were collected only from patients near WSM showing severe symptoms of COVID-19 in a short time interval (Dec 30, 2019&#x02013;Jan 7, 2020), which was the initial period of COVID-19 outbreak. Samples outside of WSM were underrepresented due to the sampling bias. Similarly, another 22 of the 68 (32.35%) H1 haplotypes were also collected in a short time interval (Jan 21, 2020&#x02013;Jan 25, 2020) from patients in Hangzhou (Zhejiang Province). The H3 node includes 32 samples collected during Jan 18, 2020&#x02013;Feb 23, 2020, of which 26 genomic sequences were sampled during Feb 15, 2020&#x02013;Feb 17, 2020 from patients on board the Diamond Princess cruise. All these sequences belong to the L lineage and are highly similar. The H4 node mostly includes samples from a nursing home and a school in the King County of Seattle (Washington, USA) during Feb 20, 2020&#x02013;Feb 29, 2020. H5 consists of 16 samples with 8 collected during Jan 29, 2020&#x02013;Feb 1, 2020 from the same hospital in Guangzhou (Guangdong Province). H6 includes 14 samples, among which 7 are related to a church get-together in South Korea. Apparently, the large nodes H1&#x02013;H6 are nearly all related to infection clusters.

Since the virus genomes evolve and transmit among hosts during a short time interval, we make no assumptions on the virus population growth model. We assume no recombination within genomic sequences and no recurrent mutations (see &#x0201c;Maximum likelihood estimate of mutation rate and TMRCA&#x0201d; of the Materials and methods section for details).</p><p id="p0065">We evaluate the performance of VirusMuT with simulated data, by checking its robustness to the sampling bias and presence of infection clusters, and compare the performance of VirusMuT with that of the commonly used method, BEAST <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In simulation 1 (<xref rid="s0095" ref-type="sec">Figure S2A and 2B</xref>), time-series samples composed of 300 sequences were generated from a forward simulation of virus population for 20 generations. In simulations 2 and 3, 200 additional sequences from an infection cluster were sampled. Furthermore, in simulation 3, one filtering step prior to analysis was adopted by removing identical sequences from the infection cluster. As we can see from <xref rid="s0095" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>, both BEAST and VirusMuT showe deviation from the true values in the presence of infection clusters (<xref rid="s0095" ref-type="sec">Figure S2C and 2D</xref>). However, the filtering step that down-weights sequences from the infection clusters can correct the bias in some degree (<xref rid="s0095" ref-type="sec">Figure S2E and 2F</xref>).

However, some studies claimed COVID-19 might originate at an earlier time point and outside of WSM (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>). The estimated TMRCA and the associated 95% CIs are both earlier than the outbreak time of COVID-19 in WSM. It is likely that the L and S lineages have been existing for quite a while before the outbreak.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><title>Pitfalls in inferring adaptive evolution of virus lineages</title><p id="p0080">Another important question on virus evolutionary dynamics is to identify whether the virus genomes are under rapid adaptive evolution with the accumulation of abundant mutantations during its transmission. In population genetic analysis, a haplotype group at a high frequency and relatively low heterozygosity will exhibit an over-sized node in the network graph of a uniformly collected sample, which is often considered as a strong evidence of positive selection on the haplotype. The prominent over-sized H1 node in the haplotype network graph was identified as a signal of higher infectivity of the H1 haplotype by multiple studies <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, as we discussed above, over-sized nodes in the haplotype network are patterns commonly observed during virus spread due to the presence of infection clusters or severe sampling bias. Infection clusters occur mostly in places like transport hubs, nursing facilities, and schools, and usually unrelated to the infectivity or pathogenicity differences among virus lineages <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p id="p0085">The other informative statistic often used to detect selection is the allele frequency difference between samples from different places or stages. We observe remarkable changes in the prevalence of L lineage during the COVID-19 pandemic (<xref rid="s0095" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>A). For example, 35 out of 38 specimen collected before Jan 10, 2020 were from Wuhan, and 33 (94.3%) among the 35 sequences classified as L lineage; while 707 of the 718 sequences collected after Jan 10, 2020 were sampled outside of Wuhan, among which 478 (67.6%) fall into L lineage. Tang et al. <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> noticed this allele frequency difference, and hypothesized that it could be caused by different virulence of the two virus lineages and purifying selection acting on the difference. However, sampling bias in the existing data can fully explain the data pattern. The L lineage is prominently dominant in the samples collected from WSM. Since no samples from other regions in Wuhan were collected at that time, the H1 haplotype was over represented, and therefore its sample frequency did not reflect the &#x0201c;population&#x0201d; frequency in Wuhan at the early stage of the pandemic. A recent clinical study has suggested that the two lineages exhibit similar virulence and clinical outcomes <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p id="p0090">Although it is a widely adopted approach in population genetics to compare the proportions of a specific allele or haplotype in different samples or to trace the allele frequency trajectories through time to evaluate the effect of natural selection, we need to be cautious about employing this approach in virus genomic analysis, because of the widespread presence of infection clusters throughout the pandemic. Indeed, most genetic polymorphism patterns, including the allele frequency spectrum and haplotype structure <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, were largely shaped by infection clusters. A direct application of existing methods in virus evolutionary study without taking into account the virus epidemiological dynamics can lead to misinterpretation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0040"><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0095">Population genetic analysis of virus genomic sequences has been demonstrated to be useful to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of viruses. Tens of thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences are publicly available for study since the outbreak of COVID-19, attracting extensive investigation. However, as we demonstrate in this paper, virus samples are different from common population genetic samples in several aspects: first, the data may be sampled massively at multiple time points; second, presence of outbreak clusters and sampling bias is common. The enrichment pattern of some subsets of haplotypes or the trend of allele frequency trajectories caused by the sampling bias are similar to that caused by evolutionary forces such as natural selection. Direct applications of existing population genetic methods may lead to biased parameter estimation or misinterpretation of evolutionary effects. Robust methods are expected to be developed by fully considering the aforementioned virus epidemiological dynamics, and improve our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of viruses and the underlying driving forces.</p></sec><sec id="s0045"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0050"><title>Sequence alignment, quality control, and population genetics summary</title><p id="p0100">A total of 12,909 SARS-CoV-2 genomes available on May 4, 2020 were downloaded from GISAID (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gisaid.org" id="ir015">http://www.gisaid.org</ext-link>) and National Genomics Data Center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/" id="ir020">https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/</ext-link>).
