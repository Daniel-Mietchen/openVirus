    "The prevalence and incidence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) among men who have sex with men (MSM) are on the rise throughout China. With a large population of MSM, Jiangsu Province is facing an escalating HIV-1 epidemic.The aim of this study was to explore the phylogenetic and temporal dynamics of HIV-1 CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC among antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve MSM recently infected with HIV-1 in Jiangsu Province.We recruited MSM in Jiangsu Province (Suzhou, Wuxi, Nantong, Taizhou and Yancheng) 2012 to 2015. We collected information on demographics and sexual behaviors and a blood sample for HIV genome RNA extraction, RT-PCR amplification, and DNA sequencing. Multiple alignments were made using Gene Cutter, with the selected reference sequences of various subtypes/recombinants from the Los Alamos HIV-1 database. Phylogenetic and Bayesian evolutionary analysis was performed by MEGA version 6.0, Fasttree v2.1.7. and BEAST v1.6.2. Categorical variables were analyzed using χ test (or Fisher exact test where necessary). χ test with trend was used to assess the evolution of HIV-1 subtype distribution over time. All data were analyzed using SPSS20.0 software package (IBM Company, New York, NY).HIV-1 phylogenetic analysis revealed a broad viral diversity including CRF01_AE (60.06%), CRF07_BC (22.29%), subtype B (5.88%), CRF67_01B (5.26%), CRF68_01B (2.79%), CRF55_01B (1.55%), CRF59_01B (0.93%), and CRF08_BC (0.62%). Two unique recombination forms (URFs) (0.62%) were also detected. Four epidemic clusters and 1 major cluster in CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC were identified. The introduction of CRF01_AE strain (2001) was earlier than CRF07_BC strain (2004) into MSM resided in Jiangsu based on the time of the most recent common ancestor.Our study demonstrated HIV-1 subtype diversity among ART-naïve MSM recently infected with HIV-1 in Jiangsu. We first depicted the spatiotemporal dynamics, traced the dates of origin for the HIV-1 CRF01_AE/07_BC strains and made inference for the effective population size among newly infected ART-naïve MSM in Jiangsu from 2012 to 2015. A real-time surveillance of HIV-1 viral diversity and phylodynamics of epidemic cluster would be of great value to the monitoring of the epidemic and control of transmission, improvement of antiretroviral therapy strategies, and design of vaccines."
