who have sex with men (MSM) are on the rise throughout China. With a large population
of MSM, Jiangsu Province is facing an escalating HIV-1 epidemic.</p><p>The aim of this study was to explore the phylogenetic and temporal dynamics of HIV-1
CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC among antiretroviral therapy (ART)-na&#x000ef;ve MSM recently
infected with HIV-1 in Jiangsu Province.</p><p>We recruited MSM in Jiangsu Province (Suzhou, Wuxi, Nantong, Taizhou and Yancheng)
2012 to 2015. We collected information on demographics and sexual behaviors and a
blood sample for HIV genome RNA extraction, RT-PCR amplification, and DNA sequencing.
Multiple alignments were made using Gene Cutter, with the selected reference
sequences of various subtypes/recombinants from the Los Alamos HIV-1 database.
Phylogenetic and Bayesian evolutionary analysis was performed by MEGA version 6.0,
Fasttree v2.1.7. and BEAST v1.6.2. Categorical variables were analyzed using
<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> test (or Fisher exact test where necessary).
<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> test with trend was used to assess the
evolution of HIV-1 subtype distribution over time. All data were analyzed using
SPSS20.0 software package (IBM Company, New York, NY).</p><p>HIV-1 phylogenetic analysis revealed a broad viral diversity including CRF01_AE
(60.06%), CRF07_BC (22.29%), subtype B (5.88%), CRF67_01B (5.26%), CRF68_01B (2.79%),
CRF55_01B (1.55%), CRF59_01B (0.93%), and CRF08_BC (0.62%). Two unique recombination
forms (URFs) (0.62%) were also detected. Four epidemic clusters and 1 major cluster
in CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC were identified. The introduction of CRF01_AE strain (2001)
was earlier than CRF07_BC strain (2004) into MSM resided in Jiangsu based on the time
of the most recent common ancestor.</p><p>Our study demonstrated HIV-1 subtype diversity among ART-na&#x000ef;ve MSM recently

the dates of origin for the HIV-1 CRF01_AE/07_BC strains and made inference for the
effective population size among newly infected ART-na&#x000ef;ve MSM in Jiangsu from
2012 to 2015. A real-time surveillance of HIV-1 viral diversity and phylodynamics of
epidemic cluster would be of great value to the monitoring of the epidemic and
control of transmission, improvement of antiretroviral therapy strategies, and design
of vaccines.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>China</kwd><kwd>CRF01_AE</kwd><kwd>CRF07_BC</kwd><kwd>HIV-1</kwd><kwd>men who have sex with men</kwd><kwd>most recent common ancestor (MRCA)</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>China is facing an enormous challenge for controlling the rapid spread of the HIV-1
epidemic through sexual transmission. According to the official report, since the first
HIV case found in 1985, approximately 177,000 HIV-infected people had died and the
number of people living with HIV/AIDS had reached 575,000 by the end of 2015. Nearly
100,000 people were newly diagnosed between January and October 2015.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> The proportion of MSM in newly diagnosed
cases saw the sharp increase overtime: from 2.5% in 2006 to 27.2% in 2015. In 2013, a
large-scale cross-sectional survey involving MSM from 61 cities in China revealed a
pooled HIV prevalence of 4.9%.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> This
rate had further increased to 8.0% in 2015.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> As a coastal province with booming economy and cultural diversity in
eastern China, bordering Shanghai to the south, Jiangsu has been attracting an
increasing population of migrants, including MSM. From January to September 2014, 54.5%
of the newly diagnosed cases in Jiangsu were MSM,<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> much higher than the national proportion of 25.8% in
2014.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup></p><p>In Jiangsu, the main subtypes of HIV-1 among all risk populations was CRF01_AE (56.8%),
followed by subtype B (19.9%).<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> For
MSM, the main subtypes were CRF01_AE (63.6%), CRF07_BC (18.2%), B (9.1%), and CRF08_BC
(9.1%).<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Nationwide molecular
epidemiologic surveys indicated that CRF01_AE strain, initially prevailing in the
heterosexual risk individuals in southwestern border provinces and eastern coastal
areas,<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> had quickly overtaken subtype B among MSM during the past few
years.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Meanwhile, CRF07_BC strain, the other dominating
subtype among injection drug users (IDUs),<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> was also
reported to be spreading among MSM in some provinces.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Surprisingly, CRF55_01B strain, a newly
identified recombinant virus, has been rapidly disseminated among MSM and heterosexuals
in Shenzhen in southern China and elsewhere (Hong Kong, Dongguan, Hunan, Shanghai,
Beijing, and so on) at the end of 2012.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Therefore, an
ever-increasing migrant population and a sharply rising trend of HIV-1 infection in MSM
in Jiangsu will inevitably evolve the HIV-1 subtype diversity.</p><p>Our study aimed to explore the phylogenetic and temporal dynamics of HIV-1 CRF01_AE and
CRF07_BC among recently infected antiretroviral therapy (ART)-na&#x000ef;ve MSM in
Jiangsu Province, using established phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis methods.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Ethics</title><p>The study, including design, consent, and laboratory procedures, was reviewed and
approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Human Medical Research Ethics
Committee of the municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention in each of the 5
study cities (SZCDC, WXCDC, NTCDC, TZCDC, YCCDC).</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Study subjects</title><p>We retrospectively investigated 323 MSM from initial 1265 HIV-1-infected patient
samples and their related demographic data in 5 major cities (Suzhou, Wuxi, Nantong,
Taizhou, and Yancheng) of Jiangsu Province from 2012 to 2015, from which the
sequences were isolated and analyzed based on our sentinel surveillance and drug
resistance database.</p><p>To be eligible, participants must be diagnosed (Western blot confirmation) annually
for HIV-1 infection, have resided in Jiangsu in the past 3 months, be highly active
antiretroviral therapy-na&#x000ef;ve, have a high-quality sequence of at least 1000
nucleotides based on the <italic>pol</italic> region.</p><p>Three criteria for determination of HIV-1 primary or recent infection have been
extensively applied. They are defined by diagnosis during clinically defined acute
HIV infection (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.shcs.ch/56-definitions2.1">http://www.shcs.ch/56-definitions2.1</ext-link>) or during recent infection
defined by seroconversion (&#x0003c;1 year between last-negative and first-positive
HIV test), or by an ambiguous nucleotide count of &#x0003c;0.5% (in the first year) in
a baseline in bulk sequencing of HIV-1 <italic>pol</italic> gene, from
ART-na&#x000ef;ve genetic sample. However, the surveillance analysis for acute and/or
early infection of HIV-1 could only be restricted to low-density samples. Therefore,
to exclude the all potential un-recent or late-chronic infections in our study, we
chose the molecular analysis algorithm which might distinguish recent infection from
long-standing infection (predictive value 98.7%).<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Phylogenetic subtyping and evolutionary analysis</title><p>Blood samples were collected within 3 months after infection had been confirmed.
HIV-1 genome RNA was extracted from 200 mL of stored plasma specimens using the QIAmp
Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as Manufacturer's instructions.
Reverse transcription and nested polymerase chain amplification for partial genes of
<italic>pol</italic> were performed by a home brew PCR procedure. A onetube
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction kit (Gold-Script one-step RT-PCR kit,
Life Technologies), and PCR kit (TaKaRa Ex Taq Kit, Takara Biotechnology Co, Ltd;
Dalian, China) were used according to the manufacture's recommendations for
amplification of the HIV-1 <italic>pol</italic> gene (protease 1&#x02013;99 amino
acids and part of reverse transcriptase 1&#x02013;254 amino acids). About 1050-bp
<italic>pol</italic> and 660-bp fragments were amplified. The PCR amplification
was carried out in a thermal cycler (GeneAmp PCR System 9700, Applied Biosystems).
PCR products were directly sequenced in both directions with sequencing primers using
ABI 3730 sequencer. Pre-PCR and post-PCR areas are strictly separated to avoid
contamination from amplicon aerosol.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> Multiple alignments were made using Gene Cutter (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/index">http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/index</ext-link>), with the selected reference
sequences of various subtypes/recombinants from the Los Alamos HIV-1 database. A
phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method implemented by MEGA
version 6.0 with the Kimura two-parameter and 1000 replicates for bootstrap analysis.
New intersubtype or inter-CRF sequences were analyzed by the recombination
identification programs (RIP <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/">http://www.hiv.lanl.gov</ext-link>, and SimPlot 3.5.1 software). Selection of the
clustering sequences was analyzed by Maximum likelihood phylogeny with Fasttree
v2.1.7. Local support values were computed with the Shimodaira-Hassegawa test. The
node SH-like support value of a cluster &#x0003e;0.9 was considered credible.</p><p>To estimate the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) and the effective
population sizes for both CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC strains circulating in Jiangsu, we
selected the sequences close to node of each single epidemic cluster in Fasttree ML
tree and performed Bayesian inference analysis using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) approach with chain length 200 million in BEAST v1.6.2. An HKY substitution
model and uncorrelated relaxed log-normal molecular clock model and Bayesian skyline
model were selected for the best-fit model for this analysis. The first 25% of states
of each run were discarded as burn in.</p><p>The convergence of parameters was checked using Tracer v1.5. The Maximum Clade
Credibility (MCC) tree was constructed by TreeAnnotator v1.7.2 and shown by FigTree
v1.3.1. The effective sample size (ESS) was &#x0003e;200.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The demographic characteristics of these studied subjects were analyzed based on
HIV-1 genetic subtypes. Proportions were used for categorical variables. The
<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> test (or Fisher exact test where necessary)
was used to compare proportions between different groups. Data of age-associated and
genetic distances were described by the mean&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;standard
deviation. The trend <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> test was used to assess
whether there was a change in the trend of the proportions of subtype over time. All
tests were 2-tailed and <italic>P</italic> values &#x0003c;0.05 were considered as
statistically significant. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS20.0
software package (IBM Company, New York).</p></sec></sec><sec><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec><label>3.1</label><title>Demographic characteristics</title><p>A total of 323 HIV-1-infected MSM individuals were enrolled in 5 major cities of

(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>)</p></sec></sec><sec><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first phylodynamic study depicting the
spatiotemporal dynamics, making inference for the effective population size at the time
of HIV-1 CRF01_AE/07_BC among newly infected ART-na&#x000ef;ve MSM in Jiangsu, China, and
to trace the dates of origin for both strains. Jiangsu, a major province of economic
prosperity, with well-developed transportation and communication infrastructure and
diverse cultures, attracts an increasing number of migrants. By the end of 2015,
&#x0003e;79.73 million people are permanent residents in Jiangsu and over 1 in 3 are
migrant resident population. In addition, MSM continue to be the population group at
higher risk of acquiring HIV-1 infections in developing countries. Well-improved sense
of stigma and discrimination for MSM made them flock into metropolises or big cities,
where a closely larger social and sexual network more or less had been established or
could be easily constructed. Different epidemiological studies worldwide had revealed
some risk factors for HIV acquisition in MSM at individual levels, such as unprotected
anal intercourse, high frequency of sexual activity with multiple male sex partners, and
high prevalence of STDs among this population.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> Therefore, it is
worthwhile to note that MSM are currently vulnerable to HIV infection in Jiangsu.</p><p>In Western Europe, the incidence of HIV-1 among MSM has increased during the last
decade, probably because of an increase in unsafe risk sexual practices and the
re-emergence of several sexually transmitted infections (STI) among the young,
low-educated, and HIV-unaware individuals.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> The HIV
epidemic in European countries such as Italy was mainly attributed to the HIV-1 B
subtype.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> In Europe, national
surveillance data showed an increasing proportion of HIV-1 cases among MSM, ranging from
15% in 1996 to 1997 to 22% in 2006 to 2007.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> However, in Southeast Asia and China, CRF01_AE had quickly
overtaken subtype B among MSM during past few years.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Besides,
CRF07_BC strain, the other dominating subtype among the injection drug user (IDU) risk
group,<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> was also reported to be spreading among MSM.
Furthermore, the subtype of HIV-1 among MSM in Jiangsu, mainly were CRF01_AE (63.6%),
followed by CRF07_BC (18.2%), B (9.1%), and CRF08_BC (9.1%).<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup></p><p>Our phylogenetic analysis based on <italic>pol</italic> gene clearly revealed the
presence of viral subtype diversity among the studied subjects covering all ages.
Obviously, the major HIV-1 subtype is still CRF01_AE, reaching 67.6% in 2013, followed
by 15.7% for CRF07_BC, the second dominant strain. In this study, we also determined at
least 36 recently identified CRFs and 2 URFs as well, indicating the viral genetic
heterogeneity and subtype/recombinant complexity among MSM epidemic in this province. It
is well known that CRF01_AE caused an outbreak among the high-risk heterosexual
population in Thailand in the late 1980s,<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> and was subsequently
disseminated to various risk populations in neighboring countries, including
China.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> Of note, many
of CRF01_AE-based inter-subtype or inter-recombinants such as CRF55_01B, CRF59_01B,
CRF67_01B, CRF68_01B, and some URFs<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> have been identified
recently in different provinces in China, suggesting the future epidemic will even be
broader. These new type recombinant strains could be an alert for a future epidemic.</p><p>The <italic>pol</italic> region genomic sequencing helps to understand HIV-1 genetic
diversity and contributes to the fields of HIV epidemiology, diagnosis, pathogenesis,
and vaccine development. Analysis of tMRCA using molecular clock principle can be used
to estimate when the viral epidemic began and to estimate the early growth
rate.<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup> The analyses using
phylogenetic reconstruction and Bayesian inference indicate that the spread of CRF01_AE
in Jiangsu MSM involved at least 4 viral lineages. Cluster 1 strains play a dominant
role in the CRF01_AE epidemic in Jiangsu, and cause a significant proportion of
infections in Southern Jiangsu (88.0%), Middle Jiangsu (89.1%), and particularly
Northern Jiangsu (92.9%). Cluster 2 was prevalent in Southern Jiangsu (6.0%) and Middle
Jiangsu (10.9%). Both cluster 3 and cluster 4 are found mainly in Southern Jiangsu and
are responsible for about 1.5% and 4.5% of infections, respectively. (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) We found that tMRCA of CRF01_AE among MSM in
Jiangsu was in 2001.6 (cluster 1), 2004.2 (cluster 2), 2005.9 (cluster 4), 2006.3
(cluster 3), a little later than other previous study,<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> in which tMRCA of CRF01_AE among MSM in China was
estimated from mid to late 1990s. In addition, we found that the tMRCA of CRF01_AE
cluster 1 (2001.6) and 2 (2004.2) was earlier than CRF07_BC (2004.2), indicating an
earlier introduction of CRF01_AE strain than CRF07_BC strain into MSM in Jiangsu.
Surprisingly, 8 independent subclusters (posterior &#x0003e;0.98) contained within major
cluster (A) in MCC tree for CRF07_BC were observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), implying that a divergent evolution of CRF07_BC strain has
occurred, and 8 independent transmission networks might have been established after
entering MSM in this province. In our study, for the first time we determined the tMRCA
of both CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC strains, and identified multiple epidemic subclusters of
CRF07_BC strain circulating among MSM in Jiangsu. However, these epidemic clusters
and/or subclusters in relation to their origin of virus introduction, social and sexual
network, as well as cross-transmission between different high-risk groups would deserve
further investigation in the future study.</p><p>Given that the MSM blood samples were from the five local CDCs involving southern,
middle, and northern parts of Jiangsu, our results were rather convincing. Nonetheless,
a comment should be made about the limitation of the data acquisition in our study.
Although the CRF01_AE/07_BC <italic>pol</italic> sequences from all parts of Jiangsu
Province were included when this study was initiated, the number of the sequences was
relatively small, especially for Northern Jiangsu. Until more archival specimens from
the region and more population besides MSM, such as female sex workers and IDU, were
retrieved and thoroughly analyzed, the complex dissemination of CRF01_AE/07_BC lineages
were interpreted with caution.</p><p>In conclusion, based on the laboratory and data analysis skills of molecular
epidemiology and the latest available data on MSM from Jiangsu Province, we have found
that HIV prevalence remains high and therefore remains a public health priority. Our
results demonstrate HIV-1 subtype diversity among ART-na&#x000ef;ve MSM recently infected
with HIV-1 in Jiangsu, highlighting the need for surveillance of HIV-1 viral diversity
and phylodynamics of epidemic cluster to understand the monitoring of the epidemic and
control of transmission, improvement of antiretroviral therapy strategies, and design of
vaccines.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank staffs at the 5 Jiangsu district (Suzhou, Wuxi, Nantong, Taizhou, and
