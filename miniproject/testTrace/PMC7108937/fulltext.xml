We sought to quantify the diagnostic utility of FASH for TB among individuals with HIV in Malawi.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between March 2016 and August 2017, 210 adults with HIV who had 2 or more signs and symptoms that were concerning for TB (fever, cough, night sweats, weight loss) were enrolled from a public HIV clinic in Lilongwe, Malawi. The treating clinicians conducted a history, physical exam, FASH protocol, and additional TB evaluation (laboratory diagnostics and chest radiography) on all participants. The clinician made a final treatment decision based on all available information. At the 6-month follow-up visit, we categorized participants based on clinical outcomes and diagnostic tests as having probable/confirmed TB or unlikely TB; association of FASH with probable/confirmed TB was calculated using Fisher's exact tests. The impact of FASH on empiric TB treatment was determined by asking the clinicians prospectively about whether they would start treatment at 2 time points in the baseline visit: (1) after the initial history and physical exam; and (2) after history, physical exam, and FASH protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 181 participants underwent final analysis, of whom 56 were categorized as probable/confirmed TB and 125 were categorized as unlikely TB. The FASH protocol was positive in 71% (40/56) of participants with probable/confirmed TB compared to 24% (30/125) of participants with unlikely TB (odds ratio=7.9, 95% confidence interval=3.9,16.1; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.001). Among those classified as confirmed/probable TB, FASH increased the likelihood of empiric TB treatment before obtaining any other diagnostic studies from 9% (5/56) to 46% (26/56) at the point-of-care. For those classified as unlikely TB, FASH increased the likelihood of empiric treatment from 2% to 4%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>In the setting of HIV coinfection in Malawi, FASH can be a helpful tool that augments the clinician's ability to make a timely diagnosis of TB.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The risk of developing active tuberculosis (TB) is 20&#x02013;37 times higher in people living with HIV than in people who do not have HIV.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> This risk is compounded by difficulty in diagnosing TB in individuals who have HIV, as they more commonly present with atypical radiographic findings, smear-negative TB, and disseminated extrapulmonary manifestations.<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> As a result, individuals with HIV and TB have a higher mortality rate, likely due to diagnostic uncertainty that leads to delays in therapy.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Gold standard diagnostics, such as TB culture, are often unavailable in regions with the highest burden of TB and HIV. Even when these diagnostics are available, the results can take up to 6 weeks to return, causing delays in diagnosis and treatment. A recent autopsy study investigating patients with HIV who died in an inpatient ward in South Africa found that TB was implicated in two-thirds of those deaths and one-third of those cases were not diagnosed and treated at the time of death.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p><p>To reduce TB morbidity and mortality, decrease transmissibility, and gain control of the epidemic, improved point-of-care diagnostics in resource-limited settings are needed. Ultrasound is one such diagnostic modality. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) provides the clinician with immediate feedback to make informed decisions that can avoid delays in treatment. One POCUS protocol, focused assessment with sonography for HIV-associated TB (FASH), has been developed to improve the diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB in patients with HIV by evaluating for pericardial fluid, pleural fluid, ascites, abdominal lymphadenopathy, and hepatic and splenic hypoechoic focal lesions.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> These sonographic findings of HIV-associated extrapulmonary TB have been described in various settings and populations.<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> The FASH protocol has been shown to detect TB that would be missed based on other available diagnostics.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> In many resource-limited settings, POCUS is more available than regular radiology services (due to availability of low-cost, small, rechargeable ultrasound devices) and point-of-care lab diagnostics, which require equipment, a regular electricity source, a supply chain for reagents, and trained technicians. FASH can be taught to midlevel health workers and has been successfully implemented in resource-limited settings.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> It is increasingly plausible that rural facilities could rely only on history, physical exam, and FASH to make an initial assessment of TB.</p><boxed-text position="float"><p>The FASH protocol has been shown to detect TB that would be missed based on other available diagnostics.</p></boxed-text><p>Despite the reported benefits of using FASH for TB diagnosis, uncertainty remains about its sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value in settings like Malawi where exams are often performed by midlevel providers. It is also unclear how best to incorporate FASH into the TB diagnostic algorithm.

Staff at the medical center have the following diagnostic tests available to them when evaluating clients who present with signs and symptoms of TB: complete blood count, CD4 cell count, viral load, acid fast bacteria stains, Xpert MTB/RIF to detect <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB) and resistance to the anti-TB drug rifampicin (RIF), urine lipoarabinomannan assay (LAM), and chest radiography. In 2015, the medical center acquired an ultrasound machine, and clinicians were trained in the FASH protocol. Information about this training has been previously published.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="s2.2"><title>Population</title><p>Between March 2016 and August 2017, we enrolled 210 adults with HIV who were 18 years of age or older who presented to Partners in Hope Medical Center for care and answered &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; to having 2 or more of the following TB symptoms: fever, cough, night sweats, weight loss. We used convenience sampling to enroll participants. If an individual met criteria based on the routine TB screening questions, and the study and clinical staff were available to perform screening, consent, and study procedures, then the participant was screened and enrolled, if eligible. Participants were eligible regardless of antiretroviral therapy status. Individuals were excluded if they were already receiving TB treatment or were pregnant.</p><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by the Malawi National Health Sciences Research Committee and the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Institutional Review Board.</p></sec><sec id="s2.3"><title>Study Procedures</title><p>After enrollment, the treating clinician (1 of 5 clinical officers or 1 medical doctor) conducted a history and physical exam and documented on a paper study form whether they would empirically treat for TB based on the history and physical exam findings. The treating clinician then conducted the FASH protocol, which included assessment for pericardial, pleural, and ascitic fluid; abdominal lymphadenopathy; and focal liver and splenic lesions using a Philips ClearVue 650 with a C5-2 abdominal transducer (2&#x02013;5 MHz). FASH was defined as positive if any single component was positive, with the exception of trace pericardial effusions (defined as pericardial effusion &#x0003c;0.5 cm), which are considered clinically insignificant. After completing the FASH, the same clinician documented whether they would treat for TB based on the FASH results (before conducting any labs or other studies) to mimic scenarios that may commonly occur in settings throughout Malawi that could have access to POCUS but not point-of-care labs or chest radiography.</p><p>After FASH was completed, all participants were then evaluated with sputum microscopy, sputum Xpert MTB/RIF assay, urine LAM, complete blood count, CD4 cell count, viral load, and chest radiography. Sputum and tissue cultures were not obtained as they were not readily available in Malawi.</p><p>At the end of the clinical visit, based on all available data, the treating clinician made final management decisions, including whether to treat for TB. Participants were asked to return for study follow-up visits at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after enrollment. At each follow-up visit, a study nurse evaluated the participant for ongoing TB symptoms, took vital signs and weight, and reviewed the medical record for any new diagnostic results related to TB. Long-term management of TB treatment was performed by Partners in Hope clinicians per the standard of care in Malawi.</p></sec><sec id="s2.4"><title>FASH Quality Assurance</title><p>Still images of each FASH protocol component were shared with a UCLA radiologist using an encrypted file-sharing program.

This is relevant because in many rural settings in Malawi, traditional radiography and lab diagnostics remain limited while POCUS equipment is becoming increasingly available. Therefore, FASH could help clinicians decide to start empiric TB treatment while awaiting test results and/or referring to facilities for further diagnostic testing. In our study, when the history and physical exam were less consistent with TB, the FASH protocol did not increase the clinician's clinical concern for TB, therefore FASH did not contribute to overtreatment.

First, it is possible that participants in the unlikely or probable TB categories were misclassified due to the lack of microbiological or histological confirmation. This is a common limitation for TB studies in low-resource areas and represents the reality faced by clinicians. This study took a conservative approach and required a high burden of evidence to classify a participant as probable TB. We chose to classify deaths without TB diagnostic confirmation as unlikely TB to avoid the possibility of biasing the results in favor of the FASH protocol. However, many of these individuals presented late, had positive FASH findings, and may have died from TB. We performed a sensitivity analysis recategorizing those who died as probable TB, and our results were strengthened. Second, given our small sample size, we did not exclude participants with pulmonary TB from the sample nor stratify by pulmonary versus extrapulmonary TB. In settings where pulmonary TB can be confirmed at the point-of-care by sputum microscopy and chest radiography, FASH would not be required as an adjunctive tool. Lastly, performing ultrasound has a high degree of interoperator variability. Our study had strong support from an expert radiologist from UCLA who provided continuous and real-time quality assurance. This type of support may not be available for many programs. Expansion of teleradiology to support the implementation of FASH should be considered within resource-limited settings.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The FASH protocol is an adjunctive diagnostic tool that is predictive of TB in individuals with HIV and can augment clinicians' ability to diagnose TB at the point-of-care and reduce delays in treatment, particularly in settings with limited lab diagnostic capacity. The FASH protocol also plays an important role for clinicians who remain concerned for TB coinfection in individuals with an initial negative work-up but ongoing high clinical suspicion. Efforts to evaluate real-world implementation of FASH across a variety of settings will be important for understanding how to best scale this strategy in a range of resource-limited settings.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Tom Heller, Tim Canan, and Zachary Boas for providing ultrasound training and Chi-Hong Tseng and Mei Leng for statistical support.
