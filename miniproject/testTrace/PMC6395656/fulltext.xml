In this study, we aimed to identify a specific and sensitive diagnostic biomarker and develop a vaccine to prevent this disease. We investigated membrane proteins to reveal biomarkers in serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from TB patients. We employed Western blotting to evaluate serological immunoglobulin G levels, and Enzyme Linked Immunospot (ELISpot) to assess the antigen-specific cellular interferon-&#x003b3; secretion from PBMCs after membrane protein stimulation. A total of 219 membrane proteins were identified, 52 exhibited at a higher levels than the 38-kDa prositive control. Of these 18 exhibited reacted ratios above 1, especially Rv1111c (427&#x02013;981), with a ratios at 3.38. Accuracy and sensitivity were markedly higher for the top two antigen candidates, Rv0232 and Rv1115, after two rounds of ELISpot tests than ESAT-6 in the commercial kit (42.15 and 43.62%, respectively).

As TB ranking alongside HIV/AIDS in worldwide mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, most countries are responding to the WHO End Tuberculosis (TB) Strategy by 2035. As a country with a high TB burden, China has developed new tools, especially in TB diagnosis, to reduce the epidemic. Currently, the gold standards for obtaining an aetiological diagnosis of TB are sputum-positive smear and culture. However, these methods are restricted because they are time-consuming to perform and these pathogenic bacteria are difficult to trace. Therefore TB diagnosis remains a challenge, as more than 50% of patients lack aetiological evidence. In addition, due to the presence of intracellular bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, vaccine failure, and drug resistance, no single method accurately diagnoses all clinical TB cases. The antigen-specific IFN-&#x003b3; release assay, which is based on host immune response detection, is a reliable auxiliary tool that can be used in the clinic and is recommended by the WHO for detect <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb)</italic> infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Nonetheless, newer, more rapid and accurate diagnostic methods are required because current methods are not superior to the tuberculin skin tests or able to differentiate latent <italic>M. tb</italic> infection from active TB. Additionally, the rate of missed diagnoses is high, as only 60% to 80% of active pulmonary TB is diagnosed by the present established methods. Thus, identification of novel biomarkers for both the host and the pathogen is key to increasing the accuracy of TB diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Recently, scientists are focusing on deciphering each <italic>M.tb</italic> gene or protein function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Among more than 4,000&#x02009;<italic>M.tb</italic> open reading frame (ORF), secreted proteins (e.g., ESAT-6, CFP-10, and Ag85A/B) are thought to stimulate an antigen specific immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and are well-studied <italic>M.tb</italic> antigens used for diagnosis and vaccine development. However, there are still limits to the use of these proteins in the clinical setting because they cannot used to differential diagnosis between TB infection and TB and only 70% of positive clinical TB patients are identified by these proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Previously, we comprehensively examined the functions of 1,250 proteins (representing approximately one-third of <italic>M.tb</italic> proteins)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. To obtain more detailed and reliable information, we focused on membrane proteins in the present study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Although <italic>M.tb</italic> membrane proteins have long been considered to be immunogens, they have not been systematically studied. Membrane proteins are those that interact with or components of biological membranes and include integral membrane proteins that are permanently anchored or are components of the membrane, as well as peripheral membrane proteins, which are only temporarily attached to the lipid bilayer or to other integral proteins. Certain membrane proteins play vital roles in many cellular processes, for example membrane receptor proteins relay signals between the internal and external environments, transport proteins move molecules and ions across the membrane, and cell adhesion molecules, such as proteins involved in the immune response, allow cells to identify and interact each other<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">To obtain a better understanding of these proteins, we expressed and purified all <italic>M.tb</italic> membrane proteins and examined via three rounds of serological immunity to determine their usefulness as potential serological diagnosis biomarkers. In addition, two rounds of cell-mediated immunity tests were carried out to evaluate the proteins for their suitability as screening biomarkers. Further analysis of membrane protein antigens generated by the cellular antigenic response in TB patients may accelerate antigen biomarker research and improve TB diagnosis and vaccine development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Bioinformatics analysis of target proteins</title><p id="Par5">ORFs of membrane proteins of <italic>M.tb</italic> H37Rv was identified and predicted by PSORTb 3.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://psort.hgc.jp/form2.html">http://psort.hgc.jp/form2.html</ext-link>) and TMHMM 2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

In the present study, this approach used to evaluate the antigenicity of membrane proteins by comparing humoural responses with that of the commercial <italic>M.tb</italic> 38-kDa antigens (Rv0934). The antigenic and immunological properties of 18 proteins were confirmed in three rounds of screening, and the ratio of the results for target proteins to those for the positive control Rv0934 control remaining above 1. especially for Rv1111c (427&#x02013;981), which had a mean ratio of 3.38. These data show that these proteins have distinct humoural antigenic properties, and suggest that they may represent potential biomarkers or vaccine candidates. Data obtained from humoral immune response experiments performed using serum from subjects without TB infection with or without BCG scars showed that a weakly positive antibody response. Although WHO has halted the use of humoural immunity to diagnose TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, serological results suggest an active response to TB serum by 18 of the evaluated membrane proteins, with satisfactory performance. Thus, combinations of these membrane proteins may be used to obtain the sensitivity and specificity desired for diagnosis because the response intensity was much higher than that for other proteins. In the future, we will perform work to explore this issue.</p><p id="Par14">The most significant result of this study is the emergence of membrane proteins as potent stimulators of human T-cell INF-&#x003b3; and IL-2 secretion, proliferative responses, and multi-cytokine production. T-cells have been explored in numerous research efforts because of their importance in protecting against TB via secretion of high levels of IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-2, and other cytokines. <italic>M.tb</italic>-secreted antigen target-6 (ESAT-6), Antigen 85 (Ag85), and culture filtrate protein-10 (CFP-10) elicit strong T cell responses in both mice and humans. Our antigen-specific IFN-&#x003b3; secretion assay identified 8 membrane proteins (Rv0232, Rv1115, Rv0284, Rv1145, Rv0987, Rv1783, Rv3447c, and Rv1500) with marked stability and a significant response. Rv1115 and Rv0232 reacted with PBMCs from active patients, with a reaction ratio above 50% <italic>in vitro</italic>, and enhanced cytokines secretion <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="Par15">To further evaluate protein immunogenicity, two candidate proteins were used as antigens to immunized mice. The two proteins were detected by two rounds of ELISpot,with ratio above 50% in the first round (supplement Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). In the second round, all proteins tested showed a suitable average intensity of reactivity and specificity (supplement Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>).

Here we presented candidate proteins with a higher capacity to stimulate IL-2 production. With the exception for the positive control, Rv3875 (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0186), which enhances cytokines secretion, we found that target proteins such as Rv1811 (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0100) induced higher expression levels of IL-2 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells.

However, based on ELISpot, Rv1811 did not elicit IFN-&#x003b3;expression when used as an antigen, indicating that this protein may serve as a biomarker for IL-2 detection. Future studies will be performed to explore this hypothesis. The finding that the initial protective immune response to <italic>M.tb</italic> following infection or vaccination can be subsequently lost is central to understanding the natural history of <italic>M.tb</italic> infection, and for exploring the rational design of TB vaccines.</p><p id="Par17">In the antigen-specific proliferation test, Rv0232 and Rv1115 also increased T-cell proliferation; though the increase were not significant.
