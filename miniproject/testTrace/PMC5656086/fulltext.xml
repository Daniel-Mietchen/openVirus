A total of 340 newly reported HIV-infected MSM were recruited proportionally from ten prefectures across Zhejiang province between January and December in 2013. Partial pol gene was amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic relationship, transmission network and genotypic drug resistance analyses were performed on 311 sequences. HIV-1 subtypes including CRF01_AE (55.9%), CRF07_BC (37.6%), subtype B (1.9%), CRF55_01B (1.3%), CRF68_01B (0.3%), CRF08_BC (0.3%) and URFs (2.6%) were identified. A higher proportion of CRF07_BC and other subtypes existed in the &#x0003e;35 years group, while a higher proportion of CRF01_AE was present in the young group (&#x0003c;35 years). Low prevalence of transmitted drug resistance was found (3.9%, 12/311). Strains with Hangzhou imprints were diffused across the full phylogenetic tree. Moreover, Hangzhou represented the dominant proportion of local HIV transmission (72.0%) and cross-regional transmission (62.4%) based on the provincial transmission network and possessed the largest number of nodes with &#x02265;50 edges, accounting for 50.0% (10/20). The complexity of HIV subtypes and an intertwined network was noticed in MSM in Zhejiang province. Hangzhou likely plays a central regional role in the intra-provincial spread of HIV.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">HIV/AIDS continues to stand as one of the most important threats to public health in China. Men who have sex with men (MSM) have accounted for an alarmingly increasing proportion of newly reported HIV/AIDS cases nationally in recent years, rising from 2.5% in 2006 to 25.8% in 2014<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. A national cross-sectional survey revealed a 4.9% of overall prevalence of HIV infection among the MSM populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. It is clear that MSM have become a major core population of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in China. Therefore, special attention must be given to MSM populations, including the circulating HIV strains among them.</p><p id="Par3">Numerous studies have revealed risk factors of HIV transmission in MSM, including unprotected anal intercourse, multiple sex partners, low rates of condom use, illegal drug use, and a history of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, studies on HIV subtypes among MSM are inadequate. Previous studies have outlined the profiles of HIV subtypes among Chinese MSM at the national level, demonstrating their dynamics and complexities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Considering the widespread disproportion of transmission across the country, deep and detailed studies characterizing localized epidemics are necessary to help implement directional interventions in response to local situations.

Relevant studies still should be carried out; these would not only benefit the development of local control measures but also amplify their effects via integration into a cohesive whole-country strategy.</p><p id="Par4">Zhejiang, a southeastern coastal province of China (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), is one of the most prosperous economic regions in China, attracting a large number of migrants from across the country annually. The first HIV-1 case was identified in 1985 in Zhejiang, and the cumulative number of reported HIV/AIDS cases was 14,703 by the end of 2013, which was the highest number of reported cases in southeastern China. HIV/AIDS cases acquired HIV through homosexual transmission have increased significantly, from 16.1% in 2008 to 37.8% in Zhejiang 2013. The prevalence of HIV infection among the MSM populations in Zhejiang was estimated to be approximately 8% in 2010&#x02013;2013 as determined through sentinel surveillance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and 13.8% based on a respondent-driven sampling survey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, with the highest rate of new infections in focus populations (6.3% in 2012)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.

Similarly, our preliminary study revealed a complicated genetic network among MSM in Zhejiang province<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, this study had limitations, including a small sample size and convenience sampling. Therefore, in this study we expanded the number of study subjects by performing stratified proportional sampling based on case reports in each prefecture, attempting to depict the molecular epidemiological characteristics of HIV strains that are prevalent among MSM in Zhejiang province. These findings will help us gain a deeper understanding of the HIV epidemic among MSM in a representative region in southeast China and develop pointed measures to curb the rapid spread of HIV-1 in this population.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Geographical distribution of HIV-1 genotypes in MSM in the study area.

However, it is still dominated by CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC. Cross-regional HIV transmission in MSM was common, inferred through phylogenetic analysis and the constructed transmission network, suggesting the existence of an interwoven complex network in which Hangzhou likely plays a central regional role in the intra-provincial spread of HIV. We also estimated a low prevalence of primary HIV DR among MSM in Zhejiang. The overall research results provided a comprehensive view of HIV-1 genetic characterization in MSM, which is conducive to a deeper understanding of HIV epidemiology and the implementation of evidence-based interventions among MSM in Zhejiang province.</p><p id="Par18">Although the major HIV-1 subtypes identified were still CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC in MSM, which is similar to findings from other reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, certain new CRFs and URFs have emerged, pointing to a continual increase in HIV genetic diversity. CRF55_01B was first identified in Chinese MSM in 2012<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and this subtype accounted for 9.2% (99/1072) of all subtyped sequences in a reported outbreak among MSM in Shenzhen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Moreover, a recent paper reported that 19 strains of CRF55_01B were identified from 975 MSM in 7 provinces, with prevalences ranging from 1.5% to 12.5%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Obviously, CRF55_01B has disseminated widely among MSM in China. It was not surprising that we identified 4 CRF55_01B strains with a prevalence of 1.3% in this cross-sectional study, and this result confirms that the national epidemic situation involves CRF55_01B. CRF68_01B was first identified in Anhui in 2013<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, followed by Jiangsu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and Shanghai<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. When the known sporadic cases of CRF68_01B were summarized, they appeared to be relatively concentrated in southeast China, particularly the Yangtze River Delta region, one of China&#x02019;s most prosperous regions, which implied that this subtype might originate there and would become widespread in the near future, similar to CRF55_01B. In addition to the newly designated CRFs, we identified 8 URFs, of which 4 were URF(CRF01_AE/B) and the remainder were URF(CRF01_AE /07_BC).

There is growing concern that URFs may be prone to formation in MSM due to the high-risk behavior features of this population, including multiple sex partners, low rates of condom use and anal intercourse.

Using HIV BLAST, we identified close-knit genetic relationships among the 8 URFs with other provinces in China, indicating that widespread existence of the formed URFs. Moreover, we found 3 epidemiologically unlinked sequences with similar mosaic patterns, which might be CRF candidates after analysis of full-length genome sequence. It is easy to foresee that URF recombinant events will continue to rise in frequency in the near future, necessitating the implementation of effective intervention strategies in Chinese MSM. It was intriguing that 61.5% (8/13) of patients infected with novel CRFs/URFs were married or divorced/widowed, implying bisexual behaviors. Although there were no statistically significant differences compared to patients infected with other strains (&#x003c7;2&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.957, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.085), further studies examining the relationship between bisexual behavior and higher infection risk for novel CRFs/URFs are warranted.</p><p id="Par19">We found that the vast majority of strains could be divided into CRF01_AE cluster 1, cluster 2 and the CRF07_BC cluster, which was comparable to findings from other report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.

The relatively higher level of nucleotide homogeneity in CRF07_BC suggests that it emerged later than CRF01_AE cluster 1 and cluster 2. Very recently, a study of phylogenetic dynamics among young MSM demonstrated that CRF07_BC drove a new wave of the HIV epidemic among Chinese MSM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, CRF07_BC strains formed a number of phylogenetic transmission clusters with high bootstrap values (&#x0003e;70%), hinting at the rapid transmission.

Further study is required to explore the underlying reasons driving the rapid spread of the CRF07_BC strain among MSM.</p><p id="Par20">Hangzhou, the capital and largest city of Zhejiang province, is the provincial center in terms of economy, culture, science, education and tourism. It is prosperous as a central city of the Yangtze River Delta Economic Region and is famous for its national history culture and world-renowned scenery travel. However, it accounted for the largest proportion (approximately 40%) of newly reported HIV/AIDS cases among MSM in Zhejiang province in 2013. Hangzhou not only reported the largest number of cases of HIV-infected MSM but also likely played a central role in the spread of HIV among MSM in Zhejiang province, as inferred from the phylogenetic analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and the transmission network (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) constructed in this study. It was intriguing that the majority of MSM strains from various prefectures demonstrated a close-knit genetic relationship with Hangzhou. Further analysis revealed that Hangzhou represented the dominant proportion, not only in terms of local transmission (72.0%) but also cross-regional HIV transmission (62.4%) based on the provincial transmission network (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), highlighting its remarkable role in the intra-provincial spread of HIV. Additionally, of the cases infected with novel CRFs/URFs or strains with SDRMs, nearly half resided in Hangzhou and were locally confirmed as HIV-positive. It was difficult to understand these dynamics upon their initial identification. However, we found clues by integrating a literature review and surveillance data on MSM behaviors (data not shown). Due to the large influence of traditional culture, homosexuality remains highly stigmatized and discriminated against in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Chinese MSM populations are inclined to hide their sexual identity and engage in sex behaviors in other regions rather than staying in their hometown, where they may be easily recognized by acquaintances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Most MSM concentrate into metropolises, where self-identity and sexual partners can easily be acquired<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Thus, a large social and sexual network has formed and expanded continually over time across the province or with a broader geographical scope, and within this network, HIV transmission occurs quietly and spreads. This study estimated that 75.8% of HIV transmission events were cross-regional, while only 24.2% of transmission events occurred locally, giving support to the inference described above. Based on this, we could infer that Hangzhou was likely the distribution center for HIV transmission among MSM during the early stage of the epidemic. The findings in this study are crucial for the development of targeted interventions for MSM in Hangzhou, which would be expected to exert an overall effect on the entire province.</p><p id="Par21">Our survey revealed an estimated prevalence rate of drug-resistant HIV-1 strains of 3.9% among ART-naive MSM in Zhejiang, representing a low level of TDR, and this was compatible with our previous reports in Zhejiang province<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, as well as the majority of reports in China concerning MSM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Previous studies reported that relatively high rates of DRMs among Chinese ART-naive MSM were associated with PIs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, which is included in second-line ART regimens and has limited usage in China. It was estimated that the majority of PI-DR strains were derived from foreign countries with prolonged ART history. However, RTI SDRMs (9 cases) were more numerous than PI SDRMs (5 cases) in this study, similar to a previous report from Kunming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. An annual ART report showed that 85.4% of cases used first-line ART regimens (2 NRITs&#x02009;+&#x02009;1 NNRTI), while only 14.6% used second-line regimens in Zhejiang province in 2013 (data unpublished). The mutations M46I, L90M, M184V, K101E G190A and Y181C, found in 8 cases (66.7%) in this study, were listed as the top five categorized DRMs in ART patients across the province. Given the 10-year implementation of HAART in Zhejiang, the higher prevalence of RTI mutations compared to PI mutations is likely attributable to the broader and longer use of first-line regimens. This indicates that DR strains were likely derived from domestic transmission, highlighting the importance of timely and effective intervention measures for TDR. However, we did not identify a predominant DRM, suggesting the presence of extensive sources for DR strains. Although it is unnecessary to make significant adjustments to current ART regimens, the prevalence of DR strains could compromise ART to a certain extent. Further studies are essential to trace the sources of DR strains and curb the epidemic.</p><p id="Par22">In conclusion, our study provides clues regarding the characteristics of the HIV-1 epidemic among MSM in Zhejiang province and also sheds light on the national epidemic. The results of this study are conducive to the design and implementation of evidence-based interventions. Further study is still needed to elucidate the sources of novel CRFs/URFs and strains with SDRMs as well as the temporal and spatial migration patterns of HIV among different populations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="Par23">This study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients involved in this study.

Ten out of eleven prefectures (except for Jiaxin) were covered in the study. The sample for the study was proportionally stratified to be representative according to case reports for each prefecture. The numbers of enrolled subjects were strictly proportional based on the reported cases in local regions as well as the fundamental demographic composition. The numbers of study subjects for each prefecture were as followed: Hangzhou (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;143), Ningbo (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;42), Wenzhou (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;49), Huzhou (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;12), Shaoxing (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;20), Jinhua (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;31), Quzhou (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;7), Zhoushan (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4), Taizhou (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;29) and Lishui (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3).
