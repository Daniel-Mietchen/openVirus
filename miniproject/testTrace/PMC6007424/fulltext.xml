Since 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that all PLHIV begin ART immediately [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Preventing transmission through treatment&#x02014;&#x0201c;treatment as prevention&#x0201d; (TasP)&#x02014;was an argument for expanding eligibility for ART to wider groups of patients and ultimately to all PLHIV. An intensive TasP intervention called &#x0201c;Test&#x00026;Treat&#x0201d; screens the population regularly for HIV and immediately starts all patients who test positive on ART. In 2014, UNAIDS launched its global &#x0201c;90-90-90&#x0201d; target, with the goal of substantially reducing transmission. The benefits of TasP and Test&#x00026;Treat have been widely discussed, but the evidence is not conclusive. Some studies have suggested that successful Test&#x00026;Treat programs could eradicate the epidemic, but others predict only minor benefit on the population level [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref>].</p><p>Treatment failures, poor adherence, and frequent dropout from care impair the effect of TasP [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref>]. Viral load monitoring and tracing patients lost to follow-up (LTFU) can support viral suppression in treated patients. The WHO has recommended routine VL monitoring as its preferred monitoring strategy since 2013. For several years, VL monitoring in sub-Saharan Africa was available only in South Africa and Botswana, and a few research sites. New testing technologies have made routine VL monitoring easier, but coverage remains limited [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Patients LTFU are frequently traced in sub-Saharan Africa through phone calls or home visits to those who do not return to pick up their antiretrovirals [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>We have developed mathematical models to test the effect of VL monitoring [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and tracing patients LTFU [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] on reducing potential transmission of HIV. We found that these interventions could prevent patients on ART from transmitting the infection, but our analyses only evaluated a patient&#x02019;s potential for transmitting the virus. The future course of the HIV epidemic depends on other important factors, such as transmission from untreated patients, behavioral preferences, and contact patterns. In this study, we took the next step and developed a transmission model to assess the potential effect of VL monitoring and tracing on the HIV epidemic.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s5"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s6"><title>Setting</title><p>We modeled the HIV epidemic of Malawi. In 2016, the estimated adult HIV prevalence in Malawi was 9.2%, and about 680 000 patients (65% of all PLHIV) were on ART [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Until recently, Malawi relied on clinical monitoring and occasional CD4 counts to monitor treatment response, but since 2011, the Ministry of Health has recommended monitoring VL at regular 24-month intervals [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In 2016, 19% of all patients on ART in Malawi had had at least 1 VL test. Several sites trace patients who miss appointments [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Mathematical Model</title><p>The model consists of an individual-based simulation of disease progression and a deterministic transmission model.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Disease Progression Simulation</title><p>We used the R package <italic>gems</italic> to develop an individual-based simulation model for disease progression in patients who have started ART (&#x0201c;treatment model&#x0201d;) [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We divided the patient&#x02019;s time on ART into 32 states (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) that accounted for virological and immunological treatment response (successful or failing), ART regimen (first- or second-line), and retention (on or off ART). We did not consider further treatment options beyond second-line. We separated HIV-related and HIV-unrelated mortality. We limited the number of off-ART episodes to 1 to simplify the structure. Patients were simulated for 10 years after initiating ART. Virological and immunological treatment response was based on previous analyses of routine data from sites in South Africa with 6-monthly VL and CD4 monitoring (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The risk of virological failure corresponds to a cumulative risk of 5.7% 1 year and 12.9% 5 years after ART initiation. One year after ART initiation, the sensitivity of immunological criteria was 7% and specificity 12%; 5 years after ART initiation, the sensitivity and specificity were 26% and 45%, respectively. A resistance penalty factor was applied to increase the risk of failure depending on how long the patient had spent on a failing regimen or off ART. Parameters related to treatment interruptions and return to care with or without tracing were derived from data from Lighthouse and Martin Preuss Centre clinics in Lilongwe, Malawi [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Patients switched to second-line ART after either virological or immunological treatment failure, depending on the monitoring strategy.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the mathematical model.

For each simulated patient, we sampled the VL values for different stages (virologically successful, failing, or off ART). We then calculated the mean log10 viral load over time in each strategy to inform the transmission model [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We ran the model for the following nine strategies:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>i. no VL monitoring, no tracing;</p></list-item><list-item><p>ii. no VL monitoring, active tracing;</p></list-item><list-item><p>iii. no VL monitoring, uninterrupted treatment;</p></list-item><list-item><p>iv.

VL monitoring at 12-month intervals, uninterrupted treatment.</p></list-item></list><p>&#x0201c;No VL monitoring&#x0201d; means that treatment failure is again determined by clinical symptoms and CD4 counts only. The WHO recommends VL monitoring at 12-month intervals, but VL monitoring at 24-month intervals is current practice in Malawi. Treatment failure is confirmed 3 months after detection, and the patient is switched to second-line therapy after a random delay. In strategies with no tracing, patients LTFU may only return spontaneously. With active tracing, all patients LTFU are traced 3 weeks after missing their appointment and return to care at a higher rate than without tracing [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Strategies with uninterrupted treatment represent the ideal but unrealistic scenario that treatment is never interrupted. This scenario sets the theoretical limit for improving retention. In all scenarios, we assumed that patients retained in care adhered to treatment, as in the data that were used for parameterization [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Transmission Model</title><p>We developed a deterministic transmission model (&#x0201c;transmission model&#x0201d;) to represent the HIV epidemic in Malawi between 1975 and 2050. The model consists of 40 compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) representing HIV status (susceptible; primary, asymptomatic chronic, or symptomatic chronic infection; ART; AIDS), age (children &#x0003c;15 years, adults 15&#x02013;49 years, adults &#x02265;50 years), sex (not distinguished for children), and risk behavior (high or low, except for children, older adults, and AIDS patients). &#x0201c;Acute infection&#x0201d; represents early HIV infection, when the risk of onward transmission is highest [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. During &#x0201c;asymptomatic chronic infection,&#x0201d; CD4 cell counts are expected to be &#x0003e;350 cells/&#x003bc;L. In &#x0201c;symptomatic chronic infection,&#x0201d; CD4 cell count is below 350 cells/&#x003bc;L and the patient is in WHO clinical stage &#x02265;2. Although there is no strict dependency between symptoms and clinical stage, these definitions roughly correlate [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. &#x0201c;ART&#x0201d; represents patients who ever started ART, including also patients who interrupted ART. &#x0201c;AIDS&#x0201d; represents the last year of untreated HIV, where the patient has a CD4 cell count below 200 cells/&#x003bc;L or severe AIDS-defining opportunistic infections.</p><p>The model is solved numerically. We calculated infectiousness from the estimated per-act transmission probability and assumed frequency of unprotected sex acts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Infectiousness was multiplied by 20 during the acute stage, and by a factor that depended on the monitoring and retention strategy during ART. This factor was estimated for each scenario from the treatment model. We also allowed infectiousness to decrease over time. The progression of patients across the stages of HIV was estimated from the literature.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Prior

The most important factors associated with the speed of decrease were the rates of ART initiation and treatment interruptions. VL monitoring and tracing lost patients reduced new infections, but only minimally. Interventions designed to keep patients in care without interruptions could be much more beneficial.</p><p>The results of VL monitoring were expected. In an earlier study, we predicted that routine VL monitoring could prevent up to one-third of transmissions from treated patients [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. But the proportion of new infections attributable to patients on ART is low, so it is unsurprising that the overall effect of VL monitoring was small. Our results are in line with other modeling studies. For example, in 2014, Braithwaite et al. noted that VL monitoring was more cost-effective if its effect on transmission was considered, but extending ART eligibility, as the WHO recommended, had much more impact [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Some potential advantages we did not include in our model could also increase the benefit of VL monitoring. Patients whose ART is failing despite good adherence may believe they are not infectious, and thus be likely to engage in unprotected sex [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Patients on failing ART may also carry resistant strains of HIV. Their spread could limit the potency of available firstline regimens, increasing long-term mortality [<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Loss to follow-up remains a major problem in sub-Saharan Africa. Although much LTFU can be explained by undocumented deaths and transfers between facilities, about one-third of lost patients have probably stopped treatment or are taking ART irregularly [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. There is a broad range of reasons contributing to interrupting treatment [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Especially during the introduction of the Option B+, there were also concerns about retention rates among women who start ART in the asymptomatic stage. Experience from this program has, however, shown that long-term retention is feasible even among patients who start ART in an early stage of the infection [<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In a prior study, we found that tracing lost patients did not substantially reduce expected transmission from patients who had started ART [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This study confirmed our finding. Tracing rarely locates patients who have moved or are traveling, or who provided an incorrect address or phone number. Many patients refuse to return to care, or interrupt treatment again later [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. If treatment interruptions could be eliminated, the overall number of new infections would drop by 5% in the next few years, but perfect retention is unrealistic. Retention may be increased by further decentralizing treatment services, providing larger supplies of ART per visit, or SMS reminders [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38&#x02013;40</xref>].</p><p>A recent survey found that, in Malawi, 89% of diagnosed PLHIV were on ART, but only 73% of all PLHIV had been diagnosed. Moreover, 91% of patients tested for VL in Malawi were virally suppressed [<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our results suggest that continuing screening to find more PLHIV in Malawi is the most effective strategy for meeting the ambitious 90-90-90 target. Our model predicted that, by 2020, in all scenarios, at least 90% of all PLHIV would be on ART. We may slightly overestimate the number of PLHIV on ART, as our estimate includes patients who have interrupted ART. But it is clear the 90-90-90 target can realistically be met in Malawi.</p><p>Cost-effectiveness calculations of VL monitoring and tracing patients LTFU should account for benefits to both individuals and the population. If VL test costs could be suppressed to $10 [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], testing each patient annually would cost about $6 million. This would prevent only about 100 new infections each year, thus costing about $60 000 to preventing a single infection. This is clearly more expensive than treating the infected patient for life. Annual VL testing may, however, also benefit the patient and reduce transmitted drug resistance. A more complete perspective is needed to assess cost-effectiveness.</p><sec id="s14"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>We used a structurally simple, deterministic compartmental transmission model to produce results that closely match the data and projections returned by other established mathematical models. Our transmission model was informed by an individual-based simulation of the progression of HIV under ART, parameterized with routine cohort data. We expect that our results are generalizable to many Southern and Eastern African countries with similar epidemics and relatively high ART coverage [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We also expect that the relative decrease in new infections with VL monitoring or tracing will be similar in other countries in this region. Our approach of linking a detailed simulation of disease progression to a relatively simple deterministic transmission model can also be adapted to other settings and questions.</p><p>Our study also had several limitations. The data we used to parameterize the model covered only a few years of follow-up and may thus not be accurate for long-term projections. We also did not consider other future changes in care, such as new antiretroviral regimens. New regimens may lead to substantially lower failure rates. If third-line ART becomes widely available in the future, it will likely further reduce the number of new infections, influencing also the relative benefit of the monitoring and retention interventions. Apart from a resistance penalty factor, first- and second-line failures were sampled independently, ignoring the possible individual factors that may result in failure through, for example, poor adherence. Several parameters had to be estimated using assumptions and calibration. We aimed to keep the transmission model as simple as possible and did not divide patients according to VL strata during treatment. Instead, we calculated average infectiousness for each stage of the disease, so our model may not be able to catch variation in infectiousness over time. We included only heterosexual transmission. Finally, we did not account for geographical variability, which can play a major role in the dynamics of the epidemic: district-level HIV prevalence in Malawi ranges from 3% in some northern districts to over 18% in the south.</p><p>There were also discrepancies between our and UNAIDS&#x02019; modeling estimates. In particular, our model estimated the annual new infections higher than UNAIDS. This resulted also in a slightly differing pattern in the total number of PLHIV. We predicted a moderate decrease since 2000, whereas UNAIDS suggests that the number remained stable or even increased slightly. However, the UNAIDS estimates are also based on models built on a limited amount of data. Our model&#x02019;s projections on number of patients on ART matched closely with the reported data. However, our estimate also includes patients who have stopped ART.</p></sec><sec id="s15"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Malawi&#x02019;s response to the HIV epidemic has been successful, and we expect the number of new infections to continue to fall, regardless of the strategies of ART initiation, monitoring, and retention support. To reach the 90-90-90 goal, scaling-up ART and preventing treatment interruptions must be a priority. Though only a small number of infections can be prevented by viral load monitoring and tracing patients lost to follow-up, the population-level effects of these interventions should be included in future cost-effectiveness evaluations.</p><p>The substantial heterogeneity in the Malawian HIV epidemic across regions and population groups may require interventions targeted to specific groups or regions to increase treatment efficiency and acceptability. Test&#x00026;Treat reduces transmission of HIV, despite individual cases of treatment failure and ART interruption, but the full benefits of the treatment as a prevention strategy cannot be reaped unless ART is improved with interventions that support retention and viral suppression.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s16"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>Supplementary materials are available at <italic>Open Forum Infectious Diseases</italic> online.
