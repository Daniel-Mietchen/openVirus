Using optogenetic stimulation, we show that activation of POMC neurons rapidly inhibits feeding behavior in fasted animals. However, simultaneous stimulation of both POMC neurons and a subset of the orexigenic neurons that express AgRP is sufficient to reverse that inhibition and trigger intense feeding behavior. We used 3D imaging and functional studies to illuminate the anatomical underpinning of both the inhibitory and excitatory events. Our work suggests that translational applications that aim to control appetite need to target the activation rather than the inhibition mechanisms.</p></abstract><abstract><p>Two classes of peptide-producing neurons in the arcuate nucleus (Arc) of the hypothalamus are known to exert opposing actions on feeding: the anorexigenic neurons that express proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and the orexigenic neurons that express agouti-related protein (AgRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY). These neurons are thought to arise from a common embryonic progenitor, but our anatomical and functional understanding of the interplay of these two peptidergic systems that contribute to the control of feeding remains incomplete.

Feeding is essential for survival and relies on mechanisms that monitor energy demands and metabolic status. But feeding behavior is more complex, as it has a strong rewarding component (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and can respond to environmental stimuli, including stress and social context (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Therefore, it is critical to unravel the mechanisms that modulate both the initiation and the cessation of feeding.</p><p>It is well established that the hypothalamus plays an essential role in the regulation of feeding behavior and contributes to the process of energy homeostasis (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Hypothalamic nuclei engaged in this regulation include the Arc, the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), the lateral hypothalamic (LH) area, the dorsomedial nucleus, and the ventromedial nucleus. Disruption of the ventromedial hypothalamus induces hyperphagia and obesity, while disruption of the lateral hypothalamus causes hypophagia and weight loss, suggesting the existence of ventromedial &#x0201c;satiety&#x0201d; and lateral &#x0201c;feeding&#x0201d; centers (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Recent work has extended these early observations and has focused on the Arc of the hypothalamus, a nucleus particularly important for the central regulation of appetite, energy expenditure, and body weight (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Two classes of peptide-producing neuronal populations in the Arc play a central and antagonistic role in the control of appetite&#x02014;the orexigenic neurons that express AgRP and NPY promote food consumption, while anorexigenic neurons that express POMC inhibit feeding behavior. AgRP/NPY neurons are active when the energy stores are not sufficient to meet systemic demands, thereby releasing AgRP and promoting feeding (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). POMC is a complex polypeptide precursor cleaved into active peptides including melanocortins and &#x003b2;-endorphin (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). While &#x003b2;-endorphin is a long-acting opioid analgesic (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), the cosynthesized &#x003b1;-melanocyte stimulating hormone (&#x003b1;-MSH) blocks appetite (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). These two sets of peptidergic neurons in the Arc respond to nutrient and hormonal signals from the periphery. Thus, leptin, a signal of positive energy balance, stimulates POMC neurons, leading to decreased food intake while inhibiting the release of the orexigenic peptides from neighboring AgRP/NPY neurons (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Together, AgRP/NPY neurons and POMC neurons work coordinately to integrate signals of energy homeostasis and to regulate feeding behavior (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Evidence suggests that these two peptidergic systems that control feeding emerge from a common cellular origin. A developmental study has demonstrated that embryonic POMC-expressing progenitors not only give rise to adult POMC cells, but also differentiate into non-POMC neurons, including NPY neurons (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). This means transgenic studies that target POMC cells in early development can capture both adult populations, whereas adult delivery of viral vectors can target POMC cells selectively. Consequently, we used optogenetic stimulation relying on both virally mediated and traditional transgenic approaches to deliver blue light-activated channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) to POMC neurons in the Arc. We coupled this stimulation with behavioral assessments and anatomical analyses examining the extent of activation and its consequences on cFos expression throughout the brain. Thus, we selectively activated neurons derived from POMC-expressing progenitors in the Arc and ascertained the net impact on food intake in adult mice. We contrasted the effect of activating only the POMC neurons versus the impact of activating both POMC and AgRP/NPY neurons simultaneously on food consumption in mice. Our findings indicate that selective activation of Arc POMC neurons inhibits food consumption rapidly in fasted animals whereas activation of Arc neurons arising from POMC-expressing progenitors results in a robust increase in food intake. We show that in the conflict between the drive to consume food and the rapid satiety control that inhibits feeding, the former dominates, resulting in an acute increase in feeding. These opposing effects are associated with distinct projection and activation patterns. Thus, the regulation of feeding behavior involves a dynamic balance between the two peptidergic systems.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="s1"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2"><title>Characterization of Viral POMC-ChR2 Mice.</title><p>To control hypothalamic POMC neurons selectively, we used a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector carrying the gene encoding the blue light-activated cation channel ChR2 fused to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP). This Cre-inducible double-floxed inverted ORF (DIO) AAV viral vector AAV5-EF1&#x003b1;-DIO-ChR2(H134R)-eYFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>) was microinjected into the Arc of adult POMC-Cre transgenic mice (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Upon transduction, Cre-expressing POMC neurons invert the ChR2-eYFP ORF in irreversible means and ChR2-eYFP proteins are expressed under control of the elongation factor 1&#x003b1; promoter (referred to as viral POMC-ChR2). This approach allowed us to selectively stimulate Arc POMC neurons with blue light (473 nm). We validated the cell-type selectivity of this viral approach in coronal Arc sections of viral POMC-ChR2 mice. ChR2-eYFP specifically colocalized with endogenous POMC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). On average, 80% of POMC-positive neurons were positive for ChR2-eYFP in the virus injection sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). Of the ChR2-eYFP expressing cells, 93% were colocalized by POMC immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>), demonstrating high specificity of ChR2 expression in the POMC neurons of the Arc of the viral POMC-ChR2 mice. To confirm the functional impact of ChR2 activation in the viral POMC-ChR2 mice, the Arc was illuminated with blue light while the animal explored an open field chamber. Expression of the neuronal activity marker, immediate early gene cFos, was evaluated in the Arc of the viral POMC-ChR2 mice with or without optic stimulation.

In this study, both viral POMC-ChR2 and Tg POMC-ChR2 mice showed an analgesic effect induced by light stimulation, demonstrating functional activation of POMC neurons in these two animal models. Selective stimulation of POMC neurons in viral POMC-ChR2 mice led to decreased food intake, consistent with the observation that the hypothalamic melanocortin pathway is involved in feeding behavior (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). This acute inhibition of feeding in fasted viral POMC-ChR2 mice is also consistent with pharmacological studies (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Thus, an &#x003b1;-MSH agonist has a potent inhibitory effect on deprivation-induced food intake within 1 or 2 h (<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) when administrated in the PVN, a site that receives projections from Arc POMC neurons and where MC4-R expression is very high. However, our finding is in partial contrast with previous studies using optogenetic (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) or chemogenetic (<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) activation of POMC neurons. While these studies demonstrate reduced food consumption, they report that the effect is not evident until 24 h of stimulation in ad libitum-fed mice (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). One possibility for this discrepancy is that we used a different light-stimulation pattern in our study. Another difference is that our mice were fasted for 4 h, which may contribute to the more immediate effects of stimulation on feeding behavior. Our results suggest that Arc POMC neurons exert faster regulation of satiety in food-motivated mice. This finding is supported by a recent report that at least some Arc POMC neurons may act on faster time scales to reduce the drive to seek food (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The combination of these pharmacological and opto- or chemogenetic studies would lead to a more complex view of the role of POMC in food regulation, whereby it would exert a long-term modulatory role based on metabolic status in the freely feeding animals, but is also active on shorter time scales during times when the animal is motivated to eat and the monitoring of food intake by these appetitive circuits is more critical. This does not preclude other mechanisms that recruit POMC to induce eating cessation (<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice, activation of Arc neurons derived from POMC-expressing progenitors evoked voracious feeding. We have demonstrated that in these animals, ChR2 is expressed in both POMC- and AgRP-positive neurons, and these two groups of neurons are simultaneously activated as determined by cFos protein induction. The POMC neurons in the Arc were also functionally activated as evidenced by the pain regulation experiment in this animal model. The increased food intake in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice demonstrates that activation of this subset group of orexigenic neurons derived from POMC-expressing progenitors overrides the anorexigenic effect contributed by POMC neuron activation. It is well established that POMC and AgRP/NPY neurons in the Arc exert opposing actions on feeding to maintain energy homeostasis in the body (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Genetic and pharmacological evidence suggests that AgRP/NPY neurons promote feeding and increase body weight (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Opto- or chemogenetic stimulation of AgRP neurons promotes intense food consumption (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The opposing effects on food consumption following optogenetic activation in the transgenic and the viral models and their differences in potency stand in sharp contrast to the effects on analgesia. Thus, optogenetic stimulation in both the viral and the transgenic models produced comparable analgesic potency. This is likely because, in both cases, the analgesia is elicited from the activation of POMC neurons only, whereas the food regulation is the result of the relative power of POMC versus AgRP/NPY neurons. Taken together, our finding of increased food intake in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice suggests that mechanisms that increase satiety may not be as effective under conditions that enhance the inhibition of food consumption and oppose AgRP.</p><p>The increased food intake in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice can be largely blocked by pretreatment with the nonselective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, suggesting involvement of the opioid receptor-signaling system. Other neural systems may also contribute to this increased food intake because naloxone did not completely block the increased food intake. Opioids are a family of peptides that differentially interact with three receptor classes (<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Anatomical studies have demonstrated that opioid receptors and peptides are widely distributed throughout the brain (<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), including in a number of hypothalamic nuclei. Given the wide distribution of opioid receptors and the presence of other neuropeptides in the vicinity of opioidergic pathways, opioids are in position to affect many aspects of feeding and energy homeostasis (<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Pharmacological studies have indicated that opioids stimulate food intake, whereas opioid antagonists are inhibitory (<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). It should be noted that this increased food intake in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice may not be solely due to the release of endogenous &#x003b2;-endorphin. Selective activation of POMC neurons in unsated viral POMC-ChR2 mice induced a reduction of food intake despite the possibility that endogenous &#x003b2;-endorphin was likely released as evidenced by an analgesic effect during the hot-plate test.</p><p>We then investigated the possible neural mechanisms whereby activation of Arc neurons derived from POMC-expressing progenitors led to increased food intake while selective activation of POMC neurons resulted in decreased food intake using cFos mRNA as a marker. Selective activation of POMC neurons in viral POMC-ChR2 mice led to neural activation in limited brain regions that are typically thought of as regulating food intake (<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), including cerebral cortex, lateral septum, PVN, dorsomedial hypothalamus, and Arc. Classic lesion studies in PVN, dorsomedial, or ventromedial hypothalamus induced hyperphagia and obesity, while electrical stimulation increased food intake (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In addition, we found increased neural activity in cerebral cortex and lateral septum following stimulation of Arc POMC neurons, indicating their possible involvement in regulating food intake.</p><p>In contrast, activation of the Arc in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice resulted in an intensive cFos response in broader areas of the brain thought to modulate feeding behavior (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), including cerebral cortex, PFC, NAcc, septum, PVN, LH, and dorsomedial hypothalamus. More importantly, the neuronal activity in cerebral cortex, PFC, CPu, NAcc, septum, and PVN was normalized by pretreatment with naloxone, while the neuronal activity of the LH was reduced by 52% with the same pretreatment. Several of these responsive regions, such as the PFC, the NAcc, and the LH, have connections with reward systems and motivated behavior that modulate feeding (<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). For example, activation of dopamine D1 receptor-expressing neurons in the PFC increases food intake (<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). The NAcc functions as a major projection area for food reward and motivation in the mesolimbic dopaminergic system (<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). The LH is known to be a critical neuroanatomical substrate for motivated feeding behavior in corticostriatal&#x02013;hypothalamic circuitry (<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Thus, the activation of the subset of orexigenic neurons derived from POMC-expressing progenitors in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice may influence the rewarding characteristics of food and/or the motivational component of feeding.</p><p>We also investigated the architecture of neural circuits specifically originating from Arc peptidergic neurons on a brain-wide scale in these two animal models via 3D visualization. In the viral POMC-ChR2 mice, CLARITY processing showed that Arc POMC neurons project to a number of brain regions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1802237115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table S1</ext-link>), consistent with previous anatomical studies (<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Our detailed mapping of Arc POMC neuronal connectivity points to functional studies on the roles and circuit mechanisms underlying the regulation of feeding in these areas. The apparent diffuse projections of Arc POMC terminals observed suggest that POMC participates in the regulation of food consumption not only through hypothalamic structures, but also extrahypothalamic nuclei, including the amygdala, zona incerta, and lateral septum. More specifically, the amygdala is of interest as it is an area implicated in emotional aspects of feeding behavior. Recent studies have also shown that activation of zona incerta GABAergic neurons results in rapid binge-like eating behavior (<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), while inactivation of lateral septum neurons blunts ventral hippocampus-induced suppression of feeding (<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). However, it is still not fully understood how the inputs from Arc POMC neurons affect the neuronal physiology in these brain regions or their potential regulation of feeding behavior. In contrast to the viral POMC-ChR2 mice, a seemingly greater intensity of hypothalamic eYFP signal in the Tg POMC-ChR2 mice necessitated diminishing the comparatively less intense extrahypothalamic projections through the image threshold function. Nevertheless, the 3D visualization of neuronal projections in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice highlights the extensive neuronal communication between the Arc and lateral hypothalamic nucleus which is at the center of feeding control.</p><p>In sum, the POMC-expressing progenitors in the Arc differentiate into two functionally distinct neuronal subpopulations to influence feeding behavior in adulthood. Furthermore, the differences in food intake are associated with distinct projection and activation patterns of Arc neurons derived from POMC-expressing lineages compared with adult hypothalamic POMC neurons. Translational applications that aim to control appetite likely need to target the activation rather than the inhibition mechanisms and to modulate either the AgRP system itself or its downstream mediators. The fact that increased food intake in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice can be blunted by the opioid antagonist naloxone coupled with the normalization of neuronal activity in brain regions involved in reward and motivation highlights the potential value of targeting opioid receptor signaling to control feeding behavior.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s10"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s11"><title>Animals.</title><p>POMC-Cre and Rosa26-CAG-stop<sup>flox</sup>-ChR2(H134R)-eYFP (Ai32) mice were generated as previously described (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).
