SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 is novel and the effect on typically prevalent seasonal viruses is just becoming apparent. We present our initial data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the month of March&#x000a0;2020.&#x000a0;This is a retrospective cohort study post launching of SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 testing at Baylor Scott and White Hospital (BSWH), Temple, Texas. Testing for SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 was performed by real&#x02010;time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction&#x000a0;assay and results were shared with State public health officials for immediate interventions.&#x000a0;More than 3500 tests were performed during the first 2 weeks of testing for SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 and identified 168 (4.7%) positive patients. Sixty&#x02010;two (3.2%) of the 1912 ambulatory patients and 106 (6.3%) of the 1659 emergency department/inpatients tested were positive. The highest rate of infection (6.9%) was seen in patients aged 25 to 34 years, while the lowest rate of infection was seen among patients aged &#x0003c;25 years old (2%). County&#x02010;specific patient demographic information was shared with respective public health departments for epidemiological interventions.&#x000a0;Incidentally, this study showed that there was a significant decrease in the occurrence of seasonal respiratory virus infections, perhaps due to increased epidemiological awareness about SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 among the general public, as well as the social distancing measures implemented in response to SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2. Data extracted for BSWH from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System&#x000a0;site revealed that Influenza incidence was 8.7% in March 2020, compared with&#x000a0;25% in March 2019.&#x000a0;This study was intended to provide an initial experience of dealing with a pandemic and the role of laboratories in crisis management. This study provided SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 testing data from ambulatory and inpatient population. Epidemiological interventions depend on timely availability of accurate diagnostic tests and throughput capacity of such systems during large outbreaks like SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd id="jmv26010-kwd-0001">COVID&#x02010;19</kwd><kwd id="jmv26010-kwd-0002">diagnosis</kwd><kwd id="jmv26010-kwd-0003">epidemiology</kwd><kwd id="jmv26010-kwd-0004">rRT&#x02010;PCR</kwd><kwd id="jmv26010-kwd-0005">SARS&#x02010;COV&#x02010;2</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="4243"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>edited-state</meta-name><meta-value>corrected-proof</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:5.8.3 mode:remove_FC converted:05.06.2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><p content-type="self-citation">

By 7th January&#x000a0;2020, Chinese scientists had isolated a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2; previously known as 2019&#x02010;nCoV), from these patients with virus&#x02010;infected pneumonia.<xref rid="jmv26010-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref> Cases have now spread to 190 countries. As of 23rd March&#x000a0;2020 there were more than 372&#x02009;000+&#x000a0;confirmed cases and 16&#x02009;000+&#x000a0;deaths.<xref rid="jmv26010-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">

</xref> Although the outbreak is likely to have started from a zoonotic transmission event associated with a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals, it soon became clear that efficient person&#x02010;to&#x02010;person transmission was occurring.<xref rid="jmv26010-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref> The clinical spectrum of SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 infection appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory tract illness, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death, with many patients being hospitalized with pneumonia.<xref rid="jmv26010-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">

</xref> A global pandemic has erupted due to a high proportion of asymptomatic patients coupled with a high degree of viral shedding, long incubation period, and late clinical manifestations. Prolific testing coupled with case isolation and contact tracing, therefore, remains one of the most effective epidemiological interventions to stop early community spread. Unfortunately, the novelty of SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 meant that no testing was immediately available, making it difficult for public health officials to get ahead of the pandemic curve.</p><p>As State public health laboratories became backlogged, Baylor Scott and White Health (BSWH), a large, not&#x02010;for&#x02010;profit integrated healthcare delivery system in north and central Texas, collaborated with the Luminex Corporation (Austin, TX) to implement a SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 real&#x02010;time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT&#x02010;PCR) assay using the genetic primers previously used in China to help relieve the bottleneck. The BSWH laboratory was one of the first laboratories in Texas to implement SARS&#x02010;Co&#x02010;V2 testing to assist state public health officials in their efforts to isolate patients and track their immediate contacts. As the pandemic continues to spread across the nation, goal of this study was to share the early clinical trends for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#x02010;19) in north and central regions of Texas, to encourage other laboratories to consider early implementation of testing during future pandemics. This study also reports the possible impact of SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 on other seasonal respiratory viruses in this region, the spread of which may have been affected by epidemiological interventions introduced in response to SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="jmv26010-sec-0020"><label>2</label><title>METHODS</title><sec id="jmv26010-sec-0030"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design, setting, and participants</title><p>This retrospective cohort study included all adult patients (age &#x0003e;18 years) tested for SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 collected through BSWH testing sites from 11th March&#x000a0;2020&#x000a0;to&#x000a0;23rd March&#x000a0;2020. BSWH is a large, not&#x02010;for&#x02010;profit integrated health care delivery system, with 52 hospitals and more than 1000 care sites, serving patients in 47 counties in north and central Texas. All SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 tests included in this study were performed at the molecular pathology laboratory located within BSWH, Temple.</p><p>All ambulatory care patients were prescreened according to World Health Organization and BSWH guidelines to be eligible for SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 testing via the BSWH web portal, phone app and/or through an e&#x02010;visit before making an appointment for specimen collection at one of the several designated BSWH locations. Patients were asked about current symptoms, such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath, as well as travel and other exposure history. When clinically indicated, SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 testing was ordered by the attending physician or other care providers.</p><p>No prescreening was done for emergency department (ED)/inpatients. In these settings, a nasopharyngeal swab was collected for SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 testing from all patients showing signs and symptoms of SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 infection.</p><p>As BSWH laboratory continues testing, this study included data from the day testing began on 11th March&#x000a0;2020&#x000a0;to 23rd March&#x000a0;2020. These two hospital systems within BSWH represent central and north Texas population and are limited to these regions of Texas due to community outreach.

</xref> Briefly, all BSWH nasopharyngeal specimens were collected either at drive through collection sites or from inpatients using a flocked swab in Universal or Transport Media (Copan Technologies). Specimens were transported at 2 to 8&#x02009;&#x000b0;C to the BSWH&#x02010;Temple molecular pathology laboratory for processing and testing with less than 3&#x02009;hours of transit time. The BSWH&#x02010;Temple molecular pathology laboratory was responsible for SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 detection in respiratory specimens by rRT&#x02010;PCR methods (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX).</p><p>The <italic>SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2</italic> primers were designed by Luminex to detect RNA targets from the SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 in respiratory specimens from patients, as recommended for testing by public health authority guidelines. Luminex Aries employs primers for amplifying the <italic>ORF1</italic> gene and the <italic>N</italic> gene from the SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 virus, and the assay includes extraction and internal controls (Human RNAase P) built into the same cartridge, to verify sample lysis, nucleic acid extraction, and proper system and reagent performance. Luminex Aries offers true random&#x02010;access testing, unlike the Luminex NxTAG platform, an assay for batched testing (offering high throughput capabilities) on which increased demand for testing necessitated validation. The Luminex NxTAG method also includes an additional <italic>Envelope (E)</italic> gene target for SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 detection.</p></sec><sec id="jmv26010-sec-0070"><label>2.3.2</label><title>Other respiratory virus testing</title><p>BSWH&#x02010;Temple utilizes a respiratory virus syndromic panel, also from Luminex and run on the NxTAG platform, to diagnose upper respiratory infections.<xref rid="jmv26010-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">

Real&#x02010;time rRT&#x02010;PCR is already widely deployed in diagnostic virology laboratories; our experience demonstrates that institutions with molecular testing capabilities should consider proactively reaching out to manufacturers to improve testing capabilities and turn&#x02010;around time should a similar situation recur. In the race against this pandemic, real&#x02010;time data empower epidemiologists and public health officials to identify, track, and contain spread as much as possible. Integrating laboratory&#x02010;based reporting with epidemiologic surveillance registers will only improve public health outcomes.</p><p>The intent of this study was not to assess the performance characteristics of the rRT&#x02010;PCR assay for the detection of SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 infection. Accurate determination of test performance characteristics will require appropriate distribution of cohorts among the general population. This is specifically true in the context of virus shedding, transmission dynamics, asymptomatic carriers, and specimen requirements that are still being debated and investigated. SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 has exhibited a great degree of plasticity in all of the above properties; hence it may take additional time and understanding to determine the performance characteristics of the assay.</p><p>The evidence available from the literature at the initiation of the public health emergency was sparse for US healthcare systems. The only country with published data and epidemiological or management studies was China.<xref rid="jmv26010-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref> However, the structure of both the political and the health care system in China is very different from the United States, where healthcare is regional and private for most part, and much of the public health authority is decentralized and vested in state and local governments. While these structures create challenges for the coordinated, authoritarian type of response China implemented to control and mitigate its. SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 outbreak, the substantial autonomy they provide creates opportunities to try to improve and optimize diagnosis, management and partnership with public health officials. In this context, BSWH ramped up efforts in laboratory diagnosis and collegial collaboration with public health officials to support effective epidemiological interventions.</p><p>Because SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 infection symptoms range from nonspecific mild respiratory symptoms to acute respiratory distress,<xref rid="jmv26010-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">

In the case of a public health emergency, proficient diagnostic laboratories can rely on this robust technology and infrastructure to establish new diagnostic tests within their routine services before pre&#x02010;formulated assays become available. In addition to information on reagents, oligonucleotides, and positive controls, laboratories working under quality control programs need to rely on documentation of technical qualification of the assay formulation as well as data from external clinical evaluation tests.<xref rid="jmv26010-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">

This early adoption of rRT&#x02010;PCR assay led to improved turnaround times of SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 test results, reduced testing burden on public health laboratories, and won praise from the local public health officials for efficient communication of test results for appropriate interventions.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 testing from Texas,&#x000a0;and the first report of a private laboratory's experience with early implementation of SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 testing in the context of relieving botttlenecks related to testing shortages and delays at the national level. While we hope never to find ourselves again in the situation of a rapidly spreading pandemic and inadequate testing resources and supplies within the traditional public health infrastructure, the reality is that COVID&#x02010;19 may not be an isolated occurrence. Our results show the capabilities of private laboratories, partnering with both industry and public health stakeholders, to provide alternative mechanisms to support the early adoption of testing so necessary for effective management and control measures in a pandemic situation.</p><p>Our results also provide limited insights into the clinical manifestations of patients with COVID&#x02010;19 who either presented to an ED or were admitted to a BSWH hospital for further evaluation. Major symptoms included were fever and cough, with more than 75% of the patients reporting these symptoms. Khuwara et al<xref rid="jmv26010-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">

<sup>12</sup>
</xref> It is likely, however, that the lack of co&#x02010;infections in our data is attributable to the limited concurrent test ordering for other respiratory viruses in an ambulatory setting. A general impression of the prohibitive cost of respiratory syndromic panels among our providers may have led to the limited ordering in outpatient settings.</p><p>SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 has spread rapidly around the world, posing enormous health, economic, and social challenges to societies.

</p><p>The non&#x02010;pharmaceutical measures may have additional impacts on public health. For example, our data indicated significantly lower incidence of other respiratory viruses, such as influenza viruses typically circulating during this time of the year. This observation may be merely coincidental, however, we suspect that the general epidemiological measures, such as social distancing, and cancellation of large gatherings, as well as large portions of the general population being extra&#x02010;careful about practices, such as handwashing or avoiding handshakes to prevent SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 infection may have led to the decrease in influenza cases compared last year. However, our results regarding influenza are not intended to, nor should they be interpreted as, conclusive on this point, especially while data for 2019 to&#x000a0;2020 flu vaccine effectiveness is still evolving.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="jmv26010-sec-0130"><label>5</label><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We provide results from a molecular diagnostic laboratory's initial experience with dealing with a pandemic, and an example of how laboratories can contribute to management of public health crises.
