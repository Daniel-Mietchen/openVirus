No drugs have yet been approved and NAFLD remains a major unmet need. Here, we identify MCJ (Methylation-Controlled J protein) as a target for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), an advanced phase of NAFLD. MCJ is an endogenous negative regulator of the respiratory chain Complex I that acts to restrain mitochondrial respiration. We show that therapeutic targeting of MCJ in the liver with nanoparticle- and GalNAc-formulated siRNA efficiently reduces liver lipid accumulation and fibrosis in multiple NASH mouse models. Decreasing MCJ expression enhances the capacity of hepatocytes to mediate &#x003b2;-oxidation of fatty acids and minimizes lipid accumulation, which results in reduced hepatocyte damage and fibrosis. Moreover, MCJ levels in the liver of NAFLD patients are elevated relative to healthy subjects. Thus, inhibition of MCJ emerges as an alternative approach to treat NAFLD.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) disease causes degeneration of the liver, affects about 25% of people globally, and has no approved treatment.

The highest prevalence of NAFLD is found in populations with obesity or type 2 diabetes, but NAFLD is also frequently found in otherwise healthy people without obvious risk factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. NAFLD includes a wide spectrum of different pathological conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. While simple symptomatic steatosis (accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes) is the earliest stage of NAFLD, it can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), characterized by the presence of fibrosis in the liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. NASH is currently the most common cause of chronic liver disease. Patients with NASH have increased liver-mediated mortality and an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. A fraction of NASH patients develops cirrhosis due to progressive liver fibrosis.</p><p id="Par4">NAFLD is initiated by the excessive accumulation of lipids in the liver due to an increased delivery of fatty acids from adipose tissue accompanied by an imbalance between lipid degradation and de novo lipid synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The accumulation of lipids within hepatocytes triggers a chronic inflammatory response that involves other hepatic cell types, such as Kupffer and stellate cells, and can lead to liver fibrosis (NASH). Fatty acids are catabolized in the liver by &#x003b2;-oxidation within mitochondria, with the resulting reducing products (NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>) being fed into the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). Lipid catabolism in the liver is therefore highly dependent on mitochondrial metabolism. Increasing mitochondrial respiratory activity in the liver could enhance degradation of fatty acids, thereby preventing their accumulation and liver disease progression. However, this pathway has not been extensively considered therapeutically for the treatment of NAFLD because of the potential increase in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a result of enhanced &#x003b2;-oxidation.</p><p id="Par5">MCJ is a transmembrane protein in the inner mitochondrial membrane (encoded by the <italic>Dnajc15</italic> nuclear gene) that acts as an endogenous negative regulator of Complex I and restrains mitochondrial respiration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Loss of MCJ leads to increased Complex I activity, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial respiration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, loss of MCJ does not increase the production of ROS because it also promotes the formation of respiratory supercomplexes that are commonly formed by Complex I, III, and IV of the ETC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The major function of supercomplexes is to facilitate the transport of electrons between Complex I to III and III to IV by bringing them into proximity, and thereby minimize electron leak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. MCJ is expressed predominantly in highly metabolic tissues including the liver, heart, and kidney<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Under normal physiological conditions MCJ is dispensable as no obvious abnormalities can be found in MCJ-deficient mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Disrupting MCJ expression and/or function in the liver could, therefore, be a safe strategy to minimize lipid accumulation and the development of fibrosis, and thereby treat NASH. In this study we show that MCJ-deficient mice are resistant to the development of fatty liver and NASH. Importantly, using siRNA as a therapeutic approach we show that treatment with different formulations of siMCJ after the onset of the disease reduces liver steatosis and fibrosis in multiple mouse models. These results, together with the increased levels of MCJ in liver of NAFLD patients we report here, suggest that MCJ is emerging as an alternative target for treatment of NASH.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Reduced NAFLD liver steatosis and fibrosis in MCJ deficient mice</title><p id="Par6">MCJ is a negative regulator of respiratory Complex I and mitochondrial respiration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.

We therefore investigated the role of MCJ in fatty liver disease using MCJ-deficient (MCJ KO) mice and the methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet mouse model of NASH where lipid accumulation in the liver causes steatosis followed by fibrosis. WT and MCJ KO mice were maintained for 2 weeks on the MCD diet. Histological analysis of the liver showed profound steatosis in WT mice, but minimal steatosis was found in MCJ KO mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The analysis of lipid accumulation showed reduced accumulation of lipids in the livers of MCJ KO mice relative to WT mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, c</xref>). Protection from lipid-mediated liver damage in MCJ KO mice was further demonstrated by the lower levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). To examine whether loss of MCJ could also impact liver fibrosis, WT and MCJ KO mice were maintained on the MCD diet for 3 weeks. Liver fibrosis was determined by Picro Sirius Red staining of liver sections. Similar to liver steatosis, MCJ KO mice developed less fibrosis in the liver relative to WT mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref>).

To determine the efficacy of siMCJ in reducing MCJ expression in vivo, WT mice were i.v. administered a single dose of siMCJ using Invivofectamine (lipid-based) as a delivery system that resembles the lipid nanoparticles (LNP) delivery system used for one of the FDA-approved siRNA-based therapies. Livers were harvested at different time points after siMCJ administration and levels of MCJ were examined by Western blot analysis. As early as 24&#x02009;h after the administration of siMCJ, endogenous MCJ was almost undetectable in the liver (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The levels of MCJ remained low for up to 7 days following siMCJ administration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). No effect on MCJ levels was observed when a control siRNA was administered (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>). In contrast to MCJ in liver, siMCJ treatment did not obviously affect MCJ levels in the heart or kidneys (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b</xref>), two other tissues where MCJ is highly expressed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Thus, siMCJ administration was highly efficient in reducing the levels of MCJ in the liver. To address potential toxicity of the siMCJ treatment, mice were administered a dose fivefold higher than the experimental dose and markers of toxicity were examined 1 week later. Serum levels of transaminases, albumin (liver dysfunction), and urea (renal toxicity) were not elevated in mice that received high doses of siMCJ compared with control mice (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">b, c</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Reducing MCJ levels in the liver by in vivo administration of siMCJ decreases liver steatosis and fibrosis in the MCD diet models.</title><p><bold>a</bold> WT mice received a single i.v. dose (1.7&#x02009;mg/Kg) of siMCJ using Invivofectamine as a delivery system.

Analysis of MCJ in the liver by Western blot analysis showed a clear reduction (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a</xref>). While control mice showed a massive accumulation of lipids in the liver, minimal lipids could be found in siMCJ-treated mice (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5b, c</xref>). Thus, targeting MCJ in the liver by administering siMCJ is an effective way to reduce lipid accumulation.</p><p id="Par11">We then assessed whether the administration of siMCJ could prevent the accumulation of lipids in the liver and development of NASH using the MCD diet model. Based on the pharmacodynamics shown above, a weekly i.v. dose of siMCJ was chosen starting simultaneously with the MCD diet. As controls, mice received either no siRNA (control) or a non-specific siRNA control (siRNAc). Mice were analyzed after 3 weeks on MCD diet (1 week after the last siMCJ treatment). The levels of MCJ remained low in siMCJ treated mice compared with control animals even 1 week after the last treatment (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a</xref>). Relative to the livers of control and control-siRNA treated mice, only minor liver steatosis was present in the livers of siMCJ-treated mice, as determined by H&#x00026;E staining (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), and lipid staining of liver sections (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6b</xref>).

The mice were maintained on mMCD diet for an additional 3 weeks with a weekly dose of siMCJ and euthanized 1 week after the last dose (4 weeks on diet total). The efficient suppression of MCJ expression in the liver was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7a</xref>). Analysis of H&#x00026;E staining of liver sections showed minimal levels of steatosis in siMCJ-treated mice relative to controls (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7b</xref>).

Thus, treatment with siMCJ after the onset of liver steatosis and development of fatty liver reduces the lipid content of the liver. While enhanced &#x003b2;-oxidation and mitochondrial ETC activity may lead to increase ROS production due to electron leak, we have shown that loss of MCJ increases Complex I activity and mitochondrial respiration without increasing ROS because it promotes the formation of supercomplexes that reduce electron leak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

However, while the weight of nontreated mice continued to increase over the 6 weeks following the beginning of the treatment, the weight of siMCJ-treated mice decreased (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). To further support a potential benefit of disrupting MCJ in the liver on metabolic disorders, we tested the effect of siMCJ in weight gain in LepR<sup>db</sup> mice, which show a continued increased weight due to a genetic mutation in the leptin receptor leading to a deficiency in leptin-mediated signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.

We therefore tested whether silencing MCJ in the liver and increasing hepatic mitochondrial function could affect insulin resistance by treating mice on high fat diet for 13 weeks (known to exhibit insulin resistance) with siMCJ. After 2 weeks of treatment with siMCJ, an insulin tolerance test was performed by determining blood glucose levels. siMCJ treatment increased insulin response compared with control-treated mice (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). These results show the efficacy of siMCJ as a treatment for NASH in the context of obesity while managing metabolic disorders.</p><p id="Par17">To further demonstrate the effect of siMCJ treatment on liver fibrosis we also examined its effect on aggressive liver fibrosis caused by the administration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>), the most frequently used model to investigate liver fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. After 2 weeks of periodical i.p. injections of CCl<sub>4</sub>, mice were treated weekly with siMCJ or vehicle control for 3 additional weeks (total of 5 weeks with CCl<sub>4</sub> administration). As reported, the levels of serum ALT were only slightly elevated, and there was no difference in the two groups (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11a</xref>). Liver fibrosis was evaluated by Picro Sirius Red staining of liver sections. Unlike the diet models of NASH where fibrosis develops mostly in perivenular area, mice treated with CCl<sub>4</sub> develop a pattern of fibrotic bridging between central and portal areas that resembles that observed in advanced stage human NASH. As previously described, after 2 weeks of CCl<sub>4</sub> administration, fibrosis was present but minimal signs of bridging could be found (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11b, c</xref>). After 5 weeks of CCl<sub>4</sub> administrations, marked bridging was present in mice from the control group (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11b, c</xref>). In contrast, while fibrosis was present, fibrotic bridging was clearly reduced in the siMCJ-treated mice (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11b, c</xref>).

The byproducts of &#x003b2;-oxidation, NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>, directly feed into the ETC to be oxidized by Complex I and Complex II, respectively. Since MCJ is a negative regulator of Complex I, removing this restraint on Complex I activity could enhance the oxidation of NADH and thereby enhance fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation. We first tested whether silencing MCJ could increase mitochondrial respiration in the fatty liver using the mMCD diet model. Mice were placed on mMCD diet for 4 weeks and treatment with siMCJ started 1 week after the initiation of the diet. Mitochondria were then isolated from the livers of mMCD diet-fed mice and respiration in freshly isolated mitochondria was examined using the Seahorse MitoStress assay. The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was elevated in mitochondria from siMCJ-treated mice compared with nontreated mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Accordingly, mitochondrial ATP levels were also increased in siMCJ-treated mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). Thus, reducing MCJ in vivo by treatment with siMCJ in NAFLD enhances mitochondrial respiration. We then tested whether siMCJ treatment could also indirectly enhance fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation in NAFLD. Using fresh liver sections from control and siMCJ-treated mice on mMCD diet, analysis of fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation by acid soluble metabolites (ASM) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>) and CO<sub>2</sub> release (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>) revealed a significant increase in &#x003b2;-oxidation in the livers of siMCJ-treated mice.

Consistent with the in vivo studies, attenuation of MCJ expression prevented accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5k, l</xref>). However, inhibition of Complex I restored lipid accumulation in the absence of MCJ (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5k, l</xref>).

The efficacy of si381 and si393 to lower MCJ protein levels in the liver was further confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). As expected, due to the slower release of the GalNAc formulation, the kinetics of loss were delayed relative to Invivofectamine, but by 3 days after s.c. administration of si381, MCJ was undetectable in the liver (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12b</xref>). We first tested whether silencing MCJ in hepatocytes with si381 and si393 had similar effect in reducing lipid accumulation in the liver using the fasting model.

Administration of si381 and si393 was initiated at the time the mice were placed on the diet. A second dose was provided 2 weeks later, and mice were harvested 1 week later. The levels of MCJ in the liver remained markedly reduced in the treated mice a week after the last treatment (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14a</xref>). Minimal lipid accumulation in the liver could be detected in mice treated with si381 or si393, relative to control mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c, d</xref>).

Mice were maintained in the diet for 4 months prior to the initiation of the treatment, and were treated with si381 for 2 months with a dose every 2 weeks (total of 4 doses). The levels of MCJ in the liver remained very low even 2 weeks after the last dose of si381 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15a</xref>).

Mice were then treated with si393 or PBS every 2 weeks for 4 additional weeks (2 doses). Lipid accumulation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6h</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16a</xref>) and overall histological liver steatosis (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16b</xref>) were markedly reduced in si393-treated mice compared with the control group. In addition, while liver lipid content increased in PBS-treated mice relative to the initiation of the treatment, no difference was detected in si393-treated mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6h</xref>). Importantly, fibrosis analysis also revealed substantially lower levels of liver fibrosis in si393-treated mice relative to the PBS-treated group, as determined by Picro Sirius Red staining (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6i, j</xref>), as well the levels of smooth muscle actin in liver (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6k</xref>). Similar to lipid content, liver fibrosis in si393-treated mice was no different from the levels of fibrosis at the initiation of the treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6i, k</xref>), indicating that treatment with GalNAc-siMCJ after development of NASH prevents its progression. To address the safety of the delivery of siMCJ with GalNAc, we also tested a single dose 3-fold higher than the experimental dose of si393 under physiological conditions for signs of toxicity. No signs of toxicity could be observed 1 week (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17</xref>) or 24&#x02009;h (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18</xref>) after administration.

In spite of numerous attempts, the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for NAFLD remain largely unknown. Numerous pathogenic molecular pathways have been described in the development and progression of NASH. Some of the targets that have been pursued were initially identified as targets for diabetes and other metabolic disorders (e.g., PPAR, FGF-21)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. De novo lipid synthesis in the liver has been a frequent pathway targeted with the goal of inhibiting and decreasing the production of lipids (e.g., ACC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Blocking the release of lipids from the adipose tissue to prevent their transport to the liver is another approach that has been taken to clinical trials, but this approach can result in weight gain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Since fibrosis is the most important predictor of overall and liver-related mortality, different fibrotic targets as well as inflammation (the main trigger of fibrosis) have been extensively explored (e.g., caspases, chemokines, Galactin-3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Interestingly, boosting the catabolism of lipids in the liver mitochondria has received little attention. However, the new thyroid receptor &#x003b2;-agonists, thought to enhance fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation in mitochondria, are now in clinical trials as treatment for fatty liver disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Here, we identify a pathway that has not been targeted previously: enhancing mitochondrial ETC activity in hepatocytes.</p><p id="Par26">Two of the main products from fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation in the mitochondria are NADH (the substrate reduced to NAD<sup>+</sup> by Complex I of the ETC) and FADH2 (substrate of Complex II of the ETC) that feed into ETC. However, if the ETC activity is low, the accumulation of NADH and FADH2 within the mitochondria could provide a negative feedback to the &#x003b2;-oxidation process. Thus, increasing Complex I activity and mitochondrial respiration could indirectly enhance the catabolism of fatty acids through fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation, but this approach has not been obvious because there are not many known negative regulators of the ETC to be targeted. We have previously identified MCJ as an endogenous negative regulator of Complex I and mitochondrial respiration in multiple cell types including hepatocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In this study, we demonstrate that the therapeutic inhibition of MCJ expression in vivo enhances fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation in the liver in a NASH model. In addition, we also show that the enhanced fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation resulting from inhibiting MCJ is due to enhanced Complex I activity. Thus, we identify an alternative pathway to boost &#x003b2;-oxidation and lipid catabolism in the liver by interfering with MCJ expression in hepatocytes.</p><p id="Par27">While increasing fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation is a strategy to reduce the accumulation of lipids in the liver and thereby reduce fibrosis, increased &#x003b2;-oxidation is also known to cause increased ROS production in the liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> with potential toxic effects. Indeed, treatment with thyroids and thyroid receptor &#x003b2;-agonists can increase ROS levels in the liver, triggering mitophagy as a mechanism to eliminate damaged mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In contrast, loss of MCJ increases Complex I activity and mitochondrial respiration without increasing mitochondrial ROS production because it also promotes the formation of respiratory complexes (Complex I, III, and IV) in hepatocytes and other cells, and thereby diminishes the risk of electron leak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Here we show that in vivo treatment of siMCJ of mice with NASH increases &#x003b2;-oxidation, decreases lipid accumulation in the liver but does not increase ROS production. The JNK pathway has been involved in the initial mechanisms as well as in the progression of NAFLD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Mice lacking JNK1 and JNK2 are largely protected from liver steatosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In addition, mitochondrial ROS are known to activate the JNK pathway, which has been associated with NAFLD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, but we have shown that loss of MCJ does not cause activation of JNK in the liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Thus, unlike thyroid hormone receptor agonists, targeting MCJ in the liver could provide a safer therapeutic option since it prevents the generation of ROS.</p><p id="Par28">Currently, all the therapeutic drugs undergoing clinical trials for NASH are small molecules. Our data show, in contrast, that the use of siRNA to reduce the levels of MCJ in the liver may constitute an alternative therapeutic strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Following the initial excitement for the use of siRNA for therapeutic purposes, the actual development of successful siRNA therapies has been a long and complicated process. A critical challenge for the efficient development of siRNA-based therapies has been the design of delivery systems that specifically target the tissue of interest. In spite of this, delivery to the liver has produced major success and resulted in some FDA-approved drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. The most common delivery system for siRNA to the liver has long been LNP and the first LNP-formulated siRNA-based drug (Patisiran) was approved in 2018 for the treatment of hATTR (hereditary transthyretin-mediated) amyloidosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. However, due to potential secondary effects during prolonged treatments, particularly on the immune system, GalNAc was developed as an alternative delivery system for the liver that specifically targets hepatocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. GalNAc-siRNA conjugates are synthesized by incorporating synthetic triantennary GalNAc to a chemically modified siRNA. GalNAc is specifically delivered to hepatocytes due to the presence of the hepatocyte-specific asialoglycoprotein receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Unlike LNPs, GalNAc-siRNA conjugates can be delivered by subcutaneous administration (s.c.), which can potentially allow for self-administration. The first GalNAc-conjugated siRNA drug (Givosiran) was FDA approved in 2019 for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria. There&#x000a0;are over 30 clinical trials with different GalNAc-conjugated siRNA to treat multiple clinical indications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Here we show that siMCJ formulated into LNP or GalNAc has efficacy in reducing liver steatosis and fibrosis in multiple NASH mouse models. To date no other siRNA-based drugs have been tested in human clinical trials, therefore GalNAc-siMCJ could be one of the first therapies tested in the future.</p><p id="Par29">Overall, we show that liver-specific delivery systems for MCJ safely reduce steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis using different mouse models of NAFLD.
