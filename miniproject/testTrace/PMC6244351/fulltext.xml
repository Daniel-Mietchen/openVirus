This is a key game changer that emphasises the importance of any HIV-positive partner being on ART and virally suppressed before they start trying to achieve pregnancy.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Since 2013, Option B+ has been rolled out in many countries to provide lifelong ART for all HIV-positive pregnant and breastfeeding women to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p></list-item><list-item><p>Reassuring safety data are now available concerning ART exposure during pregnancy and breastfeeding, including efavirenz use.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p></list-item><list-item><p>However, a new safety alert has emerged for dolutegravir use in women around the time of conception, with an indication of increased risk of neural tube defects (NTDs). Further research is needed but, in the interim, providers are recommended to avoid the use of dolutegravir in any woman who expresses a desire for pregnancy now or in the near future and to counsel all women of childbearing potential about the possible risks of becoming pregnant while taking dolutegravir. Providers should adhere to World Health Organization (WHO) or relevant local recommendations as they evolve.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Tenofovir/emtricitabine (Truvada<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and equivalent generics) has been registered for use as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention among individuals at high risk of HIV infection by the National Regulatory Authorities of Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe.<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Approval is pending in Botswana, Nigeria and Uganda, although their national health policies incorporate PrEP as a key prevention intervention.<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p></list-item><list-item><p>The WHO recently recommended that tenofovir-based PrEP should be continued for pregnant and breastfeeding women who <italic>remain at substantial risk of HIV acquisition</italic> during this period.

There are some drug interactions with ART, which are discussed in more detail below.<sup><xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s0003"><title>Introduction</title><p>In southern and sub-Saharan Africa, the majority of HIV-positive individuals are adults of reproductive age,<sup><xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> many of whom desire children<sup><xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and between 30% and 50% of them have an HIV-negative partner,<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> although many may remain unaware of their own or their partner&#x02019;s status.<sup><xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Attempting natural conception, without using any HIV risk reduction strategies, places HIV-affected couples at increased risk of HIV transmission.<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> This likely contributes to regional estimates that up to 60% of new HIV infections occur in stable serodifferent couples.<sup><xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Acknowledging the considerable overlaps between high HIV prevalence in reproductive-aged individuals, HIV transmission risks and active fertility desires, safer conception services need to be scaled up across the region.<sup><xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p><p>Modern ART, which is highly effective, with lower toxicities and pill burden, ensures that HIV can be managed as a lifelong, chronic disease and that MTCT and infection of an HIV-negative partner can be almost entirely avoided if testing and treatment are effectively offered and utilised. With this in mind, the medical and ethical arguments previously used to deny the rights of HIV-positive women to become pregnant, or HIV-positive men to have biological children, are becoming increasingly irrelevant.<sup><xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Healthcare providers need to actively engage with people living with HIV (PLHIV), and their partners, to respect and support the fulfilment of their reproductive rights and desires. Parenting should now be normalised for any individual or couple affected by HIV. These guidelines attempt to provide practical information about how this goal can be achieved safely, with optimal health and minimal HIV acquisition risks for any uninfected partner and the resulting child.</p><p>The routine provision of appropriate contraception and safe prepregnancy planning support holds the potential to impact adult HIV testing and ART uptake, VL outcomes, adult HIV prevention efforts and the achievement of elimination of mother-to-child transmission (EMTCT).<sup><xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> It is one of the few cross-cutting interventions that can positively impact across numerous HIV and sexual and reproductive health programmes to the benefit of women, men and children. This requires accessible and safe fertility planning services and includes both the prevention of unplanned pregnancy through the use of appropriate contraceptive methods and the achievement of a planned, healthy pregnancy.</p><sec id="s20004"><title>Scope of the guidelines</title><p>The guidelines are designed to assist healthcare providers to, first, identify clients&#x02019; fertility desires and second, provide safe and effective pregnancy planning guidance to a presumed fertile couple who currently desire a child and where one or both partners are known to be living with HIV or are at possible risk of acquiring HIV because of having condomless sex with a partner(s) of unknown HIV status.</p><p>Both resource-limited settings, such as most public health sector facilities across the region, and resource-intensive clinical settings, including the private sector, where assisted reproductive technologies may be available, have been considered. However, even in resource-intensive settings, with effective ART and other risk reduction strategies, costlier assisted reproductive technology, for example, sperm washing, IUI and <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilisation (IVF), should no longer be considered necessary purely for the prevention of HIV transmission.<sup><xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p><p>It is important to recognise infertility and refer individuals or couples who are unable to achieve pregnancy; however these guidelines do not cover the management of infertility.</p><p>It should be noted that much of what is covered in these guidelines is relevant to all couples desiring pregnancy.</p></sec><sec id="s20005"><title>Structure of the guidelines</title><p>The guidelines are presented in four sections.</p><p>The first section, &#x02018;Discussing fertility and childbearing with HIV-affected women and men&#x02019;, discusses how providers can raise the issue of fertility planning and help identify the desires of HIV-affected women and men in relation to preventing an unwanted pregnancy or planning a desired pregnancy.</p><p>The second section, &#x02018;HIV-affected clients who express a desire to have a child&#x02019;, focuses on the management of individuals and couples who desire pregnancy, with an emphasis on management of HIV and other comorbidities prior to attempting pregnancy. This section includes strategies for serodifferent and seroconcordant couples, as well as undisclosed individuals or individuals with an unknown status partner, to minimise risks of horizontal and vertical HIV transmission.</p><p>The third section, &#x02018;Clients with no immediate plans for a child&#x02019;, provides a very brief overview of contraceptive provision within the context of HIV for those who do not desire a child at present or in the future.</p><p>The fourth section, &#x02018;Additional considerations for optimising prepregnancy health&#x02019;, provides an overview of several additional service delivery issues, including prepregnancy counselling, basic assessment for underlying infertility, as well as management of comorbidities, pregnancy in older women and basic management if pregnancy is confirmed or a miscarriage occurs. Special considerations for the provision of counselling for HIV-affected single women, same sex and transgender individuals and couples desiring pregnancy are briefly covered.</p></sec><sec id="s20006"><title>A word on terminology used in the guidelines</title><sec id="s30007"><title>Safer conception</title><p><italic>Safer conception</italic> is the term used throughout these guidelines to refer to the overall process of choosing one or more risk reduction strategies to try and minimise HIV transmission and acquisition risks while attempting to achieve a healthy pregnancy. Although in the field of fertility medicine the word <italic>conception</italic> is no longer used because it is not a distinct biological event,<sup><xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> for the purposes of these guidelines it was felt important to maintain continuity with existing literature and guidelines, which speak to safer conception with particular reference to minimising HIV risks during the time when an HIV-affected couple is attempting pregnancy.</p></sec><sec id="s30008"><title>HIV-affected individuals and couples</title><p>The term <italic>HIV-affected individuals and couples</italic> includes a range of HIV relationship combinations, all of which require specifically tailored support to minimise HIV risk and to maximise the possibility of a safe pregnancy. Couples may be in a mutually disclosed seroconcordant or serodifferent relationship, relationships where one or both partners have unknown HIV status or partnerships in which one individual is living with HIV and feels unable to disclose their status to their partner. HIV-positive and -negative individuals without a stable partner may also desire a child. HIV-affected men who have sex with men, women who have sex with women, bisexual and transgender individuals and couples may also have reproductive desires requiring the support of healthcare providers. In high HIV prevalence settings all HIV-negative individuals who have a known positive or unknown status partner fall within this definition of &#x02018;HIV-affected&#x02019; and should be offered safer conception services if they desire a child.</p></sec><sec id="s30009"><title>Safe pregnancy</title><p>Safe or healthy pregnancy in this case refers to a minimised risk of HIV transmission to an uninfected partner and/or a foetus.</p></sec><sec id="s30010"><title>Horizontal HIV transmission</title><p>The transmission of HIV from one sexual partner to another is called <italic>horizontal transmission</italic>. It can also occur between people who inject drugs if they share injecting equipment.</p></sec><sec id="s30011"><title>Vertical HIV transmission</title><p>Vertical transmission is the transmission of HIV from mother-to-child, either during pregnancy, labour and delivery or breastfeeding.</p></sec><sec id="s30012"><title>Condomless sex</title><p>These guidelines specifically use the term <italic>condomless sex</italic> as opposed to <italic>unprotected sex</italic> because, with the availability of ART and PrEP, when a couple undertake sexual intercourse without a condom they are not unprotected; they are simply using other measures to protect themselves and their partner from HIV transmission and acquisition. This distinction is important because the phrase <italic>unprotected</italic> or <italic>unsafe</italic> sex creates anxiety in couples and also implies unsafe and irresponsible behaviour when, in fact, many of these couples are very committed to doing everything possible to achieve pregnancy safely and reduce risk to the HIV-negative partner.</p></sec><sec id="s30013"><title>Timed condomless sex</title><p>Timed condomless sex is one safer conception strategy that individuals or couples may choose to use to reduce the total number of HIV risk exposures undertaken while trying to achieve pregnancy. With this strategy, condomless sex acts are limited to the peak fertile window, which occurs around the time that the female partner ovulates. This strategy has also been referred to as <italic>timed periovulatory unprotected intercourse</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s30014"><title>Healthcare provider(s)</title><p>This term refers to all clinicians, including doctors and nurses, and other staff such as counsellors and community healthcare workers who provide contraception, fertility planning and prepregnancy services for people affected by HIV, as defined by their scope of practice.</p></sec><sec id="s30015"><title>Serodifferent (serodiscordant)</title><p>The guidelines use the term <italic>serodifferent</italic> instead of <italic>serodiscordant</italic> to describe relationships in which one partner is HIV-positive and the other is HIV-negative. Other terms with the same meaning are <italic>seromixed, mixed status</italic> or <italic>magnetic couples</italic>. The term serodifferent is used in these guidelines rather than <italic>serodiscordant</italic> in response to the expressed preferences of PLHIV and their partners.</p></sec><sec id="s30016"><title>Disclosure and partial disclosure</title><p>In the context of these guidelines, <italic>disclosure</italic> is the process of revealing one&#x02019;s HIV status to another person. Disclosure may also involve telling another person about his or her HIV treatment, health status or VL.</p><p>Partial disclosure, for the purposes of this document, refers to a situation in which one partner has disclosed their HIV status but may not have told the other partner all of the details of their HIV history.

Partners should be consulted separately at least once to explore any undisclosed issues about which the healthcare provider should be aware.

Forced disclosure, or a judgmental approach towards non-disclosure, may cause the undisclosed individual to withdraw from care altogether, placing them and their partner at even higher risk of HIV transmission and poor health outcomes. Risks can still be mitigated even where disclosure has not occurred and the individual who has not disclosed should be optimally managed within this context.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Couple-based HIV testing and counselling may represent a valuable opportunity to assist with supported disclosure, whereby the known positive individual tests with their partner as if for the first time.

These include barrier methods (male and female condoms), hormonal injectables such as depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) or norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN), combined oral contraceptive pills (COCP), subdermal contraceptive implants, intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) and levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS).<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref></sup></p></list-item><list-item><p>Long-acting reversible contraceptive options, particularly the IUCD, should be encouraged where possible, especially among young women, because of fewer side effects, better adherence and immediate return to fertility following removal. The IUCD is also a recommended option for women who have completed their families but do not wish to access permanent sterilisation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Drug interactions, as per the WHO medical eligibility criteria (MEC) and country guidelines, need to be considered, for example:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The efficacy of subdermal implants in preventing pregnancy may be compromised because of drug interactions with certain antiretroviral drugs, such as efavirenz,<sup><xref rid="CIT0096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref></sup> and certain other enzyme-inducing tuberculosis (TB) and antiepileptic drugs.<sup><xref rid="CIT0097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref></sup> Women who choose this as a method need to be counselled about the risks and the need for consistent male or female condom use as additional protection. However, there is no need to counsel against implant use or advise early removal of implants in women living with HIV.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, particularly efavirenz, interact with the COCP such that there is a marginally higher rate of pregnancies seen in women on efavirenz and COCP, but the pregnancy rate observed was still considerably lower than among women on no form of modern contraception.<sup><xref rid="CIT0096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref></sup> Women on protease inhibitors did not have a significantly higher rate of pregnancy.<sup><xref rid="CIT0096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref></sup> The COCP should, therefore, remain an option for women on these ARVs and is preferable to being on no reliable contraception when the COCP is the woman&#x02019;s preferred choice. However, as with the subdermal implant, more extensive interactions are seen with TB drugs, particularly rifampicin, as well as antiepileptic medications, so these interactions should be reviewed before proceeding with a final choice for women on one or more of these medications. Again, dual prevention with consistent male or female condom use should be recommended to all women.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p>There are various options for women and couples who do not want any further children in the future.

This is often poorly understood and forms the basis for optimising the strategy of timed condomless sex or self-insemination for safer conception.</p><p><bold>Remember</bold>: For those HIV-affected couples who are U=U, precise timing of condomless sex to the fertile window is not considered necessary. If they are comfortable to do so, the couple should be advised to have regular, condomless sex, two or three times per week spread out equally over each week when the woman is not menstruating. For those couples who are anxious about multiple condomless sex acts, the strategy of timing condomless sex to limit them to the days of highest fertility can be explained.</p><p>Explain the following:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>When an HIV-affected couple is advised to, or chooses to, limit their condomless sex acts to peak fertility, determining a woman&#x02019;s fertile period is necessary to establish the timing of periovulatory intercourse. There are various ways in which a woman&#x02019;s fertile period can be determined. The methods described here presume normal fertility and require minimal resources.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In situations where a woman&#x02019;s fertility may be impaired, more resource-intensive methods such as Day 21 progesterone measurements or serial ultrasound monitoring, with or without ovulation stimulation through clomiphene administration, may be used by a reproductive specialist. These more intensive methods may also be used in women living with HIV (who have presumed normal fertility) in order to increase their chance of fertility prediction.</p></list-item></list><sec id="s20067"><title>Fertile dates</title><p>The average normal duration of a menstrual cycle is 28 days. The first day of a woman&#x02019;s menstrual period is considered to be Day 1 of her menstrual cycle. Ovulation is anticipated to occur 14 days before the next period is due to start. Her fertile period would be from five days before predicted ovulation up until 1&#x02013;2 days after ovulation. For example, in a woman whose cycle is 28 days long, ovulation would be assumed to occur on Day 14. The woman&#x02019;s fertile period would therefore occur between Days 9 and 16 of her menstrual cycle. This creates a seven-day window. This may be narrowed down to a peak fertile window of four days if the couple would like to minimise risk exposure further. This would be calculated as two days before predicted ovulation, the day of ovulation and one day after predicted ovulation.</p><p>However, menstrual cycle length may differ considerably between women and may even differ from month to month for an individual woman. It is therefore essential that a woman keeps a record of her menstrual cycle (typically taking into account the first day of her menstrual period) in order to determine an average menstrual cycle length. It is important to explain to patients that regular menstrual cycles may not necessarily indicate that ovulation has occurred. Ovulation is less likely to be occurring in women whose cycle is 24 days or less or 35 days or longer. There are now several mobile phone applications that are available for free that can assist women to keep track of their cycles and to predict ovulation. This can be a very helpful resource. Examples include CycleBeads&#x02122; and Dot&#x02122;. It may take up to four months to establish an average cycle length where cycles are irregular and the more months that are recorded the more accurate the timing can become when using this method.</p></sec><sec id="s20068"><title>Ovulation prediction kits (for urine and saliva)</title><p>A number of over-the-counter products are available that enable ovulation prediction. These methods may utilise sampling and analysis of either urine or saliva and detect the surge of luteinising hormone that occurs immediately before ovulation. These test kits are becoming more affordable and can limit risk exposure to just two days per cycle because of their high levels of accuracy. The use of ovulation prediction kits can be particularly useful for women with irregular cycles where the calendar method is often not as helpful. In women where there may be a concern about anovulatory cycles, ovulation test kits may also help to identify if the luteinising hormone surge is not happening and there is a need for further investigation and management to promote ovulation.</p></sec><sec id="s20069"><title>Cervical mucus monitoring</title><p>Monitoring the cervical mucus changes that occur around the time of ovulation is also a useful means to identify peak fertility. During non-fertile days, the cervical mucus is thick and acidic. In contrast, during fertile days, the mucus undergoes a change to become thin, profuse, transparent and &#x02018;stretchy&#x02019; (spinnbarkeit), like raw egg white. A woman&#x02019;s awareness of these changes in her cervical mucus may help her to predict her fertile period and guide her pregnancy attempts. However, this method may not be as easy to use for some women, particularly those who use certain hygiene practices including douching or vaginal drying, as the cervical mucus is disrupted or washed away so changes in vaginal secretions may not be as easily observed. If the provider gathers a history of vaginal hygiene practices, it is advisable to counsel the client against such practices as there may be an association between vaginal douching or drying and increased rates of bacterial vaginosis,<sup><xref rid="CIT0117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref></sup> which in turn may be associated with increased rates of HIV transmission and pregnancy loss.<sup><xref rid="CIT0118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref></sup></p></sec></sec></app><app id="app003"><title>Appendix 3: Low-technology sperm collection and self-insemination techniques</title><sec id="s0070"><title/><p>Artificial insemination is the process whereby semen is introduced into the female reproductive tract other than by sexual intercourse. It may be intrauterine or vaginal, the former being a specialist procedure. The latter is a low-risk procedure that can be carried out by a healthcare provider or at home by the patient herself or her male partner.</p><p>It is advisable that vaginal insemination be attempted at the most fertile time in the menstrual cycle, as described above.</p><p>Semen needs to be provided in a clean receptacle, either by male ejaculation into a condom during intercourse or by male ejaculation into a clean specimen jar provided for the purpose. The semen (most men ejaculate 1.5 mL) should be inseminated as soon as possible, and within an hour of ejaculation. If the ejaculate is collected from a condom the couple must ensure that the condom is one that does not include spermicide and the transfer to syringe or clean jar should be done immediately, as latex condoms can cause sperm immobility if exposure is prolonged.</p><p>Other equipment to carry out the vaginal insemination would include a &#x02018;turkey baster&#x02019;, 5 mL or 10 mL plastic needleless syringe or plastic disposable pipette.
