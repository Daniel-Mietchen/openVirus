We have expanded on these elements and have further focused on situation monitoring, funding and surgical preparation. As world leaders, healthcare executives and clinical leads scramble to establish &#x02018;best practice&#x02019; models moving forward, we describe these strategies and assess their efficacy based on published reports, analyse current outcomes and offer evidence-based recommendations on de-escalation of restrictions in an attempt to aid policy makers during these crucial times. We also identify leadership issues and ethical dilemmas which may arise amidst the pandemic and describe their effect on implementation of policy.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Leadership Compartmentalisation</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Planning and coordination</title><p id="p0040">Planning is key in any national crisis and especially in a pandemic that affects every element in society, effective coordination is essential. This coordination must happen at a national, regional and local level with lines of communication between each. Under these unique circumstances, this should be done virtually (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). As part of planning, it is also prudent to utilise previous pandemic preparedness plans and mitigation strategies which will be discussed in section <xref rid="sec2.5" ref-type="sec">2.5</xref> as an independent entity.</p><p id="p0045">At a local level, hospitals are advised to set up local incident management teams (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) consisting of a clear chain of command as well as a clinical director, a managerial director and a single point of reference to regional command centres (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) as well as public health specialists. This is important for the relaying of national directives to clinical staff delivering care and to ensure they follow the latest up to date best practice whilst able to use individual clinician discretion. A similar structure should also be followed in individual hospital service delivery settings with lead clinicians identified and able to coordinate an effective response in their area of expertise.</p><p id="p0050">Regionally, coordination must be also established within a local health system. This is relevant both for large urban conurbations with closely linked populations as well as more sparsely populated rural health systems (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Regional coordination is needed for the pooling of resources, the sharing of clinical best practice, the coordination of workforce sharing and redeployment as well as being essential for the interface between primary, secondary and emergency care providers to collaborate and manage patient pathways. Regional response teams can consist of small municipal regions or larger national subdivision regions, such as Federal States or Administrative Regions, who link with national systems.</p><p id="p0055">Finally, national coordination. Strong national leadership provides unity of purpose and strategy as well as coordination with other countries (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) for resources and coordinated responses. Each country uses its nationally agreed upon procedures with the most common response team consisting of the Head of Government, Health Minister, Chief Medical Officer/Lead Public Health Officer, Epidemiologist and Virologists as well as civil defence/military representatives. A similar structure can also be replicated on a more regional basis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Situation monitoring and assessment</title><p id="p0060">Given the expeditious nature of its transmission and severity of disease, accurate monitoring and assessment is crucial for enabling an effective response. Despite transparent reporting and collaboration between the majority of national and international public health agencies, variability in testing criteria may contribute to a misleading epidemiological picture (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). For example, due to a limitation in laboratory testing capacity, countries such as Spain and Italy have recalibrated their eligibility guidelines resulting in more stringent criteria (e.g., only those with severe symptoms or at high risk due to comorbidities will receive testing) (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). This may lead to expressions of a flattened epidemic curve, potentially causing a misinterpretation of the epidemic&#x02019;s true status. Furthermore, some countries, such as South Korea, have shifted to more liberal eligibility guidelines (i.e., a greater number of people are tested) which may result in a steepening of the curve&#x02019;s gradient (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Appreciating the evolving nature of national testing efforts is crucial when formulating a plan of action for COVID-19. Garcia-Basteiro et al (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) argue the two indicators most resilient to changes in testing capabilities - and thus should be relied upon when monitoring and assessing a situation - are incidence risk of hospital admissions and mortality rate.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Communication</title><p id="p0065">Effective communication is a key attribute of successful leaders during a public health crisis since even the most efficient and best strategies may be rendered ineffective by inadequate or ineffective communication at all stages of planning, or communication that fails to be integrated successfully into the community. In fact, poor communication may exacerbate the existing threat. Overall, the plans employed by national authorities must reflect a thoughtful, effective, informative, and evidence-based approach (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p id="p0070">As a result of the dynamic nature of a pandemic, complete transparency and prompt communication of both real and potential risks is necessary. Social marketing and health promotion, particularly during the preparation phase of a public health risk, ensure the delivery of crucial health protection messages. Evidently, these factors are important because the quality of the resulting societal response e.g. social distancing and self-isolation, depends partly on meeting these specific communication and outreach needs. In addition to the importance of communication as part of the preparation phase of a pandemic, leaders should be mindful of the importance to continually inform, update, and promote its population on the existence of known, proven, and/or recommended guidelines and interventions to protect the general public and speed recovery. This ensures that any risk at both the population and individual level is mitigated.</p><p id="p0075">The delivery of continual and factual information to the public and all stakeholders on the pandemic&#x02019;s current state, and throughout every stage of planning, response, and recovery, is equally as significant. Such delivery has to be clear and focussed. If mistakes happen or performance falls short, governments should be honest with the public. Although the potential mortality, morbidity, life and economic disruptions may be difficult to predict, it is nevertheless vital that these concerns and harsh realities be communicated. Since leaders are public figures upon which others will depend for reassurance and guidance, in turn fostering resilience and recovery, they must refrain from communicating any false or non-evidence-based scientific information that may lead to panic and negative health outcomes. Evidently, reducing any negative consequences relies heavily on gaining the trust and cooperation of a substantial body of countrywide entities. Post-pandemic, leaders should publicly acknowledge the contributions of all key-workers, services, and communities. Leaders also play a critical role in detailing the lessons that have been learned, to enable prompt action in the event of future public health crises. These lessons will evidently lead to the active incorporation of those strategies having proven most effective into existing governmental strategies. Overall, communication is key to building trust, developing effective guidelines and principles and to ensure the prevention and containment of disease. However, it is nevertheless important to note that good communication practices will not substitute for poor planning or misconceptions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Funding, PPE, testing</title><p id="p0080">It is important that global leaders ensure the appropriate allocation of funds towards medical supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE) to help meet the ever increasing demand. This fundamental priority is key to protecting frontline healthcare staff and to preventing further viral transmission within the hospital setting. Examples of necessary PPE include masks, visors, gloves, aprons, and gowns. In the UK, the British Government has endeavoured to allocate &#x000a3;6.6 billion from the Government&#x02019;s coronavirus emergency fund to the NHS, following on from an initial contingency fund of &#x000a3;5 billion (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The European Commission have also announced plans to create a strategic stockpile of medical equipment with an initial budget of &#x020ac;50 million to support EU countries (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Funding may additionally be used to free up hospital beds, purchase intensive care medical equipment including ventilators, diagnostic kits, therapeutic supplies, and laboratory equipment to support research and development.</p><p id="p0085">Regarding testing, leaders must ensure the development of sustained diagnostic capacity, the establishment of adequate testing schemes, and ensure the rapid validation and deployment of serological testing. In the UK, the implementation of a nation-wide coronavirus testing programme (via a home testing kit or a pre-booked regional test site) to enable all individuals who develop symptoms of the disease to be tested (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In the EU, aggressive testing of all 3,300 inhabitants of the town of V&#x000f2;, near Venice, irrespective of the presence of symptoms, enabled the spread of infection to cease (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). As of 17th June 2020, Italy has conducted approximately 2,926,000 tests (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In Asia, Taiwan has achieved international praise for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of 17th June 2020, Taiwan has conducted 74,842 tests, with 445 confirmed cases and 7 deaths (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). These successes have highlighted the importance of testing and isolation, in otherwise healthy individuals, to leaders on a global scale.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><label>2.5</label><title>Mitigation and containment</title><p id="p0090">The overwhelming cases of COVID-19 have forced global leaders to adopt containment measures in an attempt to suppress the spread of the disease. South Korea has taken the global lead in containment of the virus as they have focused greatly on mass testing, early contact tracing and successful quarantine. In other parts of the world, namely China, Spain, Italy and the US, raising numbers of daily cases prompted governments to switch from containment to mitigation strategies (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In doing so, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been implemented worldwide having a great effect in managing and limiting social contact (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p id="p0095">A recent Belgian study suggests that &#x02018;Flattening the curve&#x02019; strategies in an attempt to develop herd immunity &#x02013; in essence reducing the Reproduction number (R0) to less than 1 - are &#x02018;unfeasible&#x02019;. Using the SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered) model, they predict that supplemental ICU capacity will need to be maintained for several years, inadvertently overwhelming healthcare systems worldwide. Moreover, an outbreak of the disease will be observed if R0 raises above 1, overloading an already saturated healthcare system. When R0 falls to less than 1, the disease is predicted to disappear for a period, effectively extending the time required to build up herd immunity (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p id="p0100">It is clear that as countries enter different stages of the pandemic, leaders must develop the courage to abruptly alter the course of the health policy when needed. As new scientific evidence emerges rapidly, it is prudent that policy makers regularly update their response to meet this science evidence, learn from other countries&#x02019; responses and aim to enhance their own. In doing so, they can adjust lockdown measures in an accurate and timely manner and maneuver through implementation of NPIs appropriately.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><label>2.6</label><title>Predictive mathematical modelling</title><p id="p0105">Varying mathematical models have been formulated across countries, offering direction to governments regarding appropriate interventions. It should be noted, however, the utility of modelling largely stems from its ability to define the effect of interventions rather than providing precise quantitative predictions (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Nevertheless, the predictive function of mathematical modelling holds an important role for governmental responses and target-setting.</p><p id="p0110">Crucially, the values produced by these models are dependent on the quality of the data employed. At the primordial stages of an epidemic, quality of data is limited by inconsistencies in national detective efforts and inadequate documentation (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Indeed, execution of decisions without reliable data has been a key concern of epidemiologists (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Moreover, even as many countries are in the midst of the epidemic, factors such as accuracy of tests, population characteristics, and the possibility of reinfection add a layer of complexity when modelling. Thus, when relying on models, attention should be paid to the key assumptions of the report &#x02013; particularly, how sensitive to errors these assumptions are.</p><p id="p0115">A model released by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) has purported specific predictions in relation to the United States which include the day on which cases will peak (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). This model has subsequently been widely referenced by officials in Washington, D.C. as guiding decisions for policy. Predictive modelling becomes further complicated when faced with large countries, such as the United States, as the epidemic unravels differently in sub-populations. Variability in prevalence of comorbidities, age, environment, and genetic disposition may result in a wide range of feasible outcomes which differ dramatically from state to state (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Indeed, the long-term mortality projection for New York by the IHME model shifted upwards by 60% in under a week at the end of March. This volatility and dynamic nature demonstrates the importance of avoiding the overinterpretation of models: leaders should be appropriately circumspect in their claims when basing their communication on predictive mathematics.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.7"><label>2.7</label><title>COVID-19 surgical adaptation phases</title><p id="p0120">The COVID-19 pandemic causes a challenge for the optimal and safe surgical management of patients. Al-Jabir et al. summarise the effects of the pandemic on surgical practice worldwide (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). One specific strain for surgical leaders is the need to risk-stratify elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the WHO declaration of the pandemic, the United States Surgeon General advised the cancellation of all elective surgeries in hospitals to prevent the spread of the virus (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). However, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) later advised the prioritization of surgical resources (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The organization advised that each hospital should &#x02018;review all elective procedures to minimize, postpone or cancel elective surgery until the predicted point in the exposure graph is passed, to support the healthcare infrastructure&#x02019; (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The careful consideration of which surgical procedures to perform during COVID-19 is of utmost importance, due to the risk of spreading the virus further. The Royal College of Surgeons of England provided advice on how to stratify surgical procedures during the pandemic (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The guidance advised that prioritization of surgery for patients should be according to a specific classification (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>
). The categorization of patients aims to help managers plan the allocation of resources, allows surgeons to appreciate the needs of other surgical specialties and facilitate the development of regional surgical networks to sustain the delivery of surgery in a timely fashion (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The Royal College Surgeons of England stratification of patients for surgery (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0010">Table 1</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Priority Level</th><th>Operation Timetable</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Priority level 1a Emergency</td><td align="left">Operation needed within 24 hours</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Priority level 1b Urgent</td><td align="left">Operation needed with 72 hours</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Priority level 2</td><td align="left">Surgery that can be deferred for up to 4 weeks</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Priority level 3</td><td align="left">Surgery that can be delayed for up to 3 months</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Priority level 4</td><td align="left">Surgery that can be delayed for more than 3 months</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="p0125">The guidance highlights the importance of documenting the surgical procedures that are deferred to plan for the increase in the time and quantify of the surgical waiting lists (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The ACS similarly provided guidance on the surgical prioritization of patients during the pandemic (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The guidelines highlight that leaders of institutions should follow a collaborative process to identify principles and frameworks for prioritization, ensuring input from surgery, anaesthesia and nursing (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The ACS recommends transparency of the framework utilized in hospital institutions to ensure consistency, reliability and public assurance (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p><p id="p0130">One critical aspect of surgical leadership during COVID-19 is to provide roadmaps to ensure scheduling of elective surgery, when it is safe to do so (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The ACS, American Society of Anesthesiologists, Association of Perioperative Registered Nurses and the American Hospital Association provided a joint statement on 17th April 2020 to ensure the smooth transition of rebuilding elective surgery following the end of the pandemic (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The statement highlighted the need to consider appropriate timing for reopening, COVID-19 testing within the facility, case prioritization and scheduling. With the ongoing unknown timelines of COVID-19, it will be critical to design and implement clinically relevant and patient safe surgical management guidelines by the leaders of individual healthcare institutions (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>Ethical dilemmas</title><p id="p0135">COVID-19 is raising many ethical medical dilemmas for the leaders of healthcare institutions. Treatment rationing is one of the main problems that is faced among healthcare professionals (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). With the surge in cases it is unclear how the leaders should ration resources fairly, particularly ventilators for patients on the intensive care unit (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Institutional protocols are one way in which healthcare professionals can be guided to making such critical decisions (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). On 11th April 2020, the American Medical Association (AMA) released guidelines, a code of medical ethics for healthcare professionals during the pandemic (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The guidance provided criteria for limited resources by considering the urgency of medical need, likelihood and anticipated duration of benefit and change in quality of life following the treatment (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). With the shortage of PPE, physicians themselves will be asked to care for patients infected with COVID-19 without sufficient protection, raising many ethical dilemmas. The AMA guidelines discuss how physicians may ethically decline to provide care if PPE is not available after considering the anticipated level of risk. Unique circumstances of the healthcare professional, including an underlying health condition, may justify the refusal of care. The American College of Surgeons (ACS), provided some ethical framework for the allocation of resources in the event of shortages. The ACS advised the use of well-known objective measures to predict mortality, to help guide healthcare professionals treat individual patients (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p><p id="p0140">During the crisis, leadership is of utmost importance in helping to solve these medical dilemmas. The AMA advised that as leaders of the healthcare team, such healthcare professionals should advocate for resources and support (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The British medical association (BMA) provided advice on medical dilemmas during the COVID-19 pandemic (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The institution advised that senior leadership should make the decisions on how resources are allocated in difficult situations (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The decisions should be based on the best available evidence, agreed in advance where practicable, communicated openly and transparently and subject to modification and review as the situation develops (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Advice on which patients should be treated during the COVID-19 pandemic was also provided by the BMA. They advised that manager and senior clinicians must set the thresholds for admission to intensive care units and the use of highly limited treatments including mechanical ventilation.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><label>3.2</label><title>De-escalation strategies</title><p id="p0145">De-escalation strategies are required to ensure that societies gradually return to normal practice. A number of considerations are required for successful implementation, since de-escalation that is too rapid or inappropriately timed carries the risk of a rapid upsurge in transmission. In particular, surveillance data and seroepidemiological population surveys may be used to provide information on the extent and speed of population immunity, which may guide subsequent decisions on de-escalation (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Large scale surveys may be achieved via commercial SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, on the collection of specimens at symptom onset, admission, and discharge. Such tests will additionally form a crucial element to informing first-line responders, key workers, and healthcare professionals of their infection status and to thereby guide safe return to work. Individuals having recovered or endured an asymptomatic transmission may also be able to return to employment without the risk of increased transmission.</p><p id="p0150">For countries having implemented strict physical lock-down measures, a review of existing strategies to ensure the presence of adequate contact tracing (to reduce the risk of disease re-emergence) is required before de-escalation measures are employed. Since stringent physical lock-down can be disruptive at both the societal and economical level, placing further strain on existing nationwide issues, there are already reports of individuals having failed to adhere adequately to these public health recommendations, due to a so-called &#x02018;isolation fatigue&#x02019;(<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Since de-escalation requires the incidence of infection to be reduced to very low levels, there is significant interest in formulating an effective and logical approach to de-escalation with regards to physical distancing interventions. In order to mitigate the possibility of an unprecedented recurrence of increased transmission, inevitably placing vulnerable populations at risk, such approaches should be mindful not to prematurely uplift current bans (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).

In 2016, an external quality assessment (EQA) of the molecular diagnostics, carried out by non-governmental South Korean medical laboratories, for Zika virus and MERS-CoV was sponsored by KCDC and conducted by KEQAS. In addition to evaluating the proficiency of molecular tests performed by non-governmental medical laboratories for Zika virus and MERS-CoV, recommendations were made to conduct regular EQA of non-governmental laboratories involved in the diagnosis of emerging infectious diseases in South Korea in order to bolster the capacity of laboratories able to deal with new pathogens (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).</p><p id="p0170">On 7th January 2020, Chinese authorities confirmed that a novel coronavirus was behind the spike in pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology seen in the country since early December 2019 and on 12th January 2020, China shared the genetic sequence of this novel coronavirus with the rest of the world (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). By the time the first case of COVID-19 was detected in South Korea on 20th January 2020, South Korea had already developed a diagnostic test for COVID-19, KCDC had established public-private partnerships for the development and execution of diagnostic tests to allow for rapid expansion of testing capacity and Korean Food and Drug Administration had expeditiously approved the use of these diagnostic tests for suspected cases (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).<list list-type="simple" id="olist0015"><list-item id="o0015"><label>&#x025cf;</label><p id="p0175">

These text message alerts allowed people to judge their risk of contracting COVID-19 and encouraged them to self-isolate or get tested (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>).
