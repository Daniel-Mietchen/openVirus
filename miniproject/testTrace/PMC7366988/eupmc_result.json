    "On 11th March 2020, the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Approximately 5.6 million have now been infected and over 350,000 have died. This global public health crisis has since cascaded into a series of challenges for leaders around the world, threatening both the health and economy of populations. This paper attempts to compartmentalise leadership aspects, allowing a closer examination of reports and the analysis of outcomes. The authors are thus enabled to formulate a number of evidence-based recommendations on the de-escalation of restrictions."
