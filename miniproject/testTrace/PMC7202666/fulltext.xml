Even after numerous source reduction programmes, more than 30,000 incidences are reporting in the country every year. The last and greatest dengue epidemic in the country was reported in July, 2017 with more than 300 dengue related deaths and the highest number of dengue incidences were reported from the District of Gampaha. There is no Dengue Virus (DENV) detection system in field specimens in the district yet and therefore the aim of the study is development of entomological surveillance approach through vector survey programmes together with molecular and phylogenetic methods to identify detection of DENV serotypes circulation in order to minimize adverse effects of imminent dengue outbreaks. Entomological surveys were conducted in five study areas in the district for 36 months and altogether, 10,616 potential breeding places were investigated and 423 were positive for immature stages of dengue vector mosquitoes. During adult collections, 2,718 dengue vector mosquitoes were collected and 4.6% (n = 124) were <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. While entomological indices demonstrate various correlations with meteorological variables and reported dengue incidences, the mosquito pools collected during the epidemic in 2017 were positive for DENV. The results of the phylogenetic analysis illustrated that Envelope (E) gene sequences derived from the isolated DENV belongs to the Clade Ib of Cosmopolitan genotype of the DENV serotype 2 which has been the dominant stain in South-East Asian evidencing that a recent migration of DENV strain to Sri Lanka.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Natioanl Research Council, Sri Lanka</institution></funding-source><award-id>NRC TO-14/04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8300-9849</contrib-id><name><surname>Hapugoda</surname><given-names>Menaka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004493</institution-id><institution>International Atomic Energy Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SRL/TC- 5/047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8300-9849</contrib-id><name><surname>Hapugoda</surname><given-names>Menaka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Resources including field entomological laboratory, man power, equipment and supplies, etc. for the study were provided by the National Research Council, Sri Lanka (TO-14/04), Sri Lanka.

Over the past 50 years, dengue has become the most rapidly spreading disease in the world with a 30-fold magnitude rise of global incidences. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 50 billion people have been infected with dengue around the globe with 50&#x02013;100 million annual incidences [<xref rid="pone.0231408.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The causative agent of the disease is one of the four antigenically distinct serotypes Dengue Virus (DENV) which is a positive stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae. The disease is transmitted to humans mainly via bites of <italic>Aedes (Stegomyia)</italic> dengue vector mosquitoes. <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (Linnaeus) is considered as the predominant vector while <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> (Skuse) is considered as the subsidiary vector of DENV. Transmission of dengue is mainly influenced by large-scale unplanned urbanization and the increase in human population. Further, increased global travelling has also been identified to be contributing significantly for the spread of the virus [<xref rid="pone.0231408.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0231408.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The first dengue incidence in Sri Lanka was reported in 1962 and ever since, the number of dengue incidences increased every year. The first Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) epidemic was reported in Sri Lanka in 1989 and after that DHF has been considered endemic to Sri Lanka [<xref rid="pone.0231408.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. All four serotypes of DENV are circulating in the country even though the predominant serotype is changing over time [<xref rid="pone.0231408.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Sri Lanka experienced a recent dengue epidemic in 2017 with more than 186 000 dengue incidences with 215 deaths. Approximately half of the total dengue incidences were reported in the Western Province which comprises of Districts of Colombo, Gampaha and Kaluthara. The highest number of dengue incidences were reported in the District of Colombo which is the commercial capital and largest city of the country followed by the District of Gampaha bordering the Northern boundary of the District of Colombo. Despite many efforts taken for controlling dengue in the District of Gampaha, more than 5,000 cases on average are reported annually with approximately 32,000 reported cases in the year 2017 [<xref rid="pone.0231408.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is required to have a broad knowledge on entomological risk factors, distribution, densities and seasonal variation of dengue vector mosquitoes together with climatic and other possible risk factors affecting transmission of dengue to control dengue incidences in the District of Gampaha, however, there is no study conducted in the district to identify DENV serotypes in specimens from entomological surveys and identification of its origin and circulation. Therefore, the study is focused on development of better entomological surveillance approach through vector survey programmes together with molecular and phylogenetic methods to identify detection of DENV serotypes circulation in order to minimize adverse effects of imminent dengue outbreaks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Selection of study areas</title><p>The District of Gampaha (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231408.g001">Fig 1</xref>) where the second highest number of dengue cases reported in Sri Lanka [<xref rid="pone.0231408.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] was selected for the study.

However, non-significant positive correlations were all three entomological indices of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and current month minimum and maximum temperature in high risk study areas. <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> is mainly indoor resting mosquito and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> is outdoor resting mosquito. In the high risk study areas, temperature ranges from 21.3&#x000b0;C to 34.3&#x000b0;C. In high temperature periods, <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes will fly inside of households and rest in there for their survival and therefore, they can survive better in high temperature periods than <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic>. This can be another reason for negative correlations of entomological indices of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> and positive correlations of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> entomological indices with temperature. This may indicate that most of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes are resting indoors in the study areas and therefore, more attention need to be paid to control indoor mosquito populations in future source reduction programmes during epidemic as well as non-epidemic periods. Further, positive correlations were observed between all three entomological indices of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> and maximum temperature in all study areas at two and three months lag periods. These positive correlations may be due to safeguard of mosquito eggs. During high temperatures, water in the containers gets evaporated and even though the container completely dried out, the eggs can survive without dropping out as the eggs are attached to the walls of the container. Therefore, when there is a rainfall, those eggs can be hatched successfully and develop mosquito larvae leading to positive correlation [<xref rid="pone.0231408.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>When considering the RH, both the minimum and maximum RH were correlated in a similar manner with entomological indices. Positive correlations were observed between current month maximum RH with both HI and BI of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic>. Further, similar non-significant positive correlations were observed between HI of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and current month minimum and maximum RH. These positive correlations can be due to the higher RH in study areas. Sri Lanka is an island nation located in the Indian Ocean and a high level of humidity prevails throughout the year. The average RH in Sri Lanka is about 79.8% which makes favorable conditions for the development of dengue vector mosquitoes. Therefore, positive correlation of entomological indices with RH at current month has to be expected in Sri Lanka. However, all three entomological indices of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> were negatively correlated with two and three month previous minimum and maximum RH in study areas. This may be due to higher RH can reduce the hatching rates of mosquito eggs attached to dry containers which is reported in a previous study [<xref rid="pone.0231408.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In rearing insectaries, the mosquito eggs were stored in a desiccator below 60% of RH to maximize the hatching rates. This observation indicate that higher RH may be lead to reduce hatching rates of mosquito eggs. When the eggs were attached outdoors at high level of RH for long periods, the hatching rates will be decreased leading to a negative correlation of the entomological indices with two and three month previous minimum and maximum RH.</p><p>When considering the wind speed, negative correlations were observed between all three entomological indices of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> and current month average wind speed and these correlations were significant in Akbar Town study area. The negative correlations may be explained by the difficulties in finding breeding places as well as hosts for dengue vector mosquitoes due to suppressing of mosquito flights at higher wind speed. However, non-significant positive correlation was observed in HI and BI of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> with current month wind speed in Akbar Town and 3<sup>rd</sup> Kurana study area. The reason may be attributed to the indoor resting of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. Since the <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes are resting indoors, they can find a host easily for their blood feedings. Further, the <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes are reluctant to fly long distances and they prefer artificial breeding containers close to their resting household. In the entomological survey, many potential artificial breeding places were identified and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes can find better breeding container with the aid of wind speed. Meantime, positive correlations were observed between HI and BI of both the species with two months previous average wind speed and it was significant in 3<sup>rd</sup> Kurana study area for both the species and Eriyawetiya study area for <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>. These positive correlations may be explained by migration of dengue vector mosquitoes by air waves and wind. Even though the movements of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> was greatly affected by human activities, previous studies have mentioned that the wind currents may also advances the movements of large populations of mosquitoes [<xref rid="pone.0231408.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These positive correlations at lag 2 and 3 months of wind speed suggested that the possibility of movement of dengue vector mosquitoes from another area to study areas and emphasized areas of attention that has to be paid intensively during future vector control programmes [<xref rid="pone.0231408.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Correlations between entomological indices with reported dengue cases in the study areas</title><p>No significant correlations were observed with entomological indices of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> and reported patient cases. However, non-significant negative correlations were observed in the Eriyawetiya study area. This may be due to other vector control and source reduction activities conducted by the MOH office and residents in the study areas when there were dengue incidences. The Eriyawetiya study areas was highly affected by dengue and it was the highest number of dengue incidences reported study area among all study areas. The breeding places of dengue vector mosquitoes got reduced at the time of field surveys as the dwellers in the area removed potential breeding places from their households which lead to the reduction of potential breeding places of dengue vector mosquitoes even though the reported cases were higher [<xref rid="pone.0231408.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0231408.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Even though adult mosquitoes are the vectors of DENV, those entomological indices focus on immature stages of dengue vector mosquitoes. During vector control activities, some of the breeding places may be unidentified depending on level of personal expertise, restrictions of accessibility to household, limitations due to inadequate resources, etc. which lead to differences between actual adult population and larval indices. Although those possibilities were addressed in the current study, some restrictions were aroused during investigation in inside of households. This may lead to poor correlation between entomological indices and dengue incidences in the study areas.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Molecular identification of DENV transmitted by dengue mosquito vectors</title><p>Field-caught mosquitoes were tested by rRT-PCR assay.

(1992), the melting peaks for DENV-2-4 appeared around 82&#x000b0;C while a broad melting peak appeared for DENV-1. The broad peak appeared in DENV-1 may be due to the variations in the GC content at the 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; ends or binding differences of SYBR Green of the amplified products of DENV-1. During the detection of serotypes, demarcations of serotypes were not strong at low level resolution (steps of 0.4&#x000b0;C).

However, SYBR Green is a non-saturation fluorescence dye and it binds to dsDNA randomly. Since the size of the amplified product was 511 bp in length there is higher probability that the florescence curve developed from SYBR Green was not correlated proportionally with the amplified product as it can get attached to anywhere in the dsDNA.</p></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>Testing of field-caught dengue vector mosquitoes to detect DENV</title><p>The field-caught mosquitoes were tested using the developed rRT-PCR assay with primers developed by Lanciotti <italic>et al</italic>.

All glassware and crushing rods were rinsed thoroughly with DEPC treated water and autoclaved to remove residual DEPC.

Further, separate bench spaces, pipette sets and personal protection measures were followed.</p><p>During testing of mosquito pools, pools prepared with collected mosquitoes from Eriyawetiya study areas in June, 2017 were positive for the DENV. In June and July, 2017, Sri Lanka experienced the largest dengue epidemic reported so far with 110,370 dengue incidences with 301 dengue related deaths in the first seven months of the year 2017 [<xref rid="pone.0231408.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The epidemic peak was observed in the July, 2017 and during the epidemic peak, the highest number of dengue incidences were reported from the District of Gampaha [<xref rid="pone.0231408.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. When considering the reported dengue incidences in the Eriyawetiya study area, 41, 75 and 79 dengue incidences were reported in May, June and July months in 2017 respectively. During the entomological survey in June, 2017, 27 <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> and 4 <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes were collected and both the <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquito pools were positive for DENV. When detecting the infected serotypes, both the samples belonged to DENV2. These mosquitoes may infect DENV through horizontal transmission as there was a severe outbreak at study areas during this period of time.</p><p>None of the other <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito pools were positive for DENV in Eriyawetiya study area or other study and control areas. Further, none of the <italic>Aedes</italic> dengue vector mosquito eggs and larvae pools tested to detect vertical transmission of DENV were positive. The level of vertical transmission of DENV is rarely detected in the field even though the phenomenon is an important strategy to explain arboviral disease transmission in nature [<xref rid="pone.0231408.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0231408.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec031"><title>Importance of phylogeographic analysis</title><p>The genotyping PCR was performed for DENV positive samples to amplify complete E gene using the DENV2 specific primers. The derived E gene sequences generated from the positive mosquito pools were compared with the available DENV-2 gene sequences at NCBI GenBank database and multiple sequence alignment was prepared using the MAFFT 7 software which utilize the Fast Fourier transformation which generate the alignment faster and accurately. Substitution models are used to predict the rate of substitution for nucleotides at a given site together with the distribution of substitutions across the entire sequence during generation of phylogenetic trees. The GTR model, which is also known as the General Reversible (REV) model, is more complex type of models that assumes different rates of substitution for each pair of nucleotides, in addition to assuming different frequencies of occurrence of nucleotides. The result of the phylogenetic analysis illustrates that the E gene sequences of DENV2 obtained from two DENV positive mosquito pools belong to DENV2 Cosmopolitan Clade Ib. The virus strain was detected in Singapore since 2013 and it has been the dominant strain in South-East Asia, specially Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and China since August, 2015. Comparative sequence performed using network indicate that the sequences generated from the mosquito pools were grouped with a Singapore isolates (2013&#x02013;17) sub-clade variant 3 of clade Ib viruses which exhibits fixed substitutions of C1383T and T1464C, which caused the latest DENV-2 outbreak in Singapore during early 2016. Further, the BEAST analysis also indicated that the DENV clade Ib virus has migrated to Sri Lanka from the South-East Asian region. These evidences suggested recent introduction of this DENV strain to Sri Lanka and the cause for the epidemic in mid-2017. The DENV-2 clade Ib virus was reported to be the dominant viral strain since August, 2015 and it migrated to Sri Lanka approximately 2 years&#x02019; later. Since the virus strain was introduced to Sri Lanka recently and there was no herd immunity against the viral strain, the strain spread throughout the country increasing the number of dengue incidences rapidly until it reached an epidemic level. If there was a system in Sri Lanka to detect such migrations of virulent strains of DENV, the magnitude of the severity of the outbreak could be minimized with the aids of previous reports and literatures because most of times when there is an epidemic in an areas, the viral serotypes and genotypes as well as its virulence were reported to many WHO databases and online resources. Therefore, once a virulent genotype found, using the phylogeographic model, it is possible to analyze its spread and virulence at early stage of outbreak locally and control it before propagating into an epidemic. Furthermore, once the data gathered over few years, it is possible to identify recurrence of previously identified viral genotypes over the periods. This is mainly observed in after an epidemic. During an epidemic, most of times a viral genotype predominates other serotypes and genotypes when these epidemic strains introduced to the community recently. Therefore, there will be no enough herd immunity against the viral strain leading to rapid spread of the strain. Once the epidemic is over, where the herd immunity for the disease is mainly replaced by the epidemic strain, there is a possibility to overtake other already existing virulent DENV strains after a few years of silence. Since the population does not have enough herd immunity against those strains now, there is a higher possibility of another dengue outbreak, probably at lower magnitude as there is some level of herd immunity against the strain already in the population, due to reoccurrence of previously existing epidemic strains. These scenarios can be tracked using the developed phylogeographic model when it applied locally over some years and minimize spread of outbreaks at early stage.</p><p>District of Gampaha is located next to the District of Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka, where the highest number of dengue cases are reported every year. Previous studies mentioned that during the daily commute of residents in the District of Gampaha to the District of Colombo for work and other commercial purposes, they can be infected by dengue. However, these patients are reported under the District of Gampaha [<xref rid="pone.0231408.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. There is no proper mechanism to track these commute related infections so far in the country. Further, it is a great concern that the dengue cases were reported sporadically prior to its spread all over the country. The proposed phylogenetic approach can be the solution to detect migration patterns of DENV serotypes throughout the country. For example, when cases are reported from a remote area, the generated E gene sequences can be modelled to identify the similarities and mutation patterns and compared with the sequences from outbreak areas to detect a possible migration pattern. Therefore, it is possible to identify whether the same DENV strain has spread to new areas. This may lead to identification of significant mutations for successful proliferations of DENV and it is reported that most of the generated mutations in the DENV strains are not epidemic while epidemic strains successfully proliferate in the environment causing outbreaks and epidemics [<xref rid="pone.0231408.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In the scenario, the Colombo and Gampaha districts should not be considered separately as it can hinder many important evidences.</p><p>The fifth serotype of DENV has already been reported [<xref rid="pone.0231408.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0231408.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. If the serotype migrated to Sri Lanka where no prior cases are reported from the serotype and so no herd immunity, there is higher possibility of dengue epidemic depending on the virulence of the strain. A phylogeographyic model, like the one developed in the study, can detect the origin and distribution of the strains which will minimize the establishment of new DENV strains locally. This will enable utilize scare public health resources efficiently to minimize magnitudes of impending dengue epidemics.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec032"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the study, we identified a migrated DENV serotype 2, which belongs to the cosmopolitan Clade1b genotype leads the dengue epidemic in July, 2017 in Sri Lanka. This viral strain is the predominant strain in South-East Asian region since 2015. A real-time model of this approach can identify risks of virulent forms of DENV in early stage in individual clusters. Since the epidemiology and virulence of the DENV strain is known from previous areas, the spread of the disease can be minimized in the new area with more specified vector control and source reduction programmes managing scarce public health resources effectively. When the system is established in all areas, then it will be easy to identify the pattern of migrations of newly introduced DENV strains over the time in the country.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec033"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0231408.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Melting curve analysis of the first PCR.</title><p>A - DENV-1, B - DENV-2, C - DENV-3, D - DENV-1.
