Introduction</title><p>Africa is a large continent comprising 54 countries including some of the island nations within its geography. Various vector-borne and zoonotic virus diseases were reported from several African countries. Africa has a tropical climate, which enforces great diversity in its flora and fauna across the continent. The tropical climate, scarcity of resources, rampant poverty, and lack of knowledge coupled with cultural and traditional rituals and practices put many countries in the African continent at the edge of virus disease outbreaks. The high density of forest area and the tribes living within these forests mainly in west Africa, where human&#x02013;animal conflicts are frequently encountered, put the communities at risk of disease progression and dissemination. One of the most challenging viruses, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), was reported to be transmitted to hunter gatherers in the forests of west Africa after conflicts with non-human primates during hunting for bushmeat. The Pygmy and Bantu tribes living within the forests in Western Africa have witnessed rampant infections of HIV [<xref rid="B1-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The Ebola virus disease outbreak remains a global challenge and has recently been reported from several west African countries. An Ebola outbreak in non-human primates (chimpanzee and gorilla) as well as in the human population was reported from west Africa between 1994 and 2002 [<xref rid="B2-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. During the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, as of 4 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has identified a total of 3444 Ebola cases, including 3310 confirmed cases and 134 probable cases. A staggeringly high mortality rate of 65.74% was observed in Ebola cases, with 2264 deaths reported so far [<xref rid="B3-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A total of 1169 survivors are still under active care in the Democratic Republic of Congo [<xref rid="B3-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The incidence of animal&#x02013;human conflict and the close proximity to wild animals in the African wilderness were thought to be the primary factors behind the disease progression; however, human-to-human contact is another crucial factor for further disease dissemination [<xref rid="B2-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Monkeypox is another zoonotic viral disease with a high prevalence in west Africa. The dependence of the local population on bushmeat is one of the major driving factors behind the spread of monkeypox in west Africa. Apart from this, exposure to the body fluids of infected individuals is another mode of human-to-human transmission of the disease [<xref rid="B4-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Other parts of Africa have also reported different zoonotic virus diseases, including Rift Valley fever (RVFV), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHFV), West Nile virus (WNV) disease, avian influenza, and rabies among several other viral diseases [<xref rid="B5-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Countries all over Africa have reported different avian diseases affecting domestic and wild birds. Avian influenza is one of the most widely distributed avian viral diseases, which causes great economic losses to the poultry industry and an incipient threat to humans in the entire of Africa. The involvement of wild birds and waterfowls in the spread of avian influenza is well proven [<xref rid="B11-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Various species of waterfowls though notably those belonging to the orders of <italic>Anseriformes</italic> and <italic>Charadriiformes</italic> have been reported to be the reservoir of avian influenza viruses [<xref rid="B12-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. IAV infections in wild birds and poultry have been reported from several African countries, including South Africa [<xref rid="B5-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B13-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A recent incidence of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) in an ostrich farm located in Western Cape Province of South Africa almost decimated the ostrich industry in South Africa [<xref rid="B16-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Migratory wild birds have been reported to be responsible for the long-distance dissemination of highly-pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1 [<xref rid="B17-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Long-distance migration of wild birds is an important factor in the spread of avian influenza across the African continent [<xref rid="B18-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Migratory waterfowls from European countries overwinter in the Rift Valley of Kenya, which is known as one of the favorite destinations of migratory birds for over-wintering [<xref rid="B19-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The identification of a novel avian influenza virus H4N6 subtype from Kenya suggested that migratory water birds could act as a potential source of avian influenza transmission given that there was no earlier report of H4N6 subtype from the African continent [<xref rid="B19-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Since influenza virus strains can cross the species barrier and therefore may emerge as new strains and recombination, they have a broader host range. It is suggested that the segmented nature of the influenza A virus genome may facilitate its evolution through re-assortment and mutation, and through these mechanisms, viruses would switch between hosts or find a new host and adapt or evolve in the new host [<xref rid="B20-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Apart from poultry, swine farming is another large-scale industry in the African continent. The challenging aspect of swine farming is that swine are known to be a &#x02018;mixing vessel&#x02019; for several viruses, including influenza viruses, which are reported to cause disease outbreaks in swine as well as in humans [<xref rid="B20-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The evolutionary history of swine influenza viruses has been thoroughly investigated and reflects multiple introductions of these viruses into swine populations from other species [<xref rid="B24-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Pigs are reported to be susceptible to influenza virus infection with both human as well as avian strains of the virus, and most interestingly, have been reported to be an important host for virus ecology and interspecies transmission of the virus [<xref rid="B26-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The 2009 swine influenza H1N1 virus pandemic is thought to have originated from the avian strain, which was introduced into swine and further transmitted to humans [<xref rid="B20-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B23-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. There are various reports available on the incidence of influenza viruses worldwide, but only limited information is available from the African continent. Influenza A virus has recently been reported from pigs in Kenya [<xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Interestingly, pigs have recently been reported to be infected with the HPAIV H5N1 subtype in Nigeria [<xref rid="B30-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus in Nigeria, Ghana [<xref rid="B31-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], Cameroon [<xref rid="B32-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and Togo [<xref rid="B33-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Interestingly, swine were found positive for the HPAI H5N1 subtype and low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) H9N2 subtype in Egypt during 2014&#x02013;2015 [<xref rid="B34-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Currently, there is no information available on the prevalence of influenza viruses in pigs in South Africa.</p><p>Arboviruses, including yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus, and chikungunya virus infections have been reported from several African countries. These arboviruses are transmitted by mosquitoes and the abundance of mosquitoes in certain areas has resulted in a high incidence of these arboviruses [<xref rid="B35-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. West Nile virus (WNV) disease is a deadly zoonotic disease, which is thought to be transmitted by migratory birds into new regions [<xref rid="B8-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Mosquitoes of the genus <italic>Culex</italic> are reported to be the main reservoir of WNV [<xref rid="B36-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. WNV has successfully been isolated from white storks, which are migratory birds [<xref rid="B37-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Rift Valley fever (RVF) is another widely present disease in Africa, which largely affects ruminants [<xref rid="B38-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne disease, which develops hemorrhagic fever in the infected person with high fatality. CCHFV has been reported from several countries in the continent, including South Africa [<xref rid="B39-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Apart from these, there are countless other significant virus zoonotic diseases that are in circulation in the African continent. Given the potential of virus evolution through reassortment and host switching, monitoring and continuous active surveillance of the virus diseases should be of utmost importance. Currently, there is no comprehensive information available on the status of vector-borne and zoonotic virus diseases in the African continent. Therefore, in this systematic review, virus diseases&#x02019; incidence and viral disease outbreaks in the African continent were reviewed, which provides insight into the current status of viral zoonotic diseases and possible risks of viral disease outbreaks in Africa. This is the first systematic review to be reported from Africa about viral diseases, including the most important zoonotic and vector-borne viral diseases in the continent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-pathogens-09-00301"><title>2.

Search Strategy and Eligibility Criteria</title><p>Original research and review articles that reported virus zoonotic and vector-borne diseases in humans and other species in localities within the African continent were searched for any available records published until 25 September 2019. Only original research, natural case reports, or review articles were included in this systematic review. Experimental studies that did not report natural cases were excluded from this study. The articles were primarily searched through four databases, including National Library of Medicine, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NLM-NCBI)-PubMed, Google Scholar, the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED), and SCOPUS. The reported virus diseases in humans, livestock, wild birds, wild animals, pets, poultry, and slaughterhouses were screened. Initially, the databases were searched using variation of the search terms (&#x0201c;Zoonotic virus diseases in Africa&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Virus zoonoses in Africa&#x0201d;). Later, the search terms were further extended to search through the databases with individual country names for all the 54 countries that are located either within mainland African continent or its island nations. Therefore, the search terms were extended to, e.g., &#x0201c;Virus zoonosis in South Africa&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Zoonotic virus diseases in South Africa&#x0201d;, as well as &#x0201c;Virus zoonotic diseases in Zimbabwe&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Virus zoonotic diseases in Madagascar&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Virus zoonotic diseases in Mozambique&#x0201d;, and so on for all 54 African countries, including the island nations of Mauritius, Seychelles, Comoros island including Mayotte and Anjouan, as well as Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, and La Reunion islands for the zoonotic virus diseases that were reported up until 25 September 2019. Full-length research or review articles were collected for this systematic review. Articles reported from outside Africa or those articles that did not report virus zoonosis within the African continent were not included for the drafting this systematic review. Additionally, editorials, conference proceedings, and articles in a language other than English were excluded from this systematic review. The article titles that reported a virus or zoonotic virus disease(s) in humans, domestic or wild animals, and birds were downloaded and stored for further refinement to be included in this study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-pathogens-09-00301"><title>2.3.

The frequency distribution of the different reported virus diseases from African countries is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00301-f004">Figure 4</xref>.</p><sec id="sec3dot1dot1-pathogens-09-00301"><title>3.1.1. Comoros Island</title><p>Anjouan is part of the Comoros island nation in the Mozambique channel, located in the Indian Ocean between the southern African mainland and Madagascar in the eastern part of Africa. A study included 21 samples from different bat species, including blood from live bats species of <italic>Miniopterus griveaudi</italic> and <italic>Chaerephon pusillus</italic> and brain tissues from dead bats, to investigate the prevalence of lyssaviruses. These bats were primarily hunted for bushmeat purposes. Initially, the sera samples collected from bats were heated for 30 min at 56 &#x000b0;C to inactivate the complement and then lyssavirus-neutralizing antibodies were detected in the samples using a miniaturized rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT). Additionally, real-time RT-PCR was conducted to detect lyssavirus RNA in the bat samples using specific oligonucleotide primers targeting a conserved sequence of nucleoprotein gene of lyssaviruses under investigation, including Lagos bat lyssavirus (LBV), Duvenhage lyssavirus (DUVV), European bat lyssavirus-1 (EBLV-1), as well as rabies lyssavirus (RABV). In this study, only two bat sera samples were positive for LBV seroprevalence while two other sera were positive for DUVV prevalence out of eight samples that were tested. None of the samples were positive for lyssavirus RNA by real-time RT-PCR [<xref rid="B41-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Many other viruses (Ebola, coronavirus, rabies, etc.) were reported to be transmitted due to exposure to or consumption of wild animals. The eating of or exposure to wild animals always puts humans at risk of zoonotic virus disease transmission.</p><p>Mayotte is one of the French islands and is a part of the Comoros island nation. A lyssavirus seroprevalence study was conducted in this region, targeting insectivorous and frugivorous bats between 2010 and 2015. Twenty-two sera samples were collected from the bats in Mayotte and samples were processed for lyssavirus diagnostics. Initially, sera samples were heated for 30 min at 56 &#x000b0;C to inactivate the complement and then lyssavirus-neutralizing antibodies were detected in the samples using the miniaturized RFFIT method. Additionally, real-time RT-PCR was conducted to detect lyssavirus RNA in the bat samples. As a result, two positive sera samples were observed for both LBV and DUVV antibodies in this investigation. The RNA samples were also screened for lyssavirus prevalence, but all were negative with real-time RT-PCR. Past exposure of bats to the lyssavirus was identified, hence any human&#x02013;bat interaction may put humans at risk of disease transmission [<xref rid="B41-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot1dot2-pathogens-09-00301"><title>3.1.2.

Fifteen sera samples from patients having high fever, headache, joint or muscular pain, and anorexia, which are typical dengue fever symptoms, were collected from Agordet district, where the first outbreak was reported in 2005. Additionally, 26 sera samples were collected from clinical patients in Massawa district, where the second outbreak was reported in 2010. Serological investigation showed that five samples collected from Agordet district and 23 samples collected from Massawa district were positive for dengue virus antibodies.

Serological investigation based on immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies detected MERS-CoV in 93% and 97% of the juveniles and adults, respectively. A total of 175 sera samples were found positive for MERS-CoV.

RT-PCR diagnostics detected 17 swine samples that were positive for caliciviruses. The PCR amplicons were purified on agarose gel and four of the RT-PCR-positive samples were sequenced using Sanger sequencing. Sequence analysis identified two human norovirus genomes as well as two porcine sapovirus sequences. The occurrence of human norovirus sequences in domestic pigs suggested the transmission events of noroviruses from humans to swine in Ethiopia. This represents a reverse zoonotic disease transmission (zooanthroponosis) and was the first investigation of the prevalence of enteric caliciviruses in Ethiopian domestic swine [<xref rid="B48-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot1dot5-pathogens-09-00301"><title>3.1.5.

Fecal swabs were collected from 2630 individual birds and pooled into 516 samples (3 to 5 samples per pool) for testing with real-time RT-PCR. A total of 12 pools (2.3%) were found positive for the matrix gene sequence of avian influenza virus. However, none of the pools were positive for the H5 or H7 subtypes, but, interestingly, two pools were positive for the H4N6 virus. This is an interesting observation because there was no earlier report of H4N6 virus from the African continent [<xref rid="B19-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

Overall, 1491 swine swab, 3863 chicken swab, 172 swine sera, and 1894 chicken sera samples were collected. Additionally, sera and swabs were also collected from other domestic animals and birds, including dogs, cats, ducks, and turkeys. Serology using ELISA using specific anti-IAV antibodies identified one cat, two chickens, three dogs, three ducks, and 13 pigs that were seropositive for IAV antibodies. Real-time RT-PCR for the matrix gene of IAV detected 24 chickens, four dogs, five ducks, and 11 pigs that were positive for the active infection. Subtyping using real-time RT-PCR for the HA and NA genes identified that eight pigs were infected with the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus identified in pigs was closely related to the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, which has been in circulation in the human population in Kenya since 2009. Therefore, this investigation suggested a reverse zoonotic transmission of the A(H1N1)pdm 09 virus from humans to pigs in the country [<xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>During January&#x02013;June 2018, 1163 plasma and nasal swab samples were collected from dromedary camels across 13 counties in Kenya. Most of the samples were collected from counties located in northern Kenya bordering with the Republic of Somalia. ELISA followed by a microneutralization (MN) assay using Vero B4 non-human primate cell lines identified 792 plasma samples that were positive for the MERS-CoV antibodies. Active infection of MERS-CoV was detected in only 11 nasal swab samples. Using Vero cells, two MERS-CoV isolates were successfully retrieved for whole-genome sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis found that these MERS-CoV sequences were distinct from the sequences reported from the Arabian Peninsula. This study was the first report of the MERS-CoV whole genome sequence from Kenya [<xref rid="B54-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].

In a surveillance to assess the prevalence of BTV in Madagascar, 4493 sera samples from cattle and small ruminants, including goat and sheep, as well as 12,785 adult mosquitoes were collected during August 2008 and April 2009. Mosquitoes were divided into 390 pools, grinded, and the supernatant was used for viral analysis. Virus isolation from the supernatant of mosquito pools was carried out using mosquito AP61 cell lines. Further, the supernatant from mosquito pools were tested for virus identification using an indirect immunofluorescence assay, which revealed that one of the pools of <italic>Anopheles squamosus</italic> mosquitoes was positive for BTV infection. Interestingly, 136 cattle had antibodies against BTV while 39 samples were seronegative. This was the first report of BTV circulation from Madagascar [<xref rid="B57-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].

Serological and genetic studies based on mitochondrial (cytochrome b) and nuclear DNA analyses reported that the panmictic continental population of <italic>E. helvum</italic> would facilitate virus transmission across its colonies in the African continent, including Tanzania [<xref rid="B60-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Urine, blood, and wing biopsy samples were collected from 263 bats in Tanzania. Nipah virus (NiV)-specific antibodies confirmed 117 seropositive samples. Microsatellite genotyping revealed high levels of allelic heterozygosity (0.75 &#x000b1; 0.25) but low mitochondrial DNA diversity (0.011 &#x000b1; 0.0011) among Tanzanian samples [<xref rid="B60-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. This investigation concluded that the <italic>E. helvum</italic> population across the sample sites in African continent, including sites in Tanzania, represented panmictic continental populations.

ELISA test was used to detect rabies virus antibodies in 94 samples. However, most of the households were aware of rabies but were not aware of its wide host range. The seroprevalence of rabies virus in dogs in households puts household members at risk of contracting the virus. This would explain the high death rate (1500 people per year) each year due to rabies virus infection in Tanzania [<xref rid="B70-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot1dot14-pathogens-09-00301"><title>3.1.14. Uganda</title><p>There were two Ebola virus disease outbreaks reported from Uganda. The first outbreak was reported from Gulu in the year 2000 where 425 cases were reported with 224 deaths; Ebolavirus-Sudan (EBOV-S) was the etiological agent of this outbreak. The second outbreak was reported in November-December 2007 in Bundibugyo where 116 confirmed cases with 30 fatalities were reported; Ebolavirus-Bundibugyo (EBOV-B) was the etiological agent behind this outbreak [<xref rid="B71-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In this study, the migration of bats was correlated with the outbreaks in African countries, including Uganda. The hunting and trade of bats for meat in these regions was considered a major risk factor for disease transmission. Additionally, human-to-human transmission can also not be ruled out [<xref rid="B71-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Interestingly, a large Ebola outbreak erupted in Uganda in early 2019, but fortunately, it was quickly contained.

From February to September 2013, three different phases of a rhinovirus C outbreak among the chimpanzee population appeared in Uganda.

The autopsy of a dead infant chimpanzee revealed that the morphology of lung parenchyma was affected, with hepatic congestion and hepatomegaly. It was observed that this infant chimpanzee died due to pneumonia. The deep sequencing analysis found the sequences of rhinovirus C, which was further confirmed using real time RT-PCR. Interestingly, it was observed that the Kibale National Park where the community of these chimpanzees is based is usually visited by a number of tourists, researchers, and other local people living nearby the reserve, hence the possibility of transmission of the disease from contact appears to be the most likely transmission pathway [<xref rid="B73-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].</p><p>A study reported the transmission dynamics and persistence of zoonotic henipaviruses in <italic>E. helvum</italic> bat populations in Uganda [<xref rid="B60-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].

This child reported fever, abdominal pain, and headache, which worsened as days passed by. The patient went into a coma after two weeks of the onset of the disease. Diagnosis was carried out for the possible viral and bacterial diseases being circulated in the region but were negative [<xref rid="B74-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Hence, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples were used for viral metagenomic sequencing to investigate the possible etiological agent of the disease. However, the bulk of the sequence could not identify a probable virus, but two short reads exhibited some similarity with several orthobunyavirus genome L-segments [<xref rid="B74-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Therefore, the technique of genome walking was used to further extend these reads up to 936 nucleotides. An orthobunyavirus known as Tataguine virus appeared to share some similarity with this 936-nucleotide sequence, but still there was significant genetic variation and thus, this sequence was considered of a novel orthobunyavirus, which was termed as Ntwetwe virus based on the name of the village of the patient. Ntwetwe virus was most likely referred to as an arbovirus vectored by <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes. There has not been any other case of Ntwetwe virus from this region; hence, the case of this girl child was a rare and unique event. The study suggested that mosquitoes or an animal reservoir might be the probable source of transmission of this virus disease [<xref rid="B74-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].</p><p>WNV was first reported from the West Nile district of Uganda in the year 1937 [<xref rid="B75-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>].

A few cases have also been reported having polio-like symptoms with WNV infection [<xref rid="B76-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. WNV has been reported to be vectored by <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes. Certain avian species are considered as the reservoir host for WNV.

A sero-surveillance was initiated, which included 338 cattle, 323 sheep, and 336 goats. Anti-IgG ELISA was conducted to assess the seroprevalence of RVFV antibodies in the collected samples. The results revealed that 70 cattle were seropositive for RVFV along with 22 sheep and 12 goats. The outcome of this investigation suspected the zoonotic spread of the disease in Kisoro district [<xref rid="B9-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Patients visiting outpatient departments of different Ugandan hospitals during July 2009 through February 2010 and then July 2010 through April 2011 suffering from fever, sore throat, and cough were enrolled in a surveillance for influenza virus diagnostics. Samples were collected from the patients and screened for A(H1N1)pdm09 virus using the real-time RT-PCR assay. The positive samples were used for virus isolation; as a result, 199 virus isolates were retrieved. The genomes of virus isolates were also sequenced. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses identified 73 A(H1N1)pdm09 virus isolates [<xref rid="B77-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Since A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was the etiological agent of the 2009 influenza pandemic, the large number of virus isolates recovered in Ugandan people suggested a travel-related outbreak in the region.</p><p>In January 2017, high mortality was observed in white-winged black terns in Wakiso district of Uganda. Internal organs as well as oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs from dead birds were collected and investigated for IAV infections. Wild birds exhibited the clinical symptoms of torticollis, depression, lethargy, and convulsions just before death. Since the tern samples were positive for the IAV, subtyping for H5 virus was done, which identified few H5-positive tern samples. Immediately after this outbreak in terns, the disease was also observed in chickens and ducks in Masaka district. Eighteen clinical samples obtained from chickens and ducks were investigated. Molecular investigation followed by sequencing identified the H5N8 virus in 17 samples. Phylogenetic analysis identified a high similarity (99.5%) of Ugandan H5N8 virus sequences with the H5N8 sequences reported from the Democratic Republic of Congo and a relatively lower identity (98.8&#x02013;99.1%) with the H5N8 virus sequences reported in 2017 from Egypt and South Africa [<xref rid="B78-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. This observation suggested a bird migration-related spread of H5N8 virus in the African continent. To summarize, a high percent positivity has been reported for avian influenza virus, mamastrovirus, Nipah virus, Ntwetwe virus, and WNV from Uganda (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00301-f006">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot1dot15-pathogens-09-00301"><title>3.1.15.

Thirty-two diarrheic dogs that were taken to a veterinary hospital in Lusaka, Zambia were included in the study. Fecal samples were taken from these dogs and total DNA was extracted, which was subjected to conventional PCR reaction to amplify a 583-bp region of the VP2 gene of CPV. The amplicons were gel-purified and sequenced. This study found 23 samples were positive for CPV infection mostly in unvaccinated dogs. Three variants of CPV viz., CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c were identified, with the highest prevalence of the CPV-2c variant in the diarrheic dogs. Interestingly, variant CPV-2a showed a 100% sequence identity at the nucleotide level with the CPV-2a variant reported from India in the year 2012 while the CPV-2c variant was highly identical to the CPV-2c variant reported from Argentina in the year 2011. Intriguingly, the study found that while all three variants of CPV were co-circulating in the country, the highest predominance was of CPV-2c, which was detected in 91.3% of the CPV-positive samples.

Samples were subjected to the direct fluorescent antibody test (DFAT) followed by nested PCR for the detection of the N and G genes of rabies virus. Interestingly, all of the samples tested in this study were positive for rabies virus N and G genes, with only one exception where one dog was positive for the G gene and was negative for the N gene through nested PCR. Overall, this investigation showed a 100% prevalence of rabies virus in the brain tissues of dead animals and the human sample, which reflected a serious threat of rabies to humans as well as other domestic animals and wildlife in the country [<xref rid="B85-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>].</p><p>Fresh fecal samples from 51 healthy wild white pelicans were collected in August 2006 from Lochinvar National Park located in the Southern province of Zambia. Virus isolation followed by HI and NI subtyping identified one isolate to be avian influenza virus H3N6 subtype. For genetic analysis, the complete genome was amplified using RT-PCR. Amplicons were purified from agarose gel and sequenced using Sanger sequencing. The PB2, HA, and NS genes were highly similar with the H3N6 virus reported from a duck in South Africa, which would be due to reassortment, which might have occurred within sub-Saharan Africa because of the interaction of wild birds sharing the intra-African flyways [<xref rid="B86-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. In another investigation, 3094 fecal samples from wild waterfowls, pelicans, wild ducks, and geese were collected from Lochinvar National Park during April 2008 and November 2009. The investigation identified three subtypes of avian influenza viruses viz., H6N2, H3N8, and H11N9, in wild ducks. Subtypes of H3N8, H4N6, and H11N9 were also isolated from geese.

Forty-eight blood and spleen tissue samples were taken from Zambian malbrouck monkeys, 25 from chacma baboons, and 23 from yellow baboons. The mitochondrial cytochrome b gene was sequenced to determine the species of non-human primates. A plaque reduction neutralization test was conducted to investigate the prevalence of Zika virus, YFV, and tick-borne encephalitis virus, which resulted in a total of 33 Zika virus-positive samples. More precisely, 16 of the Zambian malbrouck monkeys, 12 of the chacma baboons, and 5 of the yellow baboons were seropositive for the Zika virus antibodies. In contrast, all spleen tissues were negative for Zika virus and YFV using real-time RT-PCR, which reflected a negative active infection.

Children with ILI reported a fever, cough, and sore throat. SARI cases reported having a fever, cough, and/or difficulty in breathing. RNA was extracted from the collected samples for the detection of IAV by real-time RT-PCR followed by IAV subtyping. Real-time RT-PCR samples with a cycle threshold (Ct) value up to 30 were considered for HA gene sequencing. The molecular investigation identified 112 IAV-positive children suffering from influenza-like illness while 12 children were IAV positive and suffering from the severe acute respiratory infection.

Ebola virus infection is known to cause hemorrhagic fever in humans, with high fatality. Apart from Ebola virus, Cote d&#x02019;Ivoire has also been hit by monkeypox. Up to 1990, two confirmed human cases of MPXV had been reported from the country [<xref rid="B96-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>,<xref rid="B97-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. One common practice that has been reported from the MPXV outbreak-prone belt of the African continent is that monkeys are eaten as a delicacy, which may be a significant source of disease transmission apart from other activities, like hunting and butchering.</p><p>A Western blot and PCR-based investigation revealed frequent infection of simian foamy virus (SFV) in free-living chimpanzees in Tai National Park. This study reported 12 chimpanzees having SFV infection out of 14 samples [<xref rid="B98-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. This study also suggested a high risk of interspecies transmission of the virus in the nearby rural population. In another investigation, HIV-1 and HIV-2 lineages were reported in the rural population surrounding the Tai National Park while simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections were reported from the monkeys. Interestingly, an eight-year-old boy was reported to have fed upon bushmeat and was found positive for HIV-2; which would be the most probable source of infection [<xref rid="B99-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>].</p><p>In a surveillance for influenza virus infections among human population during 1999&#x02013;2014, 344 cases of A (H1N1)pdm 09 virus, 171 human infections of H3N2 subtype of IAV, and 446 cases of IBV infections were reported [<xref rid="B52-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Interestingly, no human cases of H1N1 influenza viruses were reported from the country in this period. Another investigation during 2009&#x02013;2010 which included a total of 12,493 oropharyngeal and cloacal swab samples from birds, which were subjected to IAV diagnostics using the RT-PCR assay, and it was reported that all tested samples were found to be negative for the IAV-active infection. Additionally, 1283 sera samples were collected from birds and subjected to serological testing using ELISA and HI assays. All the sera samples were also found to be negative for the IAV antibodies. Further, 457 pig sera samples were subjected to ELISA, HI test, and RT-PCR but none were found to be positive for the IAV infection. Additionally, out of 1548 swine nasal swab samples that were tested, none were positive for the IAV infection [<xref rid="B91-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. These findings suggested a lack of prevalence of IAV during the study period.</p><p>In a large-scale surveillance of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and infectious bronchitis virus during 2010&#x02013;2012, tracheal and cloacal swab samples were collected from 14,508 backyard chickens, 7322 commercial chickens, 650 ducks, and 326 guinea fowls. Additionally, 1943 sera samples were also collected from different birds. Infectious bronchitis virus antibodies were detected in 1401 sera samples using the ELISA test while 420 sera samples had NDV antibodies using the HI test. Nested PCR was conducted using random hexamers to assess the prevalence of NDV and infectious bronchitis virus in tracheal and cloacal swabs, which detected 363 and 272 infectious bronchitis virus-positive pools in the backyard chickens and commercial chickens, respectively. Sixteen pools from duck samples and 15 pools from guinea fowl samples were also positive for the infectious bronchitis virus infection. On the other hand, 421 pools from backyard chicken samples while 230 pools from commercial chicken samples were positive for the NDV disease. Fourteen pools from ducks and five pools from guinea fowls were positive for NDV. Therefore, this investigation identified NDV and infectious bronchitis virus in backyard and commercial poultry, ducks, and guinea fowls during 2010&#x02013;2012 [<xref rid="B100-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>].</p><p>Briefly, Ebola virus, MPXV, and SFV infections were predominantly present in Cote d&#x02019;Ivoire.

Two samples (4%) were found to be positive for H3N2 antibodies [<xref rid="B102-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. In another study, nasal swab samples collected at a Kumasi abattoir during January to March 2014 were investigated for A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, which identified five A(H1N1)pdm09 virus-positive samples [<xref rid="B31-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This finding speculated that there might be an incidence of zoonotic transmission of A(H1N1)pdm09 to the exposed swine workers [<xref rid="B31-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In a more recent investigation, 19 pig handlers working either at an abattoir or piggeries were enrolled for an investigation aimed at the detection of IAV. Simultaneously, nasal swab samples from 132 pigs were collected from an abattoir and piggeries in Kumasi during 2014&#x02013;2015. The one-step RT-PCR for matrix gene detection followed by HA subtyping using one-step RT-PCR confirmed that two swineworkers were infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. One of these infections was from an abattoir worker while the other infection was from a piggery worker. Interestingly, 13 pig samples were also found to be positive for A(H1N1)pdm09 virus while three pig samples were infected with H3N2 virus. These findings suggested a probable zoonotic transmission of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus between swine handlers and the pigs under investigation [<xref rid="B103-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>].</p><p>Forty-eight samples, including tracheal swabs and tissues from the lung, brain, spleen, and trachea, were collected from 44 different poultry farms between November 2017 and January 2018. Samples were tested for IAV using the RT-PCR with matrix gene as well as for H5, H7, and H7 subtypes along with IBV and NDV. In this investigation, seven complete IAV genomes and one sequence of the HA cleavage site of IAV were successfully recovered along with one partial S1 gene of IBV. Sequence analyses identified the H9N2 subtype of IAV in the poultry samples. Additionally, H9N2 virus was successfully isolated from two of the samples [<xref rid="B104-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. A highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza virus H5N1 was reported from symptomatic chickens after an outbreak in the Accra region. A high mortality rate of 17.6% was reported in chickens. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of the different genes identified that the strain responsible for the avian influenza outbreak in chickens in Ghana belongs to the same clade responsible for the Nigerian avian influenza outbreak of 2015 [<xref rid="B14-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by Lassa virus, which has an incubation period of 1&#x02013;3 weeks. The initial symptoms include fever and weakness in the early stage followed by headache, muscle pain, sore throat, diarrhea, and abdominal pain in the following days. The advanced stage symptoms may include seizures, disorientation, shock, and even coma [<xref rid="B105-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. The first case of Lassa fever in Ghana was a 19-year-old male who was a farmer and an active hunter. He felt febrile and had chills along with joint pain for about three days. He went on hunting with another household member and had a rat meal while he was symptomatic. His condition worsened over the next three weeks and he was hospitalized, where his condition became complicated and he died. The RT-PCR investigation of the patient&#x02019;s blood confirmed an infection with Lassa virus [<xref rid="B105-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Interestingly, the second case was a 24-year-old male who had no contact with the first patient. He developed fever and had yellowish sputum with chest pain. Soon, his condition deteriorated, and he started vomiting blood and bloody sputum, following which he died in the hospital within hours. His blood sample was analyzed and found to be positive for Lassa virus infection [<xref rid="B105-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. These two cases indicate that Lassa fever is a fatal hemorrhagic zoonotic virus disease and suggested that contact with or eating rats may trigger zoonosis.</p><p>The straw-colored fruit bat (<italic>Eidolon helvum</italic>) has been reported to be a reservoir for several zoonotic virus infections, including those of henipaviruses. This bat species has been documented to exist in proximity of human populations in Accra [<xref rid="B60-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. An investigation reported the detection of 369 straw-colored fruit bat samples that had Nipah virus antibodies [<xref rid="B60-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The tendency of this bat species to feed nearby human populations put humans at risk of potential exposure to its excreta, body fluids, and tissues, which raises the concern of zoonosis and public health. In another study, urine samples of from straw-colored fruit bats were collected from Accra during September to November 2010, which were used for virus isolation. Sera samples were also collected at two different times in 2007 and 2010. Sera were also collected from humans living nearby bat roost in Accra or from those who were involved in the hunting or butchering of bats. Novel paramyxoviruses named AchPV1 and AchPV2 were isolated from the bats [<xref rid="B67-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. To assess the zoonotic potential of the Achimota virus, 216 healthy human subjects were sampled. Sera of two febrile individuals reacted against the AchPV2 antibodies, which indicated the zoonotic potential of this novel bat-borne paramyxovirus (Achimota virus) and its ability of cross-species transmission to humans [<xref rid="B67-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p><p>Human cases of rabies were recorded in Ghana.

A total of 150 sera samples were first tested with ELISA. Then, 32 anti-IgM ELISA-positive samples were further tested with real-time RT-PCR using total RNA extracted from these samples, which confirmed four dengue virus-positive samples out of the 32 tested. These four patients, comprising two males and two females in the range of 30&#x02013;56 years of age, had unexplained bleeding of the gums, muscle and/or joint pain, with fever and headache. Three of the patients belonged to southern Ghana while the fourth belonged to Burkina Faso, who sought medical help in the northern part of the country. The genome sequences of the RT-PCR-positive dengue virus cases showed similarity to the sequences reported from Senegal and India. This study reported two different dengue virus serotypes in circulation in Ghana among Ebola virus-suspected cases during 2014 to 2016 [<xref rid="B107-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Further, 160 archived sera samples from patients who reported fever with arthritis or conjunctivitis or arthralgia between December 2016 and November 2017 in a hospital in Accra were tested for Zika virus anti-IgM and anti-IgG ELISA tests. Interestingly, 30 sera samples were found to be positive for IgM antibodies while three samples were positive for IgG antibodies, resulting in an overall seroprevalence of 20.6% (33/160 patients) [<xref rid="B108-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>].

It was reported that the disease spread through human-to-human contact and siblings within households were found to be positive for the Ebola virus [<xref rid="B109-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. The disease affected people from different age groups and across different occupations. The 2014 Ebola epidemic was reported to be the fourth largest epidemic in the African continent [<xref rid="B109-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Until 4 May 2015, 3529 cases of Ebola were reported from Guinea. It was reported that a large number (892 or 25.3%) of the cases had a history of contact with those who were infected with the disease [<xref rid="B110-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. This contact happened either at funerals or within the household. Forty people (4.5%) from Guinea reported having contact at the funeral with the corpse, which was the most likely event to transmit the disease, while 571 (64%) people reported an exposure during a non-funeral context, which was basically either in the household or at work. Interestingly, 281 (31.5%) cases reported both types of exposure, funeral and non-funeral [<xref rid="B110-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. This investigation made it very clear that the Ebola virus disease is highly zoonotic and has great potential to spread among the population exposed to it by any means.</p><p>In a rare case, an Ebola virus transmission from mother to child was reported in Dubreka. In August 2015, a nine-month-old female infant developed fever, vomiting, cough, and diarrhea. After preliminary symptomatic treatment, her condition was stable for the next five days, which later deteriorated with severe diarrhea and vomiting. The infant quickly developed respiratory distress while being shifted to the University Hospital but died on the way. Her buccal swab test was positive for Ebola virus by RT-PCR. The genome of this virus matched with the Sierra-Leone 3 lineage, which was endemic in the region of her residence during May&#x02013;July 2015 [<xref rid="B111-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. To trace the source of infection, the deceased infant&#x02019;s parents were tested for Ebola virus infection using body fluid samples. Surprisingly, the mother&#x02019;s breast milk was found to be positive for Ebola virus RNA using real-time PCR with a threshold cycle (Ct) value of 23.3. Following sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, it was found that the virus from the breast milk was closely related to the virus from the infant&#x02019;s buccal swab. More interestingly, both isolates shared two unique single-nucleotide polymorphisms [<xref rid="B111-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Hence, it became evident that the transmission happened to the infant through breast feeding from the mother. RT-PCR-based diagnostics confirmed that the virus was also present in the seminal fluid of the father of the infant. Sequencing revealed that this virus was part of the Sierra-Leone 3 lineage but was not close to the virus isolates from the infant and the mother [<xref rid="B111-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. This was a rare incident reporting the Ebola virus transmission to an infant from the mother via breast feeding.</p><p>In October 2015, another case of Ebola virus disease appeared from Conakry, where a case patient had a loss of appetite with fever and started bleeding from the nose four days after being symptomatic. He shared a small household with a relative who was an Ebola virus disease survivor. An RT-PCR-based investigation revealed that he was positive for the Ebola virus. Since it was a known fact that Ebola virus can be shed in survivors&#x02019; semen for a long period of time [<xref rid="B112-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>], therefore, in this case, sexual transmission of the virus within the marriage was suspected. Upon investigation, the woman&#x02019;s serum was found to be positive for the Ebola virus antibodies with the ELISA test. The genome sequence of this virus revealed that the virus did not belong to the circulating clade of Sierra-Leone 3 in that area; rather, it belonged to another lineage GN1 [<xref rid="B113-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Hence, the findings of this study inferred that in this case, the survivor most likely transmitted the Ebola virus to the woman sexually. Since these people within the same household shared facilities under unhygienic conditions, this would be the most probable reason of disease transmission to the case [<xref rid="B113-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>].</p><p>In another study, 76 days after the WHO announced the end of the Ebola epidemic in Guinea, three deceased probable Ebola virus cases came to the notice of the authorities during 27 February to 15 March 2016 [<xref rid="B114-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. The investigation learned about new cases of the disease, which were transmitted among the family members of the three patients who recently died of the disease. By the end of April 2016, there were seven confirmed and three likely cases of the Ebola virus disease in the region, eight of which died during treatment. Since these people lived in the forest region, a spillover event from a wild animal reservoir was suspected. To rule out any speculations, the blood samples from two confirmed cases were collected and sequenced. The analysis confirmed that neither sequences belonged to the Sierra-Leone 3 nor GN1 clusters but were associated with the sequences reported during the 2014 outbreak [<xref rid="B114-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Hence, these results ruled out the possibility of transmission from an animal reservoir. Further investigation revealed that one of the survivors had sexual contact with the deceased first case as well as other sexual partners. It was noted that this survivor&#x02019;s seminal fluid sample was positive for Ebola virus, with a Ct value of 23.4 on 21 March 2016, which was again positive with a Ct value of 32.4 on 9 April 2016. The survivor&#x02019;s seminal fluid was collected on 21 March 2016 and viral RNA was sequenced; the results showed identical sequences from both survivors. Sequences from the other cases confirmed that the disease cluster was linked to the survivor, who sexually transmitted the disease to other individuals. Intriguingly, the molecular assays and sequencing provided evidence that the Ebola virus was persistently present in the survivor&#x02019;s seminal fluid between 26 October 2014 and 9 April 2016. This was new information indicating that Ebola virus was persistent in the seminal fluid of the patient who was cleared of infection following the standard protocol even after 531 days of the first diagnosis, the longest period reported so far [<xref rid="B114-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>].</p><p>A surveillance study reported 22 confirmed cases of Lassa virus infection in Guinea out of 311 suspected cases. An 18% fatality rate was reported for the Lassa fever cases [<xref rid="B115-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. The most common disease symptoms included a sore throat, edema, and sudden hearing loss, among others. Interestingly, 43 cases had seroprevalence for the Lassa virus IgG antibodies, which was an evidence for past exposure of these cases to the disease [<xref rid="B115-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Another surveillance study was conducted to find out the animal reservoir of the Lassa virus in Guinea [<xref rid="B116-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Across seven bush sites, 1616 small mammals, mainly including rodent species of <italic>Mastomys</italic> and <italic>R. rattus</italic> among others, were captured from households across the study area. In total, 96 rodents were found to be positive for Lassa virus antibodies in their sera samples while 46 were detected with Lassa virus antigen in the sera [<xref rid="B116-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. This study suggested that Lassa virus may transmit to human populations from these infected rodent species found in households.</p><p>After the outbreak of an influenza-like illness, a surveillance that included the collection of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs was conducted during 2009&#x02013;2010. Clinical samples from 166 symptomatic patients were collected. This study identified five IBV-positive patients while 15 patients were found to be infected with IAV. More precisely, nine patients were found to be infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus while six patients were positive for influenza virus H3N2 subtype. The IAV and IBV isolates retrieved in this study could not be sequenced given the poor quality of the clinical specimen and virus isolation [<xref rid="B95-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2dot8-pathogens-09-00301"><title>3.2.8.

It is believed that HTLV-1 originated in Africa from monkeys in the wild and was transmitted to humans as a result of animal&#x02013;human contact due to the social and cultural practices in rural communities. Rural Guinea-Bissau has been reported to have a 5% HTLV-1 prevalence in West Africa, which is the highest known prevalence in the region. Unfortunately, due to a lack of genomic data, information on the circulating subtypes of the virus was unknown until recently. The pattern of transmission within communities was also unknown. Hence, to find out the disease epidemiology and transmission patterns of HTLV-1, adults and children from the Caio community in the country were sampled. The status of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 was determined through the ELISA test. The outcome was further confirmed with PCR using tax/rex gene-specific primers. Additionally, the long terminal repeat (LTR) and p24 regions of the virus genome were sequenced for 72 individual samples to analyze the disease [<xref rid="B117-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Based on the LTR sequences, phylogenetic investigation confirmed the presence of the HTLV-1 subtype 1a in majority of the Caio sequences. However, interestingly, one virus sequence was divergent and was found to be closely related to the HTLV-1 subtype 1g, which was basically isolated from a hunter in Cameroon. This finding was further supported by analyzing the p24 sequences obtained from 36 individuals [<xref rid="B117-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. This was the first report of a novel HTLV-1 subtype 1g from Guinea-Bissau and it was speculated that transmission probably happened either through human-to-human contact or from the wild.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2dot9-pathogens-09-00301"><title>3.2.9.

These contacts happened either at funeral events or within the household. Forty-nine people (2.4%) reported having contact at funeral events with the corpse, which was the most likely reason to transmit the disease, while 1717 (82.6%) people reported an exposure during a non-funeral context, which was basically either in the household or at work. Interestingly, 312 (15%) cases reported both types of exposure, funeral and non-funeral [<xref rid="B110-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>].

There was a male survivor of the Ebola virus disease whose brother and estranged wife were also positive for Ebola virus in 2014. The survivor male had undergone several tests, including blood and semen, at different intervals to assess the status of the disease. The survivor&#x02019;s seminal fluid and blood were negative for Ebola virus 231 days after the estimated onset of the Ebola virus disease. Surprisingly, the TruSeq RNA Access kit (Illumina, CA, USA) using custom capture probes achieved 85.1% of the genome coverage of Ebola virus from the semen of the male survivor. The nucleotide sequence alignment of the genomes retrieved from the survivor&#x02019;s semen and his female sexual partner was done and it was found that there was only one base-pair mismatch across the 15,808 nucleotides, which was a strong evidence of sexual transmission of Ebola virus from this male survivor to his female partner [<xref rid="B112-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>].</p><p>In June 2015, the case of a 17-year-old deceased boy from Margibi County triggered the alarm of a second Ebola flare-up in Liberia 101 days after the last detected case of Ebola virus disease.

Mauritania</title><p>During September to November 2015, a hemorrhagic fever outbreak occurred in Mauritania. The first symptomatic case was tested for Ebola virus through RT-PCR, which was found to be negative. Hence, further diagnostics for RVFV, CCHFV, dengue virus, chikungunya virus, WNV, and YFV was conducted using either ELISA or RT-PCR. After this, 10 more cases were investigated for the above viruses. As a result, an RVFV outbreak was declared, as all the suspected cases were positive for the RVFV infection. Following this declaration, a surveillance was conducted and the patients reporting fever, back pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and cutaneous bleeding were sampled and tested for the differential diagnostics for RVFV, CCHFV, and YFV using anti-IgM ELISA and RT-PCR. This investigation included all 11 samples before the outbreak was announced and 173 samples that were collected after the outbreak was declared. Therefore, a total of 184 samples were investigated for several arboviruses. As a result, 57 samples were found to be positive for the RVFV, 5 samples were positive for CCHFV, 27 samples were positive for dengue fever virus, and one sample was positive for WNV. There were some samples that were co-infected with two viruses. The RVFV-positive samples were partially sequenced and a phylogenetic analysis was conducted, which revealed a possible association between the observed cases in Mauritania and the RVFV isolates reported from Senegal in 2013. The RVFV disease outbreak in Mauritania reported 57 confirmed cases as well as 12 deaths [<xref rid="B123-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>].</p><p>After the outbreak of an influenza-like illness during 2009&#x02013;2010, a large-scale surveillance that included the collection of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs was conducted. Clinical samples from 227 patients were collected, and RNA was extracted for the diagnostics of influenza viruses. RNA samples were subjected to the molecular detection of IAV and IBV using specific oligonucleotides with one-step real-time RT-PCR assays. Only IAV-positive samples were further subjected to a second real-time RT-PCR assay to distinguish among the H1, H3, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Virus isolation was attempted in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells followed by virus subtyping using the HI assay with specific antisera. The HA and NA gene sequences of the selected viruses were obtained through cycle sequencing followed by sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis for virus characterization. The investigation revealed that a total of 39 patients were positive for IAV while only three were positive for IBV. Further, 26 patients were found to be infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus while seven samples were positive for IAV H3N2 subtype. Six samples were also found to be positive for IAV H1N1 subtype while only three samples were positive for IBV.

As a result, many ruminants, including cows, goats, and sheep, were reported to have fever, increased salivation, abortions, and death during the outbreak. An investigation was soon launched after the disease symptoms in ruminants were reported in the country. In the early phase of the investigation, sera samples were collected from 13 symptomatic humans as well as 6 animals, including one camel, one cow, 3 goats, and one sheep. The collected sera samples were tested for a panel of arboviruses, including chikungunya virus, dengue virus, YFV, and WNV, as well as hemorrhagic fever viruses, including CCHFV and RVFV. Three animals, including one cow, one goat, and a sheep, were found to be positive for RVFV through the RT-PCR assay. Further, during August&#x02013;December 2016, a total of 399 human sera samples were collected. RT-PCR and ELISA tests identified 17 RVFV cases. More precisely, nine sera samples were found to be positive with RT-PCR while eight samples were positive for ELISA using specific antibodies. Strikingly, 33 human subjects under investigation were reported dead during this period. This was the first report of RVFV from Niger. The findings of this investigation showed the high probability of virus zoonosis between ruminants and the exposed human population in the region. Interestingly, the study also suggested that large human gatherings during festivities where ruminants are traditionally sacrificed along with environmental factors like wet climatic conditions may potentially aggravate the spread of the disease [<xref rid="B124-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2dot13-pathogens-09-00301"><title>3.2.13. Nigeria</title><p>The prevalence of H5N1 in poultry in Nigeria has been known since 2006, but the incidence of human infections was unknown. Hence, an investigation was carried out to determine if the agricultural workers exposed to poultry had evidence of disease transmission. The study included 316 farm and open market workers from four towns in the south-western part of Nigeria who were exposed to domesticated poultry, including chickens, geese, ducks, pigeons, and turkeys [<xref rid="B125-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. The MN assay showed eight poultry-exposed workers and two non-exposed individuals had elevated antibody titers against three subtypes of avian influenza viruses viz., H5N1, H5N2, and H11N1, and one avian-like influenza virus H9N2 subtype [<xref rid="B125-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Interestingly, one non-exposed individual was seropositive for IAV H5N1 subtype, which indicated the possibility of subclinical avian influenza H5N1 infection in the past. One poultry-exposed worker was seropositive for two viruses: H11N1 and H9N2, which indicated that this person was infected with two influenza viruses at some point of the occupational exposure. The study had three categories of exposed individuals: poultry industry workers, meat processors, and poultry market workers. These individuals had been in their professions from three to 20 years. This investigation reported the zoonotic transmission of avian influenza virus from domestic poultry to humans, but more interestingly, the findings also suggested that subclinical infection with avian influenza virus may also trigger zoonotic transmission of the disease [<xref rid="B125-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>].</p><p>Over a two-year period during July 2010&#x02013;June 2012, a total of 227 clinical cases of swine influenza were observed among the swine population in Lagos. Nasal swabs along with blood samples were collected from pigs and pig handlers who participated in this study. Viral RNA was extracted from nasal swab samples and sera was separated from the blood samples for downstream processing. The human workers and the animals included in this study were observed for any clinical signs of respiratory distress as well as fever and coughing. Viral RNA was subjected to one-step matrix gene real-time RT-PCR for the detection of IAV. No human samples were found to be positive for IAV infection. Interestingly, 31 swine samples were found to be positive. The virus was successfully isolated from 29 swine samples. These 29 samples were further investigated for subtyping, which confirmed the presence of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in 18 swine samples. This was the first report of the prevalence of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in Nigerian pigs [<xref rid="B23-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Soon after, another investigation from December 2015 to February 2016, during the period of circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus subtype in poultry in Nigeria, 129 apparently healthy pigs were sampled for an investigation of the incidence of the disease. Surprisingly, real-time PCR analysis confirmed that 43 swine samples were infected with the IAV [<xref rid="B30-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Intriguingly, clade-specific real-time PCR determined that 22 swine samples represented the H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1c; the phylogeny confirmed the transmission of the virus from avian species to the swine. This was the first report of the H5N1 prevalence in a swine population from Nigeria [<xref rid="B30-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The mechanism of transmission of avian-like influenza H5N1 virus subtype to the swine population may be explained by the introduction of the virus into the swine population through wild birds. The lack of proofreading as well as post-replication repair mechanisms due to error-prone RNA polymerase, which are known to make IAV a highly versatile virus in terms of genetic reassortment and evolution, may facilitate the adoption of avian-like influenza viruses into swine, where it would evolve through reassortment [<xref rid="B30-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B126-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>].</p><p>Seventy-five nasal swabs from pigs at a municipal slaughterhouse in Bodija and at the University of Ibadan&#x02019;s Teaching and Research Farm were collected and investigated for IAV.

Twenty-four samples were detected as IAV positive for matrix gene-based RT-PCR. The HA subtyping RT-PCR confirmed that 19 of these samples were A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses while five samples were IAV H3N2 subtype. The matrix gene of the IAV-positive samples were amplified and sequenced. The phylogeny revealed that the M gene sequences of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus recovered in this study clustered with A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses that were in circulation among humans during 2011&#x02013;2013 [<xref rid="B6-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

As a result, one abattoir worker in Ibadan was found to be infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Nineteen pigs were also found to be infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus while five pigs were infected with IAV H3N2 subtype.

Nasal swab and sera samples from 197 piggery workers as well as 281 pigs were collected from both communities in this study. One-step RT-PCR revealed that all the human and swine nasal swab samples were negative for IAV. Interestingly, 171 human sera and 188 swine sera samples were found to be positive with influenza A IgG antibodies using an ELISA assay.

A total of 264 sera samples from 31 swine herds were collected during 2009 and 627 sera from 75 herds were collected during 2012. The majority of the pigs appeared healthy at the time of sampling, with the exception of five pigs that exhibited sneezing, nasal discharge, and weakness. All sera samples were tested by the virus microneutralization assay using MDCK cells, given its higher sensitivity over HI test where HI assay has too much cross-reactivity from human viruses and is worthless for swine viruses. The results found that during 2009, only one swine herd was positive for the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus while the samples taken during 2012 resulted in 66 A(H1N1)pdm09 virus-positive swine herds, which suggested that most of the swine herds were free from influenza in 2009 but later became infected. On the contrary, eight herds were positive for IAV H1N1 subtype while four swine herds were positive for human-like H3N2 virus during 2009. Intriguingly, during 2012, a study found that 53 swine herds became infected with H1N1 virus while 66 herds were found to be positive for A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, which was a sharp increase compared to 2009 [<xref rid="B129-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>].</p><p>A sero-surveillance was conducted to assess the seroprevalence of canine influenza virus H3N8 and H3N2 in pet dogs and village hunting dogs in Oyo, Lagos, and Ogun provinces of southwestern Nigeria. Approximately 3 mL of blood were collected from 96 pet dogs as well as from 89 village dogs living in hunting communities. The HI assay using specific antibodies detected that 75 dogs were seropositive for canine influenza virus H3N8 antibodies while none of the dogs were positive for canine influenza virus H3N2 subtype. However, most of the pet dogs sampled at Ibadan and Lagos veterinary clinics were vaccinated for rabies virus and canine distemper virus, but the seroprevalence of canine influenza virus H3N8 subtype in pet and village dogs puts the companion human population at risk for disease transmission [<xref rid="B130-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>].</p><p>Several cases of MPXV disease have been reported from Nigeria.

Later monkeypox outbreaks in the country reported at least 262 suspected cases, out of which 7 patients died while another 115 cases were confirmed for the MPXV disease [<xref rid="B119-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>,<xref rid="B131-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>].

A seroprevalence study confirmed 16 positive cases for dengue virus, 17 for WNV, and another 16 were positive for YFV disease. These reported arboviruses are usually vectored by mosquitoes and the abundance of mosquitoes in the areas where the study was conducted suggested the transmission of these diseases to humans through mosquito bites [<xref rid="B35-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>A high seroprevalence of MERS-CoV was reported in dromedary camels during 2010&#x02013;2011. In total, 358 sera samples were collected from dromedary camels, which were raised for the purpose of meat production, from abattoirs located in four provinces viz., Adamawa, Borno, Kano, and Sokoto. Serology based on IgG antibodies detected MERS-CoV in 94% of the sera samples (336/358). The study illustrated that the MERS-CoV reported in humans is genetically highly similar to the MERS-CoV reported in dromedary camels, which suggested that dromedary camels may be a potential reservoir for MERS-CoV and may facilitate the disease transmission to humans [<xref rid="B47-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>A sero-surveillance for the detection of HEV among pigs, cattle, and goats was conducted during January-March 2016.

Intriguingly, two isolates of a new genotype IV reported in this study from Oyo and Plateau provinces were originally reported from a chicken in 1973 and a duck in 1980 in Nigeria. The study suspected that this may be an extinct genotype of NDV. Another interesting finding was the first report of sub-genotype VIh from three bird samples. These three virus sequences clustered with the NDV sequences reported from a pigeon and quail between 2007 and 2013 along with viruses reported from Kenya and Argentina.

The sera samples were harvested from 422 birds and tested with anti-WNV monoclonal antibody. Seven factors were considered while sampling the birds for data analysis, including the sampling site, migratory status, feeding behavior, resting site, type of nest, herd instinct level, and the affinity with urban areas. The ELISA test reported 23 WNV-positive birds out of the 422 tested, resulting in an overall seroprevalence of 5.5%.

Blood, buccal swab, breast milk, and semen samples were successfully used to recover the Ebola virus genome sequences greater than 10 kb in this study. Based on the genome sequences, the study reported that at least nine different lineages of Ebola virus circulated in this outbreak. Interestingly, eight virus lineages appeared to be variants of the Sierra Leone 3 lineage, which was first reported in June 2014, while one cluster appeared to have derived from the GUI-1 lineage, which was originally reported in Guinea.

DNA was extracted from all the samples and subjected to nested PCR for amplification of the DNA polymerase gene of adenovirus. The goal of this investigation was to undertake a study of the assessment of adenovirus shedding in the stool of non-human primates. A total of nine stool samples from chimpanzees and gorillas were found to shed adenovirus in their stool. Due to certain technical limitations, the virus isolation attempts were not successful.

Interestingly, the case 1 was a child who owned a pet monkey at home, but there was no report of any sort of illness in the recent past in this monkey. Other cases were either residents in the hospital or were associated with the hospital staff. Some common symptoms included fever, rash, and eye disorders. The death of one patient was also reported, who most probably died of infection with MPXV [<xref rid="B172-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>].</p><p>In the period of February to August 2001, seven outbreaks of suspected MPXV disease were reported [<xref rid="B173-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. Several patients had similar symptoms, which suggested a common source of infection, which was thought to be a dead monkey from the forest that ended up as a meal in a family. It was also thought that these people might have spread the disease among others in their contacts. The most common symptoms in the deceased were conjunctivitis, generalized eruptions, and pulmonary failure while others with less severe disease experienced pustular lesions on different body parts along with enlarged lymph nodes [<xref rid="B173-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. The laboratory investigation revealed that the first two outbreaks, which resulted in 16 cases with four deaths, were primarily due to the MPXV infection. Two outbreaks were due to cocirculation of MPXV and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which claimed one death out of seven cases, while two other outbreaks were found to originate from chicken pox infection among six people. The seventh outbreak was mainly due to MPXV infection while two cases reported orthopox virus infection as well; the outbreak primarily affected young children [<xref rid="B173-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>].</p><p>The first case of SFV infection was reported in the year 1985.

Interestingly, a very high concentration of SFV virion particles (104 to 109 RNA copies/104 cells equivalent) were reported to be present in the saliva of non-human primates that were carrying infection. Since the oral mucosa tissues of Macaques and African green monkeys are sites of virus replication, biting, licking, or saliva-based transmission of SFV was considered to be the primary source of zoonosis [<xref rid="B175-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>,<xref rid="B176-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>,<xref rid="B177-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>].</p><p>A widespread infection of SFV was reported from rural areas of the country in the year 2007.

In April 2017, three tracheal swab samples from dead backyard goslings were also submitted for investigation, raising the total samples to 22. The trachea, brain, and spleen samples from ducks and gooselings were found to be positive for H5 through RT-PCR analysis. The serology identified IAV H5N8 subtype in the nine sera samples collected from the live ducks. The duck infected with IAV H5N8 subtype exhibited lethargy with tremors and nervous symptoms like torticollis. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, this study suggested that migratory wild birds may have transmitted the highly pathogenic strain of H5N8 virus to the ducks, given their close relatedness with the European and Asian HA gene sequences deposited in GenBank [<xref rid="B217-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">217</xref>].</p><p>Two naturally infected pigeons exhibiting respiratory disease and nervous symptoms were sampled for trachea and lung samples in two different geographical locations viz., Alexandria governorate and Behera, during 2009. To investigate the genomes of both birds, RNA was extracted and amplified for all eight gene segments of influenza virus using specific primers. Amplicons were run over agarose gel and then gel-purified DNA was ligated into the pGEM vector for cloning. Multiple clones were sequenced for each gene segment and aligned for analysis. The sequences were identified as the HPAIV H5N1 subtype. This was the first report of highly pathogenic H5N1 virus from naturally infected pigeons in Egypt [<xref rid="B218-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">218</xref>].</p><p>In another investigation, five cloacal and five tracheal swabs were collected from asymptomatic bobwhite quails on a commercial quail farm in May 2011. Viral RNA was extracted and subjected to one-step real-time RT-PCR for the detection of the matrix gene of IAV as well as H5, H7, and H9 genes. The N2 gene was identified using a conventional RT-PCR. One H9N2-positive sample was passaged in embryonated chicken egg for virus isolation. Viral RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed followed by the amplification of 225 bp of the HA gene and 334 bp of the NA gene. Amplicons were sequenced and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the H9N2 virus retrieved from a bobwhite quail was similar to the H9N2 genome sequences reported from the Middle East and Israel [<xref rid="B219-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">219</xref>]. This was the first report of IAV H9N2 subtype from a bobwhite quail in Egypt.</p><p>A seroprevalence of the IAV H7N7 subtype was conducted in poultry-exposed and non-exposed individuals over a period of three years. In the first year, 565 human sera samples from the poultry-exposed group and 150 sera samples from the unexposed group were collected. At the first follow up, which occurred a year after the first study, a total of 682 human sera samples from the exposed and 139 from the non-exposed individuals were taken. Subsequently, at the second follow up, 649 human sera from the poultry-exposed group and 104 sera from the non-exposed group were collected. A virus microneutralization test was conducted to assess the titer of antibodies against IAV H7N7 subtype. The positive sera samples were then tested with Western blot analysis followed by an immunofluorescence assay. The findings revealed that in the first year of the baseline study, all sera samples were negative for IAV H7N7 subtype. However, later, at the first follow-up investigation, 13 individuals (1.9%) from the poultry-exposed group were found to have antibodies against IAV H7N7 subtype. At the second follow-up investigation, 14 individuals (2.2%) from the poultry-exposed group were found to be positive for IAV H7N7 subtype. All controls (samples in the non-exposed group) were negative.

The following years during December 2014&#x02013;January 2015, 157 nasal swab samples were collected from the pigs at an abattoir located in Cairo. Additionally, 216 sera samples were also collected from pigs at the abattoir. RT-PCR revealed that all 36 swine nasal swab samples collected in October 2013 were negative for IAV. However, 122 out of 157 nasal swabs collected during 2014&#x02013;2015 were found to be positive for IAV. The subtyping RT-PCR based on HA gene amplification was conducted to distinguish among the H5, H9, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. It was found that 46 swine nasal swabs were found to be positive for the H5N1 subtype, seven were positive for the H9N2 subtype, and 69 samples were positive for the A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype. All samples were negative for human influenza virus H3N2 subtype. Interestingly, 5.6% of the samples were co-infected with avian influenza viruses H5N1 and H9N2 subtype while 1.9% samples were co-infected with avian influenza virus H5N1 and pandemic strain A(H1N1)pdm09 subtypes. More precisely, phylogeny based on two complete HA gene sequences of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus revealed that these sequences appeared closely related to the 2009 pandemic virus. The partial HA gene sequence of the H5N1 subtype retrieved from swine in this study was found to be closely related to the avian influenza virus H5N1 subtype reported in 2015. The H9 sequences retrieved from swine were similar to the earlier reported Egyptian avian influenza virus H9N2 sequences [<xref rid="B34-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>In a targeted surveillance investigating the incidence of avian influenza virus in migratory birds in Lake Manzala, 19 cloacal and oropharyngeal samples were collected from either diseased or deceased birds being sold for food in a nearby live bird and fish market in Damietta Governorate on 24 November 2016. Interestingly, this was the same geographic location where the HPAIV H5N1 subtype was first identified and reported in the year 2006. In the current investigation, the sick migratory birds were reported as showing symptoms of mild depression. The sampled birds encompassed three species of migratory birds viz., common coot, pintail duck, and Garganey duck. Molecular investigation based on real-time RT-PCR identified two samples originating from common coot infected with IAV, which were subtyped by specific real-time RT-PCR and determined to be the HPAIV H5N8 subtype. The reported H5N8 subtype was successfully isolated and characterized by HA and NA gene sequencing followed by phylogenetic analysis. Immediately after this finding, the diagnostics were extended to the adjoining areas of Lake Manzala, where wild birds are usually noticed and poultry farming is rampant, but no other positive samples were retrieved in this extended investigation [<xref rid="B221-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">221</xref>].</p><p>Rabies virus, avian influenza virus, MERS-CoV, IAV, RVFV, and WNV were the most widely distributed virus diseases reported from Egypt.

Virus isolation was also attempted using specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs. The samples that were positive for avian influenza viruses were further tested for subtyping using real-time RT-PCR for H5N1, H7, and H9 virus identification. After subtyping, positive samples were considered for sequencing. The molecular investigation reported nine APMV-1-positive samples while four chicken samples were positive for the LPAIV H9N2 subtype.

The study also stated that 21,000 cattle had been reported to be imported from European countries to Morocco, but no export of cattle from Morocco to other countries was reported.

The phylogenetic analysis of the selected samples resulted in three clusters, where one cluster represented the rabies virus sequences retrieved from dogs while the sequences in the second cluster represented the relatedness with the rabies virus sequences reported from the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. Interestingly, the sequences in the third cluster represented the samples originating within Lesotho and a few of the samples reported from the Free State Province of South Africa. The findings of this investigation reported the circulation of rabies virus among domestic animals in Lesotho [<xref rid="B233-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>]. </p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5dot3-pathogens-09-00301"><title>3.5.3. Namibia</title><p>During January 2009&#x02013;July 2010, sera samples were collected from jackals in Etosha National Park to assess the seroprevalence of CDV and rabies virus. Sera samples were collected from 80 live- trapped jackals, 5 rabid jackals that were killed, and one jackal that was euthanized after an accident. A rabies fluorescent antibody virus neutralization test was conducted to assess the seroprevalence of rabies virus in the samples. Only seven sera samples were found to be positive for the rabies antibodies. On the other hand, a serum neutralization test was conducted to investigate the seroprevalence of CDV, which observed 62 positive samples. Four rabies virus isolates were successfully recovered from the brain tissues of the killed jackals. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that these sequences were identical to the rabies virus isolates reported from the jackals, greater kudu, and dogs in the same geographic area. Therefore, these findings suggested a zoonotic transmission of rabies virus among dogs, greater kudu, and jackals in Etosha National Park [<xref rid="B234-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">234</xref>].</p><p>Following a disease outbreak in African penguins (<italic>Sphenisus demersus</italic>) in Halifax island of Namibia, where in January- February 2019, more than 350 penguins were reported dead, and an investigation was launched. Penguins were reported to die after having severe disease symptoms, including torticollis, incoordination, corneal opacity, lethargy, and a state of comatose. The liver tissue sample from one symptomatic penguin and three cloacal samples from other sick penguins were collected and processed for RNA extraction. Quantitative RT-PCR detected the matrix gene sequence of the H5 strain of IAV. For further characterization of the virus, partial segments of the HA and NA gene sequences were amplified from the liver tissue and cloacal samples. Sequence analysis identified the HPAIV strain H5N8 in the penguin samples and revealed that the H5N8 virus in African penguins in Namibia is identical to the H5N8 virus reported in 2017 from South Africa [<xref rid="B235-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">235</xref>], which suggested the circulation of the H5N8 virus in the southern African region.</p><p>After sheep and goats exhibited typical RVFV symptoms, especially in the border areas of South Africa, during May&#x02013;July 2010, blood samples from live animals and tissue samples from various internal organs of dead animals were collected for an investigation of the disease. RNA was extracted from the blood samples and subjected to one-step RT-PCR for the amplification of the M segment of the RVFV genome for diagnostics. Virus isolation was carried out on RT-PCR-positive samples. Additionally, RT-PCR-positive amplicons were purified for direct sequencing. The investigation generated seven sequences originating from seven RVF outbreaks. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the RVFV sequences from Namibia retrieved in 2010 were identical to the RVFV sequences reported from South Africa in the years 2009 and 2010, which suggested that the RVFV in both countries most probably originated from a single virus population [<xref rid="B236-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">236</xref>].</p><p>Sixty-two free-ranging cheetahs were sampled during June 2002 through October 2004 in east-central Namibian farmlands. Additionally, three adult caracals (<italic>Felis caracals</italic>), four adult leopards, and one adult black-backed jackal (<italic>Canis mesomelas</italic>) were also sampled. Further, 24 captive cheetahs were also included in the study. Blood samples were collected from all the animals included in the study. Immunofluorescence assays were conducted using specific antibodies to investigate the prevalence of certain virus pathogens in the blood samples. As a result, three animals were found to be infected with feline herpesvirus (FHV), three were positive for feline calicivirus (FCV), five were positive for feline parvovirus (FPV), three were infected with feline coronavirus, eight were positive for CDV, and seven were found to be positive for rabies virus infections [<xref rid="B237-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">237</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5dot4-pathogens-09-00301"><title>3.5.4.

The etiological agent was termed as tern virus and was classified as influenza A virus/tern/South Africa/1961 [<xref rid="B238-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">238</xref>]. Within a short period of time, 1300 dead terns were found within four small areas in the province. This was probably the first report of influenza virus disease from South Africa.</p><p>A recent study was conducted at an ostrich farm in the Western Cape province of South Africa, which was declared positive for the HPAIV strain H5N1. In this study, serum samples were collected from farm workers and veterinarians who had been in close contact with the ostriches on this farm. Intriguingly, two humans were found to be positive for H5N1 and four cases were positive for the LPAIV strain H7N1 [<xref rid="B16-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This study provided evidence of the zoonotic transmission of avian influenza in South Africa.</p><p>In an earlier study reported in 1993, H7N1 virus was isolated from ostrich in the Western Cape province.

The sub-type H7N1 of avian influenza was isolated from an infected and symptomatic ostrich. This study suggested the transmission of influenza virus most probably from wild birds visiting the farm [<xref rid="B13-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In another study conducted in 2005, a large number of ostrich farms situated in the Western Cape province were found to be seropositive with the H5N2 strain of the influenza virus [<xref rid="B239-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">239</xref>].</p><p>After five of the ostrich farms located within Oudtshoorn valley of the Western Cape province tested positive for the H5 virus, a thorough surveillance was initiated to screen other farms in the Klein Karoo area. Meanwhile, influenza-positive farms were quarantined from the exporting of ostrich meat. In a detailed investigation, until November 2011, a total of 42 ostrich farms were suspected as being affected by the disease. RNA-based diagnostics and sequencing confirmed that 14 of these suspected farms were positive for avian influenza outbreaks. This finding led to the slaughtering of 37,000 ostriches and the destruction of 3000 eggs. This outbreak caused huge economic losses for the ostrich industry in the country [<xref rid="B240-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">240</xref>]. The molecular investigation and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the avian influenza H5N2 outbreak originated from a single source, a wild duck [<xref rid="B5-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The IAV H5N8 subtype was reported from a broiler breeder farm located near Villiers in the Mpumalanga province on 19 June 2017. The intensity of the outbreak was the highest during August&#x02013;September 2017. During the outbreak, a total of 40 isolates were successfully retrieved from commercial poultry and ostrich farms, as well as captive birds. This study suggested the role of wild birds in the introduction of the H5N8 virus strain from other African countries into South Africa and suspected that western African countries may be serving as the epicenter of the H5N8 virus. This was the first report of the HPAIV strain H5N8 from commercial poultry and captive birds in the country [<xref rid="B241-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">241</xref>].</p><p>In a routine surveillance of the avian influenza virus prevalence in ostrich populations in the Western Cape province, approximately 13,000 sera, cloacal, and tracheal swab samples were collected during April 2011 to February 2012 in 8 rounds of sampling as well as samples deposited by state personnel. The ostriches exhibited symptoms like high fever, green coloration of urine, depression, and loss of appetite. There were significant mortalities among ostriches on the index farm identified in this investigation. RNA extraction for real-time RT-PCR followed by conventional RT-PCR and DNA sequencing identified the highly pathogenic H5N2 along with the H1N2 and H6N2 subtypes of avian influenza viruses across the 20 farms under investigation in this study [<xref rid="B5-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>After a pool of cloacal swab samples came up as RT-PCR positive for the IAV H5N2 subtype in April 2011, follow-up testing was done after a month in May 2011 as per the regulations. However, the 60 sera samples collected in April 2011 were negative for the H5 and H7 viruses, but since a pool of five cloacal swab samples were positive, the authorities had to follow the procedure to declare the index farm positive for H5N2 subtype, and as a result, the entire flock was supposed to undergo culling at an abattoir. Interestingly, since all 60 sera samples were found H5 and H7 negative, the farm owner expressed disagreement and felt that his birds were culled unfairly. As the set procedure, the entire ostrich flock was bled before culling at an abattoir and further tested for H5N2 subtype based on NP-specific ELISA. Out of 929 birds, 830 were found to be seropositive for H5N2 based on the AIV antibody ELISA test. To confirm the specificity of the above test, a subset of sera samples (366 samples) containing mostly positive samples identified by the AIV antibody ELISA test as well as some negative samples were further tested with two H5-specific ELISA and HI assays. In total, 292 of these 366 samples were positive for H5 subtype through all three ELISA assays, hence a consensus was established among the testing [<xref rid="B242-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>].</p><p>In another study, over a three-year surveillance during April 2012 to December 2014, a total of 17,762 sera, cloacal, and tracheal swab samples from wild birds, chickens, and ostriches across the country were submitted to testing for avian influenza virus diagnostics. The AIV antibody ELISA test identified several strains of avian influenza virus among the submitted samples. More precisely, ostrich samples were found to be positive for IAV H1N2, H5N2, H9N2, H6N1, H7N1, H7N7, H6N8, and H10N1 subtypes. Samples from Egyptian geese were found to be positive for the H5N2, H4N2, and H1N8 subtypes. The wild bird Cape Shoveller was found to be infected with H3N8 subtype while red-billed teals were found to be infected with the H4N8 and H11N2 subtypes. IAV H5N1 subtype was found to infect yellow-billed ducks while chicken samples were infected with H6N2 subtype.

These findings suggested a widespread presence of avian influenza viruses in the country which requires programmed active surveillance in wild birds.</p><p>During an investigation of avian influenza viruses in 2014, a tracheal swab was found to be positive through the HI assay. The sample was further investigated to determine the virus through molecular techniques, hence RNA was extracted and subjected to total RNA sequencing. The genome sequence analysis found a complete genome of AOaV-1, which is known to cause Newcastle disease in avian species. This was the first complete genome of the AOaV-1 reported from the country. The genome sequences showed close identity with the AOaV-1 genome reported to GenBank from China, which was retrieved from a mallard. This finding indicated that wild waterfowls seem to harbor the AOaV-1 virus and appeared to be responsible for the long-distance dissemination of the virus to ostriches in a farm located within the Oudtshoorn district [<xref rid="B246-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">246</xref>].</p><p>The first detection of influenza virus A(H1N1)pdm09 in South Africa was reported in a traveler who arrived in the country from the United States on 14 June 2009 having influenza-like illness for one day after the onset of the symptoms. Interestingly, the first locally acquired infection was reported from a person on 24 June 2009, following which seven other travel-associated A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections were observed. By mid-July 2009, a total of 762 human samples had been tested, which resulted in 108 laboratory-confirmed cases of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections [<xref rid="B247-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">247</xref>].</p><p>During February 2009&#x02013;December 2012, a total of 16,005 patients were enrolled in a surveillance program known as severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) for the investigation of influenza-associated disease among hospitalized patients. Multiplex real-time RT-PCR detected 1239 influenza-positive samples. Influenza virus subtyping using the CDC-recommended molecular protocol identified 463 patients infected with the IAV subtype H3N2, while 338 patients were positive for the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, and 418 patients had IBV infections. Twenty other influenza virus-positive samples could not be subtyped, most probably because of the low virus yield in those samples [<xref rid="B248-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">248</xref>].</p><p>In a study conducted in Cape Peninsula, baboons were found to be positive for hepatitis A virus (HAV), cytomegalovirus, and Epstein&#x02013;Barr virus using automated enzyme-linked fluorescent assays [<xref rid="B249-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>].

DNA was extracted from the sera samples and subjected to nested PCR for the detection of HBV. The study resulted in 15 HBV-positive samples; 11 adults and four juvenile chacma baboons were infected. Southern hybridization resulted in 5 positive samples out of 15 given the low sensitivity compared to PCR. Additionally, liver tissue samples were also collected from one wild caught chacma baboon, which was ethically euthanized [<xref rid="B250-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">250</xref>].

In a study conducted in Free State, cases of the transmission of flaviviruses among human, cattle, and sheep were identified. Kunjin virus antibodies detected Langat virus and suggested that other flaviviruses may also be in circulation in the area [<xref rid="B251-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">251</xref>]. Apart from this, WNV and Wesselsbron virus were also identified among samples, which clearly suggested mosquito-borne transmission of these flaviviruses in Free State [<xref rid="B251-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">251</xref>].</p><p>WNV is a flavivirus, and the first isolation of WNV was reported from the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937 [<xref rid="B75-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. WNV is transmitted by species of <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes while birds are reported to be the primary host [<xref rid="B252-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">252</xref>]. Interestingly, vertebrate animals serve as the natural reservoir for WNV [<xref rid="B253-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">253</xref>], with the exception of humans and horses, which are suggested to be the incidental hosts of WNV [<xref rid="B254-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">254</xref>]. The first case of zoonotic transmission of WNV reported in the country was from a horse to an attending veterinarian while the second case was laboratory-originated transmission to the researcher due to a needle stick injury. Both cases developed neurological disease symptoms [<xref rid="B254-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">254</xref>]. This study included specimens from horses for virus disease diagnostics: Six horses with neurological symptoms were diagnosed with WNV; interestingly, two horses were co-infected with African horse sickness virus (AHSV), which resulted in a fatal disease [<xref rid="B255-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">255</xref>].</p><p>In another study conducted during 2008&#x02013;2015 that documented 79 horses infected with WNV, interestingly, 14 WNV-infected horses were co-infected with other viruses: Three co-infections with AHSV, three with Sindbis virus, three with Shuni virus, and four with Middelburg virus [<xref rid="B256-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">256</xref>]. There was one horse infected with equine encephalitis virus [<xref rid="B256-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">256</xref>]. Typical WNV neurologic disease symptoms were observed in the horses.

In a Sindbis virus disease surveillance in the country during 2006 to 2010, a total of 3631 samples from arbovirus-suspected patients were submitted for investigation, out of which 229 patients were found to be positive for Sindbis virus infection [<xref rid="B260-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">260</xref>]. It was suggested that the higher disease prevalence among men than women is because of the greater participation in outdoor activities by men related to farm work compared to women, which make men more prone to mosquito bites [<xref rid="B260-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">260</xref>].</p><p>During the Rift Valley fever outbreak in the country, two human cases of Wesselsbron virus disease were reported [<xref rid="B261-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">261</xref>].

There was one horse that was infected with only Sindbis virus, which had mild colic symptoms in addition to tongue paralysis and pale mucous membranes. Interestingly, the co-infection of WNV with Sindbis virus resulted in the death of two horses. The horses that were infected with Middelburg virus had febrile illness, and sometimes neurological symptoms, but death occurred in the severe cases of co-infections [<xref rid="B263-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">263</xref>].

At the time of her travel, she was unaware of the infection and had preliminary mild symptoms of a cold and was on medication for suspected influenza. Her condition deteriorated after her return from the wedding and hence she was evacuated to a private hospital in Johannesburg. Due to complications, she died in the next few days while under treatment. Intriguingly, the attending paramedic and nurse developed similar symptoms and died due to severe complications, with symptoms of viral hemorrhagic fever [<xref rid="B266-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">266</xref>]. The diagnosis confirmed an infection with Old World arenavirus. The reverse-transcription PCR procedure yielded approximately one 300-bp glycoprotein gene and another approximately 1000-bp nucleoprotein gene. The phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the etiological agent of the viral hemorrhagic fever was a novel arenavirus, hence it was named Lujo virus [<xref rid="B266-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">266</xref>].</p><p>In another investigation, liver tissue samples from two deceased people were collected along with one sera sample.

The gaps in the aligned sequences were filled with specific PCR reactions. The assembled genome was determined to be a classical bi-segmented arenavirus genome with two open reading frames. The phylogenetic analysis using the L or S segments of the genome identified that the retrieved genome belonged to Lujo virus.

The cats were seen capturing rodents and occasionally were observed in contact with bats. They were suspected to be infected with rabies, hence they were tested against rabies antigen. The results were positive for rabies, but the fluorescence was more intense than what is usually seen in rabies cases; hence, another lyssavirus infection was suspected. A panel of antibodies was used that differentiated amongst lyssaviruses and confirmed that the cats were infected with Mokola virus [<xref rid="B270-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">270</xref>]. The transmission of Mokola virus to cats was suspected to be either from bats as they have been reported to serve as the reservoir of several lyssaviruses or rodents and shrews, which also harbor and transmit lyssaviruses [<xref rid="B271-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">271</xref>,<xref rid="B272-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">272</xref>].</p><p>In another study, dog brain tissue samples were collected from the Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal provinces and investigated for rabies infection using RNA extraction followed by reverse-transcription PCR and sequencing.

The study suggested that the dogs acted as sentinels for rabies virus but not wildlife, hence it indicated the spread of the disease from dogs to wildlife [<xref rid="B275-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">275</xref>].</p><p>A University of Pretoria-based study revealed that veterinarians working at the university had contracted virus zoonotic diseases, including rabies virus, RVFV, and WNV diseases, until the year 2001 [<xref rid="B276-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">276</xref>].</p><p>The first cases of Rift Valley fever in the country were reported in Johannesburg in 1951 [<xref rid="B277-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">277</xref>]. Another report of the disease appeared from the Western Cape and Free State provinces, where an outbreak occurred on sheep farms, causing heavy losses to farmers [<xref rid="B278-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">278</xref>]. Interestingly, the veterinarians who performed autopsies or post-mortem on the diseased animals developed similar symptoms. Several farm workers who also reported developing symptoms of RVFV were individuals who cut open the infected sheep or animals [<xref rid="B278-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">278</xref>]. These preliminary observations and studies revealed the zoonotic nature of the RVFV disease.</p><p>In a recent 2018 Rift Valley fever outbreak on a sheep farm in Free State, 250 fatalities or abortions in a flock of 600 sheep were reported. In this outbreak, out of 22 farm workers, 6 experienced symptoms comparable to the RVFV disease. Interestingly, four of these six symptomatic individuals came up positive for RVFV infection through the ELISA test [<xref rid="B279-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">279</xref>]. This investigation suggested the zoonotic transmission of RVFV disease from sheep to humans through close contact.</p><p>In a country-wide RFV outbreak during 2008 to 2011, a total of 301 confirmed cases of RVFV infection were identified, out of which 25 died of the disease [<xref rid="B280-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">280</xref>]. The common symptoms of RVFV reported from this outbreak included influenza-like illness with headache and fever, unexplained hemorrhagic illness or hepatitis, symptoms of encephalitis, etc. [<xref rid="B280-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">280</xref>]. The high-risk category individuals were those in close contact with livestock and game animals, or those working in the slaughterhouses [<xref rid="B280-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">280</xref>].</p><p>The Limpopo province represents a large swine industry, which has been hit in the past with African swine fever outbreaks. A study reported 1309 pigs that were infected with ASFV in the Limpopo province originated mainly because of the illegal trade and movement of pigs within the province [<xref rid="B281-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">281</xref>].</p><p>In a recent study, cattle and goats were found to be seropositive for RVFV in Maputaland coastal plain, which is located far north in the KwaZulu-Natal province, with no earlier reported outbreak of the disease. In this study, 432 at least six-month-old cattle from small-scale farms, which were communally grazed, were bled from the coccygeal vein during November 2016 to June 2018 and tested for RVFV using IgG sandwich ELISA using IgG antibodies and the serum neutralization test (SNT). Seroprevalence of RVFV was found in 144 samples from cattle out of the 432 samples tested. These 144 seropositive samples were further tested with IgM ELISA and 5 samples were found to be positive. This study reported an overall 34% seroprevalence of RVFV among cattle in the designated study area in the northern KwaZulu-Natal province [<xref rid="B282-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">282</xref>]. Additionally, 104 goats were bled from the jugular vein during February to April 2017 and tested for RVFV using the serum neutralization test. Interestingly, 33 goats (31.7%) were found to be seropositive for RVFV in this study. Intriguingly, a higher seroprevalence along the wetland in this study area was observed. This was the first report of RVFV among livestock in northern KwaZulu-Natal without an outbreak [<xref rid="B282-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">282</xref>].</p><p>The first report of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infection in South African pigs was reported from a large-scale well-managed breeding farm in the Gauteng province along with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome during 2001 [<xref rid="B283-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">283</xref>]. Pigs were seen to have clinical symptoms of porcine dermatitis, with a mortality rate below 10%. Brain, liver, spleen, and heart tissue samples from deceased pigs were taken for histopathology and immunohistochemistry. PCV2 infection in certain tissue types was seen through immunohistochemistry. Additionally, PCR amplification was used to detect PCV2 in different tissue samples obtained from dead pigs. Intriguingly, PCR successfully amplified PCV2 sequences in tissue samples obtained from four deceased pigs, confirming the infection. This was the first report of PCV2 infection in South African pigs [<xref rid="B283-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">283</xref>].</p><p>In a recent study, 375 sera samples along with fecal and nasal swabs from healthy and diseased pigs were collected during 2015&#x02013;2016 from three municipalities in the Eastern Cape province. A total of 339 samples were processed for genomic DNA extraction and the specific primer pairs were used for PCV2 detection among the samples. The initial screening was done through a PCR reaction followed by the subsequent testing of positive samples with other specific oligonucleotides. High-quality PCR products were purified on gel and sequenced for characterization of the virus. The investigation resulted in 54 PCV2-positive samples out of the 339 tested. This was the first report of PCV2 from the Eastern Cape province [<xref rid="B284-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">284</xref>].</p><p>Later, 110 samples collected and archived during the 2015&#x02013;2016 PCV2 study in the Eastern Cape province were randomly selected to assess the prevalence of porcine parvoviruses in the country. Conventional PCR amplification was used for the detection of porcine parvovirus DNA in the swine samples [<xref rid="B285-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">285</xref>]. Positive samples were sequenced, and BLAST analysis followed by phylogeny was conducted for the identification and characterization of the porcine parvoviruses obtained in this study. Interestingly, 32 porcine parvovirus 1 (PPV1), 24 porcine parvovirus 2 (PPV2), 6 porcine parvovirus 3 (PPV3), 48 porcine parvovirus 4 (PPV4), 24 porcine bocavirus-like virus (PBo-likeV), and 49 porcine bocavirus 1 (PBoV1) and porcine bocavirus 2 (PBoV2) viruses were successfully detected in this investigation [<xref rid="B285-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">285</xref>]. This report showed the prevalence of porcine parvoviruses in areas where communal swine farming is a common practice and demonstrated the presence of heterogeneous viruses in South African swine herds [<xref rid="B285-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">285</xref>].

Intriguingly, no human cases were reported for H1N1 virus infection during this period [<xref rid="B52-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>Human infection of HEV was detected in Cape Town; the infection was believed to have emerged from the consumption of food derived from pork meat. A total of 164 archived sera samples, which were earlier submitted to the diagnostic laboratory located at National Health Laboratory Service at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, which were negative for HAV, HBV, and HCV infections along with no other identifiable cause of disease, were investigated for HEV prevalence. The ELISA test using anti-HEV IgG antibodies detected 39 HEV-positive sera in this investigation while only two sera samples were positive for anti-HEV IgM antibodies. Interestingly, RT-PCR could not detect any HEV-positive samples. The findings of this investigation reported the seroprevalence and circulation of HEV in the Cape Town population. More interestingly, the investigation suggested that the probable cause of disease was the consumption of products prepared from pork meat [<xref rid="B287-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">287</xref>].</p><p>The first complete genome sequence of a rotavirus was reported from a 10-week-old diarrheic piglet sampled at a Free State pig farm in the country in 2015. This was the first whole-genome sequence of a rotavirus reported from the African continent. For whole-genome sequencing, RNA was extracted from the fecal sample and was subjected to a sequence-independent amplification method. Sequencing was done by the ultra-deep sequencing method. The assembled sequences were analyzed using BLAST for the identification of the virus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these rotavirus sequences from South Africa clustered with the rotavirus sequences reported from Brazil, the USA, and Japan [<xref rid="B288-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">288</xref>]. In another report, diarrhea was reported by a farmer in six-week-old piglets on a Warmbaths farm in northern Transvaal. Internal organ samples from two autopsied pigs were submitted for electron microscopic examination. Fecal samples from the pigs were negatively stained and examined under an electron microscope, which identified the particles of two distinct viruses. Based on the morphology (well-defined circular particles) and particle size, it was determined that the swine fecal material had rotavirus particles [<xref rid="B289-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">289</xref>].</p><p>To investigate the prevalence of avian influenza virus and NDV in aquatic wild birds visiting ostrich farms located in the Oudtshoorn area in the Western Cape province, a study was conducted during May to July 1998. A total of 262 aquatic wild birds of different species were sampled from 19 different ostrich farms, which were sighted visiting the feeding bowls of ostriches on these farms. Additionally, 50 samples were included from non-aquatic birds, including pigeons, doves, and sparrows, in this study. Sera samples were screened for avian influenza virus using ELISA followed by the HI assay with specific antibodies to detect avian influenza viruses. Only eight aquatic wild bird samples were HI positive for avian influenza virus. These positive samples were characterized as H10N9 avian influenza virus. None of the non-aquatic birds were positive for the avian influenza virus in this investigation. This study reported the first H10N9 avian influenza virus isolate from the African continent [<xref rid="B289-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">289</xref>]. Additionally, 46 aquatic wild birds were screened for NDV. Sera from these birds were tested through ELISA using NDV-specific antibodies. Surprisingly, a high seroprevalence of NDV was identified in this investigation, with 34 samples yielding positive results [<xref rid="B290-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">290</xref>].</p><p>Orf virus is reported to trigger a zoonotic disease in ruminants and humans in the United Kingdom, the USA, and India, among other countries. An extensive investigation was launched during September 2009&#x02013;March 2010 to find out the understanding and awareness of Orf virus disease in South Africa. Veterinarians and farmers were contacted, and relevant questionnaires were obtained to understand their response about the predominance of Orf virus disease within the country. Simultaneously, ruminants and cattle exhibiting Orf virus disease symptoms were included in the study. During the investigation, suspected cases of cows, goats, Boer goats, and sheep showing any lesions or scabs were sampled. DNA was extracted from the samples and a 594 base-pair sequence of the B2L gene, which represents a conserved region in the <italic>Parapoxvirus</italic> genus, was amplified. Amplicons were sequenced and sequence analysis of the nucleotides and amino acid alignments was carried out using the ClustalW method. This study successfully retrieved Orf virus sequences from six Boer goats, two goats, two sheep, and two cows. Interestingly, Orf virus infection was reported in one human individual who developed a blistering lesion on the thumb of one hand during the study period. This was the first study in the country that investigated the economic impact of the Orf virus disease and the transmission risk to humans [<xref rid="B291-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">291</xref>].</p><p>Upper and lower respiratory tract specimens were collected from children up to five-year-old of age with respiratory disease who were admitted to hospitals during 1 January 2011 through 31 July 2015 across KwaZulu-Natal province, which is an endemic area for HIV prevalence. Multiplex PCR was conducted for the detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, IAV, human rhinovirus, cytomegalovirus, and HIV. The results identified that 316 children were positive for RSV, 215 were positive for adenovirus, 152 were infected with human rhinovirus, and 50 children were positive for the IAV infections. Additionally, the study observed that 348 children were positive for HIV while 416 were found to be positive for cytomegalovirus [<xref rid="B292-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">292</xref>].</p><p>Another study reported the implementation of severe acute respiratory illness surveillance among patients admitted to hospitals in KwaZulu-Natal, the Northwest province, Mpumalanga, and Gauteng during February 2009 to December 2013. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from 7872 enrollees, who reported symptoms like fever, sore throat, cough, and/or difficulty in breathing. Multiplex real-time RT-PCR revealed that a large proportion of the admitted patients 5321/7039; 76%) were positive for HIV infection. RSV was detected in only 4% (329) of the patients. Interestingly, the frequency of RSV infection was similar in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients [<xref rid="B293-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">293</xref>].</p><p>In a small study, clippers from 50 barbers from three townships in Cape Town were collected. Clippers were immediately collected after a clean-shave haircut and other styled haircuts. Blood was detected on 42% of the clippers collected in this study. The total nucleic acid was extracted from each clipper and tested for HIV using nested qualitative RT-PCR. For the HIV screening, a 160- bp region of the gag gene was amplified. For the HBV testing, samples were subjected to the COBAS TaqMan HBV test. The positive samples for HBV DNA were further tested by qualitative nested PCR for confirmation. However, all the samples were negative for HIV, and four clippers were found to be positive for HBV infection. These four positive HBV clippers had enough DNA copies to trigger the transmission of the disease. This study revealed the risk of HBV transmission through clippers used in haircuts at barber shops. The sequences of HBV DNA retrieved from two of the clippers were closely related to the HBV sequences reported from the Gauteng province [<xref rid="B294-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">294</xref>].</p><p>A general practitioner was called on 20 February 1970 to examine a 31-year-old white male South African farmer on a farm located approximately 100 km north-east of Pretoria. The patient was described to be in a high state of agitation with profuse sweating and muscle spasms of the back and neck. The patient was recently bitten on the lip by a bat, which was thought to be the cause of the disease. The initial disease symptoms were headache, muscle ache, sleeplessness, and difficulty in swallowing, which later progressed into profuse sweating and agitation. Muscular spasm and dyspnea of the mouth and throat muscles occurred at each attempt at drinking water. The patient was immediately admitted to a hospital in Pretoria with an initial diagnosis of rabies. At the hospital, the patient underwent intense pain and spasms of the pharyngeal muscles along with the arms and upper body parts whenever he was coaxed to drink water. The following night, the patient became violent and by the morning was seen frothing from the mouth, smashed the Vacoliter bottle to the wall, and kicked the attendants. Within 24 h after admission to the hospital, the patient died of respiratory arrest and seizure. The necropsy examination revealed that the brain was slightly congested while the lungs were severely congested along with other nervous system-related conditions. The brain tissues of the deceased were taken for a fluorescent antibody test of rabies but was found to be negative. Several attempts for rabies diagnostics were made but all were in vain. Experimental infection of mice introduced the ascending paralysis, culminating in death. It was considered a new virus strain and hence was given a new name &#x02018;Duvenhage virus (DUVV)&#x02019;. This was the first original report suggesting the zoonotic transmission of DUVV isolated from a South African male in 1970 [<xref rid="B295-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">295</xref>].</p><p>To summarize, a wide range of virus diseases have been reported in South Africa, including avian influenza virus, HIV, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis E virus, IAV, IBV, Marburg virus, rabies virus, Mokola virus, WNV, RVFV, CCHFV, cytomegalovirus, African swine fever virus, rotavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and Orf virus, among others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00301-f016">Figure 16</xref>).

Kingdom of Eswatini</title><p>The Kingdom of Eswatini (previously known as Swaziland) HIV Incidence Measurement Survey was conducted to assess the seroprevalence of HIV in the country between 10 December 2010 and 25 June 2011 across four administrative regions. This study identified 24,630 eligible individuals for participation, but only 18,177 individuals agreed to enroll for the study and HIV testing. HIV diagnostic results were available for 18,172 enrollees, out of which 5803 (32%) were determined to be HIV seropositive. This was a large fraction of the households that were positive for the disease. In a follow-up investigation, 11,897 HIV-seronegative individuals as identified in the last surveillance were investigated for the seroconversion rate among HIV-seronegative individuals. From this cohort, 11,232 individuals were accessible for the sampling and analysis. Therefore, a follow-up investigation between 23 August 2011 and 4 February 2012 included 11,232 individuals who were seronegative for HIV in the last testing and hence were sampled and re-tested for HIV seroprevalence. The outcome observed 145 HIV seroconversions among this cohort, resulting in a 2.4% incidence. The data analysis based on interviews identified that the highest seroprevalence of HIV was among men aged 30&#x02013;34 years while higher seroconversion was among females who were either unmarried or those whose partners were living elsewhere.

However, despite large swine farming practices in South Africa, there is no report on the current status of influenza virus infections in pigs in South Africa. IAV and IBV infections have been reported from patients hospitalized in different healthcare facilities across the country, but there was no information on the animal reservoir host except reports of avian influenza viruses in wild birds and ostriches.</p><p>Briefly, in this review, important virus diseases reported from countries in Africa were highlighted. The findings of this review are crucial in the context of the prevalence of virus diseases circulating across Africa and therefore, the data would be useful for designing studies focusing on virus diseases in Africa in the future. Interestingly, this review highlighted the circulation of Achimota virus, Duvenhage lyssavirus, Lagos bat lyssavirus, European bat lyssavirus, Achimota virus, Marburg virus, Nipah virus, and coronavirus through the bat species <italic>E. helvum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00301-f018">Figure 18</xref>). This information established bats as a potential natural reservoir for these zoonotic viruses that impact animal and human health.</p><p>Cattle were also found to be infected with rabies virus, IDV, Kunjin virus, RVFV, Langat virus, WNV, and Wesselsbron virus.

One of the most crucial factors reported behind the transmission of influenza virus was its dependence on the relative humidity and temperature, which have proved to be important environmental conditions behind the emergence of influenza virus disease [<xref rid="B298-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">298</xref>]. A high population density, rapidly changing environmental conditions, migration, and international travel coupled with rapid aging may facilitate virus dissemination and evolution, which may be crucial for the progression of emerging viral infectious diseases [<xref rid="B299-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">299</xref>]. Recently, an Ebola virus disease outbreak was reported from the countries in West Africa. The zoonotic transmission of Ebola virus was reported from Cote d&#x02019; Ivoire in 1994 from chimpanzees to humans [<xref rid="B71-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].

The disease affected people from different age groups and across occupations. The 2014 Ebola virus epidemic was reported to be the fourth largest epidemic in the African continent [<xref rid="B109-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>].

Similarly, HIV-1 infection in Bantu and Pygmy hunter-gatherers in Cameroon was found due to their frequent contacts with non-human primates [<xref rid="B1-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Bantu and Pygmies are forest-dwelling tribal communities in Cameroon, which usually remain in close contact with non-human primates and other wild animals. The prevalence of HIV-1 in Pygmies and Bantu individuals indicated the zoonotic potential of HIV-1 and its prevalence in tribal communities living in Cameroonian forests [<xref rid="B1-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Likewise, the high seroprevalence of HIV-1 in people of Cameroon who have been reported to be in frequent contact with non-human primates either through hunting activities for bushmeat or butchering reflected the zoonotic and pandemic potential of HIV-1 [<xref rid="B158-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. WNV is another deadly zoonotic virus disease, which has been reported to be transmitted by migratory birds into new regions [<xref rid="B8-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The significance of the environment in the emergence and re-emergence of infectious zoonotic virus diseases can be understood from the RVF outbreaks within Africa. The seroprevalence of anti-RVFV antibodies in ruminants, including cattle, goats, and sheep, living around wetland areas in Africa suggested the role of wet environmental conditions in disease progression [<xref rid="B92-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Exceptional rainfalls led to flood-like situations in African grasslands, which have been reported to serve as favorable sites for the RVFV vector, the <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes; as a result, RVF outbreaks have occurred following exceptional rainfalls within Africa [<xref rid="B302-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">302</xref>,<xref rid="B303-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">303</xref>]. Rabies virus and MPXV, among several other potentially infectious virus diseases, have been reported from humans, animals, and birds within Africa.</p><p>It is noteworthy to mention that there are several yet undetected viruses circulating in wild and domestic animals. The close proximity of human populations to wild and domestic animals may facilitate virus adaptation and the emergence of virus strains with the potential to infect humans and may result in epidemics. It was previously reported that Canine morbillivirus, which are known to distribute among carnivores, requires continued treatment and monitoring, considering that CDV infections in non-human primates have already been demonstrated [<xref rid="B304-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">304</xref>]. To date, there has been no evidence of a human infection by CDV; however, it was reported that CDV was isolated from a human cancer cell line [<xref rid="B305-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">305</xref>]. In addition, further investigation is required to determine whether CDV can initiate a cross-species event in humans because of virus adaption [<xref rid="B306-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">306</xref>].</p><p>With such a background, it is concluded that human health is interdependent on animal health as well as ecosystem health. To address such challenges, where a rapidly changing environment and animal health may impact human health, the framework of a &#x02018;One Health&#x02019; approach comes into consideration [<xref rid="B307-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">307</xref>]. The One Health approach is basically an integration of transdisciplinary sectors addressing animal, human, and ecosystem health for the well-being of the entire ecosystem [<xref rid="B308-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">308</xref>,<xref rid="B309-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">309</xref>]. The One Health approach may facilitate effective intervention in emerging infectious virus diseases through a multidisciplinary dimension from animal, human, and ecosystem perspectives, which simply would not be possible by adopting just a one-dimensional approach. The primary objective of the One Health approach is to mitigate the risk of disease outbreaks across all three constituent domains, including animals, humans, and the environment [<xref rid="B307-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">307</xref>,<xref rid="B309-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">309</xref>].</p><p>The recent emergence of zoonotic-origin SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="B309-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">309</xref>,<xref rid="B310-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">310</xref>] in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and its spread to more than 200 countries all over the world, as of the date of this publication, causing more than two million human infections worldwide and more than 130,000 deaths worldwide [<xref rid="B311-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">311</xref>], is of great global public health concern. The WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March 2020 [<xref rid="B312-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">312</xref>]. The COVID-19 pandemic is the first pandemic in history to be caused by a coronavirus (i.e., SARS-CoV-2), which reflects the importance of &#x02018;One Health&#x02019; in detecting emerging zoonotic viruses of pandemic potential to improve public health [<xref rid="B309-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">309</xref>]. In this context, programmed active surveillance for zoonotic viruses is deemed essential to fill the knowledge gaps, share information, bring awareness, and make informed decisions and strategies to be well-prepared early to combat or prevent the emergence of zoonotic viruses, which may lead to disease outbreaks in resource-limited countries in the African continent [<xref rid="B313-pathogens-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">313</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-pathogens-09-00301"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>The current investigation reported several potential vector-borne and zoonotic disease-causing viruses that have been in circulation in Africa, including avian influenza virus, ASFV, swine influenza virus, HIV, simian immunodeficiency virus, WNV, RVFV, MPXV, Ebola virus, rabies virus, MERS-CoV, dengue virus, and Nipah virus, among several others. Multiple reports have observed an increasing trend of zoonotic virus diseases, especially Ebola virus and MPXV diseases, in western African countries; and influenza virus disease in countries, including Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa. In the past few years, Ebola has emerged as a challenging zoonotic disease with high mortality in Africa. Human-to-human transmission of Ebola virus through exposure to body fluids has been reported, which makes the human population vulnerable to the disease. The introduction of MPXV from wild reservoirs to human populations represents zoonotic transmission and it has been challenging to contain the disease to date. Interestingly, the hunting, butchering, and trading of bushmeat, especially in western and central Africa, including, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, among others, puts the human population at risk in terms of a zoonotic virus disease outbreak. Reports of an avian influenza virus from Egypt in domestic as well as commercial poultry and wild birds further increased the burden of disease in the continent. A report of swine influenza A virus from Kenya along with the finding of the HPAIV H5N1 subtype in a swine population in Nigeria and Egypt indicated the possibility of the transmission of influenza from wild birds to commercial pigs. Avian influenza was first reported in terns in South Africa in 1961. More recently, the highly pathogenic subtype of avian influenza was reported from an ostrich farm in the Western Cape province in South Africa. Interestingly, ASFV, which was reported to trigger hemorrhagic fever among the swine population, was reported in a commercial piggery in South Africa in 2013.</p><p>Overall, cultural practices, poor resources, illiteracy, lack of information and awareness, and limited or lack of active surveillance of vector-borne and zoonotic viral diseases would be considered the most probable factors behind the high burden of viral diseases in the African continent. Therefore, the findings of this study recommend that appropriate action plans must be urgently taken to increase awareness through extensive concerted and interdisciplinary efforts, and adequate education must be imparted in the context of possible virus disease outbreaks to stakeholders within such communities that may be prone to the acquisition of virus infections by different means. The launch of initiatives, such as &#x02018;One Health&#x02019;, for active virus disease surveillance at the interface of animals, humans, and the ecosystem is critical to devise and implement strategies to prevent or control the transmission and circulation of vector-borne and zoonotic virus diseases in Africa.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Authors would like to thank the College of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa for financial support to R.P.C through a postgraduate scholarship.
