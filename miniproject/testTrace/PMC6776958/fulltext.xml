CCHF is asymptomatic in infected animals, and the symptoms can range from nonspecific febrile illness to a serious hemorrhagic syndrome in humans. The disease has a wide geographical distribution and has been reported from Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe. Hard ticks of the genus, <italic>Hyalomma</italic>, act as the reservoir and the vector for the CCHF virus, whereas animals such as cattle and goats serve as amplifying hosts.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Primary human infections occur through a tick bite, direct contact with blood of infected ticks, direct contact with blood/tissues of infected wild animals, and livestock. Secondary human-to-human transmission occurs through direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other body fluids of infected persons.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] It has also been demonstrated that the virus has the potential to be transmitted by aerosols.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] CCHF outbreaks constitute a threat to public health services because of its epidemic potential, its high case fatality rate, its potential for nosocomial outbreaks, and the difficulties in treatment and prevention.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] CCHF has been reported to have a case fatality rate in the range of 30%&#x02013;50%.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] There is no safe and effective vaccine available for humans or animals against CCHF infection.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The first reported case of CCHF from India occurred in January 2011 in Ahmedabad. This outbreak resulted in the death of two health-care workers including the doctor who treated the index case.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Since then, sporadic outbreaks and cases among health-care workers were reported from Rajasthan and Gujarat.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] A systematic review by Leblebicioglu <italic>et al</italic>. reports 21 cases of travel-associated infection.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] An imported case from Oman to India was also reported in 2017.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>T<sc>HE</sc> S<sc>TUDY</sc></title><p>A 30-year-old migrant worker from Kerala who was an abattoir worker in the Middle East was diagnosed to have CCHF infection in a hospital in UAE on the 3<sup>rd</sup> week of November 2018 and was treated with ribavirin. After few days of treatment, a second PCR was done, and the result was positive for CCHF viral RNA. The following day, he requested discharge and traveled to Kerala, India. As he was suffering from nausea, headache and abdominal discomfort; he was admitted to a tertiary care center in central Kerala on the day of arrival and kept under isolation. Strict adherence to standard contact precaution was undertaken by health-care workers and patient caregivers. The district health authorities were informed, and rapid response team was constituted. Contact-tracing activity was initiated by the Community Medicine Department. Communications were sent to the airport authorities to trace potential contacts. A networked online surveillance system was set up. All patient movements were mapped for contact identification. Persons considered to have had significant exposure were listed as contacts into an online contact listing form using Google Sheets. A total of 27 contacts were identified. Among these, 24 were health-care workers in the tertiary health center, 2 were travel contacts, and 1 was a relative. Most of the health-care workers were unaware of the mode of spread of CCHF as it was the first time that such a case was reported in Kerala. All the contacts were categorized as either high-risk or low-risk exposure based on nature and duration of contact. Contacts who had direct exposure to the patient's body fluids (blood, vomitus, saliva, and urine) by touch and mucocutaneous or percutaneous exposure while attending to the patient were categorized as high risk. Contacts who did not have direct contact with body fluids or blood but had close physical contact with patient without using personal protective equipment and touched or cleaned the linens or clothes of the patient were categorized as low risk.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The contacts were informed of their contact status and the importance of receiving early care if they develop symptoms and preventive information. They were kept under symptom monitoring by direct personal interviews and telephonic interviews twice a day. Two high-risk contacts were placed under modified quarantine for a period of 14 days. The symptom-monitoring and follow-up activities were planned for a duration of 14 days which was the longest incubation period of CCHF infection reported.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] On the 5<sup>th</sup> day of contact surveillance, one of the low-risk contacts, who was a resident in the emergency department, developed fever and headache. Immediate strict home isolation of the suspected case was done. The suspected case was started with ribavirin, and the blood sample was taken and sent for PCR testing to the District Medical Office (Health).[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The suspected case's symptoms subsided after 2 days, and his PCR test report came as negative for viral RNA and negative for serology. All the other contacts were closely monitored for 14 days after exposure and all 26 remained asymptomatic. No secondary cases occurred. The index patient's clinical samples&#x02019; were tested 3 days after admission in the center and was found to be negative for viral RNA. The serology done was positive for CCHF IgM and IgG indicating recent infection.

The development of contact-tracing strategy for CCHF was a challenge for the team as this was the first reported case of CCHF in Kerala state. Various studies have reported that physical contact during clinical examination, emergency medical interventions, and percutaneous exposure are routes of nosocomial transmission of CCHF. Elata <italic>et al</italic>. reported a nosocomial transmission to an attending physician in Sudan.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] A study by Altaf <italic>et al</italic>. from Pakistan describes an outbreak where a medical student contracted CCHF infection in the emergency room while examining a patient with CCHF.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In the present study, the authors performed an early risk assessment and divided the contacts into two groups based on the limited evidence about the routes of nosocomial transmission available in various published literature.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>A breach in the hospital infection control protocols is the foremost risk factor implicated in the nosocomial transmission of CCHF.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In our study, in addition to the provision of personal protective equipment, all health-care workers in the hospital including nursing assistants and cleaning staff in the isolation room were informed and trained about the transmission risks, barrier nursing techniques, and clinical symptoms of CCHF.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Many reports emphasize the beneficial effects of early use of ribavirin for the treatment and postexposure prophylaxis of CCHF.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The symptomatic contact was started on Ribavirin within 6 hours of onset of symptoms. It was given for 4 days and discontinued as the results were negative for CCHF.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Early recognition of CCHF cases is pivotal in the prevention of nosocomial transmission. A delay of up to 4 days occurred for the confirmation of diagnosis in the center as the facilities for serological and molecular diagnosis of CCHF infection were unavailable in Kerala.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>R<sc>ECOMMENDATIONS</sc></title><p>The epidemiology of CCHF transmission suggests multiple strategies to prevent human disease.</p><p>
