    "A 30-year-old male working in an abattoir in UAE returned home to Kerala, South India, after getting diagnosed with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever infection. He was admitted to a tertiary care center on the day of arrival and was placed under isolation. Due to the risk of spread of infection among health-care workers, contact-tracing and symptom-monitoring activities were undertaken. As strict standard contact precautions, isolation, contact identification and listing, quarantine, and sensitization of health-care workers were implemented, no secondary cases occurred."
