Yet the scarcity of knowledge on the dynamics of the immune response to infection has led to hesitation on recommending the use of rapid immunodiagnostic tests, even though rapid serology tests are commercially available and scalable. On the basis of our knowledge and understanding of viral infectivity and host response, we urge countries without the capacity to do molecular testing at scale to research the use of serology tests to triage symptomatic patients in community settings, to test contacts of confirmed cases, and in situational analysis and surveillance. The WHO R&#x00026;D Blue Print expert group identified eight priorities for research and development, of which the highest is to mobilise research on rapid point-of-care diagnostics for use at the community level. This research should inform control programmes of the required performance and utility of rapid serology tests, which, when applied specifically for appropriate public health measures to then be put in place, can make a huge difference.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="cesec10"><title>Diagnostics: the weak link in the COVID-19 pandemic response</title><p id="para10">The COVID-19 pandemic, now only a few months old,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> has brought into sharp focus inequalities within and among countries. John Nkengasong, Director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, reported that &#x0201c;the collapse of global cooperation and a failure of international solidarity have shoved Africa out of the diagnostics market&#x0201d;.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Sadly, the same is true of many other low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) outside Africa.</p><p id="para20">Why are diagnostics important? In any epidemic response, diagnostic testing plays a crucial role and this pandemic is no exception. Because early clinical presentations of infected patients are non-specific, testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19 in symptomatic patients, as soon as possible, so that these patients can be appropriately isolated and clinically managed.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Diagnostic testing is also needed for individuals who have come into contact with someone with confirmed COVID-19. Some testing strategies examine only contacts who have symptoms or develop illness of any kind during the 14-day period after contact. Other strategies examine all contacts when identified, regardless of whether they have any symptoms. Studies have shown that a large number of infected individuals might have no symptoms at all, and there is concern that these individuals are still able to shed the virus and transmit infection through saliva droplets as they speak.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Tracking all contacts of confirmed cases and testing them for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is key to successful pandemic control. Diagnostics are also needed to support rapid serosurveys that establish whether and to what extent SARS-CoV-2 has circulated in a community, and surveillance systems, such as that for influenza-like illness, that monitor disease trends over time. Diagnostics can also be used to identify at-risk populations and assess the effectiveness of control strategies.</p><p id="para30">Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO, urged countries to implement a comprehensive package of measures to find, isolate, test, and treat every case, and trace every contact. Goodwill between countries has already been shown through the publishing of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence and shared laboratory protocols to detect the virus.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> However, as these molecular assays require sophisticated laboratory facilities, countries with insufficient infrastructure quickly accumulate a backlog of testing. The rapid spread of COVID-19 around the world has led to a global shortage of reagents and supplies needed for testing. Point-of-care molecular assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection are now available to enable community-based testing for COVID-19 in LMICs. Unfortunately, the production of these test cartridges takes time and, again, global demand has outstripped supply, leaving LMICs struggling for access.</p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>Test, test, test</title><p id="para40">In March, 2020, WHO urged member states to &#x0201c;test, test, test&#x0201d;.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Widespread testing can help countries to map the true extent of the outbreak, including identifying hot spots and at-risk populations, and monitor the rate at which the epidemic is spreading. However, most LMICs find that molecular testing, including point-of-care testing, is neither scalable nor affordable on a large scale. Relying solely on centralised testing puts countries at risk of having nothing to use. What diagnostic alternatives are available to support decentralised testing that would allow countries to mount an adequate response to the pandemic?</p><p id="para50">Rapid antigen detection tests that are simple to do at point of care and can give results in less than 30 min would be viable alternatives to molecular testing for confirming COVID-19 cases, enabling appropriate case management, and guiding public health measures, such as quarantine or self-isolation. However, although scaling up rapid antigen testing offers an effective means of triaging symptomatic individuals in community settings, early evaluations of rapid antigen detection tests show suboptimal sensitivity for these tests to be recommended for clinical diagnosis or triage.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref>
</p><p id="para60">Rapid antibody detection lateral flow tests are also simple to use, generally requiring a few drops of whole blood from a finger prick placed onto the test strip with no processing needed. These tests take 15&#x02013;20 min to do with minimal training and can be done at the point of care as most do not require any equipment. Rapid antibody testing is an attractive option for scaling up testing but only if these tests show satisfactory performance for a clearly specified use.</p></sec><sec id="cesec30"><title>SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and immune response</title><p id="para70">The detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune response has been described in relation to different diagnostic tests.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> In this section, we summarise the evidence from studies to date.</p><sec id="cesec40"><title>Viral infectivity</title><p id="para80">Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected 2&#x02013;3 days before onset of symptoms and can remain detectable up to 25&#x02013;50 days after the onset of symptoms, particularly in patients who remain symptomatic for an extended period.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected for longer in respiratory samples from patients with severe disease than in samples from patients with mild illness.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Viral RNA concentrations peak within the first 5 days after onset of symptoms and decrease slowly with rising antibody concentrations.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, RNA clearance is not always associated with rising antibody concentrations, particularly in patients who were critically ill.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> An important question for the potential for spread of COVID-19 is whether individuals who are RNA-positive are shedding infectious virus.

A positive result for IgM in symptomatic patients fulfilling the COVID-19 case definition is strongly suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This approach is probably most effective in individuals 5&#x02013;10 days after symptom onset.</p><p id="para140">In Peru, public health facilities for molecular testing are sparse and only 500 beds in intensive care units exist for a population of 32 million. The Ministry of Health has set up a hotline and website for individuals who have symptoms to be interviewed by a health professional for possible follow-up, prioritising the visits according to age, risk factors, and severity of symptoms. A testing team visits the individual at home to do the rapid antibody test. Individuals who are IgM and IgG positive and have mild symptoms are quarantined, whereas people who need critical care are referred to hospital.

For example, if the prevalence of infection is 1% in the general population, a test with 98% specificity will identify two false-positive results for every true positive result. These results could lead to a false sense of security regarding the extent of immunity in the population and premature easing of public health measures on the basis of misleading disease estimates.</p><p id="para210">Patients at an early stage in the disease course, or asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic patients, might have low antibody concentrations that could give false-negative results. Patients' disease stage and severity are important points to consider, along with the population being tested. The estimated level of risk can be considered before using a serology test, because of the changing false-positive rate or low positive predictive value across different populations. Among the groups with the highest risk of the disease are symptomatic patients with clinical presentation of COVID-19, patients with other respiratory symptoms, contacts of confirmed cases, and health-care workers in settings with little personal protective equipment. We suggest countries consider risk levels before using serology tests and creating public health guidance. Scaling up testing, particularly at the community level, allows for better estimates of risks, which in turn allows more effective public health measures to be put into place than would be otherwise.</p></sec><sec id="cesec150"><title>Testing to allow health-care workers to return to work</title><p id="para220">In a pandemic, countries must strive to maintain a robust health-care workforce. Key workers who develop symptoms should be prioritised for molecular testing and receive care if infected. On recovery, should a serology test be used to decide when they can safely return to work?

Hence a substantial IgM or IgG response is not necessarily a surrogate marker of protective immunity.
