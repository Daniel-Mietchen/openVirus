PEDV introduction to farms and a liquid antimicrobial has been proven useful for
reducing risk. This study provides information on the survivability of PEDV
across common swine feed ingredients in the presence or absence of the liquid
antimicrobial.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Eighteen ingredients commonly included in commercial swine diets
were selected, including 3 grain sources (corn, soybean meal (SBM), dried
distillers grains with solubles (DDGS)), 5 porcine by-products (spray-dried
plasma, purified plasma, intestinal mucosa, meat and bone meal and red blood
cells (RBCs)), 3 vitamin/trace mineral (VTM) mixes (sow, nursery, finishing), 2
fat sources (choice white grease and soy oil), 3 synthetic amino acids (lysine
HCL, D/L methionine, threonine), as well as limestone and dry choline chloride.
Complete feed and stock PEDV served as controls. Thirty grams of each ingredient
were inoculated with 2&#x000a0;mL PEDV. A matched set of samples were treated with the
formaldehyde-based liquid antimicrobial SalCURB&#x000ae; (LA). All samples (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;320) were stored outdoors under winter time
ambient conditions for 30&#x000a0;days. Samples were submitted on 1, 7, 14 and 30&#x000a0;days
post-inoculation (DPI) and tested by PCR and virus isolation (VI). All
VI-negative samples were tested by swine bioassay. Viable PEDV was detected by
VI or swine bioassay at 1, 7, 14 and 30 DPI from SBM, DDGS, meat &#x00026; bone
meal, RBCs, lysine HCL, D/L methionine, choice white grease, choline chloride,
complete feed and stock virus control and at 7 DPI in limestone and at 14 DPI in
threonine. Supplementary testing of complete feed and SBM indicated viable virus
out to 45 and 180 DPI, respectively. All other samples were negative by VI and
bioassay. In contrast, treatment with LA inactivated PEDV across all ingredients
on 1 DPI and induced RNA reduction over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Under the conditions of this study, PEDV viability in feed was
influenced by ingredient with extended survival in SBM. Furthermore, LA
treatment rendered virus inactive, independent of ingredient type.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Porcine</kwd><kwd>Epidemic</kwd><kwd>Diarrhea</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd><kwd>Antimicrobial</kwd><kwd>Feed</kwd><kwd>Ingredient</kwd><kwd>Bioassay</kwd><kwd>Formaldehyde</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enveloped single-stranded
positive sense RNA virus belonging to the Order <italic>Nidovirales</italic>, the family <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> and the genus <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].
Following detection in the US swine population during May, 2013 the virus spread
rapidly across the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Initial
risk factors proposed for the spread of PEDV between herds included infected pigs,
contaminated transport and aerosols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. PEDV infection
of nursery swine results in reduced performance and fecal shedding for out to 24&#x000a0;day
post-infection (DPI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In regards to
the role of contaminated transport vehicles, data collected from the US suggests
that collection points, such as harvest facilities and livestock auction markets are
contaminated and can be a source of contamination of transport vehicles that return
to pig farms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Finally, PEDV RNA has
been detected by PCR in aerosol samples out to 16&#x000a0;km from infected swine facilities
and under experimental conditions may contain viable PEDV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, while pig-to-pig transmission of
PEDV has been proven [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], controlled
transmission studies providing proof of concept regarding the role of aerosols and
transport have not been published at this time. In 2014, new risk factors for PEDV
were identified: contaminated feed and feed ingredients. Initial reports indicated
the ability of PEDV to survive in dry feed for 7&#x000a0;days and in wet feed for 28&#x000a0;days
when stored at room temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].
Proof of concept that contaminated complete feed could serve as a route of PEDV
transmission to na&#x000ef;ve pigs was published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], with a follow-up report identifying spray-dried porcine
plasma as a possible ingredient-specific risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Both of these studies collected contaminated feed material
from farms or feed suppliers and performed controlled challenge studies involving
na&#x000ef;ve pigs. In both cases, use of swine bioassay demonstrated infection in na&#x000ef;ve
piglets following ingestion of contaminated feed bin material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] or commercial plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], therefore raising awareness of these risks.
Recently, transmission of PEDV via ingestion of contaminated complete feed has been
repeated and the minimum infectious dose calculated at 5.6 x
10<sup>1</sup>TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL (Ct&#x02009;=&#x02009;37)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>In regards to management strategies to reduce the risk of PEDV spread
between herds, protocols of transport sanitation and air filtration have been
validated using standard approaches [Dee S, unpublished data, 2013&#x02013;2015]; however,
the means to biosecure feed is a new paradigm for the swine industry. Recently, a
liquid antimicrobial (LA) product containing formaldehyde and propionic acid has
been proposed as a means to mitigate risk (SalCURB&#x000ae;, Kemin Industries, Des Moines,
IA, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This study demonstrated
the ability to prevent PEDV infection in pigs consuming contaminated complete feed
treated with LA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However,
information is not currently available regarding PEDV survival in other ingredients
in swine diets or whether LA treatment can inactivate PEDV at the ingredient level.
Therefore, a study was conducted to measure PEDV viability across a panel of
ingredients commonly encountered in swine diets in the presence or absence of a LA
presently used to maintain feed and feed ingredients as <italic>Salmonella-</italic>negative for up to 21&#x000a0;days. It was hypothesized that
while PEDV survival is ingredient-specific, LA would be efficacious, independent of
ingredient type.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sample size</title><p>A total of 320 feed ingredient samples were used for this

ingredients commonly encountered in swine diets in the presence or absence of a
liquid antimicrobial treatment. The viability of food borne illnesses, such as
<italic>Salmonella sp</italic>. have likewise been studied in
feed and feed ingredients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Based
on the fact that ingredient processing procedures can successfully render PEDV
inactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], this study operated
under the premise of post-processing contamination of all ingredients. Under the
conditions of this study, our results suggest that PEDV survival is
ingredient-specific, as 50&#x000a0;% of the non-treated ingredients harbored viable PEDV
over some period of time while the remaining non-treated ingredients were VI and
bioassay negative at 7, 14 and 30 DPI. The extended survivability of PEDV in SBM was
a novel observation and may have been influenced by environmental temperature, based
on the observed decrease in titer as temperatures increased over time. In addition,
other novel information from this study included the recovery of viable PEDV from
DDGS, 3 synthetic amino acids and dry choline chloride (all non-treated). A
by-product of the ethanol industry, wet DDGS are stored outside/uncovered while dry
DDGS are stored in open warehouses, raising the risk of post-processing
contamination. As they are widely used in swine diets and their turnover at mills is
short (1&#x02013;2 days), if contaminated, as under the conditions of our study, virus may
remain viable and the ingredient could pose a risk to complete feed during mixing.
Similarly, the observed variability in PEDV survival across the 3 amino acids raises
the question of whether ingredient chemistry, for example, D/L methionine, a
sulfur-containing amino acid, may have influenced titer magnitude and duration. In
addition, the detection of viable virus in both synthetic amino acids and choline
chloride raises the awareness of both domestic risk and transboundary risk, due to
their widespread global trade.</p><p>Just as intriguing was the inability of viable PEDV to be recovered
from certain ingredients, such as spray-dried porcine plasma, particularly since
infection of na&#x000ef;ve piglets through the ingestion of PCR-positive porcine plasma has
been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Surprisingly, we
were not able to reproduce these results, despite employing two viability assays and
purposely inoculating plasma samples with PEDV at a Ct of 16.34 (400,000 FFU/total
dose), a viral load far greater than previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Even at day 1 PI, we were not able to recover
viable PEDV by VI and samples collected at 7, 14 and 30 DPI were negative by
bioassay. Follow-up questioning confirmed that the plasma had not been chemically
altered at the mill. While negative results were obtained with intestinal mucosa
samples and purified plasma, the risk of other by-products, such as meat and bone
meal and RBCs continue to raise awareness that certain by-products, if contaminated,
may harbor viable PEDV for extended periods.</p><p>Similar to plasma, no evidence of viable PEDV was recovered from the 3
different VTMs tested. This is interesting as international shipments of VTMs were
originally considered a possible source of PEDV introduction to the US. Finally, in
regards to the management of &#x0201c;high risk&#x0201d; ingredients, under the conditions of this
study, the formaldehyde-based liquid antimicrobial successfully reduced viral load
and inactivated PEDV, independent of ingredient. These data confirm previously
published reports of the efficacy of liquid antimicrobial biosecurity of
PEDV-contaminated complete feed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>As with all research studies, this project had its share of
acknowledged strengths and limitations. Regarding the strengths of the study, we
selected 18 ingredients commonly found in commercial swine diets and designed an
experiment where the only variables in the study were the individual ingredients,
and the presence or absence of the liquid antimicrobial. Specifically, we inoculated
equal amounts of each ingredient with an equivalent quantity of virus in an attempt
to mimic published viral loads associated with field cases of PEDV in feed. All
ingredients were stored in identical containers, exposed to the same environment,
sampled over periods representative of mill turnover times and tested in a single
laboratory, involving consistent, trained personnel and validated assays for the
detection of PEDV. We organized samples in a manner to prevent cross-contamination
by insuring that the individual sample storage containers were never opened from the
time of PEDV inoculation until testing occurred at the laboratory. While this may
have resulted in some variability of the PCR assay since a new sample set was
submitted each time, the fact that our negative control samples remained free of
contamination throughout the entire project validated these protocols. Finally, we
used multiple metrics (PCR, VI and bioassay) to document viral load across a total
of 320 samples. At the time of this writing, this is the only such study we are
aware of that has used this approach to assess PEDV viability in a large variety of
ingredients.</p><p>In regards to limitations, while we did involve the use of a large
number of samples, we were limited to 18 ingredients and we only conducted 2
replicates per ingredient. Furthermore, these results were derived from gram
quantities of feed and may not directly equate to the vast quantity of tonnage used
in actual swine production or feed manufacturing facilities. The bioassay protocol,
while helpful at identifying ingredients containing low levels of virus presented
limitations, was limited by cost thereby requiring pooling across sample days, i.e.,
7, 14 and 30 DPI, instead of the testing of daily samples. Despite the need to pool
samples, the Ct values across tested inoculums ranged from 22.95 to 31.06, clearly
indicative of a high quantity of PEDV. Finally, the fact that the samples were
stored under a specific set of environmental conditions for a defined period does
not allow for extrapolation of results across other climates or over longer periods
of time, with the exception of the supplementary testing of SBM and complete
feed.</p><p>In closing, based on the information from this study, a theory to
explain how PEDV infection of a swine farm via contaminated feed may actually occur
in the field can now be proposed, based on the hypothesis that infection via
contaminated feed is a multi-factorial event:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Ingredients capable of harboring viable PEDV for an
extended period become contaminated.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Contaminated ingredients then contact a supportive
matrix (SBM) during the preparation of complete feed.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Delivery of PEDV-positive feed introduces the virus to
the farm.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>While further work is needed, including replication under varying
conditions of season, differing viral loads, a larger number of ingredient types,
and alternative intervention methods, the risk of contaminated feed and feed
ingredients as a vehicle for PEDV has now been well established. With this
information, veterinarians and feed industry experts can now begin to target
interventions to reduce risk. In addition, increased efforts at the mill level,
focusing on improved biosecurity of facilities and feed transport vehicles may also
reduce risk with the end result being a lowered incidence of feed-related PEDV cases
across the national herd. Finally, this paper provides the first proof of concept
data that PEDV can survive for extended periods in select feed ingredients. We hope
the new information generated from this project improves the understanding of
pathogen risk through feed at both the domestic and international levels, thereby
stimulating further research efforts in this critical area.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of this study indicate that PEDV viability in feed appears
to be influenced by ingredient type, with extended survival reported in SBM.
Furthermore, formaldehyde-based liquid antimicrobial treatment rendered virus
inactive, independent of ingredient type.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Processing of feed ingredients</title><p>A panel of 18 ingredients frequently found in commercial swine
diets were selected for this study, including 3 grain sources (corn, soybean
meal (SBM), dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS)), 5 porcine by-products
commonly used as auxiliary sources of protein (spray-dried plasma, purified
plasma, intestinal mucosa (PepNS, Midwest Ag Enterprises, Marshall, MN US and
TechMix LLC, Stewart, MN, US), meat and bone meal and red blood cells (RBCs)), 3
vitamin/trace mineral (VTM) mixes (sow, nursery, finishing), 2 fat sources
(choice white grease and soy oil), 3 synthetic amino acids (lysine HCL, D/L
methionine, threonine), as well as limestone and dry choline chloride.
Ingredients were screened by PCR to insure a PEDV-negative status prior to use.
The experiment was designed to evaluate viability of PEDV in ingredients over
time; therefore, it was planned to sample each ingredient at 4 independent time
periods: 1, 7, 14 and 30&#x000a0;days post-inoculation (DPI). As we were starting with
PEDV-free ingredients, the day 1 sample would be used to confirm that
contamination occurred and the extended sampling would be used to estimate the
duration of survival over a 30-day period. The specific sampling times were
selected based on estimated ingredient turnover time at mills and processing
plants, with certain bulk macro-ingredients, such as SBM, DDGS having short
turnover times, i.e., 1&#x02013;2 days of storage, while bagged micro-ingredients, such
as synthetic amino acids, dry choline chloride and VTMs, have longer periods
(21&#x02013;28 days) of storage (C. Neill, personal communication, 2014). To increase
statistical power, it was planned to conduct 2 replicates of each ingredient
with LA treatment and 2 non-treated (placebo) replicates of each ingredient.
Therefore, sixteen 30&#x000a0;g samples of each of the 18 ingredients (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;288) were added to individual freezer storage
containers (Oxo Tot Baby Blocks, Oxo International, El Paso, TX, USA). Half of
the samples of each ingredient (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;144) were
treated with 0.1&#x000a0;mL of LA (Kemin Industries, Des Moines, IA USA), based on an
inclusion rate of 3&#x000a0;kg/t of complete feed. SalCURB&#x000ae; is a premix of aqueous
formaldehyde solution 37&#x000a0;% (for maintenance of complete animal feeds or feed
ingredients <italic>Salmonella</italic>-negative for up to
21&#x000a0;days) and propionic acid (as a chemical preservative for control of mold in
feed or feed ingredients). While SalCURB&#x000ae; provides effective <italic>Salmonella</italic> control for up to 21&#x000a0;days, it is not
approved for use by the U.S. Food &#x00026; Drug Administration or the U.S.
Department of Agriculture as a treatment for PEDV. The liquid antimicrobial was
added to the designated 30&#x000a0;g samples using a tuberculin syringe. To promote
proper mixing, the feed was stirred manually for 10 clockwise rotations and 10
counter-clockwise rotations using individual wooden applicator sticks per
ingredient. The remaining 144 samples were treated using 0.1&#x000a0;mL of saline
placebo and mixed in a similar manner.</p><p>Following treatment, all samples (30&#x000a0;g each) were inoculated with
2&#x000a0;mL PEDV (passage 18, Ct&#x02009;=&#x02009;16.34, (400,000 FFU/total dose), approximately 4&#x02013;5
logs/mL TCID<sub>50</sub>) and mixed as described. This quantity of
PEDV was selected in an effort to provide a final mean Ct value in feed
ingredient of approximately 25 (range&#x02009;=&#x02009;19&#x02013;30) following mixing, based on data
from actual field cases of PEDV-contaminated feed (S. Dee, unpublished
observations, 2014&#x02013;2015), a challenge level used in published studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Once prepared, samples were stored
outdoors in large plastic covered totes (Rubbermaid Cleverstore, 92.5 l
capacity, Newell Rubbermaid, Atlanta, GA, USA) with one tote containing LA
treated samples and the other the non-treated samples. Samples were stored
outdoors (state of Minnesota, site coordinates latitude
45<sup>0</sup> 49&#x02019; N, longitude
95<sup>0</sup> 33&#x02019; W) during winter time ambient conditions
for a 30&#x000a0;day period (January 3&#x02013;February 2, 2015). These conditions were selected
based on previously published data indicating the ability of the virus to
survive under a wide range of pH when stored at cold temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, many of these ingredients
are routinely stored outdoors, uncovered at processing plants and grain
elevators, or in unheated milling facilities (S. Dee, unpublished observations,
2013&#x02013;2015). Therefore, to maximize virus survival and to accurately represent
&#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; conditions found throughout the feed industry in the upper Midwest
USA, storage under winter time ambient conditions was selected. During the study
period, it was planned to remove 4 samples of each ingredient (2 LA treated, 2
non-treated) from their respective totes and submit for diagnostic testing on
the designated (1, 7, 14 or 30) DPI. In other words, the same sample was not
repeatedly opened and tested, but rather a new set of samples were submitted on
each sampling day. Besides storage of ingredients in sealed individual
containers, containers were stored in plastic bags by sample date, for example,
the day 7 samples were bagged separately from day 14 samples which were bagged
separately from the day 30 samples, etc. The comprehensive means of sample
management would insure that all sample containers remained sealed from the time
they were inoculated until the time they were tested at the lab, eliminating the
risk of cross-contamination during storage and delivery to the
laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Controls</title><p>For the purpose of controls, 32 samples of complete feed were
inoculated with PEDV (16 positive control samples) or saline (16 negative

PEDV in minimum essential media (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) served as stock virus
controls. All controls were managed in an identical manner as the ingredients.

plates were fixed with 80&#x000a0;% acetone and stained with FITC conjugated mAb SD6-29
to allow visualization of infected cells. Virus concentration was determined by
calculating FFU/ml based on the number of fluorescent foci present in wells at
selected dilutions using a previously published method adapted to PEDV
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Personnel reading the

viable PEDV was present in any feed ingredient sample that had tested
positive on PCR but negative on VI. This study was conducted in a Biosafety
Level 2+ room at the Animal Resource Wing (ARW) at South Dakota State
University. All procedures involving animals throughout the study were
performed under the guidance and approval of the SDSU Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. Animals (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;24,
5&#x02013;7 day old piglets) were sourced from a PEDV-na&#x000ef;ve herd and were tested on
arrival to the ARW via blood sampling and collection of rectal swabs from
each pig. Prior to animal arrival, all rooms (walls, ceilings, floors and
drains) were monitored for the presence of PEDV by PCR using sampling
procedures previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].
Piglets were housed in one of 6 stainless steel gnotobiotic units measuring
0.6&#x000a0;m&#x000a0;W x 1.2&#x000a0;m&#x000a0;L x 0.6&#x000a0;m&#x000a0;H. Units were divided into 4 semi-isolated housing
units, allowing for 4 piglets per unit with individual feeding arrangements.
Flooring consisted of an open weave rubberized mat on a perforated stainless
steel grate raised 10&#x000a0;cm for waste collection. Each unit was covered with an
inflatable 20 mil plastic canopy and fitted with 2 pair of dry-box gloves
for feeding and procedures inside the canopy. Each canopy was secured and
sealed with duct tape and ratchet straps to the unit. Ventilation was
supplied by an electric fan maintaining sufficient positive pressure inside
the canopy to keep the canopy inflated above the unit. Incoming and outgoing
air to each unit was HEPA-filtered. Each unit was initially sterilized using
47&#x000a0;% aerosolized formalin, and allowed to dissipate for 2&#x000a0;weeks prior to
introduction of the animals. All incoming and outgoing materials needed
during the study (eg. swabs, injectable medication, bleeding supplies) were
passed through an air-tight stainless steel port and sterilized using 5&#x000a0;%
peracetic acid before entering or exiting the port.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Preparation of bioassay inoculum</title><p>The stainless steel unit served as the experimental unit;
therefore, all 4 piglets in each unit received the same ingredient. To
assess PEDV survivability under representative storage times, it was planned
to test samples previously determined to be PCR positive and VI negative on
days 7&#x02013;30 DPI. For preparation of the inoculums, 60&#x000a0;g of each specific
ingredient from 7, 14 and 30 DPI were pooled and mixed with 50&#x000a0;mL of sterile
PBS in a 250&#x000a0;mL centrifuge tube, inverted 10 times to mix and vortexed for
2&#x000a0;min. The suspension was then centrifuged at 5,200&#x000a0;g for 15&#x000a0;min,
supernatant decanted and tested by PCR prior to piglet inoculation. Each pig
in the unit received 1&#x000a0;mL of the designated inoculum orally via syringe and
observed for a 7&#x000a0;day period. To minimize the number of animals needed for
the study, pigs that were confirmed negative after 7 DPI would be inoculated
with a different ingredient. A negative control unit was included in the
design, with these pigs receiving sterile saline PO.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Piglet testing</title><p>Following inoculation, the PEDV status of each group of piglets was

inspected animals for clinical signs of PED and collected rectal swabs (Dacron

the negative control unit. Showers were taken upon entry to the rooms and
room-specific coveralls, footwear, hairnets, gloves and P95 masks (3&#x000a0;M, St.
Paul, MN USA) were worn. In addition, each room was ventilated individually and
HEPA filtration for both incoming and outgoing air was employed per room. If
clinically affected animals were observed, swabs of diarrhea and/or vomiting, in
conjunction with the daily rectal swab were collected. Swabs were submitted to
the SDSU ADRDL and tested by PCR. If PEDV was diagnosed in a specific unit, all
animals were swabbed, humanely euthanized with intravenous sodium pentobarbital,
the small intestinal tracts submitted for PCR testing, units were cleaned and
