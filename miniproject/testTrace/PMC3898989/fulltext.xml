This was preceded by a number of smaller FMD outbreaks in the country, two in 1967, in Hampshire and Warwickshire and one in Northumberland during 1966. The causative agent of all four events was identified as FMD virus (FMDV) serotype O and the source of the large epidemic was attributed to infected bone marrow in lamb products imported from Argentina. However, the diagnostic tools available at the time were unable to entirely rule out connections with the earlier UK FMD outbreaks, as well as other potential sources from Europe. The aim of this study was to apply molecular sequencing to investigate the likely source of this epidemic using VP1 region and full genome (FG) sequences determined directly from clinical epithelium samples (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;13) or cell culture isolates (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6), from this and contemporary outbreaks in the UK, Europe and South America. Analysis of the VP1 sequences provided evidence for at least three separate incursions of FMDV into the UK including one independent introduction that was responsible for the main 1967/68 epidemic. Analysis of FG sequences from the main 1967/68 outbreak (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10) revealed nucleotide substitutions at 94 genomic sites providing evidence for the linear accumulation of nucleotide substitutions (rate&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2.42&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;</sup><sup>5</sup>&#x000a0;nt substitutions/site/day). However, there were five samples where this linear relationship was absent, indicating evolutional dormancy of the virus<italic>,</italic> presumably outside a host. These results help define the evolutionary dynamics of FMDV during an epidemic and contribute to the knowledge and understanding from which to base future outbreak control strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Foot-and-mouth disease</kwd><kwd>Epidemic</kwd><kwd>Full-genome sequencing</kwd><kwd>Phylogenetics</kwd><kwd>United Kingdom</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is associated with severe productivity losses in cloven-hoofed animals, characterized by vesicular lesions of the feet tongue, snout and teats as well as fever and lameness (<xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Arzt et al., 2011</xref>). The etiological agent, FMD virus (FMDV), is a member of the genus <italic>Aphthovirus</italic> in the family <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>. Serotype O, which can be sub-divided into 11 geographically distinct genetic topotypes (<xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">Samuel and Knowles, 2001</xref>), is the most prevalent of the seven serotypes of FMDV. High mutation rates of FMDV RNA polymerase (10<sup>&#x02212;</sup><sup>3</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>&#x02212;</sup><sup>5</sup> per nt per transcription cycle), coupled with large population sizes and a rapid replication rate, results in the fast evolution of this virus within infected hosts (<xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Domingo et al., 2003</xref>). Although predominantly spread by direct or indirect contact with infected animals, their secretions or associated products, FMDV can also be disseminated over extensive distances by air and windborne routes or via inanimate fomites, causing incursions in areas previously free of the disease (<xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Arzt et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>FMD was first recorded in the United Kingdom (UK) in 1839 but has not been endemic in the UK since 1884 (<xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">M.A.F.F., 1965</xref>). However, outbreaks occurred almost every year until 1968, with virus introductions attributed to spread from Europe and South America. A major FMD epidemic, starting in October 1967 in Shropshire, UK, caused 2364 outbreaks, on 2346 farms, 18 of which were infected twice (<xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">M.A.F.F., 1965</xref>). The epidemic was controlled after seven months using a stamping-out policy combined with movement restrictions imposed upon susceptible animals and the last outbreak was reported on the 4th of June 1968. Although cases occurred in North and South Wales, Lancashire, Westmorland, Derbyshire, South-West Midlands, and the East Midlands, the vast majority of the affected farms (2228) were located in the North-West Midlands, which had the highest density of dairy cattle in the country at the time. Apart from two years (1963 and 1964), FMD had sporadically been present in the UK on all thirteen years preceding this epidemic, including three sets of outbreaks affecting Northumberland (32 outbreaks over approximately three months, 1966), Hampshire (29 outbreaks during January, 1967) (<xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">Sellers and Forman, 1973</xref>) and Warwickshire (5 outbreaks over 3&#x000a0;days in September, 1967) (<xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">Sellers and Forman, 1973</xref>).</p><p>The UK Government commissioned the Northumberland Report (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Anon, 1969a</xref>) that made four principal conclusions regarding the primary source and initial spread of the epidemic. First, that it was not possible to categorically establish the origin of the 1967/68 epidemic. Second, that the most probable source of the epidemic was infected meat imported from South America. Third, that, as the Ministry of Agriculture had also attributed an earlier outbreak in 1967 in Warwickshire to South American meat, this event remained as a potential link to the main 1967/68 epidemic. Finally, that it was difficult to explain the epidemic&#x02019;s rapid development and extension other than by accepting that a number of foci were established almost simultaneously.</p><p>Since 1968, FMDV diagnostic tools have advanced from serologically based tests, such as the complement fixation and virus neutralization tests, to molecular sequencing of viral RNA. Determination of the genetic sequence for one of three surface exposed capsid proteins of FMDV (VP1) and the full genome (FG), has not only enabled the global tracing of FMD transmission but provided the resolution at which disease spread can be monitored at the epidemic scale (<xref rid="b0005 b0050 b0125 b0165 b0180" ref-type="bibr">Abdul-Hamid et al., 2011a; Cottam et al., 2008a; Knowles et al., 2005; Samuel and Knowles, 2001; Valdazo-Gonzalez et al., 2012</xref>). As well as providing the genetic profile of an epidemic, FG sequencing of FMDV can yield insights into the processes shaping this profile, for example, by testing for the presence of a molecular clock in terms of nucleotide (nt) substitution rate. Previous studies have demonstrated that nt changes, from the earliest FMDV sample, accrue in a linear &#x02018;clock-like&#x02019; way with time (<xref rid="b0190 b0080 b0100 b0045 b0180" ref-type="bibr">Villaverde et al., 1991b; Elena et al., 1992; Haydon et al., 2001; Cottam et al., 2006; Valdazo-Gonzalez et al., 2012</xref>), resulting from continuous viral replication within susceptible hosts. The aim of this study was to apply current molecular sequencing tools to characterize the 1967/68 FMD epidemic by establishing its relationship with contemporary UK outbreaks, determining whether this epidemic was mono or polyphyletic and measuring the rate of mutation accumulation over time. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis will help to clarify some of the issues highlighted by the Northumberland Report (<xref rid="b0015 b0020" ref-type="bibr">Anon, 1969a,b</xref>), expanding the knowledge fed into future disease control programmes.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Material &#x00026; methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Samples</title><p>This study accessed archived vesicular epithelium samples (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;13) from the World Reference Laboratory for FMD (WRLFMD) at The Pirbright Institute, which had been stored at &#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in 0.04 phosphate buffer (M25; disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, pH 7.5) and 50% (vol/vol) glycerol. The 13 clinical samples were collected from early in the Northumberland outbreak (OB-Northumb), the beginning of the Hampshire outbreak (OB-Hants), the beginning of the Warwickshire outbreak (OB-Warks), and a total of ten samples collected approximately every month from near the beginning (the isolate from the index case on Bryn Farm was not available), to the end of the 1967/68 outbreak. As the index case for the 1967/68 outbreak occurred in Shropshire, this outbreak was designated as the Shropshire outbreak (OB-Shrops). All 13 samples had previously been found FMDV positive by the complement fixation test on original submission to the WRLFMD at the time of these outbreaks.

The branch containing VP1 sequences from early and late samples of OB-Shrops also contained the VP1 sequence that had been previously determined for an isolate (BFS 1860; GenBank accession <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ncbi-n:AY593815" id="ir0005">AY593815</ext-link>) from this outbreak (see Section <xref rid="s0050" ref-type="sec">3.3</xref> for further details and FG sequence analysis of this isolate).</p></sec><sec id="s0045"><label>3.2</label><title>Full genome sequence analysis between outbreaks</title><p>The assembled FG sequences of the 12 epithelium samples analysed were unique and ranged in length between 8183&#x000a0;nt (OB-Shrops, Sample E, which contained a single deletion of 3&#x000a0;nt discussed Section <xref rid="s0050" ref-type="sec">3.3</xref>), 8187&#x000a0;nt (single sample for both OB-Hants and OB-Warks, which both contained a single inserted &#x02018;A&#x02019; nt immediately after position 8145), and 8186&#x000a0;nt for the remaining nine samples.

Of the samples analysed, OB-Warks was most closely related to OB-Hants although the genetic difference between the two samples was still substantial (difference of 214&#x000a0;nt). In order to establish the reliability of these inferred phylogenetic relationships, recombination analysis was performed. <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> (A) identified three areas where the OB-Warks sequence identity was lower (from the 5&#x02032; end of P2 (2C) to the P3 region (3D) at nt positions 4600&#x02013;4900; 5800&#x02013;6200 and 6600&#x02013;7000, respectively), highlighting regions of increased genome divergence compared to all the other reference sequences when queried against the FG sequence, O<sub>1</sub>/Campos/BRA/58[AY593819].

Within the coding region, these nt changes were mainly synonymous (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;65), the majority of which were transitions (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;62), compared to non-synonymous mutations (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;17). Eleven mutations were found within the 5&#x02032; UTR and one was found within the 3&#x02032; UTR. In addition, a single deletion of three nt (ACC at positions 190 to 192, with respect to GenBank sequence <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ncbi-n:JX869183" id="ir0010">JX869183</ext-link>) was found within the 5&#x02032; UTR of a single sample (sample E). The single stem-loop secondary structure previously predicted for the FMDV S-fragment RNA sequence (<xref rid="b0035 b0150" ref-type="bibr">Clarke et al., 1987; Newton et al., 1985</xref>), was tested using RNAStructure 5.4 (<xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2009</xref>), and found to be maintained, with small conformational adjustments, despite this deletion. While the loop apex of this stem-loop structure maintained an A&#x02013;C&#x02013;C&#x02013;U&#x02013;C conformation within the sequence for sample E, the adjacent stem was elongated by two base pairs and the following two loops were smaller by one and six nt respectively (data not shown). However, the nt composition of the predicted loop apex was not conserved on examination of approximately 100 FMDV S-fragment sequences (representing all seven FMDV serotypes).</p><p>The maximum genetic difference seen between samples studied from OB-Shrops was of 42&#x000a0;nt (E&#x02013;G), with a minimum of 2&#x000a0;nt (I&#x02013;J).

The genealogy network of all ten samples from this outbreak, in relation to OB-Hants and OB-Warks samples plus the most likely common ancestor using O<sub>1</sub>/Campos/BRA/58 (AY593819), implemented by TCS is shown in <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. The most likely common ancestor, as estimated by statistical parsimony analysis, was maintained after addition of all publically available FG sequences for the 1967/68 outbreak (EU448370, EU448369, EU448368, AY593816, AY593815 [data not included in <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>]). All publically available FG sequences were from cell culture passaged viruses (passage numbers unknown), originally derived from a single epithelium sample (collected on the 1st of November 1967 in Wrexham), which was designated serotype O<sub>1</sub> British Field Sample 1860 (O<sub>1</sub> BFS 1860) and used as the type virus for this outbreak. It should be noted that, although additional nt substitutions may have been introduced into the viral genome of cell culture passaged isolates, these do not change the overall conclusions of this analysis.</p><p>Longer branch lengths in <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> indicate a relatively slow accumulation of nt substitutions (observed in samples F&#x02013;J), whereas shorter branch lengths indicate a relatively fast accumulation of nt substitutions (observed in samples A&#x02013;E). <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> shows the accumulation of nt substitutions from the most likely common ancestor (estimated by TCS analysis), for the ten OB-Shrops samples against time. The estimated most likely common ancestor was dated as the 21st of October 1967, according to the date on which FMD symptoms were first reported on Bryn Farm (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Anon, 1969a</xref>). Fitting a linear regression model for 42 sequences previously generated from the UK 2001 epidemic (also involving a serotype O virus) provided evidence that sequences for samples A&#x02013;E were shaped following the same linear accumulation of nt substitution over time, whilst this relationship was absent for sequences for isolates F&#x02013;J (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig.5</xref>).

Unlike previous studies of FMD epidemics (<xref rid="b0045 b0055 b0180" ref-type="bibr">Cottam et al., 2006, 2008b; Valdazo-Gonzalez et al., 2012</xref>), the sampling density (10 samples over 8&#x000a0;months) in this study was too low to attempt to reconstruct viral transmission pathways. However, this retrospective study has provided data to define the genetic relationships between viruses recovered from sporadic outbreaks of FMD and the large epidemic that occurred in the UK during 1966&#x02013;1968. In accordance with the findings of the Northumberland Report, samples from the OB-Shrops epidemic showed a closer genetic relationship to sequences from contemporary South American isolates compared to all other field samples or cell culture isolates analysed. However, the ability to confidently identify the precise source of virus in this epidemic is restricted by the number and temporal distribution of the samples and isolates available for testing. Therefore, it remains possible that the route of virus introduction that caused the 1967/68 outbreak was via an as yet uncharacterized source in Europe as speculated in the Northumberland Report.</p><p>FG sequences can be used to yield further insights into the genetic relatedness of viruses recovered from outbreaks beyond the resolution provided by VP1 sequences. The genetic difference (214&#x02013;255&#x000a0;nt) observed between the FG sequence from OB-Warks and all other sequences was partially clarified by recombination analysis. Where samples collected from OB-Shrops and OB-Hants showed greatest sequence similarity (between 96 and 100% across the genome) with the South American isolate O<sub>1</sub>/Campos/BRA/58 (AY593819), the single FG sequence from OB-Warks showed three distinct regions of lower nucleotide identity from this serotype O strain. Subsequent re-analysis indicated that these regions shared greatest sequence similarity to a serotype A strain (A<sub>26</sub>/Argentina/66; AY593770), providing evidence of multi-region recombination events between serotype A and O viruses during the evolutionary history of the OB-Warks sequence. Recombination between FMDV field strains has been documented previously (<xref rid="b0005 b0010 b0105" ref-type="bibr">Abdul-Hamid et al., 2011; Jamal et al., 2011</xref>) and these data reinforce the importance of recognising these events to limit their potential to bias phylogenetic relationships and timed phylogenies.</p><p>The improved resolution of FG sequences enabled the investigation of evolutionary dynamics, across the viral genome, over the timescale of a single outbreak, including nt substitution rate. Although it would have been useful to have included the FG sequence for the actual index case from Bryn Farm (isolate not available), extrapolations from the estimated most likely common ancestor have provided a number of interesting observations. For example, later OB-Shrops samples (I and J) were more closely related (5&#x000a0;nt difference each) to the earliest sample sequenced from this epidemic (A), although they were collected 187 and 217&#x000a0;days later respectively. Genomic sequences from the remaining three late Shrops samples (F&#x02013;H), also demonstrated characteristics of having been left evolutionary dormant for a period of time (all lying significantly outside the linear accumulation of nt substitution demonstrated by the five earliest OB-Shrops samples and the dataset from the 2001 epidemic in the UK)<italic>.</italic> It can be hypothesized that virus outside a susceptible host does not replicate or incur nt substitutions, and would therefore appear more like the ancestral virus than would be expected given the time that had elapsed. The suggestion was made by the Ministry of Agriculture (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Anon, 1969a</xref>) that 12/18 cases of FMD that occurred on the same farm twice were due to a recrudescence of the disease, possibly as a result of infected hay remaining on the farm after the original outbreak. However, none of the five late samples from OB-Shrops occurred on farms from which infected samples had previously been collected. Fomite transmission of infected material to previously FMD-free premises, including hay, could also result in this apparent &#x02018;slowing&#x02019; of virus evolution during this epidemic, for which these result provide evidence. Furthermore, FMD virus survival outside of a host may have been improved during the winter months of 1967/68. Although improved as compared to VP1 sequencing, the resolution of FG sequencing was insufficient to identify ambiguities indicative of evolutionary intermediates within the samples studied here. Future work could involve the utilisation of next-generation sequencing (<xref rid="b0200 b0160" ref-type="bibr">Wright et al., 2011; Radford et al., 2012</xref>) to investigate the genetic heterogeneity present within individual samples of FMDV.</p><p>The equivalent clock rates observed for sequences determined from early OB-Shrops samples (8.73&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;</sup><sup>3</sup>&#x000a0;nt substitutions/site/year) and the 2001 UK FMD epidemic (8.66&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;</sup><sup>3</sup>&#x000a0;nt substitutions/site/year), provide evidence for a comparable clock rate across two FMDV topotypes within serotype O, Europe&#x02013;South America (EURO&#x02013;SA) and Middle East-South Asia (ME-SA), respectively.</p><p>In conclusion, this retrospective study indicates that there were at least three separate incursions of FMD into the UK during the period between 1966 and 1968. These data confirm that earlier UK outbreaks, including those in Northumberland, Hampshire and Warwickshire did not have epidemiological links to the large 1967/68 epidemic. This study reinforces the idea that nucleotide sequences can make an important contribution to understanding the epidemiology of FMD epidemics, and analyses of these data can provide insights that can be used to control and eradicate the disease.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abdul-Hamid</surname><given-names>N.F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Firat-Sarac</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Radford</surname><given-names>A.D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Knowles</surname><given-names>N.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>D.P.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparative sequence analysis of representative foot-and-mouth disease virus genomes from Southeast Asia</article-title><source>Virus Genes</source><volume>43</volume><year>2011</year><fpage>41</fpage><lpage>45</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21479678</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b0010"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abdul-Hamid</surname><given-names>N.F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hussein</surname><given-names>N.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Wadsworth</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Radford</surname><given-names>A.D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Knowles</surname><given-names>N.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>D.P.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Phylogeography of foot-and-mouth disease virus types O and A in Malaysia and surrounding countries</article-title><source>Infect.
