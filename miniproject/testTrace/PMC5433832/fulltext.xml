To achieve these goals, countries may need to scale up point-of-care (POC) testing in addition to strengthening central laboratory services. While decentralising testing increases patient access to diagnostics, it presents many challenges with regard to training and assuring the quality of tests and testing. To ensure synergies, the London School of Hygiene &#x00026; Tropical Medicine held a series of consultations with countries with an interest in quality assurance and their implementing partners, and agreed on an external quality assessment (EQA) programme to ensure reliable results so that the results lead to the best possible care for HIV patients. As a result of the consultations, EQA International was established, bringing together EQA providers and implementers to develop a strategic plan for countries to establish national POC EQA programmes and to estimate the cost of setting up and maintaining the programme. With the dramatic increase in the number of proficiency testing panels required for thousands of POC testing sites across Africa, it is important to facilitate technology transfer from global EQA providers to a network of regional EQA centres in Africa for regional proficiency testing panel production. EQA International will continue to identify robust and cost-effective EQA technologies for quality POC testing, integrating novel technologies to support sustainable country-owned EQA programmes in Africa.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0001"><title>The need for quality assurance</title><p>It is estimated that 36.9 million people globally are living with HIV, with more than two-thirds of these individuals located in resource-limited regions.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The ambitious UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, aimed to end the HIV epidemic within the next 15 years, place diagnostics in a key role for achieving these goals: by 2020, 90% of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status; 90% of all HIV-positive people will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy; 90% of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will achieve viral suppression.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Recent estimates suggest that 15.8 million people are receiving antiretroviral therapy. With the new World Health Organization guidelines recommending test and treat, it is expected that 30 million people living with HIV will have access to treatment by 2020.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>The achievement of the 90-90-90 targets depends on the availability of tests for HIV case detection, including early infant diagnosis (EID) and viral load for monitoring viral suppression. CD4 enumeration is still used for treatment initiation in many countries as they move toward the World Health Organization guidelines of test and treat, and plan to scale up viral load testing. However, access to these tests is reduced in resource-limited settings. Recent efforts aimed at improving access to these assays have seen a large increase in novel technologies that can be performed at the point of care (POC). The rollout of rapid POC tests for HIV testing and treatment initiation has significantly reduced the time for patients to receive results and initiate therapy.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> As testing is decentralised to hundreds of sites outside of the laboratory, and being performed by non-laboratory staff, ensuring test quality and accuracy of results have become key considerations in HIV programmes.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Current point-of-care technologies for CD4, early infant diagnosis and viral load testing</title><p>To date, there are two approved (World Health Organization-prequalified) POC platforms for CD4 and two for EID, whereas POC viral load platforms are in the evaluation pipeline.<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Most of these POC technologies provide sample-in/answer-out diagnostic testing, making it possible for these tests to be performed with minimal training, outside of the traditional laboratory setting. Most of the devices can withstand extreme transport and environmental conditions, provide a test result in less than one hour and have data transmission capabilities. Some (and more are in development) can even operate on battery power.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>The rollout of CD4 POC devices in the last few years has provided us with lessons learnt in the implementation and quality management for POC testing. EID and viral load POC testing has not yet been fully implemented in the field, but will benefit from lessons learned from the CD4 experience to strengthen existing quality programmes and ensure integration of POC testing within these programmes.</p></sec><sec id="s0003"><title>Understanding quality assurance</title><p>Quality management is the entire process supporting the quality of testing, while quality assurance is the planned activities implemented to support the quality management system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> While it is highly recommended that a POC quality assurance plan address the entire quality assurance management cycle, in this report we focus on external quality assurance as a quality assurance activity relevant to POC testing, and the results serve as a strong indicator of laboratory quality.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><fig id="F0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>World Health Organization/US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quality assurance cycle to improve the quality of HIV-related point-of-care testing.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AJLM-5-557-g001"/></fig><p>POC devices have in-built internal quality controls to monitor in real time the performance of an instrument and, to some extent, the user. If any of the controls fail, the device should not provide a test result. In contrast, external quality assessment (EQA), often used interchangeably with proficiency testing, challenges the testing environment and allows for an external expert body to examine the processes and provide remedial action.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>The three components of an effective EQA laboratory programme are site supervision, retesting of specimens, and proficiency testing.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Supervision is integral to quality assurance and should be done routinely, but with minimal disruption to patient services. Retesting is rarely done due to costs and time constraints, and is especially challenging in the POC environment. Proficiency testing is the most widely-used approach to monitor the performance of the test used and the quality of testing. It involves blinded control material, meant to mimic patient specimens, sent from a reference laboratory to the testing site and results sent back for scoring. Participation in EQA programmes is often mandated for clinical laboratories performing regular testing of patient samples for HIV care and management.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>A low proficiency testing score should alert the laboratory or testing site that there is a problem.

While the use of fresh whole blood samples most closely resembles clinical samples tested by a participant, if an EQA programme has several hundred participants or a participant base located over a wide geographical area, it may not be feasible to access enough material and distribute to participants within the time-frame that the material is stable and effective for proper evaluation. Commercially-stabilised whole blood products, while financially more challenging, are homogeneous and stable for weeks to months, which is beneficial for large EQA programmes.</p><p>Novel technologies are likely to be needed, given the volumes and potential logistical challenges, such as maintenance of sample integrity during transport. Several innovative cost-effective applications are being explored to provide stabilised EQA specimens for CD4, EID and viral load testing. A major challenge with CD4 has been the necessity for whole blood and therefore stabilisers are required as a means of extending pre-analytic capacity for CD4 T-cell enumeration.<sup><xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Considering POC sites, an ideal candidate would allow the EQA CD4 and EID specimens to remain stable for up to three weeks at ambient temperatures in-country.</p><p>Another innovative technology, the dried tube specimen (DTS) has been successfully used for EQA for HIV and syphilis rapid diagnostic tests and for automated viral load laboratory tests.<sup><xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> DTS can likely be expanded for EQA of viral load POC tests as well as other tests.

Often failures go unreported, but though a proactive EQA programme, these failures can be captured and reported appropriately.</p><p>Participation in an external quality assessment program provides many benefits and valuable data to health authorities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>):<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Comparison of performance and results among different test sites.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Collection of data across different sites.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Early warning for systematic problems.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Objective evidence of testing quality.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Indicates areas that need improvement.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Survey the use of diagnostic algorithms.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Potential to build health security through surveillance and monitoring.</p></list-item></list><fig id="F0003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3</label><caption><p>Benefits of an external quality assurance programme to point-of-care sites, country programmes, and point-of-care industry.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AJLM-5-557-g003"/></fig><p>A key feature of many of these POC molecular devices is that they are equipped with data transmission capacities. Apart from monitoring the quality of tests and testing to optimise supply chain management, data connectivity links data from diagnostic laboratories and POC test readers and devices to provide data on testing coverage, disease trends and timely information for early warning of infectious disease outbreaks.<sup><xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Looking forward: Sustainable, country-owned external quality assessment programmes in Africa</title><p>Sustainability of EQA programmes requires country ownership. As countries in Africa plan the scale-up of POC technologies for CD4, viral load and EID testing, political commitment toward quality should be reflected in country policies and implementation plans. Putting in place EQA programmes that can identify gaps and challenges in the testing environment and address them immediately to increase the efficiency of healthcare systems and improve patient results, are urgent priorities.</p><p>The role of implementing partners and industry in support of EQA and quality assurance programmes is also a strong consideration for the sustainability of quality-assured testing. Partners and industry can bring numerous resources to these programmes. As an example, when Zimbabwe was establishing their national quality assurance programme, the Ministry of Health brought together stakeholders as well as quality assurance and POC partners to share their vision for a coordinated national programme that would identify redundancies and gaps and leverage partner resources and commitment. This process secures a sustainable country-owned quality assurance national policy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>CDC Disclaimer: The findings and conclusions in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official position of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Open Review: This article underwent open peer review by Ben Cheng and David Mabey.
