Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the first viral pathogen confirmed to be widely transmissible in animal food. Because the potential for viral contamination in animal food is not well characterized, the objectives of this study were to 1) observe the magnitude of virus contamination in an animal food manufacturing facility, and 2) investigate a proposed method, feed sequencing, to decrease virus decontamination on animal food-contact surfaces. A U.S. virulent PEDV isolate was used to inoculate 50 kg swine feed, which was mixed, conveyed, and discharged into bags using pilot-scale feed manufacturing equipment. Surfaces were swabbed and analyzed for the presence of PEDV RNA by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Environmental swabs indicated complete contamination of animal food-contact surfaces (0/40 vs. 48/48, positive baseline samples/total baseline samples, positive subsequent samples/total subsequent samples, respectively; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and near complete contamination of non-animal food-contact surfaces (0/24 vs. 16/18, positive baseline samples/total baseline samples, positive subsequent samples/total subsequent samples, respectively; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Flushing animal food-contact surfaces with low-risk feed is commonly used to reduce cross-contamination in animal feed manufacturing. Thus, four subsequent 50 kg batches of virus-free swine feed were manufactured using the same system to test its impact on decontaminating animal food-contact surfaces. Even after 4 subsequent sequences, animal food-contact surfaces retained viral RNA (28/33 positive samples/total samples), with conveying system being more contaminated than the mixer. A bioassay to test infectivity of dust from animal food-contact surfaces failed to produce infectivity. This study demonstrates the potential widespread viral contamination of surfaces in an animal food manufacturing facility and the difficulty of removing contamination using conventional feed sequencing, which underscores the importance for preventing viruses from entering and contaminating such facilities.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008370</institution-id><institution>National Pork Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14-273</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Woodworth</surname><given-names>Jason C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Pork Board to JCW, 14-273.

Recent changes in legislation through the Food Safety Modernization Act, along with evolving consumer demands, are placing greater emphasis on the role of animal food in the farm-to-fork food safety system [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Recently, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a swine pathogen present in other parts of the world, was identified for the first time in the United States [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187309.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The introduction of PEDV into U.S. herds was remarkable because of the sheer magnitude of infectivity and impact on animal health and welfare [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187309.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Nonetheless, it was also significant because PEDV is one of the first viral pathogens confirmed transmissible in animal food. In one proof-of-concept study, suspected particulates of animal food and dust was found infectious [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Potential routes of viral introduction into the animal food manufacturing process have been identified [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, there is potential for viral contamination of animal food manufacturing facilities [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, there is no available data describing the transmission of viruses in either animal or human food manufacturing facilities, nor are there established procedures to reduce or eliminate viral contamination on food-contact surfaces. This is particularly concerning because a proof-of-concept procedure proved elimination of PEDV RNA in an animal food manufacturing facility was challenging, and extreme decontamination measures including chemical disinfectants and heat were necessary [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. More information is needed to understand how a food-transmitted virus interacts with a manufacturing environment in order to ensure both animal and human health. Therefore, the objective of this study was to 1) characterize the extent of viral contamination in an animal food manufacturing facility and 2) test a proposed control method, feed sequencing, to decrease viral decontamination on animal food-contact surfaces as measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and infectivity by pig bioassay.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The animal food manufacturing portion of the experiments was conducted at the Kansas State University Cargill Food Safety Research Center (FSRC; Manhattan, KS), a 3-story biosafety level 2 biocontainment laboratory and animal food manufacturing facility containing pilot scale animal food manufacturing equipment.

Hazard characterization includes biological hazards, such as <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; however viral pathogens were not traditionally considered common biological hazards in animal food until after the introduction of PEDV to North America. Recent research identified swine food as one of many potential vectors for virus transmission, and confirmed PEDV contaminated foodstuffs may cause disease [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187309.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. While animal food is not likely the predominant vector, it was one of the remaining potential vectors for PEDV transmission that was not previously controlled by on-farm biosecurity measures. This is concerning because little is known about virus contamination during the manufacturing of animal food. Likewise, viral transmission in animal food manufacturing facilities is not well characterized, nor are tested control methods available to reduce contamination on animal food-contact surfaces. While there are no currently identified similar cases of viral transmission through the human food chain, its potential exists and information gleaned from studying PEDV transmission may be applicable if a virus impacting human health were to enter the human food manufacturing system.</p><p>For these reasons, an established protocol for monitoring viral transmission is needed to model animal and human food hazards if additional pathogenic viruses are discovered in our food supply. This is the first study of its kind to fully observe environmental contamination of an animal food-manufacturing facility during a proposed control method after manufacturing viral-inoculated swine food. Objectives were met by monitoring the extent of virus contamination in an animal food manufacturing facility and investigating a control method to decrease virus contamination on animal food-contact surfaces.</p><p>In general, environmental contamination of a virus in any food manufacturing facility has not been well-documented. In human food, norovirus is a known cause of foodborne illness with contamination presumed at point-of-service [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187309.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, there is little information regarding norovirus-contaminated food at the manufacturing level due to inadequate surveillance or facility control measures [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Even less is known about viral contamination in animal food manufacturing facilities.</p><p>The results from this study clearly demonstrate the extent of the widespread viral contamination that occurs in an animal food manufacturing facility after production of virus-inoculated animal food. All of the animal food-contact surfaces and most of the non-animal food-contact surfaces were qPCR positive when swabbed after the contaminated animal food was manufactured and remained qPCR positive after multiple batches of animal food were mixed and conveyed. Therefore, it seems that the proposed mitigation technique (feed batch sequencing) did not mitigate environmental PEDV contamination. Additionally, detectible PEDV seemed to persist on some animal food-contact surfaces, such as plastic and rubber conveyors, more than others such as metal. Previous studies have investigated the survivability of virus on inanimate surfaces and determined viral persistence in the environment can be affected by several factors including surface type [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Additionally, different surface types can have different characteristics such electrostatic, hydrophobic or ionic strength which may impact virus detectability on these surfaces [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187309.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For example, it has been reported that electrostatic forces impact virus attachment to lettuce [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that physical properties contributed to the persistence of PEDV on animal food-contact surfaces sampled in the current study. This is interesting because most animal food manufacturing equipment have been designed for electrical efficiency and physical cleanout, but not sanitization. For example, plastic conveyer buckets are preferred not only because they are light and more energy efficient, but they are also safer for workers due to elimination of sparking that is a concern with sheeted metal buckets [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>In pet food manufacturing, equipment surfaces are easy-to-clean with non-porous equipment surfaces selected in order to prevent biofilms or the prevalence of <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. or <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>. They are also routinely sanitized with steam or chemical sanitizers. Other animal food manufacturing facilities have not selected equipment for these purposes due to previously limited risk for biological hazards. Thus, other strategies, such as use of chemical additives in animal food, may need to be employed to reduce cross-contamination of PEDV in animal food or ingredients [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Alternatively, the difference in rate of contamination between the metal mixer or plastic and rubber in the conveyor may be due to equipment design. For example, mixers are typically designed to self-clean with little residual material from one batch to the next compared to conveyors. This is particularly true of bucket elevators, which is the conveyor type used in this experiment. The large rubber belt of a bucket elevator is suspended vertically, and plastic buckets convey feed upward until the feed is flipped from the buckets into a discharge chute. The boot pit, which is the area at the bottom of the bucket elevator, must be large enough for buckets to clear the bottom without coming into contact with the guard or cover. This area typically fills with residual feed and may lead to batch-to-batch cross contamination, which has been demonstrated by carryover of animal drugs [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, it is reasonable to extrapolate that batch-to-batch carryover of feed residue may also exist when the hazard is an undesirable microorganism.</p><p>This research concludes that differences exist in viral contamination rates on different equipment surfaces, which may be due to differences in surface type, equipment design, or other phenomena. Regardless of the source of these differences, animal food manufacturing facilities at risk for PEDV contamination should consider these findings when choosing manufacturing equipment. The results of the current experiment are applicable to other species of animal food and to human food manufacturing facilities because entry of a viral pathogen may cause widespread contamination that is difficult to eliminate. Even with wet chemical cleaning and facility heating, PEDV proved difficult to decontaminate from our facility [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This is concerning because extreme methods were used, which are impractical in commercial animal food manufacturing settings.</p><p>In the current study, environmental surfaces were swabbed for dust after production of PEDV inoculated animal food and animal-food contact surfaces were evaluated for infectivity. A previous proof-of-concept-study demonstrated that animal food dust can be infectious [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although the exact cause for lack of infectivity in this study is unknown, storage time may have impacted virulence in these samples since long-term low temperature storage has been reported to affect virus fitness and recoverability [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Additionally, although the minimum infectious dose is low in animal food [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], perhaps not enough viral particles were collected by or eluded from swabs to cause an infection in the present study. Although we were unsuccessful at finding evidence of infectivity in this study, the hypothesis that environment dust is infectious after animal food batch sequencing is still conceivable and remains to be proven.</p><p>Another result from this study is that some non-food contact swabs from a repetition were qPCR positive after the negative animal food was manufactured, although importantly, animal food tested was qPCR negative. We hypothesize this genetic material remained on the boot due to inadequate cleaning after a previous replicate and was tracked then detected on the concrete floor. Due to the chemical cleaning between repetitions, the viral material should not have been infective [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, we believe contaminated rubber boot bottoms worn during the experiment helped track and spread the virus as genetic material was consistently detected on concrete floor surfaces. This underscores the importance of foot traffic biosecurity in any facility, including animal food manufacturing facilities [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This is especially true as demonstrated in one study, PEDV and porcine deltacorona virus was detected from multiple locations within and around animal food manufacturing facilities [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] which again illustrates foot traffic can be a biosecurity problem. Therefore, key implications from these findings is that foot traffic should be limited across receiving pits or in hand-add areas that have direct access to animal food contact equipment and boots should be cleaned regularly to minimize risk of inadvertent contamination.</p><p>As the current study demonstrates, widespread contamination of PEDV occurred and was detected on most surfaces. Material collected from dust collection systems and sweepings should be collected and disposed instead of added to the product flow as per traditional measures [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187309.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, animal food manufacturing facilities should re-consider before using dust collected from dust disposal systems and instead consider including procedures to minimize and control dust since it could be a vector of possibly infectious PEDV. Again, once an animal food manufacturing facility is contaminated with an undesired microorganism, it is difficult to eliminate and thus prevention protocols should be implemented [<xref rid="pone.0187309.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187309.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, this study clearly demonstrates widespread contamination occurred in an animal food manufacturing facility after PEDV swine food production. Furthermore, the proposed mitigation method of feed batch sequencing was not effective to reduce environmental contamination, although the potential impact of PEDV contamination and importance to prevent virus entry in such facilities was better understood. It is concerning once an animal food manufacturing facility is contaminated with PEDV, it appears to harbor PEDV until chemically cleaned. This research indicates animal food manufacturing facilities potentially contaminated with PEDV can be a central point for virus transmission and the quantification for this risk should be assessed. As a result, the practicality of decontamination is a new challenge facing our animal food manufacturing facilities.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for processing animal samples.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0187309.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">FDA.
