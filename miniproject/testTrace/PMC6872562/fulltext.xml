We included 403 persons, representing 92.4% of all HIV-positive individuals entering clinical care in Croatia in 2014&#x02013;2017. Overall prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) was estimated at 16.4%. Resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside RTI (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs) was found in 11.4%, 6.7% and 2.5% of persons, respectively. Triple-class resistance was determined in 2.2% of individuals. In addition, a single case (1.0%) of resistance to integrase strand-transfer inhibitors (InSTIs) was found. Deep sequencing was performed on 48 randomly selected samples and detected additional TDR mutations in 6 cases. Phylogenetic inference showed that 347/403 sequences (86.1%) were part of transmission clusters and identified forward transmission of resistance in Croatia, even that of triple-class resistance. The largest TDR cluster of 53 persons with T215S was estimated to originate in the year 1992. Our data show a continuing need for pre-treatment HIV resistance testing in Croatia. Even though a low prevalence of resistance to InSTI was observed, surveillance of TDR to InSTI should be continued.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Epidemiology</kwd><kwd>Molecular medicine</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004488</institution-id><institution>Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost (Croatian Science Foundation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IP-2014-09-4461</award-id><award-id>IP-2014-09-4461</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oroz</surname><given-names>Maja</given-names></name><name><surname>Begovac</surname><given-names>Josip</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Croatia is a South-Eastern European country with a low prevalence of HIV-1 infection (&#x0003c;0.04%). A total of 1540 persons have been diagnosed with HIV-1 infection in the period 1985&#x02013;2017<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Clinical care for HIV-infected persons is centralized, meaning that all persons diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in the country are followed at the University Hospital for Infectious Diseases (UHID) in Zagreb, Croatian capital<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. All clinical, socio-demographic, virological and molecular data from patient&#x02019;s medical records are collected at one place, enabling us to perform extensive countrywide epidemiological, virological as well as clinical studies of HIV infection.</p><p id="Par3">HIV-1 is a retrovirus characterized by a high mutation rate and extensive genetic variability. HIV-1 strains are classified into four groups (M, N, O, P) and group M is responsible for the global pandemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Group M is divided in 9 genetically distinct subtypes (A-D, F-H, J and K), sub-subtypes (A1, A2, F1, F2) and 98 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Global distribution of HIV-1 subtypes is highly heterogeneous, but the most prevalent subtype in Central and Western Europe is HIV-1 subtype B, responsible for 85% of new HIV-1 cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Infection with HIV-1 subtype B in the population of men who have sex with men (MSM) is the most common factor that contributes to the spread of HIV-1 infection in Central and Western Europe, while the infection with non-B subtypes is usually related with heterosexual contact and immigration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In Croatia, first cases of HIV-1 infection were linked to labour migrants who returned from Western European countries (infections with subtype B) and seafarers who acquired HIV in Africa and Eastern Asia (infections with non-B subtypes and CRFs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, transmission routes in Croatia have changed considerably in the last two decades, in a way that 40&#x02013;50% of new HIV-1 cases were attributed to MSM transmission during the time period 1985&#x02013;2010<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, while the latest national reports revealed that 83% of newly diagnosed HIV-1 cases in 2016 and 92% of new cases in 2017 acquired infection through MSM contact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Despite being a country with a low level of HIV epidemic, a previous national study showed a very high prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) of 22.0% (study period 2006&#x02013;2008) in Croatia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, while the European SPREAD study, which included data for 25 European countries and Israel, showed an overall prevalence of 8.3% (study period 2008&#x02013;2010)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In contrast to Croatian data, regional countries reported substantially lower TDR prevalence, such as Slovenia (2.4%), Serbia (8.8%), Bulgaria (5.2%) and Greece (6.0%), while in Romania (14.8%), Hungary (17%) and northern Italy (12%) TDR prevalence is comparable to the Croatian setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In the previous national study primary resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs) was analysed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

As we defined complete mutation concordance when both SS and DS identified the same pattern of SDRMs, in 50% (8/16) of samples results completely matched. Partial concordance was identified in 2 samples, both of them carried triple-class drug resistance with the same pattern that was identified by SS. DS analysis detected all of these mutations and additionally identified several other RTI mutations that were present at frequencies below the SS threshold. Complete divergence was observed in 6 samples. In 4/6 samples complete divergence was determined in samples in which DS detected T215S mutation at frequencies below the SS threshold (around 10%).

We also described HIV transmission networks responsible for the forward spread of HIV-1 infection and drug-resistant variants in the country. This study included &#x0003e;90% of HIV-1 persons entering HIV clinical care in the time period 2014&#x02013;2017, therefore it is to the best of our knowledge the most extensive HIV molecular epidemiology study performed in Croatia, so far. Our results confirmed previous findings that in recent years HIV-1 infection in Croatia primarily affects the young MSM. Individuals were more likely to present for clinical care at the chronic stage of HIV-1 infection with a median CD4 count of 325 cells/&#x003bc;L. According to the international definition of late presentation for care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, which is defined by all persons with CD4 count &#x0003c;350 cells/&#x003bc;L, our cohort consisted of &#x0003e;50% late presenters and 18% were diagnosed with clinical AIDS. Even though this proportion is alarming, when compared to the study results from the period 1999&#x02013;2004<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, with baseline median CD4 count of 276 cells/&#x003bc;L and 34% persons presenting with clinical AIDS, our data show that the situation has improved.</p><p id="Par18">The Croatian HlV-1 epidemic is distinguished by a high prevalence of TDR, as first reported in our previous nation-wide study (22%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and confirmed in the present study (16.4%). Even though TDR prevalence appears to have decreased moderately in the last decade, the pattern of SDRMs has changed significantly and become more challenging for tailoring a successful first-line treatment. In the previous study, high TDR was mainly due to one large TC of MSM with SDRM T215S, while NNRTI resistance-associated mutations were only present at a low frequency (2.4%) and PI resistance-associated mutations were not detected at all. In contrast, the present study shows that the revertant T215S remains the most frequent SDRM, determined in 30 (7.4%) persons. With this, TDR to NRTIs was the most prevalent, determined in 46 (11.4%) persons; however, we also observed the emergence of SDRMs to NNRTIs among 27 (6.7%) persons. In addition, PI resistance was determined in 10 (2.5%) persons, including 9 (2.2%) with triple-class drug resistance, mediated by the mutation pattern PI: V32I, I47V&#x02009;+&#x02009;NRTI: T215D/E&#x02009;+&#x02009;NNRTI: L100I, K103N. Phylogenetic inference indicated a transmission link with one UK sequence with a similar mutation pattern, PI: V32I, M46L, I47A, V82A&#x02009;+&#x02009;NRTI: T215Y&#x02009;+&#x02009;NNRTI: L100I, K103N. Moreover, a patient with treatment failure due to this resistance pattern has not yet been encountered in clinical care in Croatia, indicating that this SDRM pattern was introduced in Croatia from abroad and has subsequently spread in the country.</p><p id="Par19">Prevalence of TDR in European countries has been monitored via the SPREAD program, organised under the supervision of the European Society for Translational Antiviral Research (ESAR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The latest SPREAD study analysed data for the period 2008&#x02013;2010 and showed an overall TDR prevalence of 8.3%. The prevalence of SDRMs to NRTIs was 4.5%, while SDRMs to NNRTIs and PIs were present at lower frequencies, 2.9% and 2%, respectively. Comparing our data (Croatian old and new dataset) to the SPREAD data, we observed that overall TDR prevalence in Croatia was and remains high above the European average. TDR prevalence studies in the region show that only a few countries report high TDR prevalence similar to that of Croatia. However, one has to take into account that variation in the study design, national coverage and interpretation algorithms may affect cross-country comparison. Andreis <italic>et al</italic>. reported TDR of 12.3% in a cohort of 750 HIV-infected persons diagnosed in northern Italy in the time period 2013&#x02013;2016, with E138A mutation being the most frequent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, Andreis <italic>et al</italic>. used the interpretation algorithm for genotypic drug resistance incorporated in Viroseq HIV Genotyping System, which also includes polymorphic mutations that do not indicate TDR. This highlights the importance of using a universally adopted mutation list for TDR surveillance, such as the WHO list<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In respect to that, E138A was also found in our cohort, but was not reported in this study. Temereanca <italic>et al</italic>. showed a 14.75% TDR prevalence in Romania<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The study included 61 newly diagnosed patients that enrolled in clinical care in the time period 1997&#x02013;2011.

Even though both countries reported high TDR, study bias is possible due to the low number of samples included in their analyses.</p><p id="Par20">The European SPREAD study analysed the presence of InSTI-resistant variants in Europe (2006&#x02013;2007) before the introduction of InSTIs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The study showed that before the drugs were introduced there were no circulating variants that could jeopardize the effect of InSTIs. InSTIs are drugs with very high potency that ensure fast and sustainable drop of viral load but also provide tolerability and safety for long-term use. Because of their positive characteristics they are recommended as a first-line regimen by ART guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Since the use of these drugs became more widespread recently, the emergence of InSTI-resistant variants can be expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. However, surveillance of InSTI resistance is currently recommended only for patients with evidence of TDR to other drug classes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Due to the high prevalence of TDR to RTI and PI drug classes in our cohort, we tested resistance to InSTIs in selected patients. InSTIs were first introduced to Croatia in 2015 and there was no clear benefit of baseline TDR testing to InSTI in persons who entered clinical care in the period 2014&#x02013;2016. In addition, first cases of resistance in InSTI-treated persons were reported in 2016<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, therefore InSTI resistance was tested only among treatment-naive persons who entered clinical care during 2017. We found only one major InSTI mutation (G140A), three accessory resistance mutations (T97A, Q146QH, D232N) and a very high prevalence of polymorphism S230N (49/100, 49%), which is not associated with reduced InSTI susceptibility. We confirmed high susceptibility to InSTIs in this Croatian cohort, as expected and reported by other countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">Subtype B remains the most common HIV-1 subtype in Croatia. The previous analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> determined infection with the subtype B in 89% of newly diagnosed HIV-1 persons and the present study showed a comparable prevalence rate of 91.3%. Among the non-B subtypes only subtype A1, subtype C and CRF02_AG variants were observed in &#x0003e;1% of the cohort. In respect to that, we focused more on transmission networks of subtype B. In the 2006&#x02013;2008 analysis, phylogenetic inference identified eight distinct TCs and the largest TC consisted of MSM carrying T215S mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Since no background sequences were included, only local TCs were identified and HIV introduction events remained unknown. The present study, which included sequences from the old (2006&#x02013;2008) and new (2014&#x02013;2017) datasets as well as control sequences, identified 45 TCs. The majority of TCs were active and only two clusters were comprised of only the sequences from the old dataset. Even though a considerable number of active TCs (65%) were newly formed, the clusters identified in the previous study expanded significantly and represented the largest TCs determined in this analysis. Most of the old dataset sequences that were determined to be without an obvious transmission link in the previous analysis, were observed to belong to mixed TCs, consisting of mainly regional (Slovenian, German, Czech, Poland and Serbian) and Croatian sequences in the present analysis. Most of these mixed TCs were intermixed with sequences from regional countries, however, it seems that a number of persons could have acquired the infection in other countries, such as Spain, Turkey, Mexico and/or the United States. Interestingly, we observed no connection between Croatian and Hungarian sequences and very few between Croatian and Italian sequences. Similar observations of cross-border HIV transmission have been described by other studies, together with reporting that risk factors, such as the use of alcohol/drugs prior to sex, visiting sex parties and travelling abroad to engage in sex, seem to be increasing in Europe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par22">Overall, the phylogenetic analysis has shown that a significant number of persons (86%) were part of TCs, among which 70% were found in local TCs. When combining results of phylogenetic inference with socio-demographic data reported by persons included in this study, our results indicate that HIV-1 epidemic in Croatia is mainly local and driven by young MSM. Similar findings were observed in Slovenia, where Lunar <italic>et al</italic>. determined a high percentage of clustering among Slovenian sequences (81%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Our findings are comparable with epidemiological studies from other Western and Central European countries, where HIV-1 infection is concentrated among MSM infected with subtype B, however the proportion of clustered sequences was &#x0003c;60%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Since analysis of TCs is dependent on sampling methods, methodological approaches and transmission cluster definition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, high extent of clustering in our study can be explained by high sampling density. This study included &#x0003e;90% of HIV-1 persons who entered HIV clinical care during consecutive 4-year period, while the majority of above mentioned studies achieved a coverage of 30&#x02013;60%, sampled during an extended time frame (usually during a 10&#x02013;20 year period).</p><p id="Par23">A considerable number of persons carrying SDRMs (61/66, 92.4%) were observed in TCs, thus confirming the substantial forward spread of SDRMs in the country. Most of the sequences with SDRMs (83.6%) formed local TCs, of which the T215S cluster of 53 persons remained the largest SDRM cluster in Croatia. Phylodynamic analysis suggested that this TC could be one of the earliest clusters in the country, with its estimated tMRCA in the year 1992. T215 revertants are one of the most common NRTI mutations found in untreated persons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. These variants develop from strains containing T215Y/F mutations, primarily selected under the stavudine (d4T) and zidovudine (AZT) treatment and tend to persist for many years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. In Croatia, regimens containing AZT and d4T were in use from the early 90&#x02009;s on, but the use of AZT has decreased to &#x0003c;5% in 2017 and d4T is not in use since 2012. However, the high prevalence of the revertant T215S variants in the Croatian HIV-1 cohort is likely a hallmark of once highly prevalent therapy in Croatia.</p><p id="Par24">Along with T215S, we report on K101E, T215S&#x02009;+&#x02009;L210W and triple-class drug resistance pattern, as major contributors to the spread of resistant strains in Croatia. All strains carrying these mutations were found in local TCs. Interestingly, each cluster had its specific characteristics such as age of the persons participating in the cluster, prevalence of AIDS at initial diagnosis and estimated time of the origin of the cluster. However, one common characteristic was observed in all TCs &#x02013; all persons but one were MSM. The TC with K101E, the triple-class resistance TC and the sub-cluster T215S&#x02009;+&#x02009;L210W were all identified as newly formed clusters. On the other hand, the largest TC with T215S is an expanding cluster that has contributed in the spread of HIV-1 infection in Croatia over the last two decades. Its longevity and impact on the local epidemic shows the importance of monitoring TDR on a national level. Particularly alarming is the finding of a local TC with triple-class resistance pattern. We estimated that the origin of this TC dates in 2008, with the sequence most closely related originating from the UK, sampled in 2006. Since it is a newly formed TC comprised of 8 Croatian sequences that were sampled throughout the period 2014&#x02013;2017, we can expect to see more patients with this complex resistance pattern in Croatia in the future. For some of the observed SDRMs further transmission was not detected. These were possibly individually introduced into the country or originated from Croatian persons with treatment failure and simply had not been transmitted further, due to lower fitness of these variants. For mutations M46I, T69D, G190E, K219Q and K219R reduced fitness compared to wild-type virus has been observed, as these tend to revert back to wild type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. All persons with these SDRMs participated in mixed TCs, but none of the other related sequences, sampled in Croatia or abroad, shared these SDRMs.</p><p id="Par25">In addition to Sanger sequencing, 48 randomly selected samples were tested for SDRMs using deep sequencing. The aim was to observe the agreement between the two sequencing platforms and estimate the potential use of DS for routine diagnostics of clinical HIV resistance. The proportion of resistant variants present in initial infection can fall below the standard level of detection (&#x0003c;15%) of SS, especially when persons are diagnosed in the late chronic stage of infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. In the present analysis, DS was able to detect low-abundance viral variants with frequencies &#x0003c;10%, which were not detected by SS, however, most of the results were in complete agreement (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;39/47, 82.9%). Partial concordance was observed in two samples where DS was able to detect all the mutations identified by SS and some additional SDRMs. Complete discordance was observed in six samples. In four samples discordance was due to the SDRM T215S being detected by DS at low frequencies and falling below threshold in SS. In the other two samples, highlighted by the disagreement between the platforms, the mutation patterns diverged completely. Similar results were reported by other studies, which showed that DS is able to identify SDRMs that are commonly not identified by SS and that minor disagreement between the two platforms is possible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. In this study, clinical significance of minority SDRMs was not evaluated, since we wanted to emphasize the importance of including new technologies in clinical diagnostics and combining them with already established ones, especially in complex clinical cases that do not respond to first-line treatment options.</p><p id="Par26">In conclusion, this is the first comprehensive study on molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 infection in Croatia. We have shown that the epidemic is mainly local and driven by the young MSM population. We determined a high overall prevalence of SDRM of 16.4% and forward spread of resistant viral strains, even that of triple-class resistance. Most of the identified mutations were clinically relevant, indicating a need for baseline HIV resistance testing before treatment initiation in Croatia. Even though a low prevalence of resistance to InSTI was observed, TDR to InSTI needs to be carefully surveyed on a national level. In addition, we demonstrated that deep sequencing is a reliable tool for accurate identification of low-level viral quasispecies. These data can help develop prevention strategies and public health interventions. We suggest that in settings similar to that of Croatia, where high prevalence of SDRM is present and where most of the cohort is connected through transmission networks, new approaches, such as identification of transmission clusters &#x0201c;in real-time&#x0201d; and immediate intervention, could pose a method to prevent further expansion of HIV-1 epidemics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Study population and samples</title><p id="Par27">This study included treatment naive HIV-infected persons &#x02265;18 years old who entered HIV clinical care at University Hospital for Infectious Diseases (UHID) in the time period between January 2014 and December 2017 and had plasma viraemia &#x0003e;1,000 HIV-1 RNA copies per ml.
