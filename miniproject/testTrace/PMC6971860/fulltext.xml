In the 2017, a dengue epidemic occurred in Hanoi in a short time interval and many cases were serious with associated mortality. This was the largest and unusual dengue fever outbreak in the North of Vietnam over the past 20&#x02009;years. The objective of the present study was to understand the genetic characteristics of the DENV-1 strain in the 2017 epidemic and its relationship with previous viruses in Vietnam and the rest of the world.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Complete genomes of 72 DENV-1 from patients in the 2017 epidemic were sequenced using NGS. The full genome sequences were then analyzed to find out the genetic variants in the groups of 72 strains, followed by their comparison with other strains that caused disease in Vietnam previously and several other regions of the world, revealing a genetic relationship between them.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The complete genome sequence of 72 DENV-1 strains comprised 10,697 nucleotides with an open reading frame coding for 3392 amino acids. The genomic analysis revealed different amino acid substitutions in all genes, especially varying at position S75 (Capsid), M125 (PrM), D54 (E), T147, V180 (NS1), G45, Y126, I154 (NS2A), A94 (NS2B), M298 (NS3), K47, V68 (NS4A), I29 (NS4B), and R166, E536, G614, T821 (NS5). The genetic analysis suggested that the viruses were most closely related to the causative virus of the dengue outbreak in Vietnam and Cambodia from 2006 to 2008. These results indicated that DENV-1 from the dengue epidemic 2017 in Northern Vietnam originated from the virus that caused the dengue outbreak during the 2007 to 2008 period in Vietnam.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">The present study is the first of its kind to describe complete genome sequence as well as genetic variants and phylogenetic analysis of DENV-1 associated with the unusual dengue epidemic of 2017 in northern Vietnam. These results provide detailed evidence to elucidate the origin, circulation, and genetic evolution of DENV in Vietnam.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Dengue virus (DENV)</kwd><kwd>Full-length genome</kwd><kwd>Dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1)</kwd><kwd>Genetic variants</kwd><kwd>Dengue epidemic</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007225</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KC.10.22/16&#x02013;20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bui</surname><given-names>Huy Vu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par9">Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a mosquito-borne acute infection caused by one of four dengue viruses (DENV), the disease mainly spread in tropical and subtropical countries. The virus is transmitted to humans via the bite of an infected mosquito [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Clinical manifestations primarily include acute fever, accompanied by bleeding under the skin or mucosa and thrombocytopenia, which may be fatal if not diagnosed and treated promptly and effectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Dengue hemorrhagic fever can result in major epidemics; these often occur in the Asia and Western Pacific countries such as India, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam with a disease cycle of 3 to 5&#x02009;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">There are four dengue viruses, denoted as DENV&#x02013;1, DENV&#x02013;2, DENV&#x02013;3, and DENV&#x02013;4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The genome structure of DENV has positive sense RNA genome of 10.6 to 11.0&#x02009;kb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The genome encodes for a single open reading frame (~&#x02009;3400 codons) and is flanked by 5&#x02032; UTR and 3&#x02032; UTR (untranslated region) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The genome encodes for three structural proteins, namely C protein, M protein, and E protein, and seven non-structural proteins, namely NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, and NS5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. There are four commonly circulating dengue viruses in the world, which share a similarity of 65 to 70% of amino acid sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Genome sequence of DENV-1 are classified into 5 genotypes, including I, II, II, IV and V [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Phylogenetic studies have indicated anassociation between specific genotypes and the proportion of cases with more severe disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Thus, DENV is classified as being of low, medium and high epidemiological impact. In which, several DENV may be retained in sylvatic cycles with little transmissibility to humans, other DENVs cause dengue fever only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In contrast, many genotypes of DENV may be associated with the potential to also cause the more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">DENV has been known for over 200&#x02009;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The first outbreaks caused by this virus were reported in 1779 in Jakarta (Indonesia) and Cairo (Egypt), and in 1780 in Philadelphia (USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Subsequent outbreaks have been recorded in different countries and regions around the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The disease caused by DENV is most often benign, non-fatal, with main manifestations of high fever and osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, cases of severe progression and death have also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; therefore, dengue is classified as one of the most important diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, of which <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is the main vector. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report of 2009, the countries most severely affected by this disease include those in South and Southeast Asia, and countries in the Caribbean, Central, and South America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Over the past 50&#x02009;years, the number of global dengue outbreaks has increased 30 fold owing to its spread to several new territories and its transition from urban to rural areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It is estimated that approximately 2.5 billion people live in tepidemic areas and that around 50 million cases occur per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The rise of DENV accompanied by increasing severity is thought to have occurred owing to the ever-growing human population, the speed of urbanization, migration, and lack of control measures for mosquitoes, as well as poor health infrastructure in most affected countries.</p><p id="Par14">Dengue in Vietnam has a year-round occurrence, usually increasing in the rainy season with peak numbers of cases observed between June and October [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The disease occurs in both children and adults with an increasing number of cases and associated complications. The main factors responsible for the persistance of dengue in Vietnam and the region are high density and widespread distribution of vectors, and the circulation of all four types of DENV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The habit of hoarding domestic water at home or sanitation does not guarantee the ideal environment for vectors such as <italic>A. aegypti</italic> mosquito, and effective control of this mosquito species is not yet available.</p><p id="Par15">In Vietnam from 2001 to 2010, the total number of cases reported in 19 provinces was 592,938 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Hanoi is one of the two biggest cities located in the North of Vietnam. In the previous large outbreak in 2009 with 16,263 cases were recorded that spread to all districts and Hanoi recorded 87% of all patients. The number of people infected with dengue in 2009 is 6.7 times higher than in 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In 2014, Vietnam recorded 43,000 cases in 53 provinces with 28 deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The unusual epidemic outbreak in 2017 did not occur in the peak season of the disease; however, it reported a high number of cases (183,287 cases and 154,552 hospitalizations) in a short period (from June to August 2017) and occurred in all age groups, ranging from young children, the elderly, adolescents, and adults, to pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In this outbreak, there were 59,063 dengue fever cases in Northern Vietnam, approximately eight times higher than in 2016 with 7289 dengue fever cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In this ourbreak in Hanoi, the number of cases was 70 times higher compared to the same period in 2016, with nearly 37,651 people infected and seven deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].. DENV-1 accounted for the largest proportion of detected viruses in the 2017 epidemic besides types 2, 3, and 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

Thus, not much information is available on the genetic diversity of the whole DENV-1 genome over time and the genetic diversity of the DENV resulting due to synonymous and non-synonymous mutations that make the DENV adaptable under selective pressure. Moreover, the construction of the phylogenetic tree of the causative strains of the unusual epidemic in 2017 required the dataset at a global level.</p><p id="Par16">Here, we sequenced the complete genome of 72 DENV-1 strains circulating in the unusual outbreak of dengue hemorrhagic fever 2017 in Northern Vietnam. We also analyzed the genetic variants and genetic relationships of these strains with others that circulated in Vietnam as well as in Southeast Asia and around the world previously. We believe the data obtained from this research will provide significant evidence to enhance our knowledge on the circulation and genetic evolutionary characteristics of DENV in Vietnam.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients and samples setting</title><p id="Par17">A total of 300 adult patients presenting at the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases in Hanoi with clinical symptoms of dengue (fever, fatigue, and muscle and joint aches) within three days of symptom onset, and a positive NS-1 test were included in the study between June and August 2017.

The DENV1 patterns (denoted D1) revealed a lower similarity to the DENV1 strains from Japan and Myanmar (yellow). Moreover, there seemed to be a significant difference with the strains from Brunei, Indonesia, China, Malaysia and Singapore (orange-red) although these countries are in Southeast Asia.

We aimed to investigate the amino acid substitutions in the genome of the DENV that caused the large and unusual dengue outbreak that occurred in Hanoi in 2017. We enrolled 300 dengue patients who tested positive for NS1 and had clinical dengue. Our results revealed that 92% (276 viruses) of patients were positive with DENV1, 7.3% (22 viruses) were infected with DENV2 and only 0.7% (2 viruses) was infected with DENV3 and 4. Thus, the serotype distribution of DENV in the epidemic of 2017 was different from the dengue outbreaks in previous years in the same area. The stereotype distribution in the dengue outbreak in 2011 was only DENV1 (11,3%), DENV2 (88,7%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and in the outbreak of 2008, the distribution rates for DENV1 and DENV2 were 32 and 30%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

Therefore, studying the genome characteristics of DENV strains will help to trace the origins of the virus strain in 2017 as well as provide more effective prevention. In this study, we selected 72 DENV-1 viruses with the highest viral load to conduct genome sequencing using NGS Illumina MiSeq system. The sequencing results showed that all 72 DENV-1 were successfully sequenced with high reliability, in which all gene segments were repeated from 1000x to 10,000x, the average reads were 5000x, this is a very high level of repetition for the sequencing of a viral RNA genome by the MiSeq system. The advantage of next-generation sequencing (NGS) is that the nucleotide sequence is read repeatedly, thus allowing the detection of minor mutations that occur in the viral genome.</p><p id="Par32">Genome analysis of 72 DENV-1 viruses showed that there were various amino acid alterations in all structural and non-structural genes. The proportion of viruses with amino acid changes is scarce, ranging from 1 to 6 viruses, which focused only on certain positions on the genes. However, it was recognized that there are major strains of DENV1 carrying amino acid mutations in several positions, such as in the E gene with positions 54D/N, 226&#x02009;T/A, 347I/M/V, 463A/V. The amino acid alterations in the envelope protein help the virus enhance neutrovirulence during pathogenesis. In addition, several positions with amino acid variants were observed in the NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5 genes. These changes may be related to the DENV virulence, but further studies are needed to clarify the influence of the amino acid substitution of DENV and dengue hemorrhagic fever severe.</p><p id="Par33">Studies on the genetic evolution of DENV shows that the average mutation rate of DENV is approximately 7.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;4</sup> mutations/position/year, this mutation speed compared to the other RNA viruses is relatively high, it is only slower than the HIV and influenza viruses. In nature, DENV exists in two forms, sylvatic and urban. Studies on the genetic evolution of these two forms show that the mutation rate during the urban cycle (dengue causes disease in humans) is faster than sylvatic cycle, and this is also consistent with the level of circulation and virus replication rate in dengue outbreaks worldwide. Not surprisingly, there were many mutations that occurred in the genome of the DENV that caused outbreak in 2017.</p><p id="Par34">Comparison of genetic mutation characteristics among DENV1 viruses in Vietnam in 2017 with those of DENV1 causing the disease in Vietnam in 2005 and 2008 as well as DENV1 strains in Thailand in 2010, Myanmar in 2002, Cambodia in 2008, Brunei in 2006, China in 2017 and Brazil in 2010 showed differences in many amino acid positions in all genes, especially with the DENV1 strain causing outbreak in 2005 in Vietnam, suggesting that DENV1 in Vietnam 2017 did not share the same ancestor as the DENV1 from 2005, although they both caused outbreaks in the same geographic area. Thus, it can be seen that in the same geographical area there exist many different forms of DENV, the emergence of new DENV forms in a geographical area may be due to the spread from other geographic areas due to globalization.</p><p id="Par35">Analysis of the genetic evolution of DENV1 viruses in Vietnam in 2017 with DENV1 strains causing outbreak in Vietnam and around the world previously showed complicated genetic variations. This is probably one of the main causes leading to the unusual dengue outbreak in Vietnam and other countries in the dengue endemic area.. Therefore, in order to clarify the impact of the amino acid mutation in the viral genome related to clinical severity in humans, further studies are needed to determine their role.</p><p id="Par36">Boxplot and heatmap mapping provides a clear picture of the genetic relationship of 72 viruses with strains in Vietnam and in the world. The analytical results suggested that the DENV1 circulating in the 2017 dengue epidemic very similar to the 2007&#x02013;2008 dengue outbreaks in Vietnam, with a close relationship to strains from Cambodia. Surprisingly, the DENV1 sequenced from other countries in the same geographical areas, such as China, Malaysia, Myanmar, Brunei, Singapore, and Indonesia, revealed a close genetic relationship with strains from Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, and the USA and exhibited large genetic differences with strains in Vietnam. These findings suggest an introduction of genetic transfer or the spread of DENV from one geographic region to another. This, in turn, could result in the mixing of genetic resources of different origins in order to create new variant strains.</p><p id="Par37">Previous studies on the phylogenetic tree construction of DENV often used the nucleotide sequence of E gene. In this study, through successful sequencing of the complete genome of 72 DENV1 viruses, so the phylogenetic tree was established using the entire genome sequence. The analysis showed that all 72 DENV1 viruses that circulated in Vietnam 2017 were likely derived from the DENV-1 strain that caused outbreaks in Vietnam 2007 to 2008 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This suggested that the DENV1 was responsible for the outbreak of dengue in Vietnam in 2017 and originated from the DENV that was previously distributed in Vietnam. In addition, the phylogenetic analysis revealed a close relationship between these DENV1 strains and two other DENV type 1 strains from Cambodia (2006 and 2008). These findings confirmed the origin and circulation of DENV in Vietnam. There exists no report of any intrusion of DENV from other geographical areas. However, several studies in China, Brunei, and Singapore have shown DENV1 to be imported from distant geographic areas, such as Brazil, the USA and Columbia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par38">The present study is the first of its kind to describe the complete genome sequence of 72 DENV type 1 viruses circulating in the unusual dengue outbreak in 2017 in Northern Vietnam and their genome characteristics compared to several DENV type 1 strains distributed in Vietnam and other parts of the world previously. We believe that these results constitute an important database to elucidate the mechanism of dengue hemorrhagic fever, genetic characteristics of the virus, and the development of dengue vaccine in Vietnam.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>
