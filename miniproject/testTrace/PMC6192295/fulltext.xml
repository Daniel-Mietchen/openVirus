These viruses are usually transmitted via the fecal-oral route and primarily infect and replicate in the gastrointestinal tract of the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition to causing acute diseases, EV are of public health concern because of the low infectious dose needed to cause disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par20"><italic>Enterovirus</italic> is nonenveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense viruses belonging to the family <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>. They include poliovirus, coxsackievirus (CB) groups A and B, echoviruses (E), and the <italic>enterovirus</italic>. Till date, more than 100 serotypes have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] including more than 70 <italic>enterovirus</italic> serotypes have been identified in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. EV may cause various symptoms, varying from asymptomatic infection to gastroenteritis, myocarditis and aseptic meningitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Human echovirus and coxsackievirus display a changing pattern of dominant serotypes in both sewage and clinical isolates, Echovirus 6, 19, 3, and coxsackievirus B4, B5, A9 have successively became the most common serotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the environment, enterovirus can survive under a wide pH range (pH&#x000a0;3 to 10) and for extended periods at low temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Some of the EV have been isolated from sewage water, which were <italic>coxsackievirus</italic> types B-3, B-4, and B-5 and E1, E7, and E11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Interestingly, these isolations are related to reports of isolation of the same strains during the same period in clinical samples. In general, enterovirus show great potential to be used as water quality indicators to assess the risks associated with infectious virus transmission as well as to identify the dominant source of fecal contamination in water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Assessment of enterovirus plays an important role in exploring the circulation of these viruses in the community. Earlier studies from 1974 to 1977 in U.K., 1979&#x02013;1981 in Canada, from 1994 to 2002 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA, and 2000&#x02013;2007 in Finland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] comparing sewage and clinical EVs reported and demonstrated a similarity of clinical and sewage EV. Environmental surveillance should be considered a complementary assessment tool to trace prevalent and negligible enterovirus circulating in the human population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sewage sample collection</title><p id="Par21">Sewage sample (approx one liter) was collected and stored in sterile glass bottle from the collection site by directly dipping into the sewage effluent.

The sewage sample was concentrated by two-phase concentration method on the same day as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In brief, the pH of the sample was adjusted to 7.2 and the sample was centrifuged at 5000&#x000a0;g for 30&#x000a0;min at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C to pellet the solids. 500&#x000a0;ml of clarified sewage was mixed with defined amounts of two polymers, dextran and 15% polyethylene glycol (15% PEG6000). The homogenous mixture obtained by vigorous shaking is left to stand overnight at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in a separating funnel. This allows the polymers to separate in two distinct layers (phases) in the funnel. Enterovirus accumulates in the smaller bottom layer and/or at the boundary between the layers (interphase). The bottom layer and interphase were collected drop-wise. The pellet from the initial centrifugation was suspended in this concentration, and treated with chloroform, then centrifuged at 5000&#x000a0;g for 30&#x000a0;min at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and assayed for the presence of virus.

The GenBank accession numbers for these isolates are GQ401342, GQ500896, GU068594 and GQ353352 respectively. NPEV serotypes showed 95 to 100% homology with other enteroviruses (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Phylogenetic tree of EV isolates from this study (indicated by circles) and other reference strains.

These viruses are not easily inactivated and may persist in sewage for longer periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. They are resilient organisms, able to withstand a high concentration of sodium chloride (NaCl) and large changes in temperature. These abilities allow the viruses to survive in water environment, their natural reservoir. In our study, Coxsackie viruses, untypable isolates, and serotypes of E9 and E11 were most frequently detected viruses throughout in clinical and sewage samples. E25 were present in sewage samples in the month from October to December 2007 which appears in clinical samples from January to March 2008, and again reappeared in sewage samples from July to August 2008, its circulation was observed in clinical samples in the last quarter of 2008. Similar kind of transmission was observed in E33, these were present in sewage samples from July to August 2008 and appeared in clinical samples in the next quarter of the year. This may be due to the fact that these viruses are ubiquitous in the environment. E12 serotype was present only in clinical samples in first and last quarter of the year 2008 whereas E13 was present in sewage samples only in the second and the last quarter of 2008. Enterovirus is stable for 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;h at pH of 3&#x02013;5. They are neither susceptible to proteolytic enzyme nor to bile salts. Stability of the virus in external environmental conditions depends on temperature, humidity, and UV radiations. Exposure to daylight for 24&#x000a0;h has led to inactivation of 99.9% of PV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A study conducted by Lodder et al. demonstrated that the local sewage which is being discarded into the river mass in Holland had very high density of enterovirus particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The study conducted in Holland revealed 14 positive results out of 64 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], not only mussels, but any food that comes in contact with contaminated water and is prepared unhygienically can be a source of an epidemic outbreak. Third world countries and areas undergoing recurrent flooding are at greatest risk of developing enterovirus epidemics. Poor sanitary conditions and overcrowding are also causative factors. Studies conducted in South African countries and areas of Indonesia demonstrated that over 90% of children&#x02019;s aged 5 have systemic antibodies proving contact with at least one enterovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The inherent features of a tropical environment are a relatively constant, warm, and humid climate and the flora and fauna is determined by such a climate. These features probably exert little direct influence on the spread of enterovirus, since these sagents are very stable in the free State [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Clinical samples were drawn in case of acute infection, which resulted in increased detection of serotypes. Specimens from the environment like sewage is less concentrated and thus resulted decreased detection. Moreover, environmental samples are more exposed to extreme physiochemical conditions like pH, increased temperature, and exposure to UV light, desiccation etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] that may result in inactivation of viruses, and thus decreased detection. This approach yields a comparatively more conservative prediction of the behavior of viruses in the environment.</p><p id="Par43">A review by Gelfand makes it clear that these viruses as a class of ubiquitous and during the appropriate season, can be detected frequently in the feces of children, sewage, deprived sanitized areas, privy specimen and filth flies. The ability of virus spread is depends on the mode and duration of their excretion. Existing data for non-polio enterovirus indicates that they are excreted in the feces and probably in the pharynx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Poor sanitation, great concentrations of humans, warm and humid climate, creates a new threat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Prevalence of virus in sewage water reflects the viral infections within the community, whether they are caused by wild viruses (coxsackieviruses, Human echovirus) or by vaccine viruses (poliovirus) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Human enterovirus infection is generally known as asymptomatic, and thus, environmental surveillance has been reported to be a sensitive method to detect silently circulating viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Shorter-term comparative clinical and sewage studies in U.K. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] had also demonstrated similar occurrence of Human echoviruses and type B coxsackievirus during the summer months. During our study period of 2 years, mainly untypable EV were found to be more frequent and predominantly present in environment as well as in clinical samples. Annual peaks of both sewage and clinical cases of EV occurred in late summer or early fall. In some years, early spring sewage EV signifies some of the EV that would predominate clinically during the following summer. EV that are detected in sewage can at times be predictors of some of the EV types that will be predominant clinically in the next coming season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. RT-PCR was carried out for untypeable samples by micro-neutralization test. Some previous reports suggested that RT-PCR aimed at 5&#x02019; UTR region is highly sensitive in EV detection from AFP patients, and suggested interspecies recombination concerning this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The high epidemiological potential of enteroviruses calls for a surveillance of their circulation in the children&#x02019;s communities, preferably by the virological monitoring of sewage. In addition to being effectively used to detect wild poliovirus transmission, environmental surveillance may become a powerful tool in the early detection of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Similar studies have been demonstrated in Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and Finland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], for wild poliovirus surveillance. Such study can also be useful for monitoring of human echoviruses coxsackie viruses and other viruses which spread through contaminated water.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par44">In our study, we found that coxsackieviruses, untypable isolates, and serotypes of E9 and E11 were most frequently detected viruses throughout in clinical and sewage samples. There was a close relation among the stereotypes of enteroviruses shed in stools and isolated from the environment, but few serotypes which were detected in sewage samples were not found clinically and the few which were detected clinically not found in sewage because some viruses are difficult to detect by the cell culture method. To improve the correlation between sewage and clinical cases we can use the real time PCR method and also there is a need to increase surveillance system. The restricted enterovirus season began from July and peak season generally arises in September. This study will be helpful for the researchers as well as medical practitioners who are working on polio and nonpolio enterovirus especially in the countries which are struggling for polio eradication.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Highlights</title><p id="Par45">
