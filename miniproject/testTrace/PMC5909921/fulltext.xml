Previous efforts to generate animal models of human ZIKV infection and clinical symptoms often involved manipulating mice to impair their Type I interferon (IFN) signaling, thereby allowing enhanced infection and vertical transmission of virus to the embryo. Here, we show that even pregnant mice competent to generate Type I IFN responses that can limit ZIKV infection nonetheless develop profound placental pathology and high frequency of fetal demise. We consistently found that maternal ZIKV exposure led to placental pathology and that ZIKV RNA levels measured in maternal, placental or embryonic tissues were not predictive of the pathological effects seen in the embryos. Placental pathology included trophoblast hyperplasia in the labyrinth, trophoblast giant cell necrosis in the junctional zone, and loss of embryonic vessels. Our findings suggest that, in this context of limited infection, placental pathology rather than embryonic/fetal viral infection may be a stronger contributor to adverse pregnancy outcomes in mice. Our finding demonstrates that in immunocompetent mice, direct viral infection of the embryo is not essential for fetal demise. Our immunologically unmanipulated pregnancy mouse model provides a consistent and easily measurable congenital abnormality readout to assess fetal outcome, and may serve as an additional model to test prophylactic and therapeutic interventions to protect the fetus during pregnancy, and for studying the mechanisms of ZIKV congenital immunopathogenesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during human pregnancy may cause severe congenital abnormalities and fetal death. There is currently no licensed vaccine or anti-ZIKV therapeutic to prevent or treat infection and/or disease. To generate an animal model that mimics human ZIKV infections, others have manipulated mice to impair their innate immunity, which allows ZIKV to develop high levels of infection. Here, we present an experimental model using immunologically unmanipulated pregnant mice and show that even limited maternal ZIKV infection nonetheless resulted in profound placental pathology and high frequency of fetal demise. However, neither viral RNA level in the dam, placenta or embryo reliably predicted fetal abnormalities.

ZIKV infection is often asymptomatic or presents as a mild, self-limiting febrile illness accompanied by rash, malaise, conjunctivitis, or muscle and joint pains [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The epidemic in the Americas first noted in 2015 was temporally related to the occurrence of thousands of fetal abnormalities during pregnancy [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and the causal relationship between ZIKV infection and adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g. congenital ZIKV syndrome, CZS) has since been established in both humans and following experimental infection of pregnant mice and non-human primates [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. CZS encompasses a number of potential abnormalities to include intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), fetal demise leading to spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, microcephaly, ocular disorders, and developmental abnormalities yet to be fully characterized [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Because of the devastating consequences of CZS, vaccine and drug countermeasures are being developed at a rapid pace, and the initial focus is to prevent infection and disease in women of child bearing age.</p><p>Pre-clinical mouse pregnancy models have been developed to examine the consequences of ZIKV infection on the developing embryo/fetus [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Mouse models of ZIKV infection are constrained by the virus&#x02019;s inability to replicate and cause overt clinical symptoms and disease manifestations in immunocompetent mice. It has been demonstrated that the murine innate Type I interferon (IFN) response abrogates ZIKV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. To overcome this innate response, investigators have employed immunocompromised mice genetically lacking Type I IFN signaling or wild-type mice treated with antibodies to block Type I IFN signals [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Indeed, these models recapitulate several disease manifestations of ZIKV infection observed in humans; however, the utilization of immunocompromised mice prevents the study of potential beneficial or detrimental impact of host immunity on ZIKV disease pathogenesis. Experimental conditions using immunocompetent pregnant mice which have been explored to date include inoculating mice with extraordinarily high doses of virus, or via specialized techniques or surgeries to directly deliver the virus to the maternal-fetal interface (e.g. vaginal exposure, intrauterine infection) [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These studies, too, have had some success. By these manipulations, vertical transmission of ZIKV from the mother to the fetus has been demonstrated in mice [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], despite the fundamental differences of placental structures in humans and mice. These studies showed that fetal damage coincides with ZIKV disseminated to the placenta and embryo. However, these settings created high and sustained viral titers in the circulation or in the proximity of the placenta [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], opening the possibility that the transplacental transmission and fetal damage may have been driven by unusually high maternal viral loads which would not have been achieved in an immunocompetent host.</p><p>CZS in human newborns has been reported with asymptomatic maternal ZIKV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], suggesting that maternal innate immune responses may suffice to prevent or significantly attenuate illness, yet not suffice to protect the fetus from infection or poor clinical outcome. Little is known about the consequences of ZIKV infection during pregnancy beyond those resulting directly from vigorous ZIKV infection and vertical transmission. ZIKV infection can also damage the placenta leading to placental insufficiency and pathology [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], introducing the question of whether CZS is caused by direct viral effects on the fetus, secondary effects resulting from primary placental damage, or both.</p><p>The impact of ZIKV infection on developing embryos has been shown to vary with the gestational stage [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Infection during early pregnancy appears to pose the highest risk of fetal damage in both humans and mouse models [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Growing epidemiological data also indicate the risk of adverse fetal outcome when maternal infection occurs at second and third trimesters [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Animal models suggest that early stage infection prior to completion of placentation often results in higher rates of viral transmission and more severe fetal outcomes than later stage infection when the placenta is fully functional [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It is conceivable that the window of susceptibility and the impact of ZIKV infection on fetal outcome may depend on gestational stage-associated changes at the maternal-fetal interface.</p><p>In this study, we utilized immunologically unmanipulated wild-type C57BL/6J mice, which therefore developed limited ZIKV infection. We found that even pregnant mice competent to generate intact immunity, including type I IFN signaling, nonetheless developed placental pathology and profound fetal abnormalities, including IUGR, embryonic malformation and high frequency of fetal demise. The impact on the developing embryo was caused by live infectious virus and was dependent on the dose and timing of viral administration during pregnancy. However, because viral replication was limited in the immunocompetent mice, vertical transmission was rare and, consequently, fetal abnormality did not reliably associate with the presence of ZIKV in maternal tissues, placenta or embryo. Our results reveal that adverse fetal outcome in the absence of vertical transmission was likely associated with placental pathology, including trophoblast hyperplasia in close proximity to embryonic blood vessels in the labyrinth and trophoblast giant cell necrosis in the junctional zone. Our findings indicate that, in this model, placental pathology leading to placental insufficiency rather than viral transmission can lead to profound adverse fetal outcome. Overall, our findings suggest the importance of a ZIKV pregnancy model that allows detection of placental pathology and fetal abnormality even with very low levels of overall viral infection, in order to test for interventions that can provide protective benefits against the full range of deleterious placental and fetal outcomes beyond merely preventing vertical transmission.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Intravenous ZIKV infection of pregnant immunocompetent wild-type C57BL/6J mice results in fetal demise</title><p>We infected wild-type, timed-pregnant C57BL/6J mice intravenously with 3.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of ZIKV Puerto Rico strain PRVABC59 at embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) of pregnancy, a time just prior to complete placentation (E10-E10.5).

We consistently observed these features as early as 1 dpi, implying that they may not have been caused by direct viral infection of placental cells. Moreover, while focal necrosis in the labyrinth was seen at 2 dpi, embryos began to show some focal necrosis only at 3 and 4 dpi, indicating that the placental lesions developed prior to those in the embryos. Although the placental necrosis may not have been severe enough to alone cause placental failure, the major anatomical lesions, labyrinth trophoblast hyperplasia and loss of embryonic blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006994.g006">Fig 6D</xref>) after endothelial necrosis likely interfered with embryonic nutrition exchange sufficiently to cause hypoxia to the embryo. Taken together, these data suggest that following maternal ZIKV exposure the normal placental architecture and function was substantially disrupted, causing placental insufficiency leading to fetal demise, even without widespread direct viral infection of the embryos.</p><fig id="ppat.1006994.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1006994.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Maternal ZIKV infection induces placental damage.</title><p>Pregnant dams at E9.5 were infected with 3.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of ZIKV and sacrificed at 3 dpi.

This model revealed fetal pathology, placental pathology, and potential postnatal impact. There are several key observations from this study. First, ZIKV infection of pregnant immunologically intact mice at E9.5 caused dramatic deleterious fetal outcomes. This was caused by infectious virus and depended on initial viral dose administered. Second, placental pathology was consistently observed in affected concepti, independent of detectable ZIKV RNA or protein in the placentas and/or embryos. Third, whereas pregnant immunocompetent females themselves resisted effects of ZIKV infection, their embryos appeared exquisitely sensitive to infection, and this effect depended on the time of infection during gestation. Fourth, even in the absence of acute fetal pathology <italic>in utero</italic> or at birth, pups born from ZIKV-infected dams may nonetheless be adversely affected.</p><p>Our findings argue against the concept that ZIKV-associated adverse fetal outcome is simply the result of virus crossing the placenta and having direct effects on the fetus. Rather, we show that adverse fetal outcome can occur in the apparent absence of significant, direct fetal infection. Our data support a model of placental insufficiency as a contributing cause of fetal demise in an immunocompetent setting. Moreover, Yockey et al. showed that placental damage with the potential to harm the embryo can result from Type I IFN-triggered immunopathology [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Taken together, these findings are in agreement with studies in pregnant rhesus macaques and humans, which reported that the severity of fetal outcome did not generally correlate with clinical maternal disease severity, the ZIKV RNA level in the serum or urine, or the duration of maternal viremia [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and raise the possibility that maternal disease outcome may not be strictly predictive of fetal outcome.</p><p>Humans usually contract ZIKV during mosquito feeding, which has been estimated to deliver between 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> PFU in related flaviviruses WNV and DENV [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Although the doses we administered were within this range, the possibility exists that the responses induced by experimental intravenous infection may differ from those induced by mosquito bites in humans. Indeed, a recent publication found that infection via mosquito bite delays ZIKV replication as compared to needle inoculum and alters ZIKV tissue tropism in rhesus macaques [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In addition, flaviviruses are known to antagonize Type I IFN signaling by targeting the key component STAT2 in order to replicate and cause human disease [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Unlike humans, mice are resistant to this mechanism, hence ZIKV is unable to replicate efficiently in immunocompetent mice. Our observations that ZIKV was rapidly cleared from maternal circulation and gradually declined in maternal spleen suggest a non-productive infection where after initially infecting host cells ZIKV may not replicate, or may replicate but fail to subsequently release infectious virus. Failure to establish prolonged viremia and cause vertical transmission during pregnancy differs from the common outcome of humans and nonhuman primates. However, our data suggest that the impact of ZIKV on the embryo can result from even a non-productive infection, highlighting the extreme sensitivity of the pregnancy process.</p><p>Significantly, even in the case of detectable ZIKV RNA in maternal and fetal tissues, replicating infectious ZIKV are not always detectable in maternal or fetal tissues by standard plaque assay, as reported in a pregnant nonhuman primate study where fetal brain damage was observed [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Using a two-step enhanced plaque assay where virus is pre-amplified in insect cells prior to performing a standard plaque assay, we have successfully detected infectious viruses in the placentas of dams infected at E9.5 with 3.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> PFU ZIKV at 5 and 8 dpi (13% and 8%, respectively). Although the detection frequency was low, it implies that sporadic or modest productive infection is still possible even in these immunocompetent pregnant mice. Notably, our enhanced plaque assay failed to detect any infectious virus in maternal spleen at 5 and 8 dpi, suggesting that replication-competent infectious viruses may take sanctuary in the placenta, even when they are unable to persist elsewhere in immunocompetent mice. The abovementioned limitations may affect the direct application of our findings to human infection. However, our findings nonetheless demonstrate the potential for even non-productive ZIKV infection to cause critical fetal outcomes during pregnancy, and provide a useful model to investigate the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>Despite inherent limitations, our data illustrate the importance of an immunocompetent mouse pregnancy model. In prior animal models where vertical transmission was demonstrated and believed to be required for adverse fetal outcome [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the use of Type I IFN blockade or the localized inoculation directly into the vaginal tract or uterus induced robust maternal viremia and/or direct viral seeding of reproductive tissues proximal to the conceptus. The resulting profound viral replication in the placenta was a likely driver of universal corresponding embryonic infection. The rampant viral infection in those studies presumably obscured the opportunity to identify other determinants of embryonic distress. In contrast, our use of systemically infected immunocompetent mice allowed the establishment of a sub-maximal level of infection that is subtle enough to observe previously unnoticed nuances of placental pathology. Our observation that adverse fetal outcome may occur even in the absence of vertical transmission suggests that ZIKV countermeasures that can effectively block vertical transmission still may not guarantee prevention of adverse fetal outcome.</p><p>The placenta forms a crucial physical barrier between the maternal and fetal compartments, preventing pathogen transmission during pregnancy. It also mediates exchange of gases, nutrients and wastes. Previous mouse models have demonstrated that ZIKV was detected in the placenta and resulted in trophoblast infection and apoptosis, vascular damage, hemorrhage, and loss of placental structure [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This pathology could compromise placental barrier function to allow transplacental transmission, as well as disrupt exchange function, leading to placental insufficiency. In cases where we observed virus in the placenta, we also observed that ZIKV antigen was co-localized within normal and necrotic labyrinth embryonic endothelial cells, supporting the possibility that ZIKV infection directly damages the placenta and reduces its circulation function. However, the majority of the placental and fetal pathology observed in our model showed infrequent or no measurable associated viral infection, suggesting that placental function may be compromised despite negligible viral titer. Indeed, a pregnancy mouse model of murine &#x003b3;-herpes virus 68 (MHV-68) infection suggested that even in the absence of vertical transmission, the fetus could be adversely affected by an inflammatory response induced by viral invasion of the placenta [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>In immunocompetent mice, it is conceivable that the maternal (or even fetal) immune response could cause collateral damage to the placenta in the course of viral clearance, resulting in immunopathology and placental insufficiency without detectable virus. Subsequently, such damage could in turn facilitate viral breach of the placental barrier in cases where the maternal infection has not been resolved. ZIKV infection has been shown to provoke an antiviral immune response in both human Hofbauer cells and mouse placenta [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Much remains to be learned about the possible protective and detrimental roles of maternal and fetal innate and adaptive immunity against ZIKV during pregnancy. A recent publication suggested that fetal Type I IFN signaling may play a detrimental role in mediating fetal demise after ZIKV infection by causing abnormal placental development [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Using a sophisticated breeding scheme and vaginal infection, it showed that only the embryos with functional Type I IFN signaling were resorbed despite relatively lower viral titer in their placentas, while their littermates with defective Type I IFN signaling continued to develop. It further showed that concepti with functional Type I IFN signaling had increased apoptotic cells in the placental labyrinth and upregulated hypoxia response genes in the embryo. Consistent with our observations, it supports the notion that placental dysfunction resulting from innate immune response is a possible cause of fetal demise, and taken together may provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of adverse fetal outcome of ZIKV infection in immunocompetent mice. However, whether the Type I IFN signaling-mediated placental pathology in immunocompetent hosts is specific to ZIKV infection or a general collateral damage after viral infection warrants further investigation.</p><p>The most consistent pathological feature associated with fetal abnormality in our study was trophoblast hyperplasia and embryonic endothelial cell necrosis in the labyrinth leading to loss of labyrinth embryonic blood vessels, and focal necrosis in the junctional zone. Trophoblast hyperplasia in the labyrinth has been shown in an infection-unrelated study to lead to global disruption of labyrinth and vascular architecture, and ultimately fetal death [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our data suggest that trophoblast hyperplasia is not directly caused by viral infection, as placentas from dams infected at E9.5 exhibited trophoblast hyperplasia, while those from dams infected at E12.5 did not, despite high placental ZIKV RNA levels. Although the direct link between trophoblast hyperplasia and fetal abnormality/demise remains to be established, our study clearly indicates that placental pathology can contribute to ZIKV-associated adverse fetal outcome independent of direct viral presence within developing embryos in immunocompetent mice.</p><p>The devastating effects of ZIKV infection during pregnancy on fetal development makes it clear that a pregnancy model is necessary for pre-clinical testing of vaccines and therapeutics. Protective efficacy of experimental vaccines against ZIKV-induced fetal demise was reported in a mouse pregnancy model using Type I IFN blockade [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Our immunocompetent pregnancy model could provide an additional methodologically simple and high throughput platform for pre-clinical testing. However, as we have demonstrated that the absence of detectable virus does not necessarily predict fetal health, and birth of pups does not guarantee their survival, longer term postnatal follow-up monitoring in both models is necessary to confirm the health or survival of newborns. Moreover, it has been shown that ZIKV can persist at low levels in several anatomically compartmentalized areas, including the central nervous system, reproductive tracts or bodily fluids for up to several weeks [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], which may be difficult to detect with standard RT-PCR or plaque assays. Similarly, placental tissue may provide a refuge where ZIKV may avoid complete clearance and persist at trace levels. Indeed, our ability to detect replication-competent virus at 5 dpi in placenta using an enhanced plaque assay, despite its absence in spleens, implies that the placenta may be a uniquely susceptible sanctuary for ZIKV compared with other tissues. Moreover, the profound harmful effects of infection or immunity on the fetus while leaving the mother essentially spared reveals the exquisite sensitivity of the placental-fetal environment to infection. Therefore, it is critical to determine not only whether a vaccine or drug successfully protects against overt disease/infection in adults, but also prevents fetal sequelae during pregnancy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal studies were conducted in accordance with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and approved by Trudeau Institute Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC protocol # 16&#x02013;009)</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Viruses, cells and titration</title><p>The ZIKV Puerto Rico strain PRVABC59 was obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH (NR-50240).

Mice were then infected intravenously with 3.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of ZIKV. Control mice were inoculated with 100 &#x003bc;L of Vero cell culture supernatant (mock infection).</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Measurement of viral burden</title><p>ZIKV-infected pregnant mice were euthanized at indicated times after infection. Spleen, liver, brain, kidney, as well as embryos and their corresponding placentas were harvested, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, or homogenized with stainless steel beads in 1 ml of DMEM supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated FBS using a TissueLyzer II instrument (QIAGEN). All samples were stored at -80&#x000b0;C until RNA purification or virus titration. Some placental and embryonic samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for further histological analysis.</p><p>To measure infectious viral particles, tissue homogenates were thawed and clarified by centrifugation at 2000<italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C. Viral burden was determined by plaque assay on Vero cells as described above. To measure ZIKV RNA levels, frozen tissue samples were disrupted and homogenized in Buffer RLT (QIAGEN) containing &#x003b2;-Mercaptoethanol (&#x003b2;-ME) using a Tissuemiser homogenizer (Fisher Scientific) and total RNA was purified using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using random hexamers and ZIKV RNA levels were determined by quantitative real-time PCR on a 7500 Fast Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using standard cycling conditions. The ZIKV-specific primer set and probe were previously published [<xref rid="ppat.1006994.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]: forward, 5&#x02019;-CCGCTGCCCAACACAAG-3&#x02019;, reverse 5&#x02019;-CCACTAACGTTCTTTTGCAGACAT-3&#x02019;, probe 5&#x02019;-/56-FAM/AGCCTACCT/ZEN/TGACAAGCAGTCAGACACTCAA/3IABkFQ/-3&#x02019; (Integrated DNA Technologies).

ZIKV RNA levels were interpolated against standard curves prepared by diluting RNA from uninfected tissue spiked with a known quantity of ZIKV (as determined by plaque assay) and expressed as PFU-equivalent per gram of tissue.</p><p>Blood was collected from infected mice, allowed to clot at 37&#x000b0;C and serum was separated by centrifugation at 10600<italic>g</italic> for 10 min and stored at -80&#x000b0;C. Total RNA in 50 &#x003bc;L serum was purified using QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN).

For immunohistochemistry staining of the ZIKV, 5-micron sections of paraffin-embedded tissues were washed with several changes of xylene to remove paraffin, and rehydrated through decreasing grades of ethanol (absolute to 70%) followed by deionized water. Endogenous alkaline phosphatase was blocked using Bloxall (Vector Labs) for 10 min. Tissues were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, blocked with 5% normal mouse serum (Jackson Immunoresearch) for 30 min, and then incubated with the primary Ab (Zika virus Envelop protein antibody, GeneTex) diluted in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% normal mouse serum for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, tissues were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase (Vector Labs) for 30 min, then developed using Vector Red alkaline phosphatase substrate (Vector Labs), and counterstained with hematoxylin (Fisher). Slides were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse Ci microscope and Nikon SPOT 2 digital camera. The primary Ab used to stain for ZIKV envelop protein was validated by specific staining of ZIKV-infected Vero cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006994.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Uninfected and ZIKV-infected Vero cells processed as cell pellets, embedded in paraffin, and stained with the identical reagents as were the tissues were used as negative and positive controls, respectively, and were included in each staining protocol. Tissues from uninfected mice were also used as negative controls. Histology slides were reviewed by a board certified veterinary pathologist.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software).
