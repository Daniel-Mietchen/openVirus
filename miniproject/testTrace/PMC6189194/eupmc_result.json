    "Sixty norovirus outbreaks that occurred in Pudong District, Shanghai in 2017 and affected 959 people were summarised. Of the outbreaks, 29 (48.3%), 27 (45.0%), and 4 (6.7%) occurred in kindergartens, primary schools, and middle schools, respectively. Although the total number of outbreaks peaked in March (13/60, 21.7%), outbreaks in kindergartens and primary schools peaked in April (6/29, 20.7%) and March (8/27, 29.6%), respectively. Primary schools had the highest median number of cases per outbreak (19) and the highest proportion of cases (54.6%). The male-to-female case ratio differed among school classifications, with the highest male case ratio (69.2%) occurring in middle schools. Primary symptoms also differed across the school classifications. Molecular virology analysis showed that a single viral strain caused each outbreak at each school. In turn, 50.6, 28.8, and 20.6% of cases were infected by GII.4, GII.2, and GII.17, respectively. Vomiting was seen in 98.2, 97.3, and 88.6% of the subjects infected with noroviruses GII.17, GII.4, and GII.2, respectively, and nausea in 73.6, 43.9, and 39.0%. In conclusion, noroviruses mainly affect primary school and kindergarten students. GII.4, GII.2, and GII.17 are the main epidemic strains in the local area, and the primary symptoms differed by age and genotype."
