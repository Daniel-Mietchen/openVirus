Of the outbreaks, 29 (48.3%), 27 (45.0%), and 4 (6.7%) occurred in kindergartens, primary schools, and middle schools, respectively. Although the total number of outbreaks peaked in March (13/60, 21.7%), outbreaks in kindergartens and primary schools peaked in April (6/29, 20.7%) and March (8/27, 29.6%), respectively. Primary schools had the highest median number of cases per outbreak (19) and the highest proportion of cases (54.6%). The male-to-female case ratio differed among school classifications, with the highest male case ratio (69.2%) occurring in middle schools. Primary symptoms also differed across the school classifications. Molecular virology analysis showed that a single viral strain caused each outbreak at each school. In turn, 50.6, 28.8, and 20.6% of cases were infected by GII.4, GII.2, and GII.17, respectively. Vomiting was seen in 98.2, 97.3, and 88.6% of the subjects infected with noroviruses GII.17, GII.4, and GII.2, respectively, and nausea in 73.6, 43.9, and 39.0%. In conclusion, noroviruses mainly affect primary school and kindergarten students. GII.4, GII.2, and GII.17 are the main epidemic strains in the local area, and the primary symptoms differed by age and genotype.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the excellent young medical talents training program in Pudong New Area health system (PWRq2016-16)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Noroviruses, previously known as Norwalk viruses, form a group of genetically diverse, positive-stranded non-enveloped RNA viruses belonging to the genus <italic>Norovirus</italic>, family Caliciviridae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

Norovirus outbreaks occurred in 29 kindergarten schools (students aged 4&#x02013;6 years), 27 primary schools (students aged 7&#x02013;11 years) and 4 middle schools (students aged 12&#x02013;14 years) in this area in 2017. According to the relevant laws and regulations of the health authorities of China and Shanghai municipality, the sudden increase in the incidence of a disease or condition is reported to the local CDC. Infectious diarrhoeal disease is a key monitoring disease in schools. Each school reports students with diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, and fever and/or chills, and the local CDC then carries out a field investigation. Investigation of the transmission source and route includes the collection of samples using rectal swabs of vomit, faeces, food, and water, and from the surfaces of public facilities. Environmental surface sampling was performed following the Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care Facilities (2003) recommended by the US CDC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.

Our data suggested that age and viral genotype affect the seasonal predilection of norovirus outbreaks. In general, most outbreaks occurred in the first half of the year, with a peak in March.

Our data suggest that the primary symptoms were also associated with age and viral genotype: the manifestations in students in the kindergarten and primary schools, ordered from high to low proportion, were vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, fever, and diarrhoea; among middle school students, the rates of vomiting (88.5%) and fever (5.8%) were significantly lower and the rates of cases with nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea were significantly higher than among kindergarten and primary school students. In addition, the proportion of nausea was highest in GII.17-infected cases, although vomiting was the most common symptom, its concomitant probability ranged from 88.6% in GII.2-infected cases to 98.2% in GII.17-infected cases. Taken together, our data showed that diarrhoea is not a dominant symptom of norovirus infection and implied that age-specific host factors and genotype-specific viral factors play roles in the pathology of norovirus infection.</p><p id="Par29">Human norovirus infections are caused, in decreasing order of frequency, by GII (mostly GII.4), GI, and, to a very limited extent, GIV genotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, this trend varies with time, place, and population in China.

However, GII.17, GII.P16/GII.2, and GII.6 variants have emerged in recent years and caused outbreaks in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

The prevalent strains differ among populations due to differences in acquired immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. A systematic review has analysed the burden of acute gastroenteritis caused by norovirus infection in China since the year 2000<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The integrated data from more than 200 original reports showed that GII.4 (70.4%), GII.3 (13.5%), GII.17 (11.9%), and GII.1 (4.0%) were the top four prevalent strains in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The outbreaks in 26 (52.0%), 14 (28.0%), 9 (18.0%), and 1 (2.0%) of the schools in this report were caused by GII.4, GII.2, GII.17, and GII.3 norovirus infections, respectively. Although GII.4 and GII.17 were the first and third most common genotypes in our report, consistent with the above integrated data; GII.3 is rare and GII.2 emerged as the second most common genotype identified in our report. These differences might be explained by the fact that the integrated data included people of all ages from different regions of China, while our data only examined the epidemic characteristics of a specific population in a certain period of time in a local area.</p><p id="Par30"><italic>Limitations</italic>: in this report, we did not trace the first case to identify the transmission source, as the first symptomatic case does not equate to the one originally excreting or being infected with the virus. On the other hand, although the government has been concentrating on improving water and food supplies in schools, sporadic waterborne or foodborne acute gastroenteritis cannot be extinct. The high population density and complex community life relationships in China weaken the significance of transmission source identification in outbreak control and prevention. As almost all were self-reported cases, age, sex, and personal psychosocial characteristics might affect the accuracy of self-reporting data and we could not exclude possible bias in case reporting. BLAST analysis showed that our sequences were highly similar to many reference sequences submitted from China and abroad. We could not decipher traceability because we lacked long-term background data on norovirus epidemics in China. In the present study, the viral genogroup and genotype were determined by partial VP1 sequences; thus, we could not fully study the recombinant noroviruses. Although this method is commonly used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, increasing evidence has supported the proposal to adopt a dual nomenclature using both ORF1 and VP1 sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> because recombination is common and the recognition of recombinant viruses may be relevant to their epidemiological characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par31">In conclusion, noroviruses GII.4, GII.2, GII.17, and GII.3 were in order the common genotypes in a local area.
