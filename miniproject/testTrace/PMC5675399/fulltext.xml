In Khayelitsha township (population ~500,000) in Cape Town, South Africa, more than 50,000 patients have received antiretroviral therapy (ART) since the inception of this public-sector program in 2001. Disengagement from care remains an important challenge. We sought to determine the incidence of and risk factors associated with disengagement from care during 2013&#x02013;2014 and outcomes for those who disengaged.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and findings</title><p>We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients &#x02265;10 years of age who visited 1 of the 13 Khayelitsha ART clinics from 2013&#x02013;2014 regardless of the date they initiated ART. We described the cumulative incidence of first disengagement (&#x0003e;180 days not attending clinic) between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2014 using competing risks methods, enabling us to estimate disengagement incidence up to 10 years after ART initiation. We also described risk factors for disengagement based on a Cox proportional hazards model, using multiple imputation for missing data. We ascertained outcomes (death, return to care, hospital admission, other hospital contact, alive but not in care, no information) after disengagement until 30 June 2015 using province-wide health databases and the National Death Registry. Of 39,884 patients meeting our eligibility criteria, the median time on ART to 31 December 2014 was 33.6 months (IQR 12.4&#x02013;63.2). Of the total study cohort, 592 (1.5%) died in the study period, 1,231 (3.1%) formally transferred out, 987 (2.5%) were silent transfers and visited another Western Cape province clinic within 180 days, 9,005 (22.6%) disengaged, and 28,069 (70.4%) remained in care. Cumulative incidence of disengagement from care was estimated to be 25.1% by 2 years and 50.3% by 5 years on ART. Key factors associated with disengagement (age, male sex, pregnancy at ART start [HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.47&#x02013;1.69], most recent CD4 count) and retention (ART club membership, baseline CD4) after adjustment were similar to those found in previous studies; however, notably, the higher hazard of disengagement soon after starting ART was no longer present after adjusting for these risk factors. Of the 9,005 who disengaged, the 2 most common initial outcomes were return to ART care after 180 days (33%; <italic>n</italic> = 2,976) and being alive but not in care in the Western Cape (25%; <italic>n</italic> = 2,255). After disengagement, a total of 1,459 (16%) patients were hospitalized and 237 (3%) died. The median follow-up from date of disengagement to 30 June 2015 was 16.7 months (IQR 11&#x02013;22.4). As we included only patient follow-up from 2013&#x02013;2014 by design in order to maximize the generalizability of our findings to current programs, this limited our ability to more fully describe temporal trends in first disengagement.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Twenty-three percent of ART patients in the large cohort of Khayelitsha, one of the oldest public-sector ART programs in South Africa, disengaged from care at least once in a contemporary 2-year period. Fifty-eight percent of these patients either subsequently returned to care (some &#x0201c;silently&#x0201d;) or remained alive without hospitalization, suggesting that many who are considered &#x0201c;lost&#x0201d; actually return to care, and that misclassification of &#x0201c;lost&#x0201d; patients is likely common in similar urban populations.</p><p>A challenge to meeting ART retention targets is developing, testing, and implementing program designs to target mobile populations and retain them in lifelong care. This should be guided by risk factors for disengagement and improving interlinkage of routine information systems to better support patient care across complex care platforms.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>In a retrospective study, Samantha Kaplan and colleagues document the continuity of antiretroviral treatment and care in Khayelitsha, South Africa.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Why was this study done?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>As of 2015, over 11 million people in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) for treatment of HIV/AIDS, indicating the scale of patients who need lifelong treatment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An important component in controlling the HIV/AIDS epidemic is retaining patients in lifelong care.

In order for health systems to meet the UNAIDS 90-90-90 treatment targets of patients receiving sustained ART and maintaining viral suppression, retention in care is an essential focus [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Viral suppression reduces HIV transmission [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and in a modeling study has been shown to contribute to the public health goal of ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Patients who disengage from care have an increased risk of poor health outcomes, transmitting HIV to others, and developing drug resistance, thereby undermining overall program impact as well as the global public health goal of ending the HIV epidemic. In Southern Africa, as of 2014, WHO-estimated ART retention rates after 5 years to be less than 50%, and the United States President&#x02019;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) countries in this region reported 77% retention at 12 months in 2015 [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In Khayelitsha township (population approximately 500,000) in Cape Town, South Africa, an HIV treatment program was established in 2001 as a partnership between M&#x000e9;decins sans Fronti&#x000e8;res and the provincial government at 3 public-sector primary care clinics. This represented the first initiative to provide ART in the South African public sector [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As this program has matured and grown, disengagement from ART care has become a great challenge: cumulative loss to follow-up (LTFU) at 1 year was shown to have increased from 0% in 2001 to 7.6% in 2007, and a third of patients who were LTFU by 2008 were found to have died [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Over the 15 years since the Khayelitsha ART program&#x02019;s inception, clinics have grown in size considerably [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], due to the high HIV prevalence and updating of the South African National ART guidelines, which have progressively expanded the eligibility criteria for ART initiation to higher CD4 count thresholds [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This has resulted in a massive increase of patients eligible for ART and an increase in the proportion of patients who are starting ART when asymptomatic. ART medication regimens have also become more tolerable, and fixed-dose combination formulations have improved convenience for patients. ART adherence clubs have been established for stable ART patients on treatment for &#x0003e;12 months who are virally suppressed. These clubs are managed by lay health workers and meet 5 times a year, allowing ease of medication refills and communal peer support [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

In the current analysis, we merged different data sources to create a unique dataset of all Khayelitsha ART patients from provincial and municipal clinics. Using these routinely collected data, we sought to quantify disengagement from care and identify risk factors and outcomes for those patients who disengaged using electronic tracing methods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was approved by the Yale University Human Investigation Committee (Protocol # 1504015732) and the University of Cape Town Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC REF: 568/2015) per the protocol &#x0201c;Sub-study of protocol &#x02018;Enhanced routine surveillance of patients in HIV care in Khayelitsha&#x02019; (HREC 395/2005)&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002407.s002">S1 Protocol Original</xref>).

Therefore, if a patient disengaged prior to 1 January 2013, but returned to care prior to 1 January 2013, time to disengagement was calculated from their cohort entry date (or ART start date, depending on the analysis) until a date of disengagement within the cohort window if this occurred.

two-year study period</title><p>From the perspective of the Khayelitsha clinic system, a total of 9,992 (25.1%) patients disengaged from care. However, after linkage of these patients to Western Cape data systems, we found that patients who disengaged (excluding those who silently transferred) numbered 9,005 (22.6%). From this point on in the manuscript, &#x0201c;patients who disengaged&#x0201d; refers to those who disengaged, excluding silent transfers.</p><p>As of 31 December 2014, of the total cohort, 592 (1.5%) died, 1,231 (3.1%) transferred out, 987 (2.5%) were silent transfers and visited another ART or primary care clinic in the same province (Western Cape) within 180 days of their last visit date, 9,005 (22.6%) disengaged, and 28,069 (70.4%) were in care. Of those in our study cohort, 1,179 (3.0%) patients disengaged prior to 2013 but returned to care prior to 1 January 2013. 4,156 (10.4%) disengaged prior to 2013 but returned within the study window.</p><p>Of the patients who disengaged, 5,463 (60.7%) had South African national identification numbers and could be linked to the National Death Registry. Total mortality for the entire cohort as of 30 June 2015 was 2.4% (<italic>n</italic> = 939), and 3.9% (<italic>n</italic> = 822) when restricted to those with national identification numbers.</p><p>The cumulative incidence of disengagement from care, before any other event could occur, was estimated to be 25.1% at 2 years, analyzed by time in the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002407.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The cumulative incidence of disengagement was 50.3% and 60.3% at 5 and 10 years on ART, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002407.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), based on the person time contributed during the analysis window but analyzed relative to ART initiation date. The higher hazard of disengagement soon after starting ART was largely attenuated after adjusting for the patient characteristics included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed.1002407.t002">Table

For those patients who silently transferred or disengaged and then returned to care &#x0003e;180 days later, GIS mapping indicated that most of these patients returned to care very close to Khayelitsha (some at the same clinic), but many also returned to a variety of locations throughout the Western Cape province (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002407.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Median distance from Khayelitsha to clinic of return was 3.8 km (IQR 2.7&#x02013;9.6, range 0.3&#x02013;434), an estimate that includes patients who returned to the same clinic after 180 days. Seven percent (<italic>n</italic> = 207) returned &#x0003e;50km from Khayelitsha, but within the Western Cape province. In a logistic regression model, some of the associations with failure to re-engage in care after disengagement were the same as those associated with disengagement: male sex (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.04&#x02013;1.29) and pregnancy at ART start (OR 1.36; 95% CI 1.15&#x02013;1.61).

Roughly 1 in 5 patients disengaged from care, demonstrating a high rate of disengagement and a key challenge to reaching the UNAIDS 90-90-90 treatment targets. Factors associated with disengagement were age &#x0003c;30 years, male sex, pregnancy at ART initiation, and last CD4 count &#x0003c;350 cells/&#x003bc;l. Factors associated with retention were ART adherence club membership and baseline CD4 &#x0003c;350 cells/&#x003bc;l. However, despite the high incidence of disengagement, many of those who disengaged did not do so permanently. While 48% (<italic>n</italic> = 4,199) of patients could not be traced (either did not have a national identification number or had an ID number and/or medical record number but no additional data were found), and 16% (<italic>n</italic> = 1,459) were admitted to the hospital at some point after disengagement, roughly 1 in 3 patients returned to care within the province during the study period, and half were estimated to return to care within 2.5 years. Additionally, not included in the overall estimate of disengagement are the 2.5% of silent transfers who appeared to disengage from a clinic perspective but were actually in care elsewhere in the Western Cape province when province-wide data linkage was performed. These data indicate that a substantial proportion of patients are cycling in and out of care as well as transferring elsewhere in the province (often &#x0201c;silently&#x0201d;), and potentially to facilities outside of the Western Cape province (something that our study could not ascertain).</p><sec id="sec023"><title>Disengagement in Khayelitsha</title><p>Previous studies of the Khayelitsha cohort have reported on disengagement (termed &#x0201c;lost to follow-up, LTFU&#x0201d;, in those studies) and mortality up until 2009 [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These studies are not directly comparable, as they calculated LTFU at the end of a defined period allowing for prior return to care, as opposed to the current study, in which we defined disengagement as the first episode in a 2-year period. In doing so, we report a contemporary cross-sectional perspective of disengagement rather than a cumulative snapshot. Temporal trends based on the former approach have further been shown to be biased [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Further, the current study accounted for silent transfers and mortality through data linkage, whereas the former studies only accounted for mortality. Nevertheless, the most recent of the previous studies estimated cumulative LTFU of 23% at 5 years on ART in 2008 [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], compared to the current contemporary estimate of 25% meeting the definition of LTFU at least once in a 2-year period, irrespective of duration on ART or previous disengagement. When extrapolated, and assuming that this incidence is unchanged over time and is homogeneously distributed, this would mean that 50% of patients would meet this definition by 5 years on ART. In spite of improved ascertainment of patients transferring their care, the study provides continued and robust evidence of high rates of disengagement, underscoring the importance of interventions targeted primarily at retention in continuous ART care across a platform or jurisdiction.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Risk factors for disengagement</title><p>Our assessment of risk factors associated with disengagement was limited to those in the Khayelitsha database. Male sex and pregnancy at ART initiation were strongly associated with disengagement, consistent with previous studies [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. While d4T&#x02014;with its high risk for drug toxicity [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]&#x02014;was associated with increased risk of disengagement in our study, the effect is potentially confounded, as d4T was only prescribed earlier in the cohort period. Nonetheless, associations with ART toxicity and disengagement have been reported, indicating that ART drugs that minimize toxicities may decrease the risk of disengagement [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Our results indicate that a baseline CD4 count &#x0003c;350 cells/&#x003bc;l was associated with retention, and that a most recent CD4 count &#x0003c;350 cells/&#x003bc;l was predictive of disengagement. While these findings could suggest that those who are less sick early in treatment are more likely to disengage in line with previous studies [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], this might be confounded by non-CD4-based clinical indications for ART initiation, as clinical guidelines at the time did not provide for universal eligibility of patients with CD4 counts in this range.</p><p>We also found an association with retention for adherence club membership in Khayelitsha&#x02014;which is confounded by indication&#x02014;as more stable, engaged patients (on ART for &#x0003e;12 months, virally suppressed) are referred to adherence clubs. Twenty-six percent of patients in the entire cohort were in clubs by June 2014, and recent data have shown that adherence club membership is associated with a 67% reduction in LTFU [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>We found that the higher hazard of disengagement soon after starting ART seemed to be accounted for by other risk factors in that this was no longer present in adjusted analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002407.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Other studies have suggested that there is a higher risk of disengagement early in ART treatment [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], but they did not adjust for other risk factors as we did in our analysis. This lends support to the conclusion that the high early loss to ART care may be accounted for by key demographic and clinical patient characteristics such as age, sex, pregnancy, and CD4 count.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Silent transfers and return to care: Cyclical engagement</title><p>The combination of high proportions of patients being silent transfers or returning to care after disengagement in this setting casts the challenge as cycling in and out of care and between facilities, rather than as definitive losses to care. This represents a major shift in the way ART care is now being delivered. Many of these patients spent substantial time out of care and were likely viremic. This cyclical engagement undermines the ultimate goals of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 agenda because during these interruptions in care, HIV may progress in individuals, and transmission of HIV to others is more likely.</p><p>In the current analysis, the 10% of disengagements that were in fact silent transfers underscore the relative importance of undocumented transfer being a reason for apparent disengagement. While the estimate may sound lower than previous findings of this figure, which is closer to 20% in the Western Cape [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and globally [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], we required that the patient transfer be to a site outside of Khayelitsha in order to exclude transfers within the subdistrict and that the transfer be within 6 months of the last visit.</p><p>In terms of return to care, one study in the Cape Town area found that 33% of those who disengaged returned to care with the probability of resuming within 3 years of 42%, a median of 228 days after disengagement [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], very similar to the findings in the current study. In terms of mobility issues, a rural South African cohort study found that 32% of those LTFU had migrated outside of the area after disengagement [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Indeed, data from Khayelitsha and the neighboring Mitchell&#x02019;s Plain district have indicated that approximately 84% of black South African adults were born outside of Cape Town, the majority in the Eastern Cape, and these people frequently travel to visit their families in that province or travel between the provinces for employment or annual vacation [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>However, half of patients who disengaged in this study did not return to care in the Western Cape province. Over 15% of the patients in this study were admitted to a hospital after disengagement, and 3% died. These adverse events could illustrate the potential clinical consequences of disengagement with associated healthcare costs. Other studies have illustrated such problems that arise when patients disengage from ART care: one study indicated that HIV contributed to over 60% of medical admissions to a South African district hospital in Cape Town from 2012&#x02013;2013, and 19.3% of these HIV-infected patients had interrupted ART therapy [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Another study from Johannesburg indicated that 10.4% of patients LTFU were hospitalized [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Strengths and study implications</title><p>The Khayelitsha ART program is one of the largest and oldest public-sector ART programs in South Africa, lending credibility to our findings and conclusions. Additionally, we focused on a contemporary cohort, which allows us to draw conclusions that are applicable to current ART programs across the country, as well as in the region. The ability to track patients using a unique identifier across different health services and laboratory data, and link patients to the National Death Registry for mortality ascertainment [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], are distinctive within sub-Saharan Africa. This enabled us to provide robust estimates of true disengagement and reassurance that almost half of patients originally seen by the clinic as lost to follow-up are indeed either retained in care or returned to care. A study of the National Death Registry indicated that 94% of deaths were recorded by civil registration, lending support to the notion that those who we reported as truly disengaged from care and not registered as dead are most likely alive [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Potential interventions to improve patient tracking and retention, as well as provide a greater degree of flexibility in the system may include: rational use of patient held cards/records (which exist in Khayelitsha but are not always utilized), nationally accessible electronic health records, increasing the period for ART prescription to allow patient travel, editing clinical management protocols to include sections on transferring and receiving patients, improving the ability of clinics to communicate with each other and, perhaps most importantly, accepting that patients cycle through care and promoting healthcare worker understanding of the need to adapt care around patients&#x02019; lifestyles and mobility through health worker training [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Limitations</title><p>We likely underestimate true silent transfer and return to care, as we only tracked patients in the Western Cape province. Because of the mobility of this population, it is likely that additional patients returned to care in other provinces, particularly the Eastern Cape. If person-level data were cascaded up to the national level in line with recommendations [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and a unique health identifier was used nationally, it may be possible to track patient movements country-wide. Implementation of such a system has already been proposed by the South African National Department of Health [<xref rid="pmed.1002407.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We do recognize that patients who migrated from other countries may have poorer treatment outcomes due to mobility and legal status issues and would be less likely to have a national identification number and be in the death registry. Therefore, we may have underestimated mortality in this group.</p><p>We had a short period for follow-up. We were also unable to ascertain causes of death. As we included only patient follow-up from 2013&#x02013;2014 by design in order to maximize the generalizability of our findings to current programs, this limited our ability to more fully describe temporal trends in first disengagement. Additionally, we recognize the nonuniform collection of data, which necessitated dropping particular variables from our analyses and performing multiple imputation for missing data. It is also possible that some clinic and/or lab visits were not captured in the database. This is somewhat mitigated by the large size of the dataset and power of the analysis.</p><p>Finally, the legacy of South African apartheid has contributed to specific mobility issues and social problems in communities such as Khayelitsha that may not be generalizable to other urban settings in sub-Saharan Africa.</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The Khayelitsha ART program is one of the oldest in South Africa and has grown greatly in size. The merging of all provincial and municipal clinic data in this study is unique and lends completeness to the cohort data as representative of an entire community. The ability to electronically trace patients throughout the Western Cape province and link to the National Death Registry allowed us to correct misclassified patient outcomes. For these reasons, the findings from this study are of value in directing appropriate patient and clinic-based interventions to improve long-term retention and meet the 90-90-90 HIV treatment targets in high prevalence urban settings such as this one throughout sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>Our finding that many patients who disengaged return to care suggests that many patients in ART programs in Africa, particularly in urban settings, cycle in and out of care. This suggests a shift in the provision of ART care: that the linear UNAIDS model of HIV diagnosis, ART initiation, and viral suppression may need to be reconceptualized to account for this cycling in and out of care and the mobile populations served by ART programs in many sub-Saharan African countries. As &#x0201c;Universal Test and Treat&#x0201d; is implemented in both South Africa and the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, more patients will enroll in ART care with higher CD4 counts and need to be retained. It will be important to find ways to adapt services to accommodate mobile populations to retain patients in care and prevent morbidity, mortality, and HIV transmission. Even if these systems are slow to improve, clinics across sub-Saharan Africa that are familiar with and accommodating of the mobility of their patients will be able to better care and advocate for them.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec029"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002407.s001"><label>S1 STROBE Checklist</label><caption><title>Checklist for cohort study.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002407.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002407.s002"><label>S1 Protocol Original</label><caption><title>Substudy of protocol &#x0201c;Enhanced routine surveillance of patients in HIV care in Khayelitsha&#x0201d; (HREC 395/2005) entitled &#x0201c;A retrospective cohort and a nested case-control study of risk factors contributing to default (loss to follow up) from antiretroviral therapy (ART) care in Khayelitsha, South Africa&#x0201d;.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002407.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002407.s003"><label>S1 Protocol Amendment</label><caption><title>Amendments to original protocol.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002407.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002407.s004"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Examples of how each patient contributed time to survival analyses and Cox proportional hazards models.</title><p>Bracketed dates indicate origin dates (first antiretroviral therapy [ART] visit); grey rectangles indicate entry date into the cohort.</p><p>(PNG)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002407.s004.png"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002407.s005"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Diagnostic plots for predictive mean matching used in imputation for variables with skewed distributions included in the Cox proportional hazards model.</title><p>(PNG)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002407.s005.png"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002407.s006"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Proportional hazards plots for all variables included in the final imputed Cox proportional hazards model.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002407.s006.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002407.s007"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><p><bold>A.
