The genetic distance between these subclades is about half of that between subtypes.</p><p>Subtype A is responsible of about 80% of the HIV-1 epidemic in Former Soviet Union (FSU) countries [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Evolving from a Central African ancestor, this variant initially spread through heterosexual (HE) contact in Southern Ukraine. Subtype A then begun to spread dramatically among injective drug users (IDUs) in the port city of Odessa around 1995. During the following years, the HIV-1 epidemic sustained by subtype A among IDU (labeled <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>fsu</italic></sub> or <italic>IDU-A</italic>) propagated through other FSU countries such as Russia and Estonia [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The explosive spread of this clade within the population of FSU IDUs was due to effective transmission networks taking place in the favorable setting of the massive socio-economic crisis which followed the fall of the Soviet Union Republics [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the largely populated city of St. Petersbourg the proportion of <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>fsu</italic></sub> infections increased from 37% in the 1997&#x02013;2004 period to 91% in 2006 of HIV-1 infections [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>A feature of the IDU-A variant is a high homogeneity of viral sequences, probably due to the high transmission rates among IDUs following single introduction events in distinct geographic areas and the recent spread of the epidemic [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>After its explosive diffusion in Russia, subtype A spread in neighboring countries [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In Bulgaria, subtype A was isolated only in a single individual before 1995, however, it accounted for 27% infections in further years [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], suggesting a late introduction through multiple events.</p><p>The prevalence of subtype A is approximately 2% in Western and Central Europe, however this variant has established extensive epidemics in some Mediterranean countries, such as Albania, Cyprus and Greece. In Greece, clade A1 is the most common non-B subtype (20.6%), rising from a 6% prevalence in 1984 to 42% in 2004 [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146097.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The introduction of this subtype in Greece dates back to the first epidemic phase in the country (time of the most recent common ancestor, tMRCA, 1978), probably originating from Central Africa [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Differently from other European countries, subtype A is the most frequent in long-dated residents compared with subtype B, and was involved in sexual transmission risk groups more lately [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Similarly, the clade A epidemic in Albania probably arose from Greece, Albanian and Greek sequences being more related to African ones than to Eastern European ones [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Clade A is a parental subtype in most of known circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), particularly in the most prevalent ones. These CRFs are estimated to sustain 27% HIV-1 infections globally [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], especially CRF02_AG in Western Africa [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], CRF01_AE in Thailand [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and CRF03_AB in the FSU. The high prevalence of co-circulating subtype A and B in Eastern Europe represented the background for the origin of CRF03_AB in Southern Ukraine, giving rise to an outbreak through IDUs in the city of Kaliningrad in 1996 [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Due to migration fluxes from Africa, FSU and South America, non-B subtype circulation is increasing in Italy as well as in all Western countries of Europe. The overall prevalence of infections due to non-B clade in Italy is 11.4% having raised from 2.6% to 18.9% over three decades. Among these, subtype A is the second in prevalence (12.7%) after clade F1 (23.7%) [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The aim of this study was to investigate the features of A1 subtype circulation in Italy and trace its origin and diffusion through phylogenetic and phylodynamic approaches.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study population</title><p>We studied 113 individuals carrying HIV-1 A1 subtype. Patients were sampled from 1999 through 2011. Subjects signed an informed consent to have their anonymized data stored on a central server of the ARCA database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dbarca.net">www.dbarca.net</ext-link>) and used for research studies. Authors working in the clinical setting interacted with some of the patients included in the study as part of their own routine HIV care. No additional visits were scheduled, apart from those regularly planned for HIV monitoring, according to Italian national guidelines. ARCA is an observational HIV cohort approved by the Regional Ethical Committee of Tuscany (Comitato Etico Area Vasta Toscana Sudest). HIV-1 protease (PR) and partial reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences were generated by local centers for routine drug resistance testing at diagnosis or prior to the start of antiretroviral therapy or at treatment failure. Epidemiological data (gender, risk category, country of origin, date of diagnosis and age) were collected by physicians from patient medical records and then included in the databases together with virological, immunological and treatment information. Only the earliest available HIV-1 genotype was considered for each patient. The study was conducted in accordance with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and the ethical standards of the Italian Ministry of Health.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Phylogenetic dataset</title><p>The analysis of epidemiological clusters was performed on the starting dataset of 113 HIV-1 A1 subtypes.</p><p>The evolutionary population dynamics was estimated in the dataset of Italian patients (n = 53).</p><p>A reference set of 229 subtype A1 <italic>pol</italic> gene sequences was obtained from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov">www.hiv.lanl.gov</ext-link>). Viral sequences were selected according to the following inclusion criteria: i) sequences had already been published in peer-reviewed journals; ii) the subtype assignment of each sequences classified as non-recombinant was certain; iii) the city/state of origin and the year of sampling were known and clearly established in the original publication. The final reference set includes subtype A1 sequences of Central Africa (n = 22; Democratic Republic of Congo = 13, Central African Republic = 3, Gabon = 6), East Africa (n = 52; Uganda = 17, Tanzania = 16, Kenya = 19), Estonia (n = 9), Latvia (n = 19), Lithuania (n = 5), Moldavia (n = 5), Ukraine (n = 20), Byelorussia (n = 10), Russia (n = 20), Kazakhstan (n = 6), Uzbekistan (n = 7), Greece (n = 9), Albania (n = 8).

The final alignment encompassed 834 nucleotides.</p><p>The Bayesian phylogenetic tree was reconstructed by means of both MrBayes and Beast using the general time reversible (GTR)+ gamma distribution (G)+ proportion of invariable sites (I) model, which was selected using the Modeltest v. 3.7 program. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) search was made for 10x10<sup>6</sup> generations using tree sampling every 100th generation and a burn-in fraction of 50%. Statistical support for specific clades was obtained by calculating the posterior probability (pp) of each monophyletic clade, and a posterior consensus tree was generated after a 50% burn-in. Clades with a pp of 1 were considered epidemiologically related clusters.</p><p>Dated trees, evolutionary rates and population growth were co-estimated by using Beast v.1.8.0 [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk">http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk</ext-link>) using the previous model. Different coalescent priors (constant population size, exponential growth, logistic growth and Bayesian skyline plot) were tested using both strict and relaxed molecular clock models. Different clock models were compared by calculating the Bayes Factor (BF) [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The difference (in log<sub>e</sub> space) of marginal likelihood between any two models is log<sub>e</sub> BF. Evidence against the null model (i.e. the one with lower marginal likelihood) was indicated by: 6&#x0003e;(2 log<sub>e</sub> BF)&#x0003e;2 (positive), 10&#x0003e;(2 log<sub>e</sub> BF)&#x0003e;6 (strong) and (2 log<sub>e</sub> BF)&#x0003e;10 (very strong) [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. BF calculations were performed with Tracer v.1.5 software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Tracer">http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Tracer</ext-link>). The BF analysis showed that the relaxed lognormal molecular clock fitted the data better than the strict clock model (2lnBF = 114.5). Chains were run for 50 million generations with sampling every 5,000 generations. The results were visualized in Tracer v.1.5 and uncertainty in the estimates was indicated by 95% highest probability density (HPD) intervals. Convergence was assessed based on the ESS (effective-sample size) value and only parameter estimates with ESS&#x0003e;300 were accepted. The maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was then selected from the posterior tree distribution using TreeAnnotator v.1.8.0 available in the BEAST software package.

A likelihood map consists of an equilateral triangle: each dot within the triangle represents the likelihoods of the three possible unrooted trees for a set of four sequences (quartets), randomly selected from the dataset. The dots close to the corners or at the sides respectively represent tree-like (fully resolved phylogenies in which one tree is clearly better than the others) or network-like phylogenetic signals (three regions for which it is not possible to decide between two topologies). The central area of the map represents a star-like signal (the region where the star tree is the optimal tree).</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Phylogeographic analysis</title><p>Analyses were performed using Bayesian Skyline coalescent tree prior with a relaxed clock (uncorrelated Lognormal model). Chains were run for 100 million generations with sampling every 10,000. The results were visualized using Tracer v.1.5. The ESS value for each parameter was &#x0003e;300, indicating sufficient mixing of the Markov chain. Rates with a BF of &#x0003e;3 were considered well supported and formed the migration pathway. The MCC tree was selected from the posterior tree distribution after a 10% burn-in using the TreeAnnotator program, version 1.8.0. The final tree was visualized using FigTree version 1.4.0. To provide a spatial projection, the migration routes indicated by the tree were visualized using Google Earth (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://earth.google.com">http://earth.google.com</ext-link>) and the SPREAD program (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kuleuven.ac.be/aidslab/phylogeography/SPREAD.html">http://www.kuleuven.ac.be/aidslab/phylogeography/SPREAD.html</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Viral gene flow analysis</title><p>The MacClade program version 4 (Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA) was used to test viral gene out/in using a modified version of the Slatkin and Maddison test [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A one-character data matrix was obtained from the original dataset by assigning a one-letter code, indicating the geographical origin, to each taxon in the tree. The putative origin of each ancestral sequence (i.e., internal node) in the tree was then inferred by finding the most parsimonious reconstruction (MPR) of the ancestral character using either the ACCTRAN or DELTRAN option. The final tree length, that is the number of observed viral gene flow events in the genealogy, is computed and compared to the tree-length distribution of 10,000 trees obtained by random joining-splitting (null distribution). Observed genealogies significantly shorter than random trees indicate the presence of subdivided populations with restricted gene flow. The viral gene flow (migrations) was traced with the &#x02018;State changes and stasis tool&#x02019; (MacClade software), which counts the number of changes in a tree for each pairwise character state. Gene flow was also calculated for the null distribution to assess whether the gene flow events observed in the actual tree were significantly higher (&#x0003e;95%) or lower (&#x0003c;95%) than the values in the null distribution at the <italic>p =</italic> .<italic>05</italic> level.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and comparisons between groups were performed using the &#x003c7;2 or the Fisher exact test.

The present phylogenetic analysis showed that subtype A1 originated, as expected, in East Africa (where subtype A is the most prevalent clade) with a recent epidemic, originating around 1961 [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Global subtype A1 dispersion showed a strong geographic compartmentalization in many clusters. Dispersal routes of subtype A1 from Africa to Europe were probably associated with immigration from Africa while viral mobility within Eastern Europe is probably due to connections among IDUs. After its origin in East Africa subtype A1 migrated in Central Africa; both variants from East and Central Africa likely originated the epidemic in Europe. The spread among East European countries started from 1982, corresponding to the identification of the first outbreaks in countries formerly part of Soviet Union as reported by literature [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>In general, several subtype A migration pathways exist among European countries which are mainly associated with heterosexuals and IDUs in Eastern Europe. Greece and Albania are a consistent exception due to the establishment of a large HIV-1 subtype A local epidemic sustaining 20.6% and 56.1% of infections, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146097.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In agreement with data of Paraskevis et al. [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], our findings showed a monophyletic origin of subtype A epidemic in Greece and Albania and confirmed its origin in East Africa (Kenya and Tanzania) with a date of origin around 1983.</p><p>Phylogeographical reconstruction suggests that A1 clade entered Italy through three distinct introduction events: an early first getaway took place directly from East Africa, where subtype A has a high prevalence, while two additional events occurred from the Southern Balkan Peninsula and the area encompassing Moldavia and Ukraine. This phenomenon could be related to Eastern European women who contributed to the penetration of such variant probably through sex work as demonstrated by the high proportion of women in clusters. It has been documented that, during the past 10 years, Albanian female sex workers traveled to other Balkan countries and to Western Europe, especially Italy and Greece. The very low percentage of African subjects within epidemiological networks suggests a minor role of the African A1 variant compared to the East European one in the circulation of this subtype in Italy. This is in agreement with the high degree of homogeneity of the virus populations carried by IDUs in the former Soviet Union countries which suggests that they shares a quite recent common ancestor, as a result of a single introduction. In contrast, HIV-1 A1 African sequences presented a high genetic variability, that increased in Democratic Republic of Congo in comparison to in West or East Africa [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146097.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146097.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The estimation of the demographic history of subtype A1 in Italy revealed that the epidemic growth during the 1990s. The stabilization of the epidemic around 2000 can be probably explained by the reduced number of infections related to injecting drug usage and the diffusion of combination antiretroviral therapy in infected IDUs.</p><p>Globally, we hypothesize three different coeval introduction events of the A1 variant from Africa into Europe; the former involving Byelorussia [<xref rid="pone.0146097.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], the second Greece and the latter Italy. The migration fluxes confirmed the results of phylogeographic reconstruction giving a strong support to the link between East Africa and Greece.</p><p>Some possible limits and biases of the present study have to be mentioned. First, although our dataset includes sequences from a national database we cannot exclude the possibility that the study population is not truly representative of all HIV-1 A1 subtype cases in Italy. Another potential limit of our study is that we analyzed a portion of <italic>pol</italic> gene, rather than full genome sequences, which could underestimate recombinant strains that frequently include A1 subtype portions (such as CRF01_AE or CRF02_AG, very frequent in Italy). Nevertheless, phylogenetic and recombination analysis were performed to confirm the subtype assignment on sequences classified as A1 subtype in the ARCA database by also comparing these strains with other known CRFs. Additionally, the relative lack of country of origin and risk factor information for some patients could have weakened the strength of the observed associations.</p><p>In conclusion, this study provides novel information about the A1 subtype epidemic and its geographic origin, as well as the routes of transmission among patients living in Italy and carrying such variant. Due to its founder effect, subtype B predominates the HIV-1 Italian epidemic. However, the geographic position of Italy in the center of Mediterranean basin and the increase of population mobility in Europe, had the potential to modify the previous HIV-1 epidemiological structure. The findings in the present study contribute to the understanding of this changing pattern ad highlight the importance of an extensive and continuous monitoring of the spread of HIV-1 variants in Europe.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0146097.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Bayesian tree of 113 HIV-1 A1 isolates obtained with Beast program.</title><p>The 5 supported clusters are highlighted in red color.
