    "This chapter deals with progress in disease resistance for the livestock population species-wise and describes the progress that occurred globally. Certain genes were identified for mastitis resistance and the strategies for genomic control of mastitis are discussed. Gene-edited tuberculosis-resistant cattle were developed for the first time with CRISPR/Cas 9 technology with NRAMP gene insert. Similarly studies are in progress for the development of trypanosomiasis-resistant cattle at ILRI. Genomic insights were discussed for disease resistance for goat against gastrointestinal nematode infestation, coccidiosis, peste des petits ruminants, and scrapie. Similarly genomic resistance was also discussed for sheep, discussing the mechanism of disease resistance with MHC, antibody and T cell response, cytokines, and receptors. Genes identified for bacterial diarrhoeal resistance as K88, F18 (an intestinal receptor) for resistance to bacterial infection in pig. Gene-edited pigs were developed against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and transmissible gastroenteritis caused by corona virus using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Insights on the omics technologies developed and studied were discussed for livestock species. Genomic control on various diseases of poultry is discussed as salmonellosis, avian influenza, Marekâ€™s disease, Newcastle disease with advanced genomic and allied techniques for its control as RNA interference, flow cytometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, transcriptomics, etc. A new concept on natural antibodies was discussed."
