However, hospitals are ill-prepared to meet the needs of PWUD. We focus on illicit drug use while admitted to hospital and how PWUD and health care providers describe, respond, and attempt to manage its use.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and findings</title><p>Using varied purposive methods in Toronto and Ottawa, we recruited n = 24 PWUD (who self-reported that they were living with HIV and/or HCV infection; currently or had previously used drugs or alcohol in ways that were harmful; had a hospital admission in the past five years) and n = 26 health care providers (who were: currently working in an academic hospital as a physician, nurse, social worker or other allied health professional; and 2) providing care to this patient group). All n = 50 participants completed a short, socio-demographic questionnaire and an audio-recorded semi-structured interview about receiving or providing acute care in a hospital between 04/2014 and 05/2015. Patient participants received $25 CAD and return transit fare; provider participants received a $50 CAD gift card for a bookseller. All participants provided informed consent. Audio-recordings were transcribed verbatim, corrected, and uploaded to NVivo 10. Using the seven-step framework method, transcripts were coded line-by-line and managed using NVvivo. An analytic framework was created by grouping and mapping the codes. Preliminary analyses were presented to advisory group members for comment and used to refine the interpretation. Questionnaire data were managed using SPSS version 22.0 and descriptive statistics were used to describe the participants. Many but not all patient participants spoke about using psycho-active substances not prescribed to them during a hospital admission. Attempts to avoid negative experiences (e.g., withdrawal, boredom, sadness, loneliness and/or untreated pain) were cited as reasons for illicit drug use. Most tried to conceal their illicit drug use from health care providers. Patients described how their self-reported level of pain was not always believed, tolerance to opioids was ignored, and requests for higher doses of pain medications denied. Some health care providers were unaware of on-site illicit drug use; others acknowledged it occurred. Few could identify a hospital policy specific to illicit drug use and most used their personal beliefs to guide their responses to it (e.g., ignore it, increase surveillance of patients, reprimands, loss of privileges/medications, threats of immediate discharge should it continue, and substitution dosing of medication).</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Providers highlighted gaps in institutional guidance for how they ought to appropriately respond to in-hospital substance use. Patients attempted to conceal illicit drug use in environments with no institutional policies about such use, leading to varied responses that were inconsistent with the principles of patient centred care and reflected personal beliefs about illicit drug use. There are increasing calls for implementation of harm reduction approaches and interventions in hospitals but uptake has been slow. Our study contributes to this emerging body of literature and highlights areas for future research, the development of interventions, and changes to policy and practice.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></funding-source><award-id>129926</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strike</surname><given-names>Carol J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000085</institution-id><institution>Ontario HIV Treatment Network</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3977-0523</contrib-id><name><surname>Chan Carusone</surname><given-names>Soo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>We received funding for this project from two sources: the Ontario HIV Treatment Network, Community Based Research Grant #1035 and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Grant #129926.

The magnitude of this crisis is reflected in a decline in overall life expectancy in the United States [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and some regions of Canada [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229713.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. As this epidemic has evolved, hospitalizations of people for overdose and injection drug use-related problems have increased as have calls for innovative models of care [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229713.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. While hospitalizations can be unpleasant for the average person, they are especially challenging for people who use drugs (PWUD) who commonly have histories of social, medical, and structural complexity, as well as stigma and resulting trauma [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Priest and McCarty contend that acute care for PWUD is needed, possible and effective [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the extant literature shows that few hospitals provide optimal care for PWUD and, with a few exceptions at specific hospitals, policies regarding the inpatient care of any medical problem among PWUD are lacking despite calls for such guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Mutual distrust between health care providers and PWUD has been documented to influence therapeutic interactions in hospitals and impacts the quality of care delivered [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229713.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In these settings, PWUD are often perceived to be problematic and drug-seeking by health care providers [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229713.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229713.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Correspondingly, PWUD often perceive being stigmatized and report that the care they receive is substandard compared with other patients [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Hospital settings have been characterized as risk environments [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229713.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] wherein contextual factors (e.g., formal and informal policies, discourses, and discrimination) external to the individual produce and shape harms. McNeil and colleagues applied this approach to examine the experiences of people who inject drugs while admitted to acute care hospitals and found they were subjected to surveillance, harassment, and neglect, and that these therapeutic contexts became risk environments for marginalized persons [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. They showed that the enforcement of abstinence only policies (i.e., social structures) combined with unmanaged pain and withdrawal can promote the very behaviours it targets to prevent, including illicit substance use during hospital admission and premature departure from the hospital [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Data from a Vancouver study showed that 43.9% of PWUD who had been in hospital reported ever using an illicit drug during their hospitalization [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To add to growing literature about drug use in hospitals, in this study we focus on the relational, affective, temporal and fluid elements, as well as acts of resistance associated with it. Unlike other studies that focus on either patient or health care provider perspectives, we explore the accounts of both PWUD and health care providers (i.e., physicians, nurses, pharmacists, social workers, and dieticians) about responses and attempts to manage the use of illicit drugs while admitted to acute care wards in general hospitals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Methods</title><p>This qualitative, descriptive study is located within a broader program of research about the experience of receiving or providing hospital care to people living with HIV and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) who use substances [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229713.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

The questionnaire included items about socio-demographic characteristics, health status, and substance use. During the semi-structured interview, patient participants were asked about their experiences of accessing acute care in a general hospital, the quality and nature of interactions with hospital-based clinicians, how they negotiated/managed their substance use while admitted to hospital, if and how they used substances while admitted, and what could be done to improve the experience of patients who use substances in acute care settings. Provider participants also completed a brief questionnaire with items about workplace characteristics, work role/position, demographic characteristics, and prior training in addictions and harm reduction. During the audio-recorded, face to face or telephone, semi-structured interview, provider participants were asked about their attitudes and experiences of providing care to this patient population, experiences prescribing opioids, benzodiazepines and psycho-active substances, the management of on-site substance use, procedures for patients leaving against medical advice, any hospital policies pertaining to on-site use of substances that were not prescribed, and recommendations to improve acute care for this population. As compensation, patient participants received $25 CAD cash and return transit fare and provider participants received a $50 CAD gift card for a bookseller.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Data management and analyses</title><p>Audio-recorded interviews, lasting 10&#x02013;60 minutes, were conducted between 04/2014 and 05/2015 by SR, SCC, AG or CS for patients at the University of Toronto or community organizations where recruitment took place and for providers at the hospital or by telephone. Audio-recordings were transcribed verbatim by a confidential transcriber, verified, corrected, and uploaded to NVivo 10. Using the seven step framework method, team members used line by line coding on several transcripts to identify pre-existing and emergent concepts, collectively discussed codes, developed a code set to be applied to subsequent transcripts, used an iterative approach to re-code transcripts to capture new codes, used Nvivo to capture the codes for each transcript, grouped codes into categories to create the analytic framework, charted the data by transcript and topic (e.g., managing substance use in hospital), and mapped connections between categories to identify and interpret themes in the dataset [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Themes were further compared by setting and health provider discipline. To add rigor and ensure the trustworthiness of the interpretation, preliminary analyses were presented to advisory group members, comprised of people living with HIV and/or HCV and who used drugs, for comment and used to refine the interpretation. Questionnaire data were managed using SPSS version 22.0 and descriptive statistics were used to describe the participants.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec009"><title>Results</title><p>For this study, we recruited 24 participants living with HIV and/or HCV who were mostly male, Caucasian and housed; ranged in age from 33&#x02013;56 years old and reported use of opioids, cocaine and/or many other legal and illegal drugs (see <xref rid="pone.0229713.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

Previous studies have highlighted the challenges that providers face in prescribing opioids to individuals with substance use disorders, and variation in prescribing practices [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Addiction Consulting Services (ACS) may be a model of care that could help to address some of these issues.

The models vary but ACS are typically staffed by physicians, nurses, social workers and/or peer workers who work in consultation with attending physicians to provide services such as a comprehensive addiction history, physical examinations, withdrawal management, and initiating pharmacotherapies where indicated [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229713.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Existing research documents that physicians, nurses and other health care providers often feel ill-equipped to address the complex needs of patients with substance use disorders and ACS have emerged to improve the care and outcomes for inpatients who use drugs. These services have been shown to successfully engage patients in care [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229713.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], but estimates suggest that less than ten of these services exist in North America [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. While an ACS was in operation at one of the hospitals from where we recruited, its existence did not coincide with the development and implementation of a hospital-wide policy regarding illicit drug use. ACSs seem well-placed to also contribute to the development of institutional policies regarding responses to illicit drug use while admitted. However, as we have shown there is great variability in the perspectives of clinicians in how to respond. Utilization of a patient centred approach [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] that incorporates the voices and perspectives of PWUDis crucial to avoid formalization of policies that reproduce a risk environment characterized by stigma, pain and discomfort, early discharge, and drug-related risk.</p><p>Past studies have also shown that providers have negative perceptions of PWUD including labelling them as &#x02018;drug-seeking&#x02019; or believing patients will sell their prescription opioids, resulting in reluctance to prescribe [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229713.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. While our findings substantiate the suspicion about the sale of prescribed medications within close proximity to the hospital, we only heard accounts of PWUD patients buying in this market, not selling into it. It could be that patients feared disclosing &#x02018;trafficking&#x02019; behaviours and did not fully disclose this behaviour. While hospitals might respond by recommending police &#x02018;crack-down&#x02019; on this practice within the vicinity of the hospital, this approach may not achieve the intended goal of reducing on-premise drug use. Evidence of crack-downs in community settings by police have been shown to create greater risks for PWUD [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Better management of pain and withdrawal, and/or initiation of substitution treatment might reduce this illegal market. However, this would depend on improved trust between patients and their healthcare providers, and on improved training for health care providers and/or referral.</p><p>Our study contributes to the small, but growing, body of literature and theory about drug use in hospitals and the role of harm reduction by illuminating the relational, affective, temporal, fluid, and ambiguous elements, as well as acts of resistance. First, our study provides both provider and patient perspectives, and highlights relational issues which affect care such as behaviour following use, and affective issues related to fear, anger, anxiety, and disappointment from both patients and providers. The relational is extended into the narratives of patients who supported each other by sharing drugs in hospital with friends and loved ones, and providers who turned a blind eye to these strategies. In addition to the embodied experience of drug use and withdrawal which is well documented in the literature, our findings highlight the temporal elements and how time passes when people are unable to use and the devastating impact of boredom and isolation. Despite the perception of the hospital as fixed, patients moved between the hospital and surrounding community drug using spaces, and dealers moved from those spaces into hospitals, with relative ease making for fluid borders. While much attention has been given to discriminatory and punitive polices in hospitals, we heard about the absence of policy and what this void enables or constrains. Such policy ambiguity empowers some care providers to subject patients to searches and expulsion while it empowers others to provide substitution dosing on a case by case basis. That is, we heard accounts of resistance from both patients and providers. Hospitals are indeed risk environments, but where there is risk there is also opportunity, including for developing client centred care approaches. We invite others to take up these theoretical threads in future research that recognizes the complexity of managing substance use in hospitals. Such an orientation invites thinking about drug use in hospitals as an assemblage of relations, bodies, drugs, affects, temporalities, and policies [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>While our study illuminates important patient and provider perspectives, there are limitations to consider in its interpretation. Our study findings are based on qualitative data collected about experiences in academic hospitals in two large cities in Canada. Given that participants spoke about experiences that took place in the five years preceding the interviews, their recall of experiences may be influenced by time and other subsequent events. In addition, we recruited people living with HIV and/or HCV and who also use illicit drugs people, a very specific sub-population of people who use drugs whose experiences may not reflect those of PWUD without these infections. Additionally, we recruited people who reported the use of any illicit substance without a prescription and our sample precluded sub-analysis by substance type and/or route of administration. Eligibility for provider participation included delivering care to those living with HIV and/or HCV and this provider group may have different perspectives and attitudes compared to other specialists or general medical providers. While the findings are subject to these limitations and the extent to which the data can be generalized across place and time are not clear, our findings to add to a growing literature that reports similar experiences in other settings suggesting that these experiences are more generalized than specific to person, place or time [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229713.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>There are increasing calls for implementation of harm reduction approaches and interventions (e.g., needle and syringe programs and supervised consumption services) in hospitals [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229713.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] but uptake has been slow. Nevertheless, one evaluation of a hospital-based needle and syringe program showed promise for implementation in this setting [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Several studies demonstrate that hospital-based harm reduction interventions would be acceptable to patients who use substances, may encourage them to stay to complete their treatment, and minimize drug-related risks [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Further, McNeil et al [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] explored the acceptability of incorporating harm reduction interventions into hospital settings with people who inject drugs and found that harm reduction approaches in hospital were necessary to promote patient centred care. They suggested that harm reduction approaches could improve patient-provider relationships and reduce discharge against medical advice [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, implementing harm reduction on its own will not address the issues of mistrust and the past traumatic experiences of PWUD in healthcare systems (e.g., being mistreated and cut-off of pain medication), and lack of patient centred care approaches. To help address this gap we call for trauma-informed care and policies attuned to the health needs and lived realities of PWUD [<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0229713.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].

As many of our participants noted, imposing abstinence during a hospitalization is likely to lead to delayed care, discharge, and further mistrust and the potential for increased mortality. A spectrum of harm reduction, from facilitating safer use to substitution therapy may promote greater retention in care, and create opportunities for discussions about drug treatment on patients&#x02019; terms.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are deeply grateful for the time and effort of the participants to share their experiences and opinions about the health care experience.
