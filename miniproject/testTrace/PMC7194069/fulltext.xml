The ability to detect disease outbreaks in the early stages is a key component of efficient disease control and prevention. With the increased availability of electronic health-care data and spatial analysis techniques, there is great potential to develop algorithms to enable more effective disease surveillance. The research focuses to develop a transparent user-friendly method to simulate the outbreak data. The paper describes the GIS tools to identify and define the field of investigation which requires consideration of the strengths and limitations of data collection instruments, facility of locational data collection, accuracy of locational data, and pertinent attributes for understanding disease risk. Using such information, it is quite easy for authorities to locate the highly effected area and take appropriate actions in that particular areas.

The epidemic is discovered in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and announced to be a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020 (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2020a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2020b</xref>). More than 1.8 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in more than 110,000 deaths. Over 412,000 people have recovered. The pandemic caused severe global socioeconomic chaos (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">The New York Times, 2020</xref>), such as postponement and cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural activities (panic purchases have exacerbated the widespread shortage of supplies (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Jade Scipioni, 2019</xref>).

The deadly coronavirus 2019&#x02013;20 declared as a global pandemic and the first case is reported in Pakistan on February 2020 (see, <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>
). The number of confirmed cases are over 5000 including 1026 recovered and 86 died up till April 2020. Punjab is the biggest province of Pakistan and has the highest number of cases with confirmed 2400 (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Tribune.com.pk, 2020a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Tribune.com.pk, 2020b</xref>). To restrict unnecessary movements across the cities, the government has ordered rigorous instructions for the coming two weeks that will slow the spread of coronavirus. As the COVID-19 cases are reported in Karachi and Islamabad, the Punjab government started imposing restrictions all across the province as a precautionary measure. Similarly, after reporting two new cases in Karachi, the provincial government has also taken all the necessary action. Five advanced hi-tech scanners have been fitted at airports and import tax on items related to the disease treatment. Regardless of all the high level and extensive actions being implemented by the administrative bodies, the virus is now becoming a high risk situations for old age persons, as indicated in <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>

The infectious disease affects the people who are surrounding the patient or in direct touch with them (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Ahmed et al., 2020</xref>). Health researchers are studying the reasons behind these diseases in order to find a way to discover it at an early stage and limit their spread (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Ahmed et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Al-Zinati et al., 2020</xref>). Public health agencies depend on traditional ways to control and monitor the expansion of infectious diseases. This way relies on the laboratory reports and doctor's diagnosis, but it takes a long time to detect if the disease spreads or not.</p><p id="p0045">Identifying disease outbreaks early is critical for efficient infectious disease control. Currently, spatial data are collected but often not well utilized in routine infectious disease surveillance. As outbreaks are often characterized by the degree of spatial diffusion of cases, spatiotemporal surveillance algorithms are being developed in a number of countries. These spatiotemporal algorithms aim to facilitate the early detection of disease outbreaks which exhibit spatial clustering (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Meng, 2017</xref>) such as those associated with person-to-person transmission of disease, or a localized source of infection.</p><p id="p0050">Both historical and simulated outbreak data can be used to evaluate algorithms for public health surveillance. Evaluation is typically performed by comparing algorithm-derived outbreak indicators with predetermined criteria indicating the specific location of outbreaks in time and space. The following section outlines the benefits and limitations of using historical and simulated data for the evaluation of outbreak detection algorithms. The objective of this research is to focus on developing a transparent user-friendly method (i.e. GIS) to detect, collect and analyze outbreak data in Pakistan.</p><p id="p0055">The paper discusses few challenges as well as responses associated with it, however, Pakistan need to work multiple dimensions: firstly, developing GIS capacity and using GIS Tools for controlling the pandemic. Secondly, Reveal the existence of an epidemic, identify and count cases. Thirdly, carry out convenient multi-scale dynamic mapping for epidemics. Fourthly, spatial segmentation of the epidemic risk and prevention level. Fifth, the tabulate and orient the data in terms of time, place, and person (Descriptive Epidemiology). Sixth, implement and evaluate control and prevention measures rapid estimation of the population flow and distribution. Seventh, develop, test hypothesis and plan the balancing of supply and demand of medical resources. Eighth, assessment of the supply of materials and transportation risk. Ninth, communicate findings, monitor the spatial spread of social sentiment and detection.</p><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Developing GIS capacity and using GIS tools for controlling the pandemic</title><p id="p0060">Successful collaboration with the GIS subject matter expert (SME) can be achieved through recommendations about maps relevancy, analysis plans, and accuracy of data.

Workers played an active role (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Vynnycky et al., 2019</xref>) in this collaboration and generated a plan that regulated the location of the survey, adopted a strategy of data collection, and conducted spatial data analysis that helped in producing an interactive tool for mapping.</p><p id="p0065">Pakistani cities should focus on preparing general reference maps and sampling plans to educate the local community about updated situation of COVID-19 at regional to national level. The map can be helpful to determine the boundaries of the area to be surveyed. It is handy to map and analyze data that is available publicly, based on a specific interest, for instance, health outcome data and population. In this survey, image data is also helpful in providing information particularly if someone tries to examine the damage caused by natural calamities.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Reveal and identify the outbreak of an epidemic and count cases</title><p id="p0070">The GIS packages of commercial and open-source, offer valuable software options (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Lansley et al., 2019</xref>).

Often, estimating the population in a specific geographic area is involved in assessing the vulnerable population. GIS can assist in census data evaluation in identifying an appropriate number of populations at risk. Frequently, these pre-established geopolitical limits are enough for characteristics estimations of population. But this case does not remain same all the time. For example, wind forms may transmit a disease to only a small portion of a county or even across different census zones, resulting unusual forms (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). GIS tools can be used in calculating and creating the calculated percentage of the area to be surveyed in relation to identified geopolitical borders, as given in <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>

Remote sensing techniques help in identifying primary topography or observe alteration with time fluctuations. Satellite or aerial photographs can be particularly useful to create responses to natural climatic events by providing the top view of calamities caused by environment and infrastructure and how people are stranded across the area.</p><p id="p0085">GIS is useful for the imagery evaluation of disease growth, altering concentrations, or spreading of threats across time (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Tosepu et al., 2020</xref>). This imagery evaluation and visualization include number of techniques, like static map series, animations, and linked interactive micro maps. Moreover, number of advanced tools are used to create animated and visualized curve of an epidemiology for all the spatial units within the case study area. Curve magnitude and direction are shown in maps which help in visualizing the outbreak stage, magnitude, and geographic distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>2.4</label><title>Arrange data in terms of individuals, time, and area</title><p id="p0090">Usually, the initial data is used to create a mapped visualization of the disease distribution with number of points. These points are shown in the maps displaying each case study area or depict the geographic distribution rates across time or fluctuations in the counts distribution (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Cromley et al., 2018</xref>). The data of rate and count census can be assessed to different terrestrial units (e.g., counties, census tracts, or postal codes). Choropleth mapping technique visualizes the counts extent or rates by using borderline aggregations (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Morrison and Bryan, 2019</xref>). Selection of classified divisions and color themes are of primary considerations. The mapped accumulated cases from houses within a village that is also quite useful.

These results and maps of the descriptive analysis can lead to the hypothetical development of disease-causing factors, exposure locations, and the transmission mode. This information will help the field team to determine the requirement for doing more analytical studies in which to apply various advanced and modern spatial statistics to comprehend the geographic associations in different time periods and between disease and alleged dangers. Risk maps are used to examine and calculate data in an unchecked area or geographic regression practices by using interpolation methods and spatial overlays are deployed to deeply comprehend geographically distributed disease patterns or major risk aspects (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan et al., 2019</xref>).

Detection of such areas and disclosing the main factors which are affecting the effectiveness of these procedures are beneficial to determine, if these changes are fruitful to control measures. In addition, it is more important to determine that how and where these changes are important to incorporate. Researchers can record the fluctuations in the opioid-related fatality rates across various areas to check where working is going on effectively (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Briceno et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="p0110">The spatiotemporal analysis helps researchers in advanced techniques to check and quantify complex relations in prevention activities, expected disease factors and vulnerable areas. It also helps in assessing impression of placement where prevention measures are being taken (e.g., prescription, recovery causes, or treatment location, etc.). Afterward, we have to deploy time-series visualization, animations, map series, linked micro maps, and timeliness of geographic forms to evaluate these changing patterns. Later, healthcare analysis and temporals are analytical studies that expose the missed prevention opportunities or mark location where various intrusions are proved effective.

Weekly maps are quite significant to visualize incidences and geographic shifts of the disease during major disease outbreak like COVID-19. For instance, during 2017, the overwhelming Puerto Rico Hurricane live visualizations were carried out to access current data of the situation at hospitals, pharmacies, nursing homes and other health related places with potential targeted locations. These visualizations provide adequate information to determine the top areas where medical resources can serve best. Maps are helpful for the communicational findings to respond to local authorities and agencies and spread situational awareness. Moreover, victims can get the information right on hand. Similarly, the Pakistani government have to study the precautionary measures which had been taken by the different governments during previous pandemic situations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0050"><label>3</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0120">The aim of this research is to introduce a technology for simulating disease outbreaks which can produce realistic case distributions, and be easily adapted for different locations and to represent different underlying population distributions in order to evaluate outbreak detection algorithms. The approach described facilitates the comparison of algorithms for early detection within a spatially relevant context. It is envisaged that the software will be developed further to include more detailed consideration of modes of disease spread, and to incorporate case detection and disease control processes. The implementation of the GIS environment, although not the most efficient approach, provides significant advantages including access to a large number of spatial functions, and is suited to the rapid development and prototyping. However, this approach is useful to trace and treat the patients timely, as well to take preemptive measure in that particular area to stop spreading COVID-19. For this reason, the local authorities need to quarantine that area, instead of lock down the whole country.
