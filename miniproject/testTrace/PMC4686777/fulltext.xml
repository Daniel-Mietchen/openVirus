Here we show that during the winter of 2014&#x02013;2015, an emergent variant of a previously rare norovirus GII.17 genotype, Kawasaki 2014, predominated in Hong Kong and outcompeted contemporary GII.4 Sydney 2012 in hospitalized cases. GII.17 cases were significantly older than GII.4 cases. Root-to-tip and Bayesian BEAST analyses estimate GII.17 viral protein 1 (VP1) evolves one order of magnitude faster than GII.4 VP1. Residue substitutions and insertion occur in four of five inferred antigenic epitopes, suggesting immune evasion. Sequential GII.4-GII.17 infections are noted, implicating a lack of cross-protection. Virus bound to saliva of secretor histo-blood groups A, B and O, indicating broad susceptibility. This fast-evolving, broadly recognizing and probably immune-escaped emergent GII.17 variant causes severe gastroenteritis and hospitalization across all age groups, including populations who were previously less vulnerable to GII.4 variants; therefore, the global spread of GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 needs to be monitored.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

Genetically, this virus is classified into at least 6 genogroups and nearly 40 genotypes based on viral protein 1 (VP1) sequences<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Despite the broad genetic diversity, one genotype, known as genogroup II genotype 4 (GII.4), has been the major circulating genotype in community and health-care settings since 1996 with periodic emergence of novel GII.4 variants every 2&#x02013;4 years<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Norovirus GII.4 infections are associated with more severe clinical manifestations and hospitalization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Our earlier hospital-based study also indicated that GII.4 accounted for nearly 90&#x00025; of hospitalized norovirus gastroenteritis that represents the severe end of the spectrum of disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Despite the overwhelmingly predominance of norovirus GII.4 strains in the past two decades, studies on historical stool specimens dated back to the 1970s and 1980s suggested that non-GII.4 norovirus such as GII.3 was commonly detected, at least in hospitalized paediatric diarrhoeal cases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. This raises the possibility that epidemic norovirus may not be limited only to the GII.4 genotype. Notably, accumulating evidence suggests that the circulation of different norovirus genotypes is highly dynamic, probably as a result of herd immunity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>In late 2014, we observe a rapid increase in the number of hospitalized norovirus gastroenteritis attributed to the emergent GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 in Hong Kong. Here, we report epidemiological and virological characterization of norovirus GII.17 cases. Our findings suggest close monitoring of the global spread of this emergent GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 is necessary.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>High norovirus GII.17 activity during 2014&#x02013;2015 winter</title><p>A total of 415 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized norovirus cases were studied in our ongoing local norovirus surveillance between March 2014 and May 2015, inclusively. The median age of patients was 6 years (interquartile range (IQR): 1&#x02013;58 years). The male-to-female ratio was 1.14. Typical winter seasonality with higher norovirus activity in winter months (December 2014 to March 2015) was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Norovirus genotype was successfully identified in 372 (89.6&#x00025;) cases. During the inter-seasonal period (March 2014&#x02013;November 2014), the predominant circulating norovirus genotype was GII.4 (all but 2 belonged to the Sydney 2012) that accounted for 69.2&#x00025; (128/185) of genotyped cases; GII.17 cases were only rarely (3.8&#x00025;; 7/185) detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). A rapid rise in the number and proportion of GII.17 cases was observed in winter months during which GII.17 cases predominated over GII.4 cases (65.9&#x00025; (110/167) versus 18.6&#x00025; (31/167); <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001, Fisher's exact test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>).

At least ten (or all if less than ten were available) GII.17 cases per month were randomly selected and sequenced. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic inference of VP1 nucleotide sequences rooted to non-GII.17 genotypes showed that all GII.17 cases collected on or before August 2014 clustered together with contemporary GII.17 strains in Japan (Kawasaki323/2014) and Taiwan (13-BH-1/2013; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). From September 2014 onwards, however, all GII.17 sequences grouped to a distant, separate cluster that included other recently reported GII.17 associated with increased activity during the 2014&#x02013;2015 winter in China (Guangzhou/41621/2014) and Japan (Kawasaki308/2015; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). Identical clustering was observed using complete VP1 amino-acid sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Identical clustering was also observed using nucleotide and amino-acid trees rooted to the oldest GII.17 strains but discordant tree topology to the rooting by non-GII.17 outgroups was noted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). These most recent GII.17 cases showed 4.3&#x02013;5.0&#x00025; pairwise amino-acid difference in VP1 from the phylogenetically closest GII.17 sequences collected from Japan and Taiwan in 2013&#x02013;2014.

The novel GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 showed the greatest divergence (30&#x00025; identity at trough) in P2 domain from the oldest GII.17 VP1 sequence available (Hu/GII.17/C142/GF/1978, accession number KC597139; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Compared with other earlier local and regional GII.17 VP1 sequences collected in 2013&#x02013;2014, the novel GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 shared very high pairwise nucleotide identity (97.0&#x02013;98.1&#x00025;) in the shell and P1 domains but had substantially lower identity (90.6&#x02013;92.7&#x00025;) in the P2 domain. This translated to 22 amino-acid changes in the P2 domain, including 2 insertions at positions 378 and 397 (novel GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 numbering); 18 (82&#x00025;) of the changes, including the 2 insertions, were surface exposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). Notably, the insertion at position 378 corresponds to D374 of GII.4 VP1 that comprised histo-blood group antigen (HBGA)-binding interface of various norovirus GII (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Multiple alignment of GII.17 with GII.4 VP1 sequences suggested that 6 (positions 294, 299, 334, 395, 397 and 407) and 11 (positions 293, 295, 296, 335, 342, 371, 373, 374, 378, 381 and 411) of these amino-acid changes were mapped to and adjacent to inferred antigenic epitopes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Conservative mix-effect model of evolution (MEME) analysis inferred that two codons of GII.17 VP1 were under episodic diversifying (positive) selection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Both codons (354 and 371; novel GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 numbering) resided in the P2 domain but were neither mapped to or in the vicinity of any inferred antigenic epitopes. Among the 81 sequenced complete VP1 of the novel GII.17 Kawasaki 2014, there were 144 single-nucleotide polymorphisms of which 19 were non-synonymous. Six of the non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms resided in the P2 domain.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Accelerated evolution of norovirus GII.17 VP1 since 2002</title><p>Pairwise nucleotide and amino-acid distance comparison of all complete and near complete norovirus GII.17 VP1 sequences obtained in this study and GenBank with reference to the oldest complete GII.17 VP1 sequence available (Hu/GII.17/C142/GF/1978) indicated slower evolution of GII.17 VP1 from 1978 to 2002 but an accelerated evolution from 2002 to 2015 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The difference was more prominent on the amino-acid level. Nucleotide divergence rate estimation using root-to-tip regression analysis without a molecular clock assumption revealed a similar two-phase evolution of GII.17 VP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>).

Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) data fitting narrowed down rapid virus evolution to a period after late March/early April 2015 when the norovirus activity was subsiding.

In sharp contrast, norovirus GII.17 was rarely reported worldwide. This is exemplified by the huge difference in the volume of sequences deposited in GenBank. A simplified search using &#x02018;norovirus GII.4' and &#x02018;norovirus GII.17' returned 6,202 and 226 nucleotide entries as of September 2015, respectively. The only study that found GII.17 as the predominant norovirus genotype before the 2014&#x02013;2015 winter was an environmental investigation of water sources during 2012&#x02013;2013 in Kenya<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Interestingly, it appears that GII.17 cases were more commonly reported from studies conducted in Africa and Central/South America<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. In a Paraguayan study of norovirus gastroenteritis, for example, both GII.4 and GII.17 had a similar prevalence of 18&#x00025; in children aged &#x02264;5 years<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. The apparent characteristic geographical distribution may suggest GII.17 infections are dependent on host genetic factors. Human secretor status, which controls the expression of HBGA on intestinal epithelial cell surface, is one of the well-recognized factors that governs norovirus susceptibility<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Recently ancestry-based difference in secretor status is shown to influence norovirus epidemiology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The very unusual rapid emergence and wide circulation of the novel GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 in Hong Kong and other Asian regions raises the concern that whether the new variant has overcome genetic barrier and has successfully explored evolutionarily advantageous HBGA binding. In norovirus GII, principally six residues (S343, T344, R345, D374, G442 and Y443; GII.4 numbering) on VP1 define the HBGA-binding interface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In the VP1 P2 domain of the novel GII.17 Kawasaki 2014, there was one insertion at position 378 that corresponded to D374 of the HBGA-binding interface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Limited by the absence of the crystal structure of GII.17 VP1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), the influence of the insertion on HBGA binding remains elusive. Nevertheless, our preliminary findings showed that GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 bound to saliva of secretors of various histo-blood groups. This binding profile appears to be as broad as that of several pandemic GII.4 variants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, implicating a substantial proportion of our population may be susceptible to infections of GII.17 Kawasaki 2014. This highlights the epidemic potential of this emergent novel variant.</p><p>Second, immune-escaped GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 targets all age groups and may cause severe gastroenteritis in previously less vulnerable population. To have a better chance of capturing emergent norovirus of substantial impact, we conducted our surveillance in hospitalized norovirus gastroenteritis that represents the severe end of the spectrum of disease. We reason that any change in the predominant circulating genotype or GII.4 variant in hospital cases may have crucial public health implications. Genotype change alone, however, may not be that surprising considering periodic high activity of norovirus non-GII.4 genotype is not uncommon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Another strong reason that prompted us to initiate this detailed investigation was the wide age distribution of our GII.17 cases. Young children aged &#x0003c;5 years and adults aged &#x0003e;65 years (that is, those at the extremes of age) are known to be at-risk groups for more severe norovirus gastroenteritis partly due to immature and waning immunity, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Among our GII.4 cases, the median age was 1 year and at-risk age groups accounted for 81.0&#x00025; of cases. This age distribution agreed well with the general norovirus epidemiology and clinical presentation that norovirus infection is mild (non-hospitalized) in otherwise healthy individuals. In sharp contrast, GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 targeted all age groups. The median age of our GII.17 cases was 49 years and the so-called at-risk groups only accounted for 52.3&#x00025; of cases. Increased proportion of children and young adults aged 5&#x02013;65 years is alarming because this previously less vulnerable age group is generally regarded as non-compromised, thus unlikely to develop severe norovirus gastroenteritis that required medical attention. Furthermore, higher proportion of elderly aged &#x02265;85 years in GII.17 cases may have substantial clinical implications as this age group has been associated with most mortality in norovirus gastroenteritis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Although we observed two cases of fatal GII.17 infections, direct causal relationship remains elusive. Detailed comparison of clinical features with norovirus GII.4 is underway to assess the virulence of this novel GII.17 Kawasaki 2014. One explanation for the wide age distribution is the virtually absence of immunity against the novel GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 across all age groups. This is possible because of the rarity of and thus lack of previous exposure to norovirus GII.17 until now. Moreover, residue substitutions and insertion occurred in four out of five inferred antigenic epitopes on the VP1 P2 domain, indicating the establishment of a probably immune-escaped variant. This may resemble the cyclic surge in norovirus GII.4 gastroenteritis that coincides with the epochal evolution of GII.4 variants through immune evasion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Previous exposure to a different norovirus genotype, at least to GII.4 Sydney 2012, is likely to offer little or no cross-protection as suggested by our two cases of sequential (separated by 6 months to 2 years apart) GII.4 and GII.17 infections. The first known pandemic norovirus gastroenteritis occurred in 1996 with the emergence of the then novel GII.4 95/96 variant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, followed by the Farmington Hills variant in 2002 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). The Farmington Hills variant and all other subsequent pandemic GII.4 variants differed from earlier GII.4 by a characteristic insertion at antigenic epitope D. Remarkably, the insertion at position 397 in the VP1 P2 domain of the novel GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 was also mapped to the inferred antigenic epitope D. Whether or not the insertion will confer pandemic potential to the novel GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 is of immense interest.</p><p>Third, recent GII.17 VP1 evolved faster than GII.4 VP1. Previous estimation using sequences dated back to 1974&#x02013;2007 suggests the predominant norovirus GII.4 VP1 evolved at a steady rate of 4.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> nucleotide substitutions per site per year in the past four decades<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. In our study, long-term estimation using root-to-tip regression and Bayesian BEAST analysis on strains spanning nearly 40 years as well as short-term estimation using LOWESS data fitting on strains from the 2014&#x02013;2015 epidemic period all suggest rapid evolution of GII.17 VP1 at a rate of 1.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>&#x02212;2.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> nucleotide substitutions per site per year, which is one order of magnitude faster than that of GII.4 VP1 and other norovirus genotypes such as GII.3 and GII.7 (4.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>&#x02212;6.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> and 2.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> nucleotide substitutions per site per year, respectively)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Root-to-tip analysis further hints that the evolutionary rate of norovirus GII.17 may not be constant and was accelerating in recent years. RNA viruses are well known to be fast-evolving at an overall rate of 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> nucleotide substitutions per site per year<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> and the resultant genetic diversity is paramount to maintain viral fitness and survival under immune pressure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Norovirus GII.4, the major circulating genotype since 1996 with epochal emergence of immune-escaped variants every 2&#x02013;4 years<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, was reported to have faster-evolving VP1 than other genotypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, presumably explaining its predominance. We speculate that the intriguingly high evolutionary rate of GII.17 VP1 in recent years, probably through the acquisition of a novel RNA polymerase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, favour its host adaptation by fuelling the accumulation of residue substitutions on antigenic epitopes, driving antigenic drift. This consequently allows the probably immune-escaped novel GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 to, perhaps temporarily, outcompete the contemporary GII.4 Sydney 2012 that, after 2 years of its first emergence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>, encountered herd immunity in the 2014&#x02013;2015 winter. High frequency of mutations may also power GII.17 VP1 to explore evolutionarily advantageous broad HBGA binding. It is noteworthy that use of sequences collected over a short period of time may tend to over-estimating evolutionary rate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Thus, far only 16 complete and near complete GII.17 VP1 sequences are available from GenBank over a 37-year-period (1978&#x02013;2014) and all but 2 were collected after 2000. The paucity and temporal clustering of sequence data may lead to considerable uncertainty in estimating the evolutionary pattern and substitution rate of norovirus GII.17 VP1, as reflected in the wide 95&#x00025; highest posterior density interval in spite of repeated attempts to boost the effective sample size parameter in Bayesian BEAST analysis. Rate overestimation over a very-short time frame (for example, within a few months) may also result from transient deleterious mutations commonly observed in RNA viruses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Although not common, there were reports of sporadic norovirus GII.17 infections in several earlier epidemiological studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Complete sequencing of GII.17 VP1 from these cases to fill the data gap is highly anticipated to give us a better picture of GII.17 evolution in the past decades and a more robust estimation of its evolutionary rate.</p><p>Last, genome-wide analysis of norovirus GII.17 is proved challenging since only six complete genomes are available from the public domain as of this writing. Our study provides thus far the largest collection of 27 norovirus GII.17 genomes. Despite the limitation of short sampling time frame, preliminary analysis indicated that VP1-interaction domain of VP2, for example, is also rapidly mutating during the epidemic period, providing insights into norovirus evolution. Covariation of VP1 and VP2 in norovirus GII.4 variants has been suggested<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. It would be very interesting to know whether such covariation is common among norovirus genotypes and whether VP2 plays a role in driving VP1 evolution apart from its structural functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, we report the epidemic spread of a novel norovirus GII.17 variant (Kawasaki 2014) that emerged during the 2014&#x02013;2015 winter in Hong Kong. Multiple genetic signatures linked to HBGA binding and antigenic epitopes were identified. This fast-evolving, broadly recognizing and probably immune-escaped novel GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 causes severe gastroenteritis in previously less vulnerable population. Faster evolutionary rate of GII.17 VP1 than GII.4 VP1 reveals intense competition among norovirus genotypes and the potential of GII.17 to further acquire virulence and transmissibility. The predominance of a previously rare norovirus genotype clearly underlines the highly dynamic nature and the unpredictability of norovirus genotype circulation. It remains unclear whether GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 will persist in our community and demonstrate typical norovirus winter seasonality in the coming 2015&#x02013;2016 winter. Considering norovirus GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 is still rapidly evolving after current epidemic spread and has been sporadically detected outside Asia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, close monitoring of the global spread of this novel GII.17 variant is necessary.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Study design and patients</title><p>An ongoing, systematic hospital-based local surveillance network has been established since August 2012 to detect new emergent norovirus GII.4 variants and to evaluate norovirus genotype distribution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>.
