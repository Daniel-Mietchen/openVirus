respiratory disease. In recent years, reports about EV-D68 infection have markedly
increased worldwide. However, the epidemiological features of this emerging infection
are not well understood. To evaluate the emerging EV-D68 epidemic, we isolated the
circulating viral strain and investigated the seroprevalence of neutralizing
antibodies (NAbs) in Beijing between 2004 and 2011. We found that the titers of
EV-D68 NAbs were generally low in all age groups in sampled populations in 2004 but
significantly higher in 2009. From 2007 to 2011, the NAbs against EV-D68
significantly increased over time. These findings indicate that EV-D68 has spread
widely in the Chinese population in recent years, although only a limited number of
cases were reported.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>enterovirus D68</kwd><kwd>epidemic</kwd><kwd>neutralizing antibody</kwd><kwd>seroprevalence</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) belongs to the species Enterovirus D within the
<italic>Enterovirus</italic> genus. The biological properties of acid lability and a lower
optimum growth temperature suggest that EV-D68 is similar to human rhinoviruses
(HRVs) and is a respiratory tract pathogen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> As a non-enveloped, positive-sense,
single-stranded RNA virus, EV-D68 genome contains a single open reading frame coding
for a polyprotein, which is ultimately cleaved into four viral capsid proteins
VP1&#x02013;VP4 and seven non-structural proteins 2A&#x02013;2C, 3A&#x02013;3D by its
proteases 2A and 3C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> VP1, VP2 and VP3
harbor the epitopes for neutralizing antibodies (NAbs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup></p><p>EV-D68 has been rarely detected since its first identification in 1962.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Based on the enterovirus surveillance data, only
36 cases were identified from 1970 to 2005 in the USA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> However, EV-D68 infection in patients with respiratory tract
infections (RTIs) increased markedly in recent years worldwide possibly due to the
viral genome variation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Particularly, EV-D68 infections spread widely in
2014 in the United States causing outbreaks in most states. More than 1000 cases were
reported during the epidemic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> In addition
to respiratory illness, EV-D68 infection is also associated with neurological
complications in the USA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> This has raised
a public health concern. To date, no specific drugs and vaccines specifically
targeting EV-D68 are available.</p><p>The earliest EV-D68 infection in China was identified in 2006.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> More cases were detected in different geographical
locations in subsequent years by different groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> In contrast to the prevalence observed in the United
States, there was no outbreak noted in China. The reason for this observation is
unclear. Besides viral factors, herd immunity, particularly the pre-existing NAbs in
a population, may influence the spread of a virus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> As an imprint of the immunoresponse, NAbs in specific
populations can not only trace the history of infection but also predict the
susceptibility to a certain pathogen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup>
Because EV infections are usually asymptomatic or mild,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> the data obtained from RTI patients seeking medical
services could grossly underestimate the actual incidence and prevalence. To reveal
an accurate epidemiological picture of an emerging virus infection, serological
investigations based on NAb detection in the general population are therefore of
particular importance to assess the prevalence and the transmission potential of
EV-D68 for taking public measures to prevent this emerging epidemic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup></p><p>Circulating EV-D68 strains can be divided into three clades: clades
A&#x02013;C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> Based on phylogenetic
analysis, from August 2006 to August 2011, strains of clade A were predominant
(90.9%) and clade B strains emerged in October 2011 in China.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> In this study, we isolated an EV-D68 strain in
China of clade A and set up microneutralization assays (MNAs) using sera collected
before 2011 to reveal an accurate epidemiological picture of this emerging infection
in Beijing, China.</p></sec><sec><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Sera</title><p>Horse EV-D68 (Fermon, Manassas, VA, USA) antiserum was purchased from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). Pooled horse antisera against
the most frequently isolated echoviruses and coxsackieviruses (National Institute
of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), The Netherlands) were provided by the
World Health Organization (WHO).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup></p><p>Serum specimens were collected from 393 healthy individuals aged 0&#x02013;93 years
seen for routine health check-ups in 2004 and 2009 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table
1</xref>). In addition, serum samples were collected from 169 children
(0.6&#x02013;177 months) with a primary diagnosis of lower RTIs (LRTIs) including
bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia upon admission to the Beijing
Children&#x02019;s Hospital in 2007, 2009 and 2011. Serum samples also were
collected from 374 adults (16&#x02013;59 years) with acute RTIs (369 (98.7%)
patients with upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and 5 (1.3%)
patients with LRTIs) at the time of their admission to the Fever Clinic Department
of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) in Beijing, China (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). As EV-D68 circulates in summer and
autumn,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> adult&#x02019;s sera were all collected from August to
October of the selected years.</p><p>Common respiratory viruses (RVs) including influenza viruses (A, B and C), human
parainfluenza viruses (1&#x02013;4), respiratory syncytial virus, human
coronaviruses (229E, NL63, HKU1 and OC43), metapneumovirus, adenovirus and HRVs
were screened in the respiratory specimens of these patients by multiplex RT-PCR,
single RT-PCR or PCR assays as described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> EVs were amplified 350&#x02013;400&#x02009;nt of the viral

the findings by sequence analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup></p><p>All samples were collected after obtaining informed consent either from the
individuals or from the individual&#x02019;s guardians. This study was approved by
the ethical review committee of the Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy
of Medical Sciences. The sera were separated immediately after collection, stored
at &#x02212;80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and inactivated at 56&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 30&#x02009;min
before use.</p></sec><sec><title>Viruses</title><p>The EV-D68 prototype strain, Fermon (GenBank accession no. AY426531) was purchased from ATCC. We isolated an
EV-D68 strain from the nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) of an EV-D68-positive,
32-month-old male patient with pneumonia. This patient displayed a 2-day long
cough, fever (the highest temperature: 38.2&#x02009;&#x000b0;C), sneezing and runny
nose. The NPAs were first inoculated into a monolayer of H1-HeLa cells (ATCC
CRL-1958). After 1&#x02009;h adsorption at 33&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in a humidified
5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere, the NPAs were removed and the treated H1-HeLa
cells were further incubated at 33&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in DMEM medium supplemented with
2% bovine fetal serum. The cultures were held for five to seven days and
examined periodically for viral cytopathic effects (CPEs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> The negative cultures in the first passage
were passed blindly to new cell cultures and examined for CPE. When CPE appeared,
the isolate was first identified by negative-staining electron microscopy and
characterized by MNAs using horse EV-D68 (Fermon) antiserum and a standard pool of
EV typing antisera (RIVM, The Netherlands), then by western blot analysis using a
specific antibody of VP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> and complete
genome sequencing. The isolated virus was designated as
EV-D68/Beijing/2008/01. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that
EV-D68/Beijing/2008/01 belong to clade A.</p></sec><sec><title>Neutralization test</title><p>MNAs were performed in accordance with the WHO standard procedure for
poliovirus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> Serum sample
dilutions of 1:8 to 1:2048 were assayed, and each dilution was tested in
quadruplicate. Twenty-five microliters of 100 tissue culture infective dose
(TCID<sub>50</sub>) of virus was mixed with 25&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of the appropriate
serum dilution, and then incubated for 1&#x02009;h at 33&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in a
CO<sub>2</sub> incubator to allow the antibodies bind to the virus. After the
incubation period, 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of the serum&#x02013;virus suspension was added
to monolayers of H1-HeLa cells and incubated for 1&#x02009;h at 33&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in
a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator before washing and reincubating with minimal
essential media with 2% FBS. Cell controls (without virus), virus controls
(without serum) and virus back titration were included in each batch. The horse
EV-D68 (Fermon) antiserum was selected as positive control in the MNAs. The NAb
titers were determined at the time when CPE was observed in virus controls under
an inverted microscope and calculated by the Reed&#x02013;Muench
method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The antibody titers for EV-D68 and other EVs are presented as geometric mean titer
(GMT) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI), calculated from
log-transformed titers using <italic>t</italic> distributions. For comparisons of GMTs
between different viruses, age groups and study years, one-way analysis of
variance on log-transformed titers were used if normality and homogeneity of
variance were assumed for log-transformed data; otherwise a nonparametric
Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test would be used. <italic>P</italic>-values &#x0003c;0.05 were
considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were conducted
using R version 2.15.3</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>EV-D68 isolation</title><p>We visualized typical picornavirus-like CPE after 3 days of the second passage of
the inoculation on H1-HeLa cells. The cells appeared rounding and sloughing under
a light microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> The cell culture supernatants contained
spherical particles with a diameter of about 30&#x02009;nm under negative-staining
electron microscopy.</p><p>We then examined the cross-reaction between the isolate and the reference EV
antisera. The MNAs showed that the isolate could not be neutralized by any of the
pooled EV typing antisera (RVIM, The Netherlands) but could only be neutralized by
EV-D68 (Fermon) antiserum (neutralizing titer: 64). Western blot analysis of the
pellets using antibodies against VP1 of EV-D68 and EV-A71 showed that only the
anti-EV-D68 antibody hybridized with inoculated cells. These findings indicate
that clinical strain of EV-D68 was isolated successfully. We designated the strain
as EV-D68/Beijing/2008/01.</p><p>Based on the complete genome sequence, the viral genome is 7348&#x02009;nt in
length (GenBank accession no. KF726085) with
88.2% identity to that of the Fermon strain (7367&#x02009;nt; GenBank
accession no. AY426531), with a 24&#x02009;nt
deletion at nt positions 681&#x02013;704 and an additional 3&#x02009;nt deletion at
positions 2806&#x02013;2808. The sequence had a 94.5% identity with that of
NYC403 (7341&#x02009;nt; GenBank accession no. JX101846), the representative strain of clade A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> This result suggests that
EV-D68/Beijing/2008/01 is a strain of clade A.</p></sec><sec><title>NAbs against EV-D68/Beijing/2008/01</title><p>As EV-D68 is an emerging pathogen, there are no commercial antibodies available
against currently circulating strains. So we used antiserum against Fermon strain
as positive control. We also performed MNAs using sera which had high neutralizing
titer of NAbs against EV-D68/Beijing/2008/01. These sera also could
neutralize Fermon strain but had low titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure
2A</xref>).</p><p>To further demonstrate whether NAbs could protect people from EV-D68 infection, we
compared the NAb levels between the acute phase sera from adults who were EV-D68
positive, other EV-positive but EV-D68-negative, HRV-positive or respiratory
viruses-negative as detected by RT-PCR. We found that the GMT of EV-D68-positive
adults was 21 (95% CI, 9&#x02013;49), which was significantly lower than that
of the group of other EV-positives (82) (95% CI, 59&#x02013;113),
HRV-positives (65) (95% CI, 46&#x02013;92), and respiratory virus-negatives
(60) (95% CI, 43&#x02013;84; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This
result indicates that NAbs against EV-D68 could protect people from EV-D68
infection. Although other EVs and HRVs belong to the same genus as EV-D68, these
results suggest that high titer anti-EV-D68 NAbs do not protect people from other
EVs or rhinovirus infections.</p></sec><sec><title>NAbs against EV-D68 in 2004 and 2009</title><p>Because most EV-D68 infections in China were detected in our previous study in
2006,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> we tested sera collected
from healthy individuals prior to and after 2006 (2004 and 2009, respectively) for
NAb detection. We divided the samples into four age groups: preschoolers (&#x02264;5
years); school-aged children (6&#x02013;15 years); adults (16&#x02013;59 years);
elderly (&#x02265;60 years). Our data indicate that the GMTs of EV-D68 NAbs increased
with age, peaking at adults, but declined in the elderly group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The GMTs of NAb were generally low in 2004, but were
significantly higher in 2009 in each age group.</p><p>To characterize the immune level precisely, we defined five NAbs titer ranges: no
NAbs (&#x0003c;8), low level (8&#x02013;64), moderate level (65&#x02013;128), high level
(129&#x02013;512) and very high level (&#x0003e;512). We found that while low-level NAbs
dominated in all age groups in 2004 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>),
moderate- and high-level NAbs dominated in all age groups in 2009 except in
preschoolers. These results suggest an increasing spread of EV-D68 after 2004,
which led to the boost of the EV-D68 NAb titer.</p></sec><sec><title>Trend of EV-D68 NAbs from 2007 to 2011</title><p>As anti-EV-D68 NAbs in 2009 were significantly higher than those in 2004, we then
traced the temporal dynamics of NAbs in the Chinese population in recent years. As
we could only get samples from healthy individuals in 2004 and 2009 and the NAbs
in RTI patients could block EV-D68 replication, we used sera collected from
RV-negative RTI patients as surrogates to perform MNAs. Children were divided into
three age groups: 0.5&#x02013;3 years, 3.1&#x02013;6 years and 6.1&#x02013;15 years. Our
results showed that in each year, just like in healthy individuals, the GMTs of
EV-D68 NAbs in RTI patients also increased with age. From 2007 to 2011, the NAbs
increased over time in adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting
that EV-D68 circulated widely in China after 2006 even though only a limited
number of EV-D68-positive patients were detected. From 2007 to 2011, we detected
respiratory specimens from 3030 children with a primary diagnosis of LRTIs and
7697 adults with acute RTIs, only 4 children (1&#x02013;32 months) and five adults
(29&#x02013;34 years) were EV-D68-positive.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Compared with the prototype Fermon strain, the clinical isolates had sequence
diversities in the residues flanking the putative antigenic sites, which resulted in
differences in neutralization titers for the same antiserum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> Therefore, clinical isolates other than Fermon should be
used to evaluate the seroprevalence to EV-D68 in the general population. In this
study, we isolated virus from clinical samples and identified it using EV-D68
(Fermon) antiserum and pooled EV typing antisera (RVIM, The Netherlands).
Phylogenetic and complete genome analysis demonstrated that this isolate belonged to
clade A, which was the main clade circulating in China before 2011. We hence used
this isolate to test seroprevalence to EV-D68 in China before 2011.</p><p>Our seroprevalence data show that the anti-EV-D68 NAb level was generally low in the
Chinese population in 2004. Indeed, the GMT in adults (40) (95% CI,
29&#x02013;56) was similar to that in the Finnish population in 2002 (Fermon strain,
44.5).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> Although a different strain
of EV-D68 was used in the Finnish study compared to our study, the low levels of
EV-D68 NAbs in the general population in 2004 and the emerged multiple clades of the
virus could explain why EV-D68 spread worldwide rapidly in recent years.</p><p>The apparent rise in the titer of NAbs against EV-D68 from 2007 to 2011 in adults
indicates that NAbs were boosted by infections of EV-D68. Yet limited EV-D68-positive
cases were detected in RTI adults in China during this period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> As these
specimens were all collected from patients who were seeking medical service at
hospitals, the low detection rate of EV-D68 in the general population suggests that
EV-D68 mainly causes mild or asymptomatic infections in adults, which do not
necessitate a visit to a doctor.</p><p>The titer of NAbs in children increased with age. The GMTs were higher in the group
of 6.1&#x02013;15 years than in the group of 0.5&#x02013;6 years. But even in the group
of 6.1&#x02013;15 years, the GMT (45; 95% CI, 34&#x02013;59) still had no
statistic difference compared to the group of EV-D68-positive adults (21; 95%
CI, 9&#x02013;49). In contrast to the increase year by year in adults, we did not find
a significant increase year by year in children. Even in the group of 6&#x02013;15
years, the GMT in 2011 had no statistic difference compared to that in 2007 or 2009.
The reason for the low titer of NAbs in children is not clear. This phenomenon is
noteworthy for the designer of vaccine.</p><p>In contrast to the large-scale outbreak of EV-D68 that occurred in 2014 in the USA,
only very few EV-D68 cases were reported in China in that year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> The high titers of NAbs existing in the Chinese
population might contribute to the low prevalence in China. According to our data,
the NAbs indeed could block the EV-D68 replication. Seroprevalence of NAbs against
EV-D68 increased rapidly to very high level in Chinese population. However, this
hypothesis warrants further investigations to compare the seroprevalence in different
countries at the same time points.</p><p>In our study, only acute phase sera were collected from EV-D68-positive patients and
no paired convalescent sera were available to demonstrate seroconversion after
infection. We thus compared only the NAbs in acute phase patients who were positive
or negative for EV-D68. Nevertheless, the significant difference between these two
groups suggests that high titers of NAbs may protect people from EV-D68
infection.</p><p>In conclusion, our data indicate that this emerging virus has spread rapidly in China
in recent years, resulting in increased levels of NAbs in the general population,
although only limited cases were reported.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Lan Chen, Jianxing Yu (Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of
