Herein we describe an innovative vaccinia virus (VACV)-derived vaccine platform technology termed Sementis Copenhagen Vector (SCV), which was rendered multiplication-defective by targeted deletion of the essential viral assembly gene <italic>D13L</italic>. A SCV cell substrate line was developed for SCV vaccine production by engineering CHO cells to express D13 and the VACV host-range factor CP77, because CHO cells are routinely used for manufacture of biologics. To illustrate the utility of the platform technology, a SCV vaccine against chikungunya virus (SCV-CHIK) was developed and shown to be multiplication-defective in a range of human cell lines and in immunocompromised mice. A single vaccination of mice with SCV-CHIK induced antibody responses specific for chikungunya virus (CHIKV) that were similar to those raised following vaccination with a replication-competent VACV-CHIK and able to neutralize CHIKV. Vaccination also provided protection against CHIKV challenge, preventing both viremia and arthritis. Moreover, SCV retained capacity as an effective mouse smallpox vaccine. In summary, SCV represents a new and safe vaccine platform technology that can be manufactured in modified CHO cells, with pre-clinical evaluation illustrating utility for CHIKV vaccine design and construction.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical Abstract</title><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" id="abs0020"><p>Eldi et&#x000a0;al. report the development of the Sementis Copenhagen Vector technology, a multiplication-defective poxvirus-derived vaccine platform with a complementing CHO-based cell substrate line designed for large-scale vaccine stock manufacture.

The largest outbreak of CHIKV ever recorded began in 2004, with this mosquito-borne virus initially spreading from Africa to Asia (with small outbreaks in Europe). In 2013, the epidemic reached the Americas and is spreading through South America, where millions of cases have been reported.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The primary disease manifestation of CHIKV is acute and chronic polyarthritis or polyarthralgia,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> with a number of severe disease manifestations recognized that result in hospitalization rates of 2.3%&#x02013;13% and mortality rates of 0.01%&#x02013;0.1%.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Herein we show that a SCV vaccine expressing the structural polyprotein cassette (C-E3-E2-6K-E1) of the R&#x000e9;union Island isolate (LR2006 OPY1) of CHIKV (a SCV vaccine against CHIKV [SCV-CHIK]) provided, after a single vaccination, robust and durable neutralizing antibody responses and complete protection against both CHIKV and poxvirus (ectromelia virus [ECTV]) challenge. SCV-CHIK was unable to produce infectious viral progeny either in a panel of human cell lines or in immunocompromised mice. This study thus demonstrates the utility and effectiveness of the new SCV vaccine platform and illustrates its application to CHIKV vaccine design and construction.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Design Rationale for the SCV Vaccine Technology</title><p>The Copenhagen strain of VACV, the parental virus used for the development of the SCV vaccine platform technology, was originally used as a smallpox vaccine in Denmark and the Netherlands and is replication-competent<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). After entry, the viral genome is amplified (to &#x0223c;10,000 copies<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and late gene expression is followed by virion assembly, maturation, and egress of VACV progeny (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). Generation of infectious VACV progeny depends on the assembly protein D13, which provides a mechanical scaffold to facilitate cytoplasmic assembly of the developing virions (reviewed in Liu et&#x000a0;al.<sup>19</sup>). The SCV vaccine platform incorporates a targeted deletion of the <italic>D13L</italic> gene in VACV to prevent viral assembly, thereby rendering SCV unable to generate infectious progeny in normally permissive cell lines. However, amplification of the SCV genome is retained (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B). CHO cells were engineered to constitutively express D13 and the cowpox virus host-range protein CP77. Without CP77, SCV DNA processing is blocked in CHO cells by host proteins.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Expression of D13 and CP77 in the SCS line thus permits production of SCV vaccines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C). Upon vaccination of mice or humans, a SCV vaccine (for example, SCV-CHIK) enters a host cell and, due to the absence of D13, is unable to generate viral progeny. SCV genome amplification results in the accumulation of a large number of genome copies, from which vaccine antigens (in this case, CHIKV structural proteins) are produced via late gene expression to instigate an effective immune response (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>D). The SCV vaccine technology thus provides for a vaccinia-based vaccine vector platform that, in vaccine recipients, is unable to produce progeny or infectious progeny (hereafter referred to as multiplication-defective) and can be manufactured in a CHO-based cell substrate line.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Rationale for the SCV Vaccine Platform Technology</p><p>(A) VACV multiplication in the cytoplasm of host cells is able to produce infectious viral progeny as VACV encodes the essential assembly protein D13.

(C) In <italic>trans</italic> provision of D13 in the CHO-based SCS line rescues viral assembly, allowing production of progeny for vaccine manufacture. Expression of the host-range protein CP77 allows SCV (or VACV) multiplication in CHO cells. (D) After delivery of SCV-CHIK to a vaccine recipient, the genome of SCV-CHIK is amplified and late gene expression drives production of the CHIKV structural proteins (vaccine antigen). In the absence of D13 protein, no SCV-CHIK viral progeny are generated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Construction of SCV-CHIK</title><p>SCV-CHIK was constructed sequentially.

Attenuation of the SCV vaccine was demonstrated in&#x000a0;vitro in several human cell lines, including human lung and skin epithelial cell lines that are VACV permissive and are representative of sites of active virus multiplication in human infections. In addition, we have demonstrated that SCV can be safely administered to immunocompromised SCID mice, confirming attenuation in&#x000a0;vivo.

Furthermore, most diploid and continuous cell lines used in manufacturing the vaccine have a finite culture life span and are growth anchorage dependent, with logistical and cost implications for scaled production.

Because CHO is non-permissive to VACV infection, positive selection for D13L-deleted virus was achieved by replacing the D13L ORF with an expression cassette coding for the cowpox virus CHO host-range protein CP77. A homologous recombination plasmid was constructed that consisted of a CP77 expression cassette and a dsRed fluorescent protein expression cassette flanked by left and right recombination arms that were homologous to sequences flanking the D13L ORF within VACV-CHIK. The dsRed expression cassette was added, because VACV-expressing CP77 does not form lytic plaques in CHO; therefore, infection was monitored by the presence of red fluorescence. To help in removal of the CP77 and dsRed expression cassettes that had replaced the D13L ORF, a repeat sequence of the left homologous recombination arm was placed downstream of the CP77 and dsRed expression cassettes but upstream of the right homologous recombination arm within the homologous recombination plasmid. Homologous recombination was performed by transfecting the D13L-deleting homologous recombination plasmid into CHO-<italic>D13L</italic> previously infected with VACV-CHIK at an MOI of 0.01 PFU/cell.

This single-cell sorting process was repeated five times to eliminated trace contamination with the original VACV-CHIK and produce clonal SCV-CHIK. A number of clonally purified SCV-CHIK were amplified in CHO-D13L cells and then tested by PCR analysis for the presence of contaminating VACV-CHIK and to confirm D13L replacement by the CP77 and dsRed expression cassettes. The best clone was then amplified in the SCS line (expressing both CP77 and D13 proteins) to encourage intramolecular recombination between the left homologous recombination sequence and the repeat sequence, because the dependence of the viral expression of CP77 is no longer required, resulting in the deletion of the CP77 and dsRed expression cassettes from SCV-CHIK.
