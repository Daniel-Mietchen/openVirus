    "Mitigation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was assessed using two feed additives (0.5% inclusion of a benzoic acid [BA] product and 0.02% inclusion of an essential oil [EO] product; DSM Nutritional Products Inc., Parsippany, NJ), and combination of both products (0.5% BA and 0.02% EO) in spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP) and a swine gestation diet (FEED) as determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and bioassay. Viral RNA quantification was performed at 7 sampling days post-laboratory inoculation (d 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 42) and infectivity was assessed via bioassay with 10-d-old pigs. There was a tendency for treatment × feed matrix × day interaction (P = 0.094), in which the cycle threshold (Ct) value increased over time in FEED when treated with both feed additives, whereas there was no increase over time observed in SDPP treated with both feed additives. There was a feed matrix × day interaction (P < 0.001) in which Ct increased over time in FEED, whereas very little increase over time was observed in SDPP. A tendency for a treatment × feed matrix effect (P = 0.085) was observed where FEED treated with the combination of EO and BA had a greater (P < 0.05) PEDV Ct value than other FEED treatments, and all SDPP treatments had the lower PEDV Ct values compared to FEED treatments (P < 0.05). Overall, the combination of both feed additives was most effective at reducing the quantity of genetic material as detected by qRT-PCR (P < 0.001) compared to either additive alone or no feed additive. Virus shedding was observed in the d 7 postinoculation SDPP treatment that was treated with both feed additives, as well as d 0 untreated FEED and d 0 FEED treated with both feed additives. No other treatment bioassay room had detectible RNA shed and detected in fecal swabs or cecal contents. In summary, the combination of EO and BA enhanced the degradation of PEDV RNA in feed but had little impact on RNA degradation in SDPP. Both untreated feed and feed treated with the combination of EO and BA resulted in infection at d 0 post-laboratory inoculation; however, neither set of samples was infective at d 1 postinoculation. In addition, SDPP harbored greater levels of quantifiable RNA for a longer duration of time compared to FEED, and these viral particles remained viable for a longer duration of time indicating differences in viral stability exist between different feed matrices."
