WHO has set the strategic objective to interrupt spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. An outbreak in Bavaria, Germany, starting at the end of January, 2020, provided the opportunity to study transmission events, incubation period, and secondary attack rates.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A case was defined as a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR. Case interviews were done to describe timing of onset and nature of symptoms and to identify and classify contacts as high risk (had cumulative face-to-face contact with a confirmed case for &#x02265;15 min, direct contact with secretions or body fluids of a patient with confirmed COVID-19, or, in the case of health-care workers, had worked within 2 m of a patient with confirmed COVID-19 without personal protective equipment) or low risk (all other contacts). High-risk contacts were ordered to stay at home in quarantine for 14 days and were actively followed up and monitored for symptoms, and low-risk contacts were tested upon self-reporting of symptoms. We defined fever and cough as specific symptoms, and defined a prodromal phase as the presence of non-specific symptoms for at least 1 day before the onset of specific symptoms. Whole genome sequencing was used to confirm epidemiological links and clarify transmission events where contact histories were ambiguous; integration with epidemiological data enabled precise reconstruction of exposure events and incubation periods. Secondary attack rates were calculated as the number of cases divided by the number of contacts, using Fisher's exact test for the 95% CIs.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Patient 0 was a Chinese resident who visited Germany for professional reasons. 16 subsequent cases, often with mild and non-specific symptoms, emerged in four transmission generations. Signature mutations in the viral genome occurred upon foundation of generation 2, as well as in one case pertaining to generation 4. The median incubation period was 4&#x000b7;0 days (IQR 2&#x000b7;3&#x02013;4&#x000b7;3) and the median serial interval was 4&#x000b7;0 days (3&#x000b7;0&#x02013;5&#x000b7;0). Transmission events were likely to have occurred presymptomatically for one case (possibly five more), at the day of symptom onset for four cases (possibly five more), and the remainder after the day of symptom onset or unknown. One or two cases resulted from contact with a case during the prodromal phase. Secondary attack rates were 75&#x000b7;0% (95% CI 19&#x000b7;0&#x02013;99&#x000b7;0; three of four people) among members of a household cluster in common isolation, 10&#x000b7;0% (1&#x000b7;2&#x02013;32&#x000b7;0; two of 20) among household contacts only together until isolation of the patient, and 5&#x000b7;1% (2&#x000b7;6&#x02013;8&#x000b7;9; 11 of 217) among non-household, high-risk contacts.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Although patients in our study presented with predominately mild, non-specific symptoms, infectiousness before or on the day of symptom onset was substantial. Additionally, the incubation period was often very short and false-negative tests occurred. These results suggest that although the outbreak was controlled, successful long-term and global containment of COVID-19 could be difficult to achieve.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>All authors are employed and all expenses covered by governmental, federal state, or other publicly funded institutions.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p id="para10">On Dec 31, 2019, Chinese officials reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, China.

<bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
</p><p id="para50">We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) for articles published until March 2, 2020, using the key words &#x0201c;novel coronavirus&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;2019-nCoV&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;COVID-19&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;SARS-CoV-2&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;transmission&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;incubation period&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;serial interval&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;Europe&#x0201d;. Moreover, we screened preprint servers such as medrxiv and SSRN for relevant articles and consulted the webpages of organisations such as WHO, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and the Robert Koch Institute. No reports describing events of human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within Europe other than the Bavarian outbreak were identified.</p><p id="para60">
<bold>Added value of this study</bold>
</p><p id="para70">Originating from a single travel-associated primary case from China, we describe the first reported cluster of COVID-19 cases with human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within Europe and outside of Asia. The outbreak, which resulted in 16 subsequent cases, comprised four generations of virus transmission in only 16 days, corresponding to a median incubation period and serial interval of 4 days. By testing all people who had high-risk contact with confirmed patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (and people with low-risk contact upon onset of symptoms), we were additionally able to detect and follow up patients with only very mild clinical symptoms of COVID-19 that would have probably remained undetected otherwise. By combining methods of epidemiology and whole genome sequencing, we were able to reconstruct and describe transmission events precisely. Virus transmission before or on the day of symptom onset or during a prodromal phase was substantial in this outbreak. Moreover, we were able to estimate attack rates according to different scenarios of contact intensity. As of May 2, 2020, no further cases associated with the outbreak were detected, suggesting that applied containment measures have worked.</p><p id="para80">
<bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
</p><p id="para90">In the beginning of an epidemic caused by a newly discovered virus, the assessment of key epidemiological parameters such as attack rates, incubation period, and serial interval is important, as it provides essential information for estimating the potential size of the epidemic and developing containment measures. Detailed reports on transmission events of SARS-CoV-2, especially in a well described setting, could improve the understanding of transmissibility and further spread of the virus.</p></boxed-text>
</p><p id="para100">On Jan 27, 2020, the Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority, Germany, was informed of the first human case of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in a German national working for a company in the greater Munich area. The primary case in this satellite outbreak of COVID-19 is a person from Shanghai, China, who had been in contact with their parents from Wuhan before visiting Germany for a business meeting in the aforementioned company. Between Jan 27 and Feb 11, 16 cases of COVID-19 were identified in this cluster.</p><p id="para110">Management and investigation of the outbreak was immediately initiated on Jan 27 to identify further cases and contacts and to understand transmission events and parameters that are relevant for successful containment, such as incubation period and secondary attack rates.</p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="cesec30"><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="para120">This outbreak investigation was done in Bavaria, Germany, as a collaboration of state (Bavarian Health and Food Safety Autority) and national level (Robert Koch Institute) public health authorities and four public health laboratories. It included all people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and contacts (ie, people who had contact with a person with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection) linked to patient 0 of the Bavarian cluster.</p><p id="para130">The outbreak investigation was conducted as part of the authoritative, official tasks of the county health departments as well as the state health department of the Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority, supported by the Robert Koch Institute. As conducted in response to a public health emergency, this study was exempt from institutional review board approval.</p></sec><sec id="cesec40"><title>Contact classification and management</title><p id="para140">On Jan 27, 2020, all employees of the affected company were informed about the potential risk of COVID-19 infection. International public health authorities were informed via the Early Warning and Response System or IHR National Focal points. Employees were actively queried for any contact with the first two known cases. New cases were asked about professional and private contacts. Contacts were classified as high risk if they had cumulative face-to-face contact with a patient with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection for at least 15 min, had direct contact with secretions or body fluids of a patient with confirmed COVID-19, or, in the case of health-care workers, had worked within 2 m of a patient with confirmed COVID-19 without personal protective equipment. All other contacts were classified as low-risk contacts.</p><p id="para150">High-risk contacts were ordered to stay in home quarantine for 14 days after the last known contact event with a confirmed case. Their health status was monitored daily, usually by self-report. Laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 was done at the beginning and end of home quarantine periods, irrespective of the presence of symptoms. If a contact tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, they were immediately hospitalised and isolated. Low-risk contacts were asked to self-monitor their health status and report any symptoms. In both high-risk and low-risk contacts, further laboratory testing was triggered upon onset of any symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Case interviews</title><p id="para160">Case interviews were done in a two-stage procedure. In the first stage, patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or their household members were interviewed to determine date of symptom onset, links between cases, contact events during the incubation period, and contact classification. In a second stage, in-depth interviews with ten patients with COVID-19 were done by teams of two professionals (one physician and one epidemiologist; SB, KP, NM, NZ, and TSB) using a semi-structured questionnaire. Additional topics included characteristics of symptoms and details on type, setting, and environment of contact with other patients and with high-risk contacts. The in-depth interview with the primary case from Shanghai, China, was done twice (Jan 30 and 31, 2020) and supported by a Chinese native speaker (CW). We defined fever or cough as specific symptoms; a prodromal phase (with non-specific symptoms) was defined as presence of symptoms other than fever and cough for at least 1 day before the onset of specific symptoms. The day of symptom onset was defined as the day when any symptom (specific or non-specific) occurred, and thus could coincide with the start of the prodromal phase. The potential infectious period was defined as the period 2 days before onset of any kind of symptoms (specific or non-specific) until 14 days later.</p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>Laboratory testing</title><p id="para170">Laboratory testing involved two swabs (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal, pooled) that were stored in viral transport medium and cooled.

A case&#x02013;contact pair is the connection between a given contact and a potentially infectious case with contact time of at least 15 min; the number of case&#x02013;contact pairs is higher than the number of contacts because a single contact person could have had contact with more than one case. To calculate secondary attack rates, we considered four distinct groups: (1) a household cluster where one household member had COVID-19 and all household members were quarantined together in one hospital room; (2) any other household contacts (ie, anyone sharing living space with a patient with COVID-19); (3) non-household high-risk contacts; (4) known low-risk contacts. Secondary attack rates were calculated as number of cases divided by number of contacts or case&#x02013;contact pairs, using Fisher's exact test for the 95% CIs.</p></sec><sec id="cesec80"><title>Role of the funding source</title><p id="para190">The sponsors of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.

Ten patients (patients 1&#x02013;5, 7, 8, 10, 13, and 16) as well as the primary case (patient 0) are employees of the company. A Chinese colleague (patient 13) of patient 0 accompanied them in multiple activities while in Germany. Patient 13 travelled back to China with patient 0, developed symptoms on Jan 27, and tested SARS-CoV-2 positive a few days later.</p><p id="para230">Patient 1 was an employee who attended a 1-h business meeting with patient 0 and two other colleagues on Jan 20, 2020. The meeting took place in a small room (approximately 12 m<sup>2</sup>); patient 1 sat next to patient 0, and the two other colleagues sat at the opposite side of the table. The two other colleagues did not test positive during follow-up. Patient 1 had another brief contact event with patient 0 on Jan 21, and developed a sore throat on Jan 23 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure</xref>). Over the following weekend (Jan 25&#x02013;26), they developed cold-like symptoms with self-measured fever up to 39&#x000b0;C and mild productive cough. On Jan 27, patient 1 felt well enough to go to work. There, patient 1 learned about patient 0's infection and was tested positive on the same day.</p><p id="para240">Patient 2 was not aware of any direct person-to-person contact with patient 0; however, virus sequence analysis supports the assumption that patient 0 transmitted the virus to patient 2. Patient 3 also did not have direct contact with patient 0; however, patient 3 had contact with patient 1 on Jan 24 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure</xref>), when both worked simultaneously on the same computer for a short period of time. Thus, transmission from patient 1 to patient 3 most likely took place the day after symptom onset (Jan 23). On Jan 25, the day of symptom onset of patient 3, patient 3 had a private meeting with patient 12, sitting next to him for approximately 90 min. Afterwards, they spent the rest of the evening together at patient 3's home, joined by patient 3's partner, who did not test positive during follow-up. Patient 12 departed for vacation to Spain 3 days later (Jan 28). After Spanish authorities were informed, patient 12 was isolated in hospital on Jan 30 and diagnosed with COVID-19.</p><p id="para250">Patient 4 had contact with patient 0 on Jan 20, 21, and 22, and reported chills on Jan 24. They had subsequent mild symptoms with slight malaise and slight nose and sinus congestion and were isolated on Jan 28. Patient 5 did not meet patient 0 but did meet patient 4 on Jan 22. Their only encounter was a canteen visit, sitting back to back, when patient 5 turned to patient 4 to borrow the salt shaker from their table.

Patient 11 became symptomatic first; however, her first two tests were negative. Patient 9 became symptomatic last, with the virus showing an additional C22323T substitution. This same mutation was found as a minority virus population of approximately 4% reads also in the sputum of patient 11, but in none of the other household members. Because patient 11 had become symptomatic 4 days before patient 9, patient 11 infected patient 9.</p><p id="para270">Patient 7 met patient 5 for a 1&#x000b7;5-h meeting with a distance of approximately 1&#x000b7;5 m on Jan 24, the day of symptom onset in patient 5.

Patients 8 and 5 had regular daily meetings at work, including on Jan 22, 23, and 24. Because the onset of symptoms for patient 5 was on Jan 24, transmission from patient 5 to patient 8 could therefore be presymptomatic or on the day of symptom onset. Patients 8 and 10 were identified as cases when a large number of employees, including both high-risk and low-risk contacts, were invited to be sampled at the company during the 3 days following the initial discovery of the cluster (Jan 29&#x02013;31). Retrospectively, during detailed interviews, both patients recalled mild non-specific symptoms before testing, but no symptoms on the day of testing.</p><p id="para280">Patient 14 was a household member of patient 7 and both spent multiple days together after patient 7 was sent to home quarantine. Patient 15 is a household member of patient 2 and was asymptomatic. Patients 15 and 16 initially tested negative between Jan 29 and 31 at the company and tested positive when the test was repeated at the end of the follow-up period, thus 12&#x02013;14 days after the last exposure to a case. Retrospectively, patient 16 had experienced a short period of very mild rhinorrhoea from Feb 4 and had not perceived this as a relevant symptom. Two possible transmission options could have occurred for patient 16, through patients 7 and 8, both on Jan 28. Patient 16 participated in the same meeting in which patient 10 was probably infected by patient 7. Patient 16 had also met patient 8 on the same day in a meeting, at a distance greater than 1 m; notably, Jan 28 was also the day of patient 8's symptom onset. Transmission history cannot be resolved because viral sequences in patients 7, 8, 10, and 16 are identical (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>).</p><p id="para290">Notification via IHR focal points resulted in identification of patient 12 by Spanish authorities. Extensive contact tracing involved the international flights from Munich to Shanghai (patient 0 on Jan 22, 2020) and from Munich to Tenerife (patient 12 on Jan 28, 2020). As of May 2, no further cases have been identified among flight passengers or other (personal) contacts.</p><p id="para300">All cases except for patient 15 were symptomatic, even if the symptoms were mostly mild (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). However, no transmission was documented from asymptomatic patient 15 to the patient's contacts until the end of the observation period (beginning of March, 2020). Presymptomatic transmission was the only possible explanation for the transmission from patient 4 to patient 5. It was also a possibility in the transmission from patient 5 to patient 8 and could not be ruled out for the household clusters (ie, transmission from patient 5 to patients 11 and 6 and transmission from patient 11 to patient 9) or transmission from patient 7 to patient 14. Patients 4 and 5 had symptom onset on the same day, which is only plausible if patient 4 shed virus 2 days before symptom onset and patient 5 had a 2-day incubation period. Four transmission events occurred certainly on the day of symptom onset (from patient 3 to patient 12, from patient 5 to patient 7, from patient 7 to patient 10, and from patient 7 or 8 to patient 16) and for one transmission event (patient 5 to patient 8), the only other possibility is presymptomatic transmission (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure</xref>). Five patients were possibly infected when they had contact with their source case at the day of the source case's symptom onset (patients 5 to 8, 5 to 11, 5 to 6, 11 to 9, and 7 to 14; table). Transmission during the prodromal phase of the illness occurred from patient 0 to patients 1, 2, and 4, as well as from patient 3 to patient 12. The incubation period ranged from 1 to 7 days. When using the most likely duration of the incubation periods or, in case of two equally likely durations, the mean duration, the median incubation period was 4&#x000b7;0 days (IQR 2&#x000b7;3&#x02013;4&#x000b7;3). The median serial interval was also 4&#x000b7;0 days (IQR 3&#x000b7;0&#x02013;5&#x000b7;0).</p><p id="para310">After the infection of patient 0 was confirmed, and after identification of every new case, high-risk contacts were identified and put under home quarantine. By Feb 19, 2020, 241 high-risk contacts had been identified: four household contacts of patient 5 who were isolated together with the patient in a single hospital room, 20 household contacts of other cases, and 217 close, non-household contacts (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>
). Of the family isolated in one room, three (75%) members subsequently became cases, resulting in a secondary attack rate of 75&#x000b7;0% (95% CI 19&#x000b7;0&#x02013;99&#x000b7;0; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). Among 20 household contacts of other patients who lived with the patients until they were isolated in hospital, two further cases were identified, resulting in a secondary attack rate of 10&#x000b7;0% (1&#x000b7;2&#x02013;32&#x000b7;0). Because these 20 household contacts had 80 contact days (mean 4 days), the secondary attack rate can also be expressed as one infection per 40 household contact days. Among 217 further high-risk contacts, 11 transmissions occurred, leading to a secondary attack rate of 5&#x000b7;1% (2&#x000b7;6&#x02013;8&#x000b7;9). No cases occurred among the 108 identified low-risk contacts (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>).<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Secondary attack rates among high-risk and low-risk contacts in the Bavarian COVID-19 outbreak in January&#x02013;February, 2020</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th/><th align="left"><bold>Number of contacts</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Number of cases originating from these contacts</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Secondary attack rate (95% CI)</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="5" align="left"><bold>High risk</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" align="left">Household contacts</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Shared isolation in a hospital room</td><td align="left">4</td><td align="left">3</td><td align="left">75&#x000b7;0% (19&#x000b7;0&#x02013;99&#x000b7;0)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Together until isolation of case</td><td align="left">20</td><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">10&#x000b7;0% (1&#x000b7;2&#x02013;32&#x000b7;0)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Other close unprotected contact</td><td align="left">217</td><td align="left">11</td><td align="left">5&#x000b7;1% (2&#x000b7;6&#x02013;8&#x000b7;9)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Case&#x02013;contact pairs<xref rid="tbl3fn1" ref-type="table-fn">*</xref></td><td align="left">249</td><td align="left">11</td><td align="left">4&#x000b7;4% (2&#x000b7;2&#x02013;7&#x000b7;8)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" align="left"><bold>Low risk</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Distant unprotected contact</td><td align="left">108</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">0&#x000b7;0% (0&#x000b7;0&#x02013;3&#x000b7;4)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tbl3fn1"><label>*</label><p id="cenpara40">A case&#x02013;contact pair is the connection between a given contact person and a potentially infectious case with contact time of at least 15 min.

Due to the particular setting centred around a business company with encounters tractable through electronic calendars, the timing and setting of most contact events were well defined. The sensitising and close monitoring of people involved might have triggered sensitive reporting of prodromal symptoms. This might explain a rather short median incubation period of 4&#x000b7;0 days in our study, which is substantially shorter than the 5&#x000b7;2 days calculated from data of the first 425 confirmed cases in China<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> but similar to the findings of Guan and colleagues.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> For comparison, the incubation period for SARS was 6&#x000b7;4 days, with a range of 1&#x02013;14 days.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>
</p><p id="para340">The short incubation period combined with a median serial interval of the same length correspond to transmission early in the course of disease, or even before disease onset, which is corroborated by studies of viral shedding in the same patients.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> High-level replication with frequent virus isolation from the pharynx stands by contrast with the SARS coronavirus&#x02014;genetically similar to SARS-CoV-2&#x02014;that was shed at lower concentrations from the upper respiratory tract and was effectively transmitted roughly a week after symptom onset.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> This delayed shedding in SARS caused substantial problems with the sensitivity of RT-PCR based on upper respiratory tract swabs. In our study, two tests from patient 11 came back negative although the patient had already developed symptoms, suggesting that these results were false negative. Nevertheless, it is evident from our study that RT-PCR on throat swabs can discover asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic people who shed the virus.</p><p id="para350">The present investigation enables us to determine secondary attack rates based on closely monitored high-risk contacts. The secondary attack rate thereby decreases with the intensity of contact: among members of the cohorted household, the secondary attack rate was 75%, but decreased to 10% among household contacts that were only together until isolation of the case. Although the experience with the cohorted family is based on a single observation, it shows the high risk of close household contacts&#x02014;ie, sharing a room&#x02014;of a case in home isolation and calls for strong measures within households to prevent transmission, particularly if susceptible people are present. Among 217 non-household high-risk contacts that were cumulatively followed up because of direct contact with a confirmed case, 11 were infected. The resulting secondary attack rate of 5% seems low, indicating little spread in this cluster. However, more effective spread of the virus might have been prevented by the proactive quarantine of high-risk contacts later identified as cases while still being presymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, as well as the proactive closure of the affected company. Transmission originating from people with more distinct respiratory symptoms might have resulted in a higher number of secondary cases.</p><p id="para360">Although two patients developed signs of pneumonia later in the course of disease, all others had a light course of disease and all patients recovered fully.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> However, it should be taken into account that the outbreak occurred in a population of working-age, generally healthy individuals. The overall clinical picture might have been different in a population including older individuals, or those with underlying chronic diseases. Another limitation of our study is that, naturally, not all infectious encounters could be reconstructed. Because the company held larger business and social events during the exposure period, it is possible that an infectious case might have met a successor case so briefly that neither of the two remembered the encounter. Some transmission events were nevertheless confirmed by viral sequencing and population analysis. The contact investigation and interviews followed a general hypothesis of direct human-to-human transmission, and we believe that the concurring epidemiological and genetic results in reconstructing the transmission network support this assumption.</p><p id="para370">In conclusion, while COVID-19 cases presented partially with mild, non-specific symptoms in the Bavarian outbreak studied here, we found that infectiousness before symptom onset, on the day of symptom onset, and during mild prodromal symptoms was substantial and poses a huge challenge on the implementation of public health measures. Additionally, the incubation period was often very short and false negative tests can occur. Thus, although the outbreak was controlled and therefore might have granted valuable time before more intense transmission occurred in Germany, successful long-term and global containment of COVID-19 could be difficult to achieve.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"
