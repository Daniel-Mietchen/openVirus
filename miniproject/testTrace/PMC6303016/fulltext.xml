An Outbreak investigation based on established surveillance system data and molecular analysis of viral variant(s) were conducted. Epidemiological analysis suggested the occurrence of 3 main foci of local transmission. The major focus involved 317 cases with epidemiological link with the area of Anzio. The other two foci occurred in Rome (80 cases) and Latina (8 cases). Cumulative incidence in Anzio and Latina were 331.4 and 7.13 per 100,000 residents, respectively. Cumulative incidences ranged from 1.4 to 14.3/100,000 residents in Rome. This is the first report of a chikungunya outbreak involving a densely populated urban area in a western country. The outbreak probably started in Anzio, spread by continuity to neighbouring villages, and then to the metropolitan area of Rome and to the Latina area favoured by the touristic nature of the Anzio area.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This intervention and the study were funded by Directorate of Health and Social Welfare, Latium Region, the Local Public Health Units, Latium Region and Ricerca Corrente &#x02013; Italian Ministry of Health.

Anzio is one of the most popular location for internal tourism of people living in Rome who spend summer time in their second houses on the coast commuting to Rome on daily basis. The touristic nature of Anzio could explain also secondary outbreak of CHIKV in September and October 2017, in Guardavalle Marina, a small village of 2,346 inhabitants in the province of Catanzaro (CZ), Calabria region (Southern Italy) [<xref rid="pone.0208896.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The cumulative incidence was higher in coastal and rural areas compared to that reported in Rome as also predicted by transmission models based on mosquitoes abundance and biting rate [<xref rid="pone.0208896.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

The sequences from the current outbreak are placed in a separate branch of the phylogenetic tree compared with the isolates from the 2007 Italian outbreak. Isolates from recent outbreaks in Pakistan and India are placed in the same branch, suggesting a more recent origin of the new epidemic strain. Given the molecular characterization of the strain and its phylogenetic characteristics, a possible introduction of the virus from the ongoing epidemic in Pakistan by travelers could be hypothesized [<xref rid="pone.0208896.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This hypothesis is also supported by the seasonal synchronicity between Italy and India or Pakistan, as it happened also during the outbreak in Italy in 2007 [<xref rid="pone.0208896.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The concurrent 2017 French outbreak showed a sub-lineage of the ECSA clustering with lineage from Central African Region and carrying the A226V mutation [<xref rid="pone.0208896.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This excludes a possible link between the two outbreaks. Finally, the epidemiological and molecular characteristics of the imported cases prior to the outbreak rule out these cases as possible source of introduction. Of note, the characterization of E1 performed at various time points during the outbreak indicated a virtually complete identity of the virus sequences along the outbreak suggesting no additional introductions during the outbreak.</p><p>E1 sequences lack the A226V substitution associated with increased viral fitness in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>Albopictus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0208896.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

This could explain the lower cumulative incidence compared with other urban outbreaks although the role of different background vector density or climate-dependent vector behavior cannot be excluded. The 2017 was characterized by an exceptional dry summer season. Despite the low cumulative incidence, this outbreak showed a very long duration (from June to November). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208896.g004">Fig 4B</xref> shows a greater number of mutations that, considering E1 and E2 polymorphisms at sites relevant for vector fitness, provide the genetic signature of strains that use <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> as preferential vector.

Preventive blood safety measures were also introduced in the different areas following the spread of the infection. Given the large and populated area of Rome and the consequences of a interruption of blood donations on the regional blood supply, a risk-benefit evaluation based on daily epidemiological data was performed [<xref rid="pone.0208896.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>The reappearance of CHIKV in Italy and the involvement of urban settings could have been influenced by several factors. The globalization of travel together with the global spread of CHIKV could facilitate the importation of the infection, as was the case in the 2007 outbreak [<xref rid="pone.0208896.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The adaptation of the CHIKV to specific vector species though genome mutation is a key factor in the CKIKV spread. The influence of climate change on the vector&#x02019;s climatic suitability put the Mediterranean region at high risk for CHIKV dissemination [<xref rid="pone.0208896.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208896.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>The date of symptoms&#x02019; onset of first reported case was August 5, 2017 and the earliest symptoms&#x02019; onset was June 26. The surveillance system was able to detect the first autochthonous case only after the peak of the outbreak as it was in 2007 [<xref rid="pone.0208896.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Early identification of autochthonous cases of chikungunya infection is the main challenge for the passive surveillance system in place. In Italy, the activity of the vector mosquitoes is mainly restricted to the summer season (usually between June and October) when outbreaks could be triggered by the arrival of imported cases from endemic areas and may result in secondary cases. This highlights the importance of an integrated surveillance system that should promptly identify autochthonous transmission. The integration of the passive surveillance with different surveillance tools (such as laboratory-based surveillance, syndromic surveillance, novel data stream) [<xref rid="pone.0208896.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] combined with entomological surveillance should facilitate the detection, response and control of arboviruses spreading, including CHIKV.</p><p>Finally, information and training for medical professionals might be useful to favor early diagnosis and reporting of exotic viral diseases such as chikungunya.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0208896.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Database.</title><p>This a minimum anomyzed data set is available. 0, Absent; 1, Present; F, Female; M, Male.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0208896.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Chikungunya Lazio Outbreak Group (in alphabetical order): Rosa Francesca Alicata, Alessandro Agresta, Silvia Aquilani, Giuseppina Bartolomei, Licia Bordi, Carlo Cerocchi, Francesca Colavita, Angela Corpolongo, Maurizio D&#x02019;Amato, Claudio De Liberato, Stefano De Luca, Virginia Di Bari, Giuseppe Di Luzio, Enrico Di Rosa, Giorgio Esterini, Federica Ferraro, Roberto Giammattei, Marco Iannetta, Vincenzo Labriola, Eleonora Lalle, Mariarosaria Loffredo, Adele Magliano, Donatella Mandolini, Fabrizio Magrelli, Andrea Mariano, Pier Angela Napoli, Alessio Pendenza, Alberto Perra, Alberto Piccoli, Raffaella Pisapia, Patricia Porcelli, Pasquale Rombol&#x000e0;, Amilcare Ruta, Monica San&#x000e8; Schepisi, Sara Simeoni, Donatella Vincenti.</p><p>The authors would like also to acknowledge the contributions of all staff of Local Public Health Units who managed the report of single cases and performed preliminary epidemiologic investigation of cases.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0208896.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Brouard</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bernillon</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Quatresous</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Pillonel</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Assal</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>De Valk</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
