To restore the competitive production presence of Florida in the worldwide citrus market, effective and sustainable control of HLB and the ACP needs to be identified. As alternatives for resistance-inducing insecticides, viruses are currently being considered for biological control of the ACP. To identify possible biological control candidates, we conducted one of the most comprehensive surveys of natural ACP populations in major citrus production regions spanning 21 counties in Florida. By optimizing PCRs and RT-PCRs, we were able to successfully detect and monitor the prevalence of five previously identified ACP-associated RNA and DNA viruses throughout Florida citrus groves, which include: <italic>Diaphorina citri-associated C virus</italic> (DcACV), <italic>Diaphorina citri flavi-like virus</italic> (DcFLV), <italic>Diaphorina citri densovirus</italic> (DcDNV)<italic>, Diaphorina citri reovirus</italic> (DcRV), and <italic>Diaphorina citri picorna</italic>-<italic>like virus</italic> (DcPLV). Adult and nymph ACP populations from 21 of Florida's major citrus-producing counties were collected each month during approximately 18 consecutive months. RNA extracts used for these viral screens were also regionally combined and subjected to High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) to reveal a more comprehensive picture of known and unknown viruses in Florida ACP populations. We discovered that DcACV was the most prevalent ACP-associated virus throughout nymph and adult ACP populations in Florida, detected in more than 60% of all samples tested, followed by DcPLV and DcFLV. HTS allowed us to identify a novel ACP-associated reo-like virus and a picorna-like virus. The putative reo-like virus, tentatively named <italic>Diaphorina citri</italic> cimodo-like virus, was later surveyed and detected back in seasonal adult and nymph ACP samples collected in Florida during this study. HTS generated data also revealed that the most abundant virus in Florida ACP populations was <italic>Citrus tristeza virus</italic> (CTV), which is not an ACP-associated virus, suggesting persistent presence of CTV infection in citrus throughout Florida groves. Collectively, information obtained from our study may be able to help guide the direction of biotechnological pest control efforts involving a number of viruses that were detected for the first time in Florida ACP populations, including two newly identified ACP-associated viruses.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Asian citrus psyllid</kwd><kwd>insect viruses</kwd><kwd>Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus</kwd><kwd>Huanglongbing</kwd><kwd>biological control</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="50"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="6969"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The bacterial pathogen, <italic>Candidatus</italic> Liberibacter asiaticus (<italic>C</italic>Las), the causal agent of the citrus disease Huanglongbing (HLB), continues to endanger the worldwide citrus industry, with the most severe losses occurring in Florida (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Jagoueix et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Garnier and Bov&#x000e9;, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">do Carmo Teixeira et al., 2005</xref>). Currently, this disease threatens the future of Florida's $9 billion citrus industry and simultaneously threatens production sites in Texas and California (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Gottwald, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al., 2013</xref>). The fastidious, phloem limited <italic>C</italic>Las bacterium cannot be cultured, preventing the completion of Koch's postulates and <italic>in vitro</italic> biological studies (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Jagoueix et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">do Carmo Teixeira et al., 2005</xref>). Although short-term disease management using bactericides, plant immune activators, nutritional supplements, and heat treatments have been able to slightly reduce the acceleration of the citrus plant decline, the HLB pathogen shows vigorous strength against them and eventually overcomes these temporary therapies (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Blaustein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Munir et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The insect vector of this bacterium, the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP; <italic>Diaphorina citri</italic> Kuwayama), has been proven to be the primary means of dispersal of this disease throughout citrus groves in Florida (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al., 2013</xref>). It has also been shown that each feeding event contributes substantially to the development of disease severity and on the ultimate survival of the infected trees (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Stansly et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). ACP control is therefore essential in Florida citrus groves and the growers' investment in vector control could still have considerable effect on the production of their trees, even with <italic>C</italic>Las infection (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Stansly et al., 2014</xref>). Current HLB disease surveys of Florida citrus groves show approximately 95% of trees are symptomatic, with no signs of decreasing incidence. Management options for HLB are limited and rely heavily on insecticides for controlling ACP populations, even when integrated with various cultural control methods (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Grafton-Cardwell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Blaustein et al., 2018</xref>). Unfortunately, these chemical strategies are mostly ineffective due to challenges associated with repetitive and expensive applications and the inability to consistently decrease ACP populations. Growers are also concerned with the development of chemical resistance among ACP populations and the threat long-term chemical applications pose to the environment and beneficial organisms (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Tiwari et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Kanga et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Stelinski, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Pardo et al., 2018</xref>). To prevent new citrus plantings from HLB infection and to avoid the development of pesticide-resistant ACP populations, many researchers are targeting control of the vector through biological means (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>As the most abundant entity on the planet and in the ACP, viruses offer limitless molecular and biotechnological opportunities to explore and can provide further knowledge of the <italic>C</italic>Las-vector interaction. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), which has been documented as an effective way to deliver RNA interference (RNAi) into both plants and insects, is a molecular strategy for the biological control of the ACP and eventual disruption of the HLB disease cycle (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Baulcombe, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Nandety et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Joga et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Galdeano et al., 2017</xref>). Another phloem-limited citrus pathogen, <italic>Citrus tristeza virus</italic> (CTV), is currently being used as a viral vector to deliver this RNAi technology into the citrus phloem and then into the ACPs that feed on citrus (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hajeri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Killiny et al., 2019</xref>). However, these routes can be cumbersome, require an established infection in the citrus plant before delivering RNAi to the insect, and may target only a few insect organs other than the gut. Employing an endogenous ACP-associated virus that may be naturally replicating and expressing its proteins in the insect can have the potential to deliver RNAi with higher efficiency and lower chances of deleterious, off-target effects.</p><p>As a viable alternative to chemical controls, development of knowledge-based and efficient biological control strategies to disrupt <italic>C</italic>Las transmission by current technologies (i.e., RNAi) in the ACP vector itself represent our strategy to control the disease without relying solely on chemical applications. The necessity of a precise and specific biological control for Florida ACP populations initiated this study, with hopes to provide additional molecular tools. In order to decrease or eliminate major dependence on broad-spectrum chemical controls, this study aimed to investigate the Florida ACP virome for identifying an ACP-associated virus with the potential to be manipulated into a biocontrol agent against the HLB insect vector. The endemic establishment of both HLB and the ACP in Florida has greatly increased the need for alternative control options.</p><p>Prior to this study, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Nouri et al. (2016a)</xref> used metagenomic analysis in a limited number of worldwide ACP samples and identified five new viruses, with the assemblage of nearly complete viral genome sequences (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Nouri et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Nouri et al., 2016b</xref>). These included several putative novel viruses associated with <italic>D. citri</italic>, such as a picorna-like virus, a reovirus, a densovirus, a bunyavirus, and an unclassified (+) ssRNA virus (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Nouri et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Nouri et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Nouri et al. (2016a)</xref> study and our initial observations of various viral particles in the ACP nymphs and adults <italic>via</italic> transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (unpublished data) lead us to our current strategy for identifying and detecting ACP-associated viruses, especially in Florida ACP populations. Additionally, <italic>C</italic>Las survival, reproduction, and dissemination has been observed to occur principally in the gut of the ACP, which has influenced supplementary targeted approaches for potentially inhibiting bacterial persistence in this organ (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ammar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Ghanim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Ghanim et al., 2017</xref>). It was observed that apoptosis, an ACP defense response to microbial invasion, was activated to target and destroy (or limit) the <italic>C</italic>Las infection and spread. <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Ghanim et al. (2017)</xref> documented the occurrence of several upstream events leading to these apoptotic responses, which commenced in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the ACP gut. In addition, the same study provided direct evidence of <italic>C</italic>Las replication in the midgut cells of ACP, which occurs inside Liberibacter-containing vacuoles and associates with the gut ER (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Ghanim et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, an unknown virus in the gut, if manipulated, could serve as a highly efficient and selective biological control agent for ACP when consumed by the ACP and initiated our search for this virus as a viable ACP biocontrol option. It is still unknown whether these viruses are beneficial or destructive to ACPs; however, their presence in ACP populations around the world suggests the likelihood of high persistence and may therefore be a conceivable vector for RNAi delivery. Through this study, which we believe is the most comprehensive survey in natural ACP populations (i.e., not laboratory-reared) in Florida, we intend to further characterize the ACP virome as it relates to Florida citrus groves, where the HLB epidemic has infiltrated and caused unprecedented economic damage. This may bring us closer to identifying the unknown ACP-associated virus localized in the gut. We believe the future of biological control using manipulated ACP-associated viral vectors for RNAi delivery will involve targeting and blocking an essential gene in the insect to control HLB.</p><p>The main objectives of this study include surveying and monitoring previously characterized ACP-associated viruses in nymph and adult ACP populations in Florida citrus groves with PCR-based methods and simultaneously subjecting subsamples of these populations to High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) technologies. The first objective will provide foundational knowledge of the known viruses that might already be present in Florida ACP populations, with regards to their spatial and temporal characteristics throughout citrus-producing counties. The second objective will provide a more thorough analysis of the Florida ACP virome, including the detection of novel and other known viruses. By analyzing ACPs from around the world, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Nouri et al. (2016a)</xref> had identified and characterized new ACP viruses from a small number of psyllid colonies; however, we've concentrated our samples in this study toward larger and naturally occurring ACP populations collected solely from Florida citrus groves and focused our efforts on discovering or identifying other robust and novel Florida ACP viruses. Results of this study may uncover a better candidate for an alternative viral vector used for delivering RNAi technology to combat the ACP in Florida.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>ACP Collection and Processing</title><p>Adult and nymph ACPs were collected directly from citrus trees in commercial groves in 21 of Florida's major citrus-producing counties around south-central Florida every month over a period of approximately eighteen months (August 2017 through December 2018). One grove, ranging from 500 to 2,000 acres (~200 to 800 hectare), was sampled per county and samples were taken randomly from multiple trees in one block of each grove usually around the perimeter of the block, where the observation of ACP incidence has been the greatest (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">S&#x000e9;tamou and Bartels, 2015</xref>). Each citrus grove sample site, which represented each county, remained consistent throughout the entire study, except for a few groves that closed or changed operation during the months of our sampling. These sites were immediately replaced with another grove site within the same county.</p><p>Young citrus shoots with adult or nymph ACPs were carefully detached from trees and immediately submerged into 50 ml Falcon tubes containing 100% ethanol, killing the ACPs, and the Falcon tubes were kept closed. Since HLB and ACPs are currently widespread in Florida, traveling throughout Florida with (dead) ACPs was not a concern. The number of ACPs collected varied by grove; however, we aimed to collect a minimum of 25 adults and 25 nymph ACPs from each grove every month. There were times in which lower numbers were collected due to inhospitable conditions, such as cooler or rainy weather, or increased pesticide applications. ACPs collected from these 21 groves were brought to the laboratory at the Southwest Florida Research and Education Center (SWFREC) in Immokalee FL, where adult and nymph ACPs were separated out from plant parts, counted with the aid of a stereo microscope (Leica S8 APO, Leica Microsystems, USA), and stored separately in smaller vials containing 100% ethanol at -20&#x000b0;C until needed. Total ACP counts per grove site (representing one county) were then calculated and combined into six regions for data analysis (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Total number of ACPs collected in each Florida region over a period of 18 months.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Regions</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of groves/counties</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total number of samples</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adults</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nymphs</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Region A</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">124</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,933</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14,053</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15,986</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Region B</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">72</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">836</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4,535</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5,371</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Region C</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">150</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,987</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15,187</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17,174</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Region D</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">115</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">884</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8,104</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8,988</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Region E</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">99</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,578</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13,801</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15,379</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Region F</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">876</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3,651</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4,527</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>Total RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis</title><p>For each monthly-collected sample representing a county, a subset of five adult ACPs and five 5<sup>th</sup>-instar nymph ACPs were randomly selected and separately used for RNA extraction.

Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) adults and nymphs from each citrus grove were collected monthly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). During this study, we were able to find and collect a sufficient number of ACP adults and nymphs (n = 25&#x02013;100ACPs) from each surveyed citrus grove regardless of the collection period (i.e., season). This indicates that ACP overwinter in both adult and nymph forms in Florida citrus groves. The number of ACPs collected, both adults and nymphs, was recorded separately for each grove (representing one county), but for simplicity of data presentation and statistical analyses these numbers were grouped into larger Florida regions (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Some monthly-collected county samples lacked collection of either nymph or adult ACP populations, most likely due to inhospitable grove conditions or environmental factors around the time of survey (i.e., recent pesticide application or rain).</p></sec><sec id="s3_2"><title>ACP-Associated Virus Screenings With RT-PCR and PCR</title><p>Based on our validated virus RT-PCR screenings of ACPs, all of the previously characterized viruses including DcACV, DcFLV, DcDNV, DcRV, and DcPLV were successfully detected in nymph and adult ACP populations collected in Florida citrus groves.

The densovirus, DcDNV, was also detected in all regions, but at a much lower incidence level (7% of all samples) than DcFLV or DcPLV (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). Finally, DcRV was the least prevalent ACP-associated virus detected in less than 1% of the samples and was found in only two of the regions during the entire study (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>).</p><p>Incidence levels of DcPLV, DcFLV, DcDNV, and DcRV remained consistently low during the extent of the survey. In contrast, incidence levels of DcACV had a higher level of variation across the regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>), yet the presence of this RNA virus in ACPs between the different regions was consistently the highest (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). For example, Region A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>) and Region E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"><bold>Figure 2E</bold></xref>) show DcACV present in these areas, but at different incidence levels throughout the study. DcDNV and DcPLV that were not detected previously in Florida ACP populations (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Nouri et al., 2016a</xref>) appeared to display a contradicting case during this survey and were actually widespread in Florida. However, DcDNV was found at lower incidence levels than the other viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>).</p><p>The cDNA samples generated from RNA extracts during the study always tested positive for the ACP internal control, the ACP (<italic>Dc</italic>) wingless gene (data not shown). The ACP wingless gene was used for the confirmation of total RNA and cDNA integrities during this study.

Subsequent analysis identified sequences of several diverse viruses in all ACP samples. As expected, some of these viral sequences shared high similarities with sequences of known ACP-associated viruses, including DcACV and DcFLV. However, there was also a substantial number of sequences sharing similarities with novel viruses that were not known to be present in the ACP (data not shown). For example, a novel virus sequence (~ 4.1 kb in length) with very low similarity (&#x0003c; 50%) to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of another reovirus from an insect in Africa (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Hermanns et al., 2014</xref>) was discovered during our HTS analysis. To validate the authenticity and trace back the presence of this virus in our ACP populations collected from the various regions in Florida included in this study, we designed two sets of primers (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>): one targeting the 5' end of the predicted RdRp and another at the 3' end of the genomic RNA sequence. First, we screened and successfully detected this novel virus throughout the original county samples used for the initial composite sample using RT-PCR with these primers. Simultaneously, seasonal representative samples that were used for the screening of the five known ACP-associated viruses were also used for this novel virus to obtain a general representation of its prevalence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). This virus, tentatively named <italic>Diaphorina citri</italic> cimodo-like virus (DcCLV), was detected in both adult and nymph ACP populations. It was found in all of the six Florida Regions; however, it excluded most of the seasons in Region B, D, and E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). Interestingly, we observed a higher incidence of this novel virus in nymph ACP samples than adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>).</p><fig id="f3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>The seasonal prevalence of the novel <italic>Diaphorina citri</italic> cimodo-like virus (DcCLV) in <bold>(A)</bold> nymphs and <bold>(B)</bold> adult ACPs over six seasons (one month per season) in the six larger Florida regions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpls-10-01687-g003"/></fig><p>Furthermore, HTS analysis revealed the noticeably higher abundance of <italic>Citrus tristeza virus</italic> (CTV) sRNA sequences in all Florida regional ACP samples compared to any other known virus. More than 60% of all sRNA reads in each regional sample were matched to the CTV genome, with very few detectable reads matching to the DcACV genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). Only half of the regional samples had any DcFLV sRNA reads detected, and as expected, all of the samples had levels of unknown sRNA reads, which supports our hypothesis of novel viruses present in the ACP. Interestingly, an additional novel picornavirus, with 77% sequence similarity to <italic>Graminella nigifrons virus</italic> 1 (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2015</xref>), was also detected in Region A (data not shown). Yet, for all of the regions, CTV composed at least 60% of all HTS reads and suggests possible uptake of CTV by the ACP from infected trees during phloem-feeding.</p><fig id="f4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>The percentage of high throughput sequencing (HTS) reads per composite sample that matched to a known virus species or were categorized as unknown.

Five previously identified ACP-associated viruses, DcACV, DcFLV, DcDNV, DcRV, and DcPLV were chosen from prior literature investigating the ACP virome, applied to this survey study, and successfully detected and monitored in these populations over approximately eighteen consecutive months (six seasons). Although these viruses were previously found in ACPs from other countries, only three of them (DcACV, DcFLV, and DcRV) were reported in ACP populations from Florida (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Marutani-Hert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Matsumura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Nouri et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Nouri et al., 2016b</xref>). However, our survey results indicate that all five viruses were widespread and present at varying incidences in ACP populations throughout Florida citrus groves (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has conducted a comprehensive and grove-based survey throughout Florida for establishing the prevalence levels of these viruses and the identification of two new viruses in ACP populations since their introduction into the state in 1998.</p><p>Our survey results indicate that the DcACV was detected at a higher level than any of the other four ACP-associated viruses in nymph and adult ACP populations collected throughout Florida citrus groves. And, DcACV RNAs were also detected in partially purified virions from nymph and adult ACPs (data not shown). This, along with the greater variance of DcACV incidence levels for all regions, shows the need for quantification of these viruses in future studies to compare how abundant they are in the ACP. DcFLV and DcPLV were also detected throughout most of the sampled citrus-producing counties, although not every month as was seen with DcACV, which suggests these viruses may exist at lower titers in the ACPs of these regions. Surprisingly, we also detected DcDNV throughout these vector populations, which has not been observed in Florida before this study (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Nouri et al., 2016a</xref>). Remarkably, although <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Nouri et al. (2016a)</xref> did not detect the DNA virus DcDNV or the RNA virus DcPLV in their ACP samples from Florida, it was detected in ACPs throughout all Florida regions surveyed (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). This finding supports the novel presence of this ACP-associated virus in Florida and adds increased diversity to the list of potential viral vectors to pursue for biological control. Finally, the extremely low incidence levels of DcRV detected in our study seemed to contrast with the &#x0003e;50% incidence level reported by <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Marutani-Hert et al. (2009)</xref>. Even this information on the lack of viral detection in these collected ACP samples can strengthen the case of the diversity and fluctuation of the ACP virome within the same region of citrus groves sampled. Nonetheless, all five of the viruses in this study were detected in both adult and nymph ACP populations, which suggests an infectious and/or propagative nature of these viruses passing from adult female ACPs to nymphs.</p><p>RNAi defense mechanisms represent an integral part of the insect immune response to viral infections and allows for the substantial detection of viral sRNAs among total insect RNA extracted (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">El-Shesheny et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Roossinck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Pecman et al., 2017</xref>). The insect vector of the HLB pathosystem, the ACP, also has these resistance capabilities, and was analyzed extensively during this study to further understand its virome as it relates to Florida citrus groves (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Van Rij, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Taning et al., 2016</xref>). Since the detection and prevalence of these five previously identified ACP-associated viruses allowed for only a piece of the ACP virome puzzle, we simultaneously compiled early ACP RNA samples of all county sites into six regional samples and subjected them to HTS technologies. Each of the six composite RNA samples were based on the combined regional counties (Region A-F) shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>. When we applied HTS technologies toward analysis of these insects, the sequenced and analyzed results of the RNA samples revealed a frozen snapshot of the viral composition and identity of the Florida ACP virome, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>. Although this analysis only represents a small subset of ACP populations in Florida citrus groves between August 2017 and May 2018, when combined with the results of our simultaneously conducted PCR and RT-PCR survey screenings, it provides substantial evidence to the varying levels of viral prevalence detected. Not only does this further support the high prevalence of DcACV in Florida ACP populations, but also suggests that it might be well adapted to this insect host.</p><p>However, it should be noted that our survey results show the detection of each ACP-associated virus when originating from a five-insect subset specimen (composite sample) of each monthly-collected county sample. This consistent number of insects for each population was intended to standardize possible incidence levels detected of each virus. If subsets of ACPs used for RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were increased, incidences of these viruses may change and show different prevalence levels.</p><p>The second objective of the current study was to examine populations of ACP from Florida citrus groves through HTS of small RNAs in an attempt to discover additional unknown viruses associated with this insect. Such metagenomic approaches with similar goals have been successfully implemented to discover diverse and novel viruses from field-collected mosquitoes, ACPs, <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies, and various other types of insects (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Marutani-Hert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cook et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Coffey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Webster et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Matsumura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Nouri et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Nouri et al., 2016b</xref>). A desirable translational outcome of this objective would be to identify ACP-associated viruses that have the potential to be used as biological agents to control <italic>D. citri</italic> and halt the spread of HLB, particularly in the endemic environment of Florida. In this study, we were able to identify and assemble nearly complete genome sequences of several putative novel viruses associated with ACP, including a novel reo-like virus and a picornavirus. To survey the newly identified reo-like virus, which is tentatively named <italic>Diaphorina citri cimodo-like virus</italic> (DcCLV), in six Florida regional ACP populations, specific primers were designed based on the fragments obtained from bioinformatics analysis and used to screen additional <italic>D. citri</italic> populations, which were not analyzed by HTS (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). The DcCLV was detected in both adult and nymph ACP populations and was found in all six Florida regions, although at varying prevalence levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). However, we observed a higher incidence of this novel virus in nymph ACP samples than adults, which may suggest a plausible lethality to the ACP as infected nymphs may not survive to adulthood. Nevertheless, this hypothesis must be substantiated with more evidence gathered through further studies.</p><p>One of the unexpected outcomes of the HTS results was the discovery that CTV, a non-ACP-associated virus, is extremely abundant in the Florida ACP virome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). To further validate this finding, we went back and screened representative cDNA samples of our ACP populations collected during early months of this study using RT-PCR with CTV-specific primers. We were able to detect this virus in both adult and nymph ACP samples collected throughout Florida citrus groves, as well as in subsequently purified additional virion samples from ACPs by immunogold labelling with CTV-specific antibodies using transmission electron microscopy (data not shown). Together these results cautiously suggest that although CTV is not causing noticeable decline or showing visible symptoms in citrus trees, the virus persists throughout Florida. The fact that non-pathogenic CTV-RNAi vectors are currently being deployed into the citrus host and our discovery of CTV persistence in Florida citrus groves calls for further scrutiny into possible cross-reactivity of viral strains (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hajeri et al., 2014</xref>). Unanswered questions regarding what CTV may be doing in the ACP warrants more studies. Future research into these molecular interactions may provide deeper insight into the uncertainty of CTV's modified deployment in the citrus host (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Harper and Cowell, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the detection of a novel picornavirus with high (77%) sequence similarities with <italic>Graminella nigifrons virus 1</italic>, a picornavirus known to be associated with leafhoppers (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2015</xref>), in our samples also deserves future inquiry into reasons for its presence in the ACP.</p><p>Comprehensive and grove-based viral surveys during this study (i.e., RT-PCR and PCR) and multiple sRNA read detections using HTS established that DcACV was the most prevalent and widespread ACP-associated virus in Florida citrus groves. Following the completion of this study, our specific approach for targeting the mortality of the ACP as a biological control will undoubtedly influence the choice of viral vector we will venture forth with. On the one hand, our research findings provide robust evidence for DcACV as the likely choice to pursue as a possible viral candidate in RNA interference technology. Its clear ubiquity deserves future research into possible utilization as an RNAi delivery machinery against the HLB vector. On the other hand, the low prevalence and detection of DcRV may be considered as unfavorable to the ACP and could serve as an even better viral candidate for RNAi delivery. Regardless of the virus' abundance, any modified viral vector will require high durability in the insect to avoid losing efficacy, as it will be constantly subjected to evolutionary changes and potential suppression by the ACP. Detection of all the viruses in both nymph and adult ACP samples suggest the potential of vertical transfer of each virus from parent to progeny and each virus' capability to remain in the ACP populations. DcACV's consistent detection and prevalence in ACPs and its prevalence in detection through HTS also suggests the highest stability observed amongst the viruses during this study in the ACP virome. DcACV may not be treated as a foreign entity if manipulated and re-inoculated into wild Florida ACP populations, which strengthens its potential as an RNAi vector tool for future studies.</p><p>In conclusion, this comprehensive survey and the successful detection of two novel and five previously characterized ACP-associated viruses, coupled with further HTS analysis of these Florida ACP populations, have provided innovative and clearer insight regarding the spatial and temporal prevalence of these viruses in natural grove conditions. These results have greatly increased our knowledge of a potential source of viral candidates to use against this economically devastating insect vector in Florida. To capitalize on this study, our next steps will include establishing the presence and significance of <italic>C</italic>Las in these same ACP RNA samples used for the ACP-associated viral surveys. We also hope to determine the precise tissue localization of these ACP-associated viruses in the ACP, which will help strengthen future research by determining how efficient and effective this viral candidate's RNAi capabilities could be toward controlling the HLB disease cycle by killing the ACP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>All datasets generated for this study are included in the article<bold>/</bold>supplementary material.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>KB performed the experiments, collected ACPs, analysed the data and drafted the manuscript.
