We report the clinical characteristics of 82 cases of death from COVID-19 in a single center. Clinical data on 82 death cases laboratory-confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospital&#x02019;s electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. All patients were local residents of Wuhan, and a large proportion of them were diagnosed with severe illness when admitted. Due to the overwhelming of our system, a total of 14 patients (17.1%) were treated in the ICU, 83% of deaths never received Critical Care Support, only 40% had mechanical ventilation support despite 100% needing oxygen and the leading cause of death being pulmonary. Most of the patients who died were male (65.9%). More than half of the patients who died were older than 60 years (80.5%), and the median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of the patients who died had comorbidities (76.8%), including hypertension (56.1%), heart disease (20.7%), diabetes (18.3%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer (7.3%). Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death (69.5%), followed by sepsis/MOF (28.0%), cardiac failure (14.6%), hemorrhage (6.1%), and renal failure (3.7%). Furthermore, respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhagic, hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100%, 89%, 80.5%, 78.0%, and 31.7% of patients, respectively. On admission, lymphopenia (89.2%), neutrophilia (74.3%), and thrombocytopenia (24.3%) were usually observed. Most patients had a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of &#x0003e;5 (94.5%), high systemic immune-inflammation index of &#x0003e;500 (89.2%), and increased C-reactive protein (100%), lactate dehydrogenase (93.2%), and D-dimer (97.1%) levels. A high level of IL-6 (&#x0003e;10 pg/ml) was observed in all detected patients. The median time from initial symptoms to death was 15 days (IQR 11&#x02013;20), and a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase (p = 0.002), alanine aminotransferase (p = 0.037) and time from initial symptoms to death was remarkably observed. Older males with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe disease and even die from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Respiratory failure is the main cause of COVID-19, but the virus itself and cytokine release syndrome-mediated damage to other organs, including cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hemorrhagic damage, should be taken seriously as well.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (Number: 81272619 and 81572875), Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (2019CFB635), Health Commission of Hubei Province (WJ2019M194) and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China.

Fever, cough, and fatigue are the most common symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0235458.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Approximately 20&#x02013;30% of cases develop severe illness, and some need further intervention in the intensive care unit (ICU) [<xref rid="pone.0235458.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235458.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Organ dysfunction, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock, acute cardiac injury, and acute renal injury, can happen in severe cases with COVID-19 [<xref rid="pone.0235458.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235458.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235458.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It has been reported that critically ill patients are more likely to be older, have underlying diseases, and have symptoms of dyspnea [<xref rid="pone.0235458.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, intravenous antibiotics and antiviral therapy are usually applied in clinical management, but presently, there are no effective drugs for improving the clinical outcome of COVID-19, especially for severe cases [<xref rid="pone.0235458.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235458.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235458.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>ARDS, a rapidly progressive disease, is the main cause of death for patients infected with previously recognized corona virus infections, such as SARS-CoV and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [<xref rid="pone.0235458.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235458.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In this context, it was initially considered that the lung is the most commonly damaged organ by SARS-CoV-2 infection since human airway epithelia express angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref rid="pone.0235458.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235458.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, increasing clinical cases have shown cardiac, renal and even digestive organ damage in patients with COVID-19 [<xref rid="pone.0235458.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which is consistent with the findings that kidney, colon and other tissues also express ACE2 in addition to airway epithelia [<xref rid="pone.0235458.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235458.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The above clinical phenomena and basic research suggest a more complicated pathogenesis of COVID-19. Hence, analyzing the clinical characteristics of death cases with COVID-19 is urgently needed to improve the outcome of infected patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Data collection</title><p>We retrospectively collected the epidemiological and clinical features of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients who died from January 11, 2020, to February 10, 2020, in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. The confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 was defined as a positive result by using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection on nasopharyngeal swab. This study received approval from the Research Ethics Committee of the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China (approval number: WDRY2020-K038). The Research Ethics Committee waived the requirement of informed consent before the study started because of the urgent need to collect epidemiological and clinical data. We analyzed all the data anonymously.

Radiological analyses comprised X-ray and computed tomography.</p><p>The date of symptom onset, initial diagnosis of COVID-19, and death were recorded accurately. The onset survival time was defined as the period between the onset of different symptoms and signs and the time of death. To increase the accuracy of the collected data, two researchers independently reviewed the data collection forms. Also, when the patients were admitted to hospital, the attending doctors directly communicated with them or their family members to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Inflammatory markers</title><p>Inflammatory markers associated with inflammation-linked disease were calculated using the specific parameters of blood tests.

The systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) was defined as platelet count &#x000d7; neutrophil count/lymphocyte count (/&#x003bc;L). Interleukin (IL)-6 was detected using the Human Cytokine Standard Assays panel (ET Healthcare, Inc., Shanghai, China) and the Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Descriptive analyses were used to determine the patients&#x02019; epidemiological and clinical features.

The associations between the different clinical variables and the time from initial symptoms to death were evaluated using Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation coefficient. The statistical analyses in this study were performed using STATA 15.0 software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).

However, the mortality rate from this center is slightly higher than that previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0235458.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We speculated that the reason might be that fewer patients in our study were transferred to the ICU in time when their condition rapidly worsened owing to the shortage of beds and medical supplies. On the other hand, limited death cases and fewer than 15 patients were included in their cohorts [<xref rid="pone.0235458.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235458.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], while many more death cases were included in the present study.</p><p>Our study first focused on the epidemiological characteristics of patients with COVID-19 who died and the mortality rate of COVID-19 was found higher than that of non-COVID-19 (p&#x0003c;0.001). Several factors were responsible for the death of the patients included in this study. A majority of the patients in our study were older than 60 years, and a borderline significant association between age and time from initial symptoms to death was significantly observed. These results are consistent with the finding that critically ill patients are more likely to be older [<xref rid="pone.0235458.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, we found that underlying diseases such as hypertension, heart disease and diabetes were very common in our death cases, and 30.5% of patients had 2 or more comorbidities. These features are consistent with a previous report that patients with underlying diseases are more likely to develop severe illness [<xref rid="pone.0235458.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Cancer patients comprised 7.3% of our cohort, which had a much higher morbidity than those without cancer, suggesting that cancer patients are more likely to develop severe disease or die. These results are consistent with the findings from a nationwide analysis in China [<xref rid="pone.0235458.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Immune deficiency to virus infection seems to be a common feature in older males with comorbidities.</p><p>We further analyzed the cause of death of patients with COVID-19 and found that respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death. It has been reported that the binding receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, is mainly expressed in blood vessels and lung alveolar type II (AT2) epithelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0235458.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can directly attack ACE2-expressing cells [<xref rid="pone.0235458.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Indeed, pathological findings indicated that lungs infected with SARS-CoV-2 present with ARDS, pulmonary edema with hyaline membrane formation, and evident desquamation of pneumocytes [<xref rid="pone.0235458.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, our finding that respiratory failure is the leading cause of death is consistent with the underlying pathological mechanism of COVID-19.</p><p>In addition to respiratory failure, cardiac failure, hemorrhage, renal failure and even MOF were also recognized as the cause of death by COVID-19 in our study. Laboratory findings also revealed cardiac, hepatic, and renal damage in some patients. In addition, we observed a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and time from initial symptoms to death. These clinical phenomena could be explained by virus attack and cytokine release syndrome (CRS)-mediated tissue damage. First, ACE2 expression is also found in the kidney, heart, and liver; therefore, SARS-CoV-2 could invade the cells of the above tissues, reproduce and damage these organs [<xref rid="pone.0235458.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235458.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Second, viral infection and subsequent tissue damage either in the lung or other target organs could elicit immune cells to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely, CRS, ultimately injuring the tissue and causing target organ failure. Obviously, increased amounts of cytokines, including IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), are associated with severe lung injury in patients infected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [<xref rid="pone.0235458.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235458.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A recent study showed that high levels of IL-1&#x003b2;, interferon &#x003b3;-induced protein 10, and MCP-1 occurred in the serum of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, which probably led to the activation of the T-helper-1 cell response [<xref rid="pone.0235458.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the present report, high levels of IL-6 of more than 10 U/L and C-reactive protein were detected in all patients, even in the last 24 hours prior to death.</p><p>We also depicted the immune status of COVID-19 patients with severe illness. Most of the patients in our study presented with neutrophilia and lymphopenia on admission; specifically, reduced CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T-cell counts were observed in some patients. A high NLR was also observed on admission and 24 hours before death. These results, consistent with the previous findings found in patients with severe illness, suggest that the perturbation of the immune system contributes to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. These observations could also explain why older males with comorbidities likely succumb to COVID-19.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. First, some patients did not receive timely supportive interventions, such as admission to the ICU, because an increasing number of severe patients occurred in a short period and the overwhelming of our medical system. However, the present data could partially be a scenario where COVID-19 patients progress in a natural pathophysiological manner rather than outcomes from intervention by treatment. Second, the consecutive detection of cytokines is lacking, which fails to truly monitor the severity of CRS. Third, organ damage could originate from a history of medication, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and traditional Chinese medicine, which are associated with renal or liver injury [<xref rid="pone.0235458.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235458.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In our study, all patients received intravenous antibiotics and antiviral drugs.</p><p>Overall, from the point of view of the causes of death, we presented the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19. Lung injury begins with an insult to the lung epithelium mainly attacked by SARS-CoV-2 itself because of ACE2 expressed in the lungs, which leads most commonly to respiratory failure. Other organs or tissues, more or less, are potentially damaged through direct attack from SARS-CoV-2. In addition, damage to multiple systems, including the lungs, might originate with systemic damage due to CRS following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Considering the pandemic potential and moderate threat of COVID-19 for populations with multiple underlying diseases, further studies are needed to focus on the pathology and pathophysiology of the tissue injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially on the activation process of the immune response and cytokine storm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec012"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0235458.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Dataset.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0235458.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0235458.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Treatment and survival time of dead patients with COVID-19.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0235458.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge all health-care workers involved in the diagnosis and treatment of patients in Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0235458.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ren</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>

There is no definition of "severe Illness". Results section paragraph 2 line 4 77/82 were admitted with severe illness.</p><p>2,) Line 4 of paragraph 2 of Results. Incubation time is unclear how it can be calculated. The definition in method noted this calculation to be from time of contact of transmission exposure to date to symptoms. Only 2 patients reported exposure so is incubation time calculated for only those 2. If so, I don't find it very informative or helpful.</p><p>3.) Table 1 Comorbidity - first listing is "ALL" Does that mean ANY? Not clear what that means.</p><p>4.) Table 1 Comorbidity - please define disease of reduced immunity- is this Collagen vascular disease&#x0003e; is this HIV? what does this mean?</p><p>5.) Table 3 needs clarification and some editing....right now the list is just too long and difficult to find your way through--for example it notes Neutrophyl count ( is that a mean??) then lists % with very low and very high. This was the same for every value given. There must be an easier clearer way to present this data.</p><p>6.) Table 3 notes radiographic data in the table but it really lists only Bilateral infiltrates at 100% of patients. This would be easier to be removed form the table and listed at the time of the statement o "severe illness on presentation - is this in fact what you meant?</p><p>7.) Table 3 what is acquired infection? nosocomial infection during admission?</p><p>8.) The surprise is that only 17% of patients go to MICU --- this appears first in the table 3 and then later there is a brief mention of this in the discussion. This is important and needs to move up much sooner in your paper. 83% of deaths never received Critical Care Support due to the overwhelming of your system. Only 40% had mechanical ventilation support despite 100% needing oxygen and the leading cause of death being pulmonary. This all speaks to the overwhelming of the system and needs to be highlighted. You might look to see if the patients who did make it into the MICu were any different than the ones who did not?</p><p>9.) What anti viral medications were given? Table 3 again.</p><p>I think the paper is important glimpse into the early phase of the pandemic and is publishable with a bit of more work and editing.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

This article is timely given the present pandemic for COVID 19&#x0003e; It is a descriptive retrospective review of the epidemiological descriptions of over 80 deaths at a single hospital in Wuhan in the first month of the epidemic. as such it is an informative article. There are a few issues of note that need to be addressed:</p><p>There is no definition of "severe Illness". Results section paragraph 2 line 4 77/82 were admitted with severe illness.</p><p>Response: The definition has been added in the revised manuscript.</p><p>2. Line 4 of paragraph 2 of Results. Incubation time is unclear how it can be calculated. The definition in method noted this calculation to be from time of contact of transmission exposure to date to symptoms. Only 2 patients reported exposure so is incubation time calculated for only those. If so, I don't find it very informative or helpful.</p><p>Response: Yes, the situation at the time was too difficult to accurately trace and calculate the incubation period of each patient. Maybe, patients actually had exposure, but they did not acknowledge contact with patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. So, we delete the data for the median incubation time (Page 11; Table 1).</p><p>3. Table 1 Comorbidity - first listing is "ALL" Does that mean ANY? Not clear what that means.</p><p>Response: &#x0201c;All&#x0201d; means patients having any one or more comorbidities. We have changed &#x0201c;All&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;Any&#x0201d; (Table 1).</p><p>4. Table 1 Comorbidity - please define disease of reduced immunity- is this Collagen vascular disease&#x0003e; is this HIV? what does this mean?</p><p>Response: It means abnormal blood examination for cellular immune or humoral immune indexes (Table 1).</p><p>5. Table 3 needs clarification and some editing...right now the list is just too long and difficult to find your way through--for example it notes Neutrophil count (is that a mean??) then lists % with very low and very high. This was the same for every value given. There must be an easier clearer way to present this data. </p><p>Response: Neutrophil count is that a median (IQR). In fact, in all Tables data are presented as median (IQR), or n/N (%), where N represents the total number of patients with COVID-19 with available data. Please see the footnotes affiliated with table 3. To present clearly, &#x0201c;treatment&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;survival time&#x0201d; in table 3 have been separated to Supporting Information part as S2 Table at the end of the manuscript.</p><p>6. Table 3 notes radiographic data in the table, but it really lists only Bilateral infiltrates at 100% of patients. This would be easier to be removed from the table and listed at the time of the statement o "severe illness on presentation - is this in fact what you meant? </p><p>Response: Bilateral infiltrates at 100% of patients are radiographic findings, did not equal severe illness on presentation. To present clearly, we delete this data in Table 3.</p><p>7. Table 3 what is acquired infection? nosocomial infection during admission? </p><p>Response: Yes, it means nosocomial infection during admission. </p><p>8. The surprise is that only 17% of patients go to MICU --- this appears first in the table 3 and then later there is a brief mention of this in the discussion. This is important and needs to move up much sooner in your paper. 83% of deaths never received Critical Care Support due to the overwhelming of your system.
