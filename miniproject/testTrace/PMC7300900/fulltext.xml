The World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the disease &#x0201c;coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#x02010;19).&#x0201d; Meanwhile, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses named the novel coronavirus &#x0201c;severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2).&#x0201d; Due to the measures of preventive control and medical treatment, the rising momentum of the epidemic in China has been contained and the epidemic has been alleviated. However, morbidity abroad is on the rise and the virus is spreading globally. According to data from the currently released report, the pathogen may infect people of all ages, but the severe disease rate is higher among the elderly population, which accounts for the vast majority of mortalities.<xref rid="agm212113-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">

This receptor is mainly distributed in the pulmonary vascular endothelial cells, heart, kidney, and so forth. The physicochemical property data of the novel coronavirus mainly come from the study of SARS&#x02010;CoV. The virus is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat. Exposure to 56&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;minutes and lipid solvents, such as ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine&#x02010;containing disinfectant, peracetic acid, and chloroform, can effectively inactivate the virus.

</xref> As for the elderly, there are many variations in the respiratory system&#x02019;s physiological function caused by the change of pulmonary anatomical structure and muscle atrophy, such as the weakening of airway clearance, the reduction of lung reserve, and the depression of defensive barrier function. In addition, pro&#x02010;inflammatory cytokines baselines in the tissue and circulation of the elderly rise with age, especially interleukin (IL)&#x02010;1&#x003b2;, IL&#x02010;6, and tumor necrosis factor&#x02010;&#x003b1; (TNF&#x02010;&#x003b1;), resulting in a condition known as &#x0201c;inflammatory senescence.&#x0201d; Corresponding to inflammatory senescence, the body's immune response to pathogenic threaten or tissue damage is blunt, called "Immunosenescence." With age, the function of innate immunity and adaptive immunity declines; the discernment, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis of macrophages, natural killer cells, and neutrophils downgrade; and the diversity of the T&#x02010;cell receptor (TCR) decreases. Furthermore, at the age of 60 years, the thymus that produces immature T&#x02010;cells is replaced by adipose tissue, which leads to the accumulation of memory T&#x02010;cells and effector T&#x02010;cells and results in the decrease of immature T&#x02010;cells. Meanwhile, the B&#x02010;cells&#x02019; ability to produce antibodies declines with age, which may cause hypoimmunity.</p><p>Inflammatory senescence and immunosenescence make individuals susceptible to novel coronavirus. The elderly in morbid states, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or extra&#x02010;pulmonary organ system diseases, are more likely to have severe respiratory infections, which causes the high mortality in elderly patients with NCP. The specific mechanism by which inflammatory factor storms are more likely to develop into acute respiratory failure in the elderly infected with novel coronavirus is unknown. It is still to be studied whether this mechanism is associated with the inflammatory imbalance that leads to disruption of pulmonary immune homeostasis and/or the decline of innate immunity and adaptive immunity that aggravate novel coronavirus transmission, which leads to the imbalance response of pro&#x02010;inflammatory and anti&#x02010;inflammatory cytokines.<xref rid="agm212113-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">

</p><p>The novel coronavirus mainly leads to pulmonary infection, which increases the heart&#x02019;s workload, causes hyperglycemia, and makes it harder to control the infection. The characteristics of multisystem disease in the elderly make it a complex condition with all the diseases interplaying with each other, which increases the difficulty of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="agm212113-sec-0005"><label>5</label><title>CLINICAL MANIFESTATION OF NCP</title><p>Based on a current epidemiological survey, the incubation of NCP is 1&#x02010;14&#x000a0;days, and mostly 3&#x02010;7&#x000a0;days. The most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and weakness. Nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, emesis, and diarrhea are found in some cases. Severe patients develop dyspnea and/or hypoxemia after 1&#x000a0;week and may progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, multiple organ failure, and so forth. There are no clinical data on novel coronavirus infection in the elderly. However, the clinical symptoms of pneumonia in elderly patients are often atypical, so if elderly patients have dyspnea, ARDS, or unexplained systemic symptoms, such as fatigue, shock, coagulation disorders, or other symptoms, the possibility of new coronavirus infection should be considered.</p><p>With the popularization of etiological examination, many suspected patients with mild cases have been diagnosed. However, there are neither clinical studies about the clinical characteristics of these mild patients, nor clinical studies about the proportion and characteristics of the elderly.

Some patients have elevated liver enzymes, muscle enzymes, and myoglobin. Most patients have elevated C&#x02010;reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and normal procalcitonin. The levels of some inflammatory cytokines, such as IL&#x02010;2, TNF&#x02010;&#x003b1;, IL&#x02010;6, and interferon&#x02010;&#x003b3;, are normal or higher.

As the disease progresses, imaging shows multiple ground&#x02010;glass opacities and infiltration in both lungs. In severe cases, pulmonary consolidation may occur. However, pleural effusion is rare. The elderly often suffer from chronic diseases that may effect and disturb the auxiliary examinations, which should be considered minutely in the process of treatment. For example, the elderly may have an increase in blood parameters and procalcitonin earlier than other patients, which is caused by co&#x02010;bacterial infection; they may experience patient delay caused by atypical symptoms, which makes the initial manifestation of laboratory examination atypical; and underlying pulmonary diseases may lead to the early manifestation of atypical pulmonary imaging and, under these circumstances, the dynamic observation of past imaging data and imaging features is more meaningful.</p></sec><sec id="agm212113-sec-0007"><label>7</label><title>DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR NCP</title><p>We recommend the adoption of the criteria in the &#x0201c;Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (trial version 7).&#x0201d;<xref rid="agm212113-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">

Even patients with common respiratory pathogens who have had close contact with positive novel coronavirus patients are advised to take a timely novel coronavirus nucleic acid test. Suspected cases can be excluded if the respiratory pathogens in nucleic acid testing are negative (sampling interval must be at least 24&#x000a0;hours) and the IgM and IgG of the novel coronavirus&#x02010;specific antibodies are still negative 7&#x000a0;days after onset.</p></sec><sec id="agm212113-sec-0013"><label>11.2</label><title>Treatment venue determined by the severity of the disease</title><p>Suspected and confirmed cases should be treated in a designated hospital with effective isolation and protection; suspected cases should receive isolated treatment in one single room separately while confirmed cases can be accommodated in the same room.

<list list-type="alpha-lower" id="agm212113-list-0005"><list-item><p>General treatment: Allow patients to rest in bed and provide strengthening support therapy; ensure sufficient caloric intake for patients; monitor patients&#x02019; water, electrolyte, and acid&#x02010;base balances to maintain internal environment stability; and closely monitor vital signs and oxygen saturation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sputum drainage: The sputum&#x02010;drainage ability of elderly patients can decrease and sometimes they need mechanical assistance. Assisted sputum drainage procedures should be strictly followed.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Oxygen therapy: Patients with hypoxemia should be provided with oxygen therapy immediately, with blood oxygen saturation maintaining at &#x02265;90%. Note: (1) Oxygen therapy methods: Patients with mild symptoms should receive normal nasal catheter and mask oxygen supply; patients with severe symptoms suffering from increased respiratory distress or where standard oxygen therapy has had no effects can be given high&#x02010;flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy, starting at 20&#x000a0;L/min and gradually increased to 50&#x02010;60&#x000a0;L/min. In the meantime, adjust oxygen concentration (fraction of inspired oxygen) according to the oxygenation targets. For patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the decision of whether they need to use HFNC oxygen therapy should be made after assessing the possible risk of carbon dioxide retention. If possible, inhalation of mixed hydrogen and oxygen can be applied. (2) Respiratory support methods: The non&#x02010;invasive ventilator, which is not recommended prior to HFNC oxygen therapy, should be adopted immediately once the HFNC oxygen therapy fails to reach the treatment objectives as desired. The non&#x02010;invasive ventilator is the preferred mechanical ventilation mode if the medical staff can achieve complete protection. If non&#x02010;invasive mechanical ventilation works for 2&#x000a0;hours showing no improvements on patients, or patients cannot tolerate non&#x02010;invasive ventilation with increased airway secretion, severe cough, or unstable hemodynamic, close observation should be arranged and, if necessary, invasive ventilation can be used. For invasive mechanical ventilation, use the &#x0201c;ventilation strategy for lung protection,&#x0201d; low tidal volume (4&#x02010;8&#x000a0;mL/kg predicted bodyweight) and low inspiratory pressure (platform pressure&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;30&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O; 1&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.098&#x000a0;kPa) to reduce ventilator&#x02010;related lung injury. Closed sputum suction is selected according to the condition of airway secretion. If necessary, bronchoscopy should be used with appropriate treatment. When it comes to the most serious time, prone&#x02010;position ventilation, lung recruitment, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can be used. However, as regards treating critically ill patients, the main recommendation of mechanical ventilation among the elderly is the non&#x02010;invasive ventilator. Non&#x02010;invasive mechanical ventilation should be used carefully after full evaluation of benefits.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Antiviral therapy: It is advised to try &#x003b1;&#x02010;interferon aerosolized inhalation (5 million units each time, 2&#x000a0;mL, 2&#x000a0;times/d with sterilized injection water), lopinavir/ritonavir (two capsules, 2&#x000a0;times/d, no more than 10&#x000a0;days per session), umifenovir (200&#x000a0;mg, 3 times per day, no more than 10&#x000a0;days of treatment), or ribavirin intravenous injection (500&#x000a0;mg, 2&#x02010;3&#x000a0;times/d, no more than 10&#x000a0;days per session) additionally. Hospitals can try &#x003b1;&#x02010;interferon (5 million U or equivalent dose each time, adding 2&#x000a0;mL of sterilized water, atomization inhalation twice daily), lopinavir/ritonavir (200&#x000a0;mg/50&#x000a0;mg per pill, two pills each time, twice daily, no longer than 10&#x000a0;days), ribavirin (suggested to be used jointly with interferon or lopinavir/ritonavir, 500&#x000a0;mg each time for adults, twice or three times of intravenous injection daily, no longer than 10&#x000a0;days), chloroquine phosphate (for the elderly aged&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;65 years, 500&#x000a0;mg bid for 7&#x000a0;days with bodyweight over 50&#x000a0;kg; 500&#x000a0;mg bid for Days 1&#x02010;2 and 500&#x000a0;mg qd for Days 3&#x02010;7 with bodyweight below 50&#x000a0;kg [note: chloroquine cannot be used for patients with heart diseases]), and umifenovir (200&#x000a0;mg tid, no longer than 10&#x000a0;days). The clinical effect of the above drugs in the treatment of NCP still lacks large&#x02010;scale clinical research and evidence&#x02010;based medical evidence. In clinical application, the efficacy of all currently tested drugs needs to be further evaluated. Since the elderly have poor tolerance to medicine, with different diseases, they often take several kinds of medicine, which may result in adverse reactions, such as liver and kidney damage. Antiviral drugs should be used cautiously. During the treatment process, adverse reactions should be monitored. If there are intolerable adverse reactions, the drug should be stopped in time and symptomatic treatment should be given.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Glucocorticoid: Severe patients can take glucocorticoids at a dose of 1&#x02010;2&#x000a0;mg/kg/d, and the recommended course of treatment is 3&#x02010;5&#x000a0;days.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Antibiotics: Blind or improper use of antimicrobial medicine, especially combined use of broad&#x02010;spectrum antibacterial medicine, should be avoided.

Malnutrition is one of the most important negative factors affecting the prognosis of disease among elderly patients. The elderly are recommended to have a balanced diet and balanced intake of calories, protein, vitamins, minerals and so on, with meat and vegetables to ensure adequate nutrition. Elderly people should eat foods that are easily digested, eat more vegetables and fruits, drink water frequently, and avoid eating wild animals and rotten or expired food. Chilled poultry should be purchased through regular channels, and meat, eggs, and milk should be fully cooked before eating. Elderly people with poor appetite and eating inadequate food can take some protein and trace elements appropriately through nutritionally fortified foods, special medical formula foods, or nutrient supplements. For all elderly people, attention should also be paid to avoid aspiration pneumonia due to improper inhaling. Patients and their families nursing at home should receive standardized health education and training, including room arrangements, hand hygiene, proper use of masks, respiratory hygiene, disinfection standard of household articles, contact information of medical institutions, nutrition and health knowledge, psychological self&#x02010;regulation skills, and disease&#x02010;monitoring methods. After confirmation of home&#x02010;based care with patients, the medical staff should assess the patient&#x02019;s general condition and reconfirm the patient&#x02019;s medical treatment in the past and home&#x02010;based medical treatment plan, and make sure patients and their families understand those.
