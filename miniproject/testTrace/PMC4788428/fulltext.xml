After quality filtering, putative transmission linkages were inferred when two sequences were &#x02264;1.5% genetically different. Multiple linkages were resolved into putative transmission clusters. Further phylogenetic analyses were performed using BEAST v1.8.1. Finally, we investigated putative links between the 259 sequences from South-East Austria and all publicly available HIV polymerase sequences in the Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV sequence database. We found that 45.6% (118/259) of the sampled sequences were genetically linked with at least one other sequence from South-East Austria forming putative transmission clusters. Clustering individuals were more likely to be men who have sex with men (MSM; p&#x0003c;0.001), infected with subtype B (p&#x0003c;0.001) or subtype F (p = 0.02). Among clustered males who reported only heterosexual (HSX) sex as an HIV risk, 47% clustered closely with MSM (either as pairs or within larger MSM clusters). One hundred and seven of the 259 sequences (41.3%) from South-East Austria had at least one putative inferred linkage with sequences from a total of 69 other countries. In conclusion, analysis of HIV-1 sequences from newly diagnosed individuals residing in South-East Austria revealed a high degree of national and international clustering mainly within MSM. Interestingly, we found that a high number of heterosexual males clustered within MSM networks, suggesting either linkage between risk groups or misrepresentation of sexual risk behaviors by subjects.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by funds from the following: the Max Kade Foundation, New York (Max Kade Postdoctoral Research grant), Interdisciplicinary Research Fellowship in NeuroAIDS (R25-MH081482), the Bettencourt-Schueller Foundation, the California HIV/AIDS Research Program (CHRP) Grant F13SD321, and grants from the National Institutes of Health: NIH Grants including AI106039, AI43638, AI074621, AI108351, MH100974, AI036214, AI093163, AI100665, DA034978, and AI036214.

Although the majority of HIV infected individuals (over 90%) are receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), the annual number of new HIV diagnoses in Austria has remained stable at about 400&#x02013;500 new HIV diagnoses per year during the last decade [<xref rid="pone.0151478.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A major reason for the steady rate of incident diagnoses, despite high ART-coverage, is that despite high numbers of per-capita testing (compared to other European countries), only 20% of individuals are diagnosed with acute or recent HIV infection (defined as seroconversion, with the last negative HIV test not more than 3 years before the first positive test) [<xref rid="pone.0151478.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151478.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

To further examine the relationship between geography and HIV transmission, we next investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of the observed epidemic specifically between urban and rural regions of South East Austria by applying a Bayesian phylogeographic inference using discrete non-reversible models to our geo-referenced sequences. In this phylogeographic reconstruction, each node was annotated with a geographic location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151478.g004">Fig 4</xref>).

Branches linking red and blue nodes represent location state transitions (viral lineage migrations) between the rural and urban regions. We found that the sampled subtype B HIV epidemic was mainly initiated in the urban areas of Graz (in red) as illustrated by the most probable location state of the descendant nodes with 57.1% (95%CI 54%-60.1%) of all viral lineages movements originating from urban Graz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151478.g004">Fig 4</xref>).

Network analysis revealed a high rate of inferred clustering within the cohort, consisting mainly of MSM and injection drug users, and a large number of international connections.</p><p>The sequences included in this analysis represent an estimated 7.4% of the new HIV diagnoses across Austria in this time period, and over 95% of the new HIV diagnoses in South-East Austria [<xref rid="pone.0151478.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151478.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We were therefore able to reconstruct a relatively complete network of individuals newly diagnosed with HIV in South-East Austria between 2008 and 2014. We found a high degree of clustering, with putative transmission linkages for 45.6% (118/259) of the sequences.</p><p>Nearly a third of HIV positive males identified HSX contact as their only risk for HIV acquisition, which may be considered a high proportion when compared to other settings in Europe and the United States [<xref rid="pone.0151478.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0151478.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Interestingly, of the clustering males that reported only HSX risk, 47% (9/19) clustered closely with MSM (either as pairs or within larger MSM clusters). This suggests misrepresentation of risk that may be related to perceived stigma in South-East Austria that prevents males from self-identifying as MSM, or may be related to a group of &#x0201c;missing&#x0201d; individuals with two risk factors (i.e. HSX/MSM [Bisexual], or MSM/IDU) bridging these individuals to MSM HIV-1 transmission networks. Local transmission networks of HIV infected persons are never complete because i) sampling of the entire network is often impossible, such that the inferred network will not include HIV-infected persons not yet diagnosed. Further, a putatively inferred linkage does not represent a true transmission link, as additional unsampled individuals could have been members of the transmission chain linking the two observed putatively linked individuals [<xref rid="pone.0151478.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore we can&#x02019;t rule out that there might be&#x0201d;missing&#x0201d; individuals bridging our sampled HIV-1 infected MSM and HSX males. Our results correlate well with characteristics of the overall Austrian HIV epidemic. Interestingly heterosexual contact was the most frequently reported mode of HIV acquisition until 2008, and only recently surpassed by men who sex with men (MSM) sexual contact [<xref rid="pone.0151478.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In part, these findings may be explained by stigma and discrimination that may limit individuals from self-identifying as MSM. Austria, while influenced by Roman Catholicism, has slowly become more liberal with laws and social opinions concerning sexual orientation and gender identity. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons in Austria are, however, still facing some legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents [<xref rid="pone.0151478.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In a survey conducted by the European Union in 2012, collecting online-information from over 93,000 LGTB persons, 48% of respondent from Austria felt discriminated against or harassed on the grounds of sexual orientation in the last 12 months with an average number of 1,078 harassment incidents per 1000 respondents [<xref rid="pone.0151478.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. More than that, only 26% of Austrian LGBT respondents reported that they reveal their sexual orientation or gender identity to most people in their private and professional lives, while 29% reported that they never reveal their LGBT lifestyle [<xref rid="pone.0151478.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Bayesian phylogeographic analyses also provided insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of the South-East Austrian HIV epidemic, suggesting a key role for the densely populated region of Graz as a hub for transmission of new HIV infections throughout the region. These results are consistent with our recent evaluation of French individuals with primary HIV infection which revealed an early spread of the HIV epidemic from Paris to the rest of the Country [<xref rid="pone.0151478.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Interestingly, these analyses also showed that the subtype F and CRF01_AE local epidemics were more likely to have started (and persisted) in rural areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151478.g004">Fig 4</xref>).</p><p>Previously, Frentz and co-workers evaluated 1,330 clustering pol sequences from 26 European countries collected between 2002 and 2007 and found that transmission of HIV-1 in Europe is predominantly occurring between individuals from the same country as only 25.8% of sequences clustered with individuals from foreign countries (10.2% with individuals from neighboring countries only and 15.6% with individuals from countries without a common border) [<xref rid="pone.0151478.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In contrast, our study found that more than 40% of sequences had putative linkages with sequences from countries outside Austria, with the majority of linkages to Eastern European countries without a common border. The main explanation for these differing findings can be found in the size of the network tested. While Frentz and colleagues evaluated linkage within a limited pool of 4,260 pol sequences only, our study evaluated linkage using nearly 150,000 sequences of the Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV sequence database. In contrast to Frentz et al., our findings may therefore indicate that infections through travelling between countries may be more frequent and a more international approach that is not restricted to national borders is needed for surveillance of HIV-1 epidemics.</p><p>In conclusion, analysis of HIV1 sequences from South-East Austria revealed a highly clustered transmission network with a large number of international connections. Higher rates of clustering in MSM, and a high proportion of HSX males clustering within MSM networks may inform prevention, testing and linkage to care strategies. Future studies are needed to further expand that network to other parts of Austria and other countries across Europe.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151478.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the 107 sequences from the South-Eastern Austrian Cohort putatively linked with sequences from foreign countries/regions by A.
