Community health workers are poised to play a pivotal role in fighting the pandemic, especially in countries with less resilient health systems. Drawing from practitioner expertise across four WHO regions, this article outlines the targeted actions needed at different stages of the pandemic to achieve the following goals: (1) PROTECT healthcare workers, (2) INTERRUPT the virus, (3) MAINTAIN existing healthcare services while surging their capacity, and (4) SHIELD the most vulnerable from socioeconomic shocks. While decisive action must be taken now to blunt the impact of the pandemic in countries likely to be hit the hardest, many of the investments in the supply chain, compensation, dedicated supervision, continuous training and performance management necessary for rapid community response in a pandemic are the same as those required to achieve universal healthcare and prevent the next epidemic.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>health systems</kwd><kwd>health policy</kwd><kwd>public health</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Summary box</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Community health workers (CHWs) are poised to play a pivotal role in fighting the pandemic, especially in low-income countries with vulnerable health systems.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The COVID-19 response must build on existing platforms, infrastructure and relationships wherever possible; the focus should be on supporting the Ministries of Health and regional authorities as they lead coordinated responses.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Immediate investment in community health systems will help achieve the following goals: PROTECT healthcare workers, INTERRUPT the virus, MAINTAIN existing healthcare services while surging their capacity, and SHIELD the most vulnerable from socioeconomic shocks.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Achieving these goals will require targeted actions at different stages of the pandemic.

Its members have developed and supported high-quality community health programmes with governments and communities across the globe, through multiple outbreaks and epidemics.</p><p>Given that in a pandemic speed is of the essence, this paper was generated in less than 72&#x02009;hours using an adapted nominal group technique (NGT). NGT is an organisational planning technique<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> that involves four phases: (1) nominal/silent phase: participants individually write their responses to a defined question without discussion; (2) item generation phase: participants take turns sharing their responses, and each response is recorded as a succinct idea without being discussed; (3) discussion/clarification phase: participants ask clarifying questions and delineate the pros/cons of each idea; and (4) voting phase: participants assign ranks to the items. This approach was chosen as it is comprehensive, quick and of low cost.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> It was adapted in the following ways: given that participants were distributed across multiple continents and 12 time zones, phases 1 and 2 took place entirely asynchronously&#x02014;responses were collected on a shared drive. The discussion phase took place over a 24-hour period, first asynchronously (participants asked and answered questions in a shared word processing document) and subsequently in a video meeting. The final voting phase took place during an additional video meeting. Selection of participants was opportunistic: any health practitioner from the CHIC network was invited to participate.</p><p>This paper is intended to advocate for rapid action in response to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, providing an initial modifiable roadmap to funders, non-governmental organisations and Ministries of Health alike.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Priorities</title><p>The COVID-19 response must build on existing platforms, infrastructure and relationships wherever possible.
