    "On December 31, 2019, Chinese authorities reported the first case of what would become known as COVID-19 to the World Health Organization (WHO), which declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern one month later. In the ensuing weeks, health care organizations, industry partners, and government agencies worldwide have quickly come together to address pandemic challenges such as scaling high-quality laboratory tests, conducting treatment research, and enabling virtual health care in a time of social distancing. What we have accomplished together to date demonstrates the opportunity for future cross-sector partnerships in science and technology to fight the disease, while simultaneously creating the new digital health care solutions that our world greatly needs."
