Accumulated weekly data were gathered from readily available hospital records at bi-weekly visits during the peak of the outbreak from September 2014 to May 2015. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare weekly median admissions during the first year of the EVD outbreak, with the 20&#x000a0;weeks before the outbreak, and weekly median volume of surgeries performed during the first year of the EVD outbreak with identical weeks of 2012.

There was a 51% decrease in weekly median non-Ebola admissions and 41% fewer weekly median surgeries performed compared with the 20&#x000a0;weeks before the outbreak (admission) and 2012 (volume of surgery). Governmental hospitals experienced a smaller reduction in non-Ebola admissions (45% versus 60%) and surgeries (31% versus 53%) compared to private non-profit hospitals. Governmental hospitals realized an increased volume of cesarean deliveries by 45% during the EVD outbreak, thereby absorbing the 43% reduction observed in the private non-profit hospitals.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Both non-Ebola admissions and surgeries were severely reduced during the EVD outbreak.

Volume of surgery is a promising indicator of hospital functions that should be further explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12913-018-3666-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hospital functioning</kwd><kwd>Inpatient admissions</kwd><kwd>Surgery</kwd><kwd>Ebola viral disease</kwd><kwd>Sierra Leone</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009123</institution-id><institution>Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par10">By the time the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an end to the transmission of the Ebola virus in West-Africa in June 2016, the outbreak had claimed more than 11,000 lives and infected almost 29,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. During a few months in 2014, the weak and fragile health systems in the three most affected countries, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, were overwhelmed with urgent and radically new challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The fear of contracting Ebola viral disease (EVD), the deaths of health staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], the closure of health facilities, and the disruption of essential health programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] contributed to reduced health service utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and increased all-causes of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">The health system&#x02019;s functions, adaptations, and its consequences for essential health services during the EVD outbreak have been, with a few exceptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], largely based on primary health care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], or estimated by modeling analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This study complements an assessment of obstetric health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] during the EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone and evaluates non-Ebola admissions and the volume of surgeries performed in hospitals. Hospitals, an essential service delivery component of the health care system, are of particular interest during an EVD outbreak because many potential EVD patients are admitted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and it is where most EVD-infected health care workers believed they contracted the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Collecting and analyzing metrics measuring all aspects of hospital functions have proven challenging even in stable settings in low-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and is extremely difficult during a humanitarian emergency such as the EVD outbreak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, much simpler, yet relevant, approaches need to be applied.</p><p id="Par12">Because of their complexity, provision of surgery signals the presence of the &#x02018;staff, stuff, space, and systems&#x02019; in a hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. As many of these components are not standalone requirements for surgery, but are rather part of a shared delivery infrastructure that is the basis of hospital functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], we assume that provision of surgery might be a relevant indicator of the hospitals&#x02019; capacity to deliver a broader range of services. In an attempt to assess the EVD&#x02019;s effects on service provisions in hospitals in Sierra Leone, the aim of this study was to evaluate changes in non-Ebola admissions and provision of surgery during the first year of the EVD outbreak.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Context</title><p id="Par13">Sierra Leone is a West African costal country bordering Guinea to the north and east, and Liberia to the south. In 2015, the population were 7,09 million, divided in 14 districts. The health care system in Sierra Leone is comprised of public, private for-profit, and private non-profit actors and is organized into three tiers of care: peripheral health units, district/regional hospitals, and tertiary hospitals. The governmental is the largest sector where the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) formulates policies, mobilizes resources, and monitors and coordinates health care at the central level. Secondary care is delivered in district hospitals typically with more than 100 beds covering a population of about 500,000. There are three regional hospitals which also provide more specialized care. In the capital Freetown, there are furthermore three tertiary hospitals, of which two offer surgical care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Total expenditure on health care was $ 590 million or $95 per capita, of which 62% was private out-of-pocket contributions, 31% was derived from donor support, and 7% came from the government. Some 45% of the total expenditures were spent on hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The country has 0.4 hospital beds per 1000 inhabitants (2006 figures) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Most hospitals operated by private non-profit actors were either faith-based institutions or non-governmental organizations, both with significant international support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par14">All hospitals offering surgery and anesthesia within an operation theatre in Sierra Leone prior to the EVD outbreak were assessed in a collaborative undertaking between the MOHS, the non-governmental organization CapaCare, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Twenty-one community health officers employed in a surgical task sharing training program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] collected the data using the District Health Information System 2 (DHIS 2) software installed on Huawei Mediapad 7 and is previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Weekly accumulated non-Ebola admissions, inguinal hernia repairs, caesarean deliveries, and all surgeries were collected from readily available hospital logbooks. Data were obtained from the first 38&#x000a0;weeks of the year during an initial visit to all hospitals in September 2014, and later during bi-weekly visits until the end of May 2015, altogether totaling 72&#x000a0;weeks. The two most commonly performed surgical operations in Sierra Leone before the EVD outbreak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], inguinal hernia repair and caesarean delivery, were selected for the study as inguinal hernia repair is a predominantly non-acute surgical intervention performed even in humanitarian emergencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], while caesarean delivery is almost exclusively an acute operation in Sierra Leone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

Median weekly non-Ebola admissions during the first year of the outbreak (week 21 of 2014 to week 20 of 2015) were compared against median weekly admissions in the first 20&#x000a0;weeks of 2014, before the onset of the EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone. To excluded seasonal variations, the surgical volume during the EVD epidemic was compared against similar weeks in 2012 from previously obtained data from the same hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The same data sources and approach were applied to obtain the 2012 data as the present study. All comparisons are performed on the weekly medians, for which the Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine if there were differences in admissions or the volume of surgeries performed. The manuscript is prepared according to the STROBE checklist for cross-sectional studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The study did not require an ethics approval from the local ethics committee, which was confirmed by Office of the Sierra Leone Ethics and Scientific Review Committee. The Director of Research and Non-Communicable Diseases (MS) and the Director of Hospitals and Laboratory Services (DAB-T) of the MOHS approved the study, highlighting that risks for data collectors had to be minimized; hence, data collection needed to be safe, rapid, and cost-effective. Access to the facility registry books was facilitated by the MOHS in which they encouraged all hospitals to share the required data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The main ethical considerations were focused on the safety of the data collectors. As professional health care workers, they had, prior to the hospital visits, received training in infection prevention control and were equipped with personal protective equipment. The registry books were kept in separate rooms from patients; hence, the data collectors were not exposed to symptomatic patients potentially infected with EVD. As public transportation posed the highest risk of accidental EVD exposure, we provided data collectors with a travel allowance to ensure safe movement.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results</title><p id="Par17">Out of the 42 hospitals known to perform inpatient surgery in Sierra Leone before the EVD outbreak, two were closed throughout the data collection period and excluded.

A systematic review which evaluated the effects of the West African EVD on healthcare utilization found that the uptake of health service provision (services less available, patients fear and stigma) seemed to be more pronounced than the volume of health care provision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Already before the EVD outbreak, the annual rate of hospitalizations per 1000 inhabitants in Sierra Leone were less than 10% of the average for Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. To what extent this dramatic reduction of hospital care increased mortality is unknown, but its impact is likely considerable, especially in comparison with the 4000 Sierra Leonean EVD deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Almost 7500 (41% weekly median reduction) fewer surgeries performed is also substantial, knowing that only 8% of surgical needs were met in the country prior to the EVD outbreak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Others have reported reductions in hospital admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and volume of surgeries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] during the recent West-African EVD outbreak, but the short observation time for only selected groups of patients from a single or minimal institutions makes those findings less representative. A system wide study like the present seems to be able to revile additional patterns which are not found from assessments of single institutions.</p><p id="Par23">We were surprised that the volume of caesarean deliveries did not change during the EVD outbreak, as this contradicted reports during the outbreak that described an almost complete breakdown of maternal health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The fact that governmental hospitals managed to increase the volume of caesarean deliveries during the EVD epidemic is impressive, since maternity services are particularly vulnerable to nosocomial EVD infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and obstetric care is known to be exceptionally challenging during an Ebola outbreak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. We believe that the urgency of cesarean deliveries which is far more likely to be a lifesaving operation compared to a hernia repairs, were the main reason cesarean deliveries were prioritized before the latter. Regional data and further analysis of normal and caesarean deliveries from the current data set is described by Brolin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Non-Ebola admissions and the volume of surgeries performed during the outbreak saw fewer reductions in governmental hospitals. This might indicate that part of the activities in governmental hospitals functioned better or were given higher prioritization than in the private non-profit hospitals. The absolute and relative increase in the emergency surgical procedure caesarean delivery and the decrease in the non-emergency operation inguinal hernia repairs imply that the governmental hospitals adapted adequately in terms of being able to prioritize the most needed surgical services. External factors, such as the establishment of a telephone service for medical emergencies, increased use of ambulances which mostly referred patients to governmental hospitals and the reluctance of traditional birth attendants to assist with deliveries because of the fear of contracting EVD are possible contributions to the increase in caesarean deliveries at governmental hospitals. Resilience refers to the health care system&#x02019;s ability to absorb disturbance, adapt, and respond with the provision of needed services during a crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Looking solely at the provision of caesarean delivery in the governmental hospitals during the EVD outbreak, elements of resilience were demonstrated.</p><p id="Par25">The substantial reduction in both admissions and surgeries performed in the largely internationally supported private non-profit hospitals indicates that limited foreign resources were directed towards managing routine health care at the hospital level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Preliminary results were published early in the outbreak to rapidly share the data during the crisis in order to inform the response priorities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Some private hospitals were found to be closed during the peak of the epidemic, while others actively reduced or stopped admissions of non-Ebola patients and focused solely on managing EVD cases. The epidemic caused dramatic additional challenges for the function of hospitals, particularly in the beginning of the outbreak before designated Ebola treatment units were sufficiently established. Revision of the hospital triage systems, increased isolation capacity, new infection prevention measures, and the development of supply chains for EVD-related commodities became imperative for the provision of routine health care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Difficulties encountered by hospitals in providing safe environments was the most common reason given for closure of private hospitals. On the other hand, governmental facilities remained open for emergency admissions and surgeries throughout the outbreak, despite the challenges encountered in establishing safe hospitals. The courageous undertaking by governmental health care workers to provide essential hospital services was however not accomplished without costs. By May 2015, 6.85% of the country&#x02019;s doctors, nurses, and midwives had died of EVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], which represented a rate of 100 times higher cumulative incidence compared with the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Non-Ebola hospital facilities were associated with 47% of the EVD infections among health care workers, compared with 11% for EVD isolation units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">The strengths of this study are the broad inclusion of 40 facilities that performed most of the surgeries in the country prior to the EVD outbreak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the completeness of the data, the long observation period of 72&#x000a0;weeks, and the utilization of local surgical providers as data collectors. A potential classification bias was that EVD patients early in the outbreak, before designated Ebola treatment units were sufficient, might have been recorded as Non-Ebola admissions. It was not possible to trace or adjust this retrospectively and the consequence of the potential misclassifications is an over reporting of non-Ebola admissions in this material. Obtaining data from readily available logbooks always represents a source of error; however, we have not been able to identify recording habits in the facility registry books that diverge from the actual activity performed. Another potential bias was that non-Ebola admissions during the EVD outbreak were compared against the first 20&#x000a0;weeks of 2014, which do not adjust for seasonal variations in admissions. The first 20&#x000a0;weeks of the year is dry season, with easier access to hospitals. However, malaria as one of the main causes for severe morbidity potentially in need of hospitalizations are more prevalent during the wet season. How those and other factors influence hospitalizations are not clear. Volume of surgery were however compared against identical weeks of 2012, of which seasonality should not affect the results. Also Brolin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] compared cesarean deliveries during the EVD outbreak against the first 20&#x000a0;weeks of 2014, which together with a potential selective increase in volume of caesarean deliveries in the governmental hospitals and not in the private hospitals between 2012 and 2014, may explain discrepancies in some of the results presented. This study does not fully capture all hospitals in Sierra Leone, as there are a few highly specialized hospitals that do not perform surgeries, such as a pediatric and a psychiatric hospital.</p><p id="Par27">In the absence of applicable tools to monitor hospital functioning during a disaster in resource-limited settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], better uses of readily available routine data is a straightforward and affordable alternative that should be explored further. Evaluating hospital functions based on volume of surgeries is a gross simplification, but seem relevant in this context. An example is the increased provision of the emergency surgical cesarean delivery at the expense of the more non-emergent hernia repairs which indicates that elements of resiliency was observed. Surgery is one of the most advanced and resource demanding services offered at hospitals in general and requires a functioning infrastructure and a broad range of support functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], such as laboratory-, radiology-, anesthesia-, together with pre- and post-operative services. Further studies are needed to explore the relationship between provision of surgery and the hospital&#x02019;s capacity to deliver other essential health care services, as well as the relevance of surgical volume as an indicator of hospital functions in resource constrained areas.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par28">Admissions and volume of surgery were less reduced during the EVD outbreak in governmental hospitals compared with private hospitals. In a crisis context where more comprehensive healthcare system information tools are not feasible to implement, available routine data can be a straightforward alternative, and volume of surgery is a promising indicator of hospital functions that should be further explored. The governmental hospitals&#x02019; ability to absorb the reduction of cesarean deliveries in the private hospitals can be seen as encouraging seeds of healthcare system resilience worth cultivating in the post-Ebola recovery phase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec12"><p>
