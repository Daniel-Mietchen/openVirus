The Transmission Reduction Intervention Project (TRIP) evaluated a network intervention to detect individuals recently infected (in the past 6 months). TRIP was conducted in Greece (2013&#x02013;2015) and focused on drug injector networks. Based on HIV status, testing history, and the results of an assay to detect recent infections, TRIP classified drug injector &#x0201c;Seeds&#x0201d; into groups: Recent Seeds (RS), and Control Seeds with Long-term HIV infection (LCS). The network members of RS and LCS were traced for two steps. The analysis included 23 RS, 171 network members of the RS, 19 LCS, and 65 network members of the LCS. The per-seed number of recents detected in the network of RS was 5 times the number in the network of LCS (Ratio RS vs. LCS: 5.23; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.54&#x02013;27.61). The proportion of recents among HIV positives in the network of RS (27%) was approximately 3 times (Ratio RS vs. LCS: 3.30; 95% CI: 1.04&#x02013;10.43) that in the network of LCS (8%). Strategic network tracing that starts with recently infected persons could support public health efforts to find and treat people early in their HIV infection.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Starting early antiretroviral treatment (ART) benefits HIV-infected people and reduces sexual HIV transmission<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.

If a person recruited by TRIP has recently acquired HIV, it is likely that the person who infected him/her, others whom that infector may recruit, and those whom the index person has infected are located in the same network.

The questionnaire asked the participants to name their network members: people they injected or had sex with in the past six months; people who injected or had sex in their presence in the past six months; and people who injected, used drugs or had sex with people the participants had injected or had sex with. TRIP staff also asked them to indicate venues they usually visit to use drugs, to have sex, or to meet new sex partners. Participants were asked to provide identifying information about the network contacts they named, which was electronically recorded and could help the staff validate links: names and/or nicknames and type of relationship, demographics including gender, age and nationality, physical characteristics including height, build, eyes, hair, scars, tattoos, and contact details. Participants were given coupons corresponding to people they named, which the nominees had to show to the project staff before recruitment.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Network tracing</title><p>Network members of RS and LCS were recruited for two steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). We tested network members for HIV; if they were positive, we carried out LAg tests and quantified plasma HIV-RNA. Recents in networks were defined as newly HIV-diagnosed individuals with documented testing history of recent infection (last negative &#x02013; first positive test&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;6 months) irrespective of their LAg ODn value or with LAg ODn&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;1.5 if testing history was unknown. Antibody negative samples of network members were tested for HIV-RNA in pools of 10 to identify acute infections who were classified as recents for the analyses. In order to maximize the number of potential highly infectious network members, Borderline Recents found in networks were also recruited. These were newly HIV-diagnosed individuals who did not meet the definition of recent in networks as described above. They had, however, (i) documented or very reliable self-reported testing history of HIV infection in the last 9 months (last negative &#x02013; first positive test&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;9 months) irrespective of their LAg ODn value or (ii) had unknown testing history but very high viral load typical of recent infection (&#x0003e;5&#x02009;log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml) regardless their LAg ODn value.

On the other two measures, the proportion of recents in the networks and the incidence of recent infection in the networks, the comparison ratios ranged from 1.6 to 4.2 but the confidence intervals overlapped. Nonetheless, the overall pattern of results provides a proof of concept for the underlying hypothesis that the networks of recents will contain more recents than the networks of longer-term HIV-positives<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.</p><p>The present findings suggest that efforts to seek, test, and treat recents can be accelerated by using strategic, network-based approaches. Finding and treating people soon after infection protects their health; and fears about toxicity and resistance have not been supported by carefully-conducted trials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Further, reducing viral loads as early as possible is likely to decrease the expected number of transmissions in a community<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Although a mathematical model of the South African epidemic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> questioned whether targeting recents there would reduce transmissions over the long term, both the generalizability of the epidemic to other settings and the adequacy of the modeling have been challenged by other modelers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and phylogeneticists<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Finally, recents and especially acutely infected people may also be appropriate targets for therapeutic vaccines, should these become available<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>.</p><p>One issue that might appear paradoxical is the higher proportion of HIV+ participants in the network of long-term infected seeds than in the network of recent seeds. We understand this finding as the logical consequence of the relatively short history of the HIV outbreak among PWID in Athens, which began only in 2011<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Long infection chains were established relatively rapidly and those infected at that time are now by definition long-term infected. Yet their networks have not had time to change all that much, so there will be a statistical tendency for their recruitment networks to include others who were infected at that time. The HIV epidemic slowed down before TRIP began. The recent seeds we were recruiting later at TRIP were members of recent infection chains at a time when improvements in harm reduction availability, the effects of ARISTOTLE as an intervention, drug users&#x02019; own protective actions, fluctuating behavioral risk, the firewalls network effect, and declining community viral loads due to ART use had reduced the rate of new infections<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Thus, although the recruitment of other recents is higher in the networks of recents for all the reasons stated here, they are likely to be in parts of the PWID community where long term HIV is less prevalent. Higher HIV prevalence in the networks of LCS could also be partially attributed to the fact that the proportions of sex workers and of HIV positives among sex workers were higher in the networks of LCS than in the networks of RS.</p><p>This work is subject to a number of limitations. First, fewer recents were recruited than had been anticipated because the outbreak in Athens had leveled off before TRIP started<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. The TRIP intervention itself is a novel model. This plus staffing limitations may also have limited recruitment. Research is needed to learn how to recruit network/venue members more rapidly and cost effectively. Our team has begun such research in Ukraine. Secondly, given that this is a network intervention, sampling was neither random nor statistically independent. This limits the accuracy of confidence interval estimates. Thirdly, although the higher contact tracing ratio of recently infected people in networks of recent seeds probably reflects their higher density in the networks of recent seeds than in the networks of the longer-time infected seeds, we cannot rule out other explanations. Alternative explanations might include that it is a result of higher concern among members of the networks of recent seeds to protect themselves and others upon learning that there may be highly infectious people among their friends and networks; or greater attention by project staff at tracing recent seeds&#x02019; networks. Project staff made every effort to spend equal time in tracing both kinds of networks. Our finding that the proportion of recents among positives in networks is higher among members of recent seeds&#x02019; networks supports, however, the argument that the higher contact tracing rate is due to higher density of recents in the networks of recent seeds. Finally, the network size of recent seeds is bigger than the network size of long-term control seeds. By design, TRIP moves two steps away from seeds in both arms. In addition, if a recent was found in networks of seeds, contacts of the newly identified recents were also recruited for 2 rounds. Consequently, the difference in network size between recent seeds and long-term control seeds could be partly explained by the need to trace the network members of these additional recents who were found in the networks of recent seeds.</p><p>This paper provides evidence that strategic, social network tracing techniques can effectively locate people recently infected with HIV. Further research is needed to confirm the results, to find easier-to-implement ways to recruit social network members, and to improve the speed with which HIV-positives can be tested for recent infection preferably at the time and place of HIV testing. Next generation seek, test, and treat interventions could benefit from focusing on the seek component within the networks of those recently infected.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Nikolopoulos, G.
