    "Tremendous effort has been given to the development of diagnostic tests, preventive vaccines, and therapeutic medicines for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Much of this development has been based on the reference genome collected on January 5, 2020. Based on the genotyping of 15â€¯140 genome samples collected up to June 1, 2020, we report that SARS-CoV-2 has undergone 8309 single mutations which can be clustered into six subtypes. We introduce mutation ratio and mutation h-index to characterize the protein conservativeness and unveil that SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein, main protease, and endoribonuclease protein are relatively conservative, while SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, spike protein, and papain-like protease are relatively nonconservative. In particular, we have identified mutations on 40% of nucleotides in the nucleocapsid gene in the population level, signaling potential impacts on the ongoing development of COVID-19 diagnosis, vaccines, and antibody and small-molecular drugs."
