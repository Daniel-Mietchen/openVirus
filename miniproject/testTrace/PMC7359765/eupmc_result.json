    "BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has aroused global health concerns, particularly in relation to diabetes where it has been associated with poorer outcomes. The bulk of the evolving evidence in diabetes and COVID-19 relates to type 2 diabetes (T2D). Since there are a significant number of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) with unique concerns and challenges during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we reviewed existing literature, relevant websites, and related guidelines to form this narrative review to help address key questions in this area.MethodsWe systematically searched the PubMed database up to May 31, 2020, and retrieved all the articles published on T1D and COVID-19.ResultsWe found 18 relevant articles, each of which carried a part of the evidence regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 in patients with T1D, effect of COVID-19 on development of T1D, outcomes in T1D with COVID-19, and special management issues in T1D in the light of COVID-19. These have been documented in the present review.ConclusionCOVID-19 with T1D presents special challenges. While the available evidence does shed some light, we need more evidence to deal with this difficult duo."
