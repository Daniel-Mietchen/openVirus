Case Records of fourteen COVID-19 patients treated at Medanta Hospital, Gurgaon were analyzed to compare symptomatology with data obtained from published literature. Further, a careful correlation was done with the data collected from selected Ayurvedic classical texts and expert views of clinical practitioners to arrive at a preliminary Ayurvedic clinical profile of COVID-19.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>COVID-19 can be provisionally understood from the Ayurvedic perspective as <italic>v&#x00101;takapha</italic> dominant <italic>sannip&#x00101;tajvara</italic> of <italic>&#x00101;gantu</italic> origin with <italic>pitt&#x00101;nubandha</italic>.

India does not figure in the most severely affected countries [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] but fares worse than the top affected nations in key medical infrastructure and health care investments. India has fewer hospital beds and doctors per 1000 people than any of the countries affected by COVID-19 [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In terms of personal hygiene, a section of the population may not even have adequate facilities for washing hands with soap frequently or hand sanitizers, a basic preventive measure [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, those who progress into critical stages would require intensive care and this can pose a major challenge for the limited hospital resources and capacities in case of a sudden spike in infections.</p><p id="p0015">Considering the fact that COVID-19 requires a structured approach covering preventive care, management in early stages of confirmed disease as well as hospital care for moderately and critically ill patients, it is imperative that the capacity of the AYUSH sector is harnessed to ensure optimal use of the scarce health care resources available in the country. The World Health Organization has also recommended inclusion of traditional medicine in its COVID-19 strategic preparedness and response plan [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The focus should not be to just deploy this workforce as a standby option, but to utilize its therapeutic management potential in complementing the treatment administered by modern medicine. Pluralism is one of the core principles in Indian health system as outlined in the National Health Policy 2017, which calls for integrative health practices to achieve national health goals and objectives [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">To move in this direction, it becomes necessary to develop an Ayurvedic diagnostic and treatment protocol for integration into the standard treatment guidelines of COVID-19. We have a precedent in China, where Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) doctors were actively involved in the treatment of COVID-19 patients and the TCM diagnostic classification as well as treatment was integrated into the official management guideline. More than 60,000 patients received TCM medications based on this protocol [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and TCM interventions have also been included in the official handbooks that recommend protocols for management of COVID-19 [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. TCM interventions have also figured in research studies that have been initiated to discover a remedy for the disease [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p id="p0025">In this paper, we are demonstrating that it is possible for Allopathic and Ayurvedic doctors to cooperate and work together to understand the disease better from an Ayurvedic perspective. This will be the first step to develop an integrative treatment protocol incorporating Ayurveda for best outcomes in the management of COVID-19.</p><p id="p0030">An Ayurvedic assessment of the disease can help to classify the clinical presentations of COVID-19 on the basis of the <italic>trido&#x01e63;a</italic> framework (the three <italic>do&#x01e63;as</italic> called <italic>v&#x00101;ta</italic>, <italic>pitta</italic> and <italic>kapha</italic> represent the self-regulatory mechanisms of the body, the failure of which leads to development of disease). It is seen that the clinical presentations of the patients are different with the lower respiratory, gastrointestinal or upper respiratory systems being variably affected in patients [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The question that we are addressing in this paper is whether such clustering of symptoms can be interpreted based on an Ayurvedic understanding of the pathogenesis with reference to imbalance of <italic>trido&#x01e63;as</italic>. This would lead to development of appropriately specific Ayurvedic interventions that can be integrated into the evolving COVID management protocol.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methodology</title><p id="p0035">In the prevailing circumstances, Ayurvedic physicians are unable to directly examine COVID-19 patients clinically. For this reason, a triangulation approach has been used for the study. The steps were 1) Study the existing clinical data from review of current scientific literature, 2) Review prospective clinical data collected from hospital documentation and regular discussion with the clinicians treating COVID19 patients and 3) Review relevant Ayurveda literature with the inputs of expert clinicians. The three-pronged strategy in the respective sequence covered the following aspects:</p><p id="p0040">A detailed literature review of the reported typical clinical presentation based on existing data sources such as journal articles and interim clinical guidance on management of patients by agencies such as US CDC (as on April 30, 2020) was undertaken [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The global overview reports were screened for key terms relating to COVID19 symptoms, pathogenesis and stagewise understanding. As the clinical presentation is found to vary widely, research papers reporting clinical symptoms of patient cohorts from different parts of the world were also reviewed to identify outliers and atypical presentations.</p><p id="p0045">A quick scoping of PubMed found around 569 articles on COVID19 based on a search with the key words COVID 19, symptoms. It was found that papers reported symptoms related to COVID-19 from specific clusters and cohorts of patients and the information could not be generalized to the larger population. Interim guidelines issued by international agencies like US CDC and WHO [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which were drafted by reviewing published research papers were selected to study the clinical presentation of COVID-19. Eighteen most relevant papers reviewed by US CDC and WHO were shortlisted for a detailed review based on the following inclusion criteria &#x02013; 1) Paper reports from large samples of patients from representative regions of the outbreak of COVID-19, 2) Papers reporting typical presentations of the disease, 3) Papers reporting atypical presentations of the disease.</p><p id="p0050">Clinical case documentations of fourteen COVID-19 patients treated at Medanta Hospital, Gurgaon was examined prospectively. Necessary ethical approval for patient data review was obtained and a confidentiality agreement was signed with the hospital. Baseline data was compiled with a structured questionnaire covering clinical symptomatology and laboratory reports of each patient at the time of admission. This data also included assessment of co-morbidities and other prescriptions at the time of admission. A second set of data was collated, summarizing assessments done during hospital stay. Regular discussions and interactions with the treating allopathic clinicians during the course of management provided individual case narratives and focused clinical perspectives about each patient.</p><p id="p0055">Subsequently, an independent analysis of Ayurvedic literature was carried out. This included three major classical texts (<italic>B&#x01e5b;hattray&#x0012b; &#x02013; Carakasamhit&#x00101;, Su&#x0015b;rutasa&#x01e43;hit&#x00101;, A&#x01e63;&#x01e6d;&#x00101;&#x01e45;gah&#x01e5b;daya&#x01e43;</italic> and their important commentaries (by <italic>Cakrap&#x00101;&#x01e47;i</italic>, <italic>Aru&#x01e47;adatta</italic>, <italic>Hem&#x00101;dri</italic>, <italic>Indu</italic> and <italic>Dalha&#x01e47;a).</italic> In addition, specific diagnostic literature viz. the <italic>Jvaranir&#x01e47;aya</italic> (an exclusive text on management of fevers), <italic>Yogaratn&#x00101;kara</italic> (a medieval textbook on Ayurveda), <italic>Bh&#x00101;vaprakasa</italic> and <italic>M&#x00101;dhavanid&#x00101;na</italic> (a classical text on diagnosis, etiopathogenesis and differential stage wise classifications) were also studied. Five clinical conditions described in these texts were examined to develop correlation with COVID-19. These were fever (<italic>jvara</italic>), cough (<italic>k&#x00101;sa</italic>), dyspnoea (<italic>&#x0015b;v&#x00101;sa</italic>), consumption (<italic>r&#x00101;jayak&#x01e63;m&#x00101;</italic>) and poisoning (<italic>vi&#x01e63;a</italic>) including Ayurvedic descriptions of the co-morbidities that indicate poor prognostic outlook for COVID-19. Since COVID-19 is a new disease and not previously described in Ayurvedic classical texts, a detailed study of the etiology (<italic>nid&#x00101;na</italic>), status of <italic>trido&#x01e63;a</italic>, structural elements (<italic>d&#x0016b;&#x01e63;ya</italic>) and site of disease (<italic>sth&#x00101;na</italic>) was done. The book <italic>Siddh&#x00101;ntanid&#x00101;na</italic> by Ga&#x01e47;anatha Sen was reviewed to understand approaches to study new diseases based on principles of Ayurveda. The analysis of sections on epidemics (<italic>janapadodhva&#x01e43;sa</italic>) and diseases of exogenous origin (<italic>&#x00101;gantukavik&#x00101;ra</italic>) was also undertaken. Host-pathogen specific interactions as observed in COVID-19 were analysed on the basis of the Ayurvedic understanding of the clinical progression of <italic>&#x00101;gantuka</italic> diseases. The pathogenesis of the disease was traced from the point of contact with the causative agent (SARS-CoV-2) and its development through the asymptomatic, presymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe and critical stages culminating in recovery or death. This was also corroborated with insights from experienced Ayurveda physicians in the team.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Findings &#x00026; results</title><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>Disease profile as per current scientific literature</title><p id="p0060">The incubation period of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is approximately two weeks. Symptoms can manifest within 4&#x02013;5 days after infection and majority will become sick by 11&#x02013;12 days. In rare cases it can be delayed even up to 24 days [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p id="p0065">According to the US CDC, symptoms present at onset of COVID-19 are highly variable. However, in the stage of full-blown disease, 83&#x02013;99 percent of patients develop fever, 59&#x02013;82 percent have cough, 44&#x02013;77 percent have fatigue, 40&#x02013;84 percent have anorexia, 31&#x02013;40 patients have shortness of breath, 28&#x02013;33 percent have sputum production and 11&#x02013;35 percent have myalgias [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p id="p0070">Fever, Cough (dry) and Shortness of breath are considered to be the cardinal symptoms of COVID-19.

Vomiting and diarrhea are seen only in less than 10% of the cases. Likewise, upper respiratory symptoms like sore throat, rhinorrhea and headache are sporadically reported. Hemoptysis may also be seen in a similar percentage of cases [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>]. Skin eruptions have been rarely reported [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It has been observed in certain cohorts that patients who exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms tend to have longer time from onset to admission and more laboratory derangements [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Although age is a higher risk for a bad prognosis, even people in the younger age group without co-morbidities have higher risk of death than that of seasonal influenza [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Patients with comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cancer are at a high risk for complications and death due to COVID-19 [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p id="p0085">Interestingly, patients tested positive for COVID-19 have also been reported to be asymptomatic as noticed with patients aboard the ship Diamond Princess [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Though subsequent studies have been conducted, the percentage of this occurrence is not accurately known.

If the disease becomes severe, then shortness of breath indicating pneumonia can develop with or without high grade fever. It can progress to severe pneumonia and ARDS of varying severity, which can be life threatening. In the event of an over-exuberant immune response, complications can arise as a result of damage to the lungs. Pneumonia may be mild or severe, ARDS may be mild, moderate or severe requiring oxygenation or ventilator support. Especially in some young people, the immune system can go into an overdrive and manifest the cytokine storm syndrome, which can cause severe lung damage and death. The SARS-CoV-2 induced infection can also be associated with a coagulopathy.

Three of them were hypertensive, one also had cardiovascular disease and one had BPH. Patient 6, who was hypertensive and had cardiac disease, became very critical requiring ventilatory support as well as prolonged stay in hospital and eventually died on the 37th day. This patient (P6) tested negative on the 18th day but again tested positive on 24th day before turning severely critical. P6 had exhibited severe anxiety and irritability during the hospital stay and also reported the maximum number of thirteen symptoms. Patient 7 was the fastest to recover, testing negative on the fifteenth day and was discharged on the eighteenth day.

In this cohort, 35% of patients were asymptomatic at the time of admission and except for three patients who developed severe disease (21.43%) and one patient who became critical (7.14%), others developed mild to moderate symptoms during hospital stay (71.43%). P6 became critical and died (7.14%). The higher percentage of patients in the severe and critical category is an expected finding, considering the advanced age of the patients as well as presence of co-morbidities. Cough, throat pain and fever were dominant in this cohort, which have been reported as typical symptoms of COVID-19 patients. The symptoms seen were mainly related to upper and lower respiratory tract. Some patients also reported symptoms related to gastrointestinal tract. Apart from other generalized symptoms like fever and myalgia, psychological symptoms were also seen in some patients.

As pointed out earlier, three patients in the cohort of COVID-19 patients that we studied did not report fever and did not progress to severe or critical stage. Asymptomatic and presymptomatic patients will need to be studied closely to profile the prodromal signs of COVID-19. Pre-symptomatic patients develop symptoms later, but asymptomatic patients can remain so until they test negative.

However, the granularity of the <italic>do&#x01e63;a</italic> imbalance as well as its dynamic progression in the course of the disease warrants further investigation and analysis. The wide variation in the incubation period, clinical presentation, clinical course and outcomes of the disease is indicative of the complex interactions between the agent and host factors, which is understood in Ayurveda in terms of interaction between <italic>nid&#x00101;na</italic>, <italic>do&#x01e63;a</italic> and <italic>du&#x01e63;ya</italic>. The clinical course of the disease and its evolution into the critical stage in some patients with fatal outcome or disabilities after recovery is characteristic of the clinical course of <italic>sannip&#x00101;tajvara</italic> described in Ayurvedic texts. Further studies are needed to delineate the various clinical stages (<italic>vy&#x00101;dhyavasth&#x00101;s</italic>) of the disease to envisage specific therapeutic approaches.</p><p id="p0330">This study has several limitations. At the very outset, we pointed out that Ayurvedic physicians did not have direct access to COVID-19 patients, which ruled out the possibility of a comprehensive clinical assessment of COVID-19 on the basis of Ayurvedic parameters. We have tried to demonstrate that this challenge can be circumvented to some extent by interaction and discussion with Allopathic doctors who are treating COVID-19 patients. However, such an exercise, even when strengthened by review of published literature and classical Ayurvedic literature can only serve the purpose of developing a preliminary clinical profile of COVID-19 from the Ayurvedic perspective. The gaps have been pointed out indicating the specific areas where further studies based on clinical consultation with COVID-19 patients will be needed.</p><p id="p0335">The analysis of clinical data from Medanata demonstrates that it is possible for Ayurveda physicians to cooperate with Allopathic physicians treating COVID-19 patients and that interactions should be encouraged for developing a preliminary understanding of COVID-19 from an Ayurvedic perspective when Ayurvedic physicians do not have direct access to patients. However, it also reveals the challenges in gathering data that is clinically relevant for Ayurveda when Ayurvedic physicians are not directly involved in clinical examination of COVID-19 patients. A comprehensive Ayurvedic understanding of a new disease like this needs clinical examination of patients based on Ayurvedic parameters and a meticulous documentation of clinical symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><label>6</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0340">Based on a preliminary analysis of literature reporting clinical symptoms of COVID-19, study of clinical presentation of a cohort of COVID-19 patients and Medanta and a review of classical Ayurvedic literature, we suggest that COVID-19 can be classified as <italic>&#x00101;gantuka jvara</italic> with a <italic>v&#x00101;takaphapradh&#x00101;nasannip&#x00101;ta</italic> presentation. The dominance of <italic>pitta</italic> in certain stages of the disease and in some patients should be considered. However, COVID-19 needs to be further subclassified under the category of <italic>v&#x00101;takaphapradh&#x00101;nasannip&#x00101;tajvara</italic> on the basis of a more detailed analysis of clinical symptomatology of a cross section of COVID-19 patients representing diverse populations from different geographical regions in the world.</p><p id="p0345">This paper demonstrates that it is possible to develop provisional Ayurvedic clinical classifications of COVID-19 in consultation with modern medical doctors treating COVID-19 patients, in a regulatory environment that does not permit Ayurvedic doctors from directly managing COVID19 patients. Studies involving larger number of patients are needed to further develop the approach outlined in this paper and formulate a protocol that can be validated at the point of care. Since Ayurveda management is personalized, closer interactions of Ayurveda experts in hospital settings with patients tested positive is important to refine the clinical profiling.</p><p id="p0350">In India, the Central Government has created an Interdisciplinary AYUSH research Task force for COVID -19. The Task Force has set-up several working groups to explore the various possibilities of integrating Ayurveda with standard of care to deal with the COVID-19 epidemic more effectively. In the meantime, the Government of Kerala announced and rolled out a protocol and program for integrating Ayurveda into the management protocol of COVID19, in the State. This initiative shall implement preventive, mitigative and rehabilitative programs based on Ayurveda for better management of the COVID-19 epidemic in the State. Several other State governments are exploring similar possible integrative approaches. Such policy decisions may create a better integrative environment in the future which underlines the significance of this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of competing interest</title><p id="p0355">The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Johns Hopkins University</collab></person-group><chapter-title>Coronavirus COVID-19 global cases by the center for systems science and engineering</chapter-title><year>2020</year><publisher-name>CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University</publisher-name><comment>Available at:</comment><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html" id="intref0015">https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html</ext-link></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Frayer</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Pathak</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group><chapter-title>India's doctors worry the country is unprepared for a coronavirus surge. <italic>npr</italic></chapter-title><year>2020</year><comment>Available at:</comment><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/26/821895160/indias-doctors-worry-the-country-is-unprepared-for-a-coronavirus-surge" id="intref0020">https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/26/821895160/indias-doctors-worry-the-country-is-unprepared-for-a-coronavirus-surge</ext-link></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mampatta</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Das</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group><chapter-title>Doctors to hand wash: why India isn't ready for coronavirus crisis</chapter-title><year>2020</year><publisher-name>Business Standard</publisher-name><comment>Available at:</comment><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/coronavirus-india-s-readiness-a-concern-due-to-shortage-of-beds-drugs-120031401127_1.html" id="intref0025">https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/coronavirus-india-s-readiness-a-concern-due-to-shortage-of-beds-drugs-120031401127_1.html</ext-link></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref4"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>World Health Organisation</collab></person-group><chapter-title>COVID-19 strategic preparedness and response plan operational planning guidelines to support country preparedness and response</chapter-title><year>2020</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref5"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>National Health Policy</collab></person-group><year>2017</year><publisher-name>Government of India</publisher-name><comment>Available at:</comment><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nhp.gov.in/nhpfiles/national_health_policy_2017.pdf" id="intref0030">https://www.nhp.gov.in/nhpfiles/national_health_policy_2017.pdf</ext-link></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref6"><source>TCM aids treatments of over 60,000 COVID-19 cases in China - xinhua | English.news.cn.
