The site of delivery is particularly relevant as HIV transmission generally requires that the virus crosses a mucosal membrane to infect a new host. Here we undertake a pilot study comparing three vaccine delivery routes, two to the oral cavity (intraepithelial (iEp) and needle-free (NF-Injex)) as well as intramuscular (IM) delivery. These vaccinations utilized a recombinant HIV-1 Env trimer 10042.05 from an elite neutralizer, subject VC10042, that has previously induced high titers of cross-clade reactive V1V2 antibodies. The 10042.05.SOSIP fused trimer was administered with adjuvants R848 (Resiquimod), MPLA and Alhydrogel to characterize the innate cellular and anti-HIV Envelope (Env) antibody responses following the administration of the vaccine to the oral mucosa. Oral delivery of the 10042.05.SOSIP induced high titers of anti-V1V2 antibodies, which together with previous studies, indicates an immunogenic bias toward the V1V2 regions in 10042-derived Envs. Both types of oral vaccine delivery resulted in immunologic and serologic responses that were comparable to the IM delivery route. Furthermore, induction of anti-V1-V2 specific antibodies was best following iEp delivery of the oral vaccine identifying this as the optimal method to orally deliver this vaccine formulation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE026336</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9128-172X</contrib-id><name><surname>Sather</surname><given-names>D.

Efforts to increase access to antiretroviral therapies have brought the number of yearly deaths from HIV-1 to below 1 million per year (UNAIDS). However, decreases in the rate of viral acquisition have not kept pace and remain at 1.8M new infections each year, pushing the total number of infections toward 37 million people worldwide. Thus, development of an effective vaccine remains the ultimate goal for the induction of a protective, long lasting memory and rapid recall immune response to prevent infection from a future HIV exposure.</p><p>An effective HIV-1 vaccine remains elusive, with only one clinical trial, RV144, resulting in efficacy against viral acquisition [<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This trial resulted in ~34% reduction in viral acquisition, and follow-on analyses indicated that neutralizing antibodies were not associated with protection from infection [<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Rather, anti-V1V2 loop IgG was identified as the major correlate of reduced risk. In addition, Fc-mediated functional activity of the anti-V1V2 antibodies are associated with reduced risk of infection [<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These findings imply that non-neutralizing activities can contribute to protection in an eventual vaccine. While the field continues to focus on eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) [<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], there remain significant hurdles to overcome, including a need to induce a high degree of somatic mutation and the lack of germline B cell receptor recognition by Env immunogens [<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, optimizing strategies that elicit V1-V2 loop HIV antibody responses remains one that is achievable and desirable. Thus, there is significant need for the development vaccine antigens and delivery modalities that can accomplish this goal in a safe and effective manner.</p><p>There are currently licensed mucosally-administered vaccines for five different pathogens, most of which are administered orally to the gastro-intestinal associated lymphoid tissue (e.g., poliovirus) or nasally (e.g., influenza) [<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233577.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Such vaccines are known to elicit both local and systemic immune responses but can show variable efficacy, and some carry safety concerns due to their formulation. Vaccination in the intravaginal and intrarectal mucosal tissues can induce strong local immune responses, but systemic responses induced by these routes are modest [<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233577.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Direct vaccination into the oral mucosal tissue is a mucosal vaccination site that has been demonstrated to induce systemic immunity and has been shown to enhance immunity at distal mucosal sites [<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The oral mucosa is rich with accessible lymphoid tissue, including the ringed arrangement of lymphoid tissue known as the Waldeyer&#x02019;s tonsillar ring (WTR), which contains the tonsils, adenoids, and other lymphoid tissue [<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Vaccination into the oral mucosal tissue may allow for the localized, rapid uptake of antigen into primary lymphoid tissues to form germinal centers and promote antibody maturation. Further, the oral mucosal subepithelial layers are enriched with Langerhans cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages that may be readily engaged by vaccination and may promote efficient antigen uptake and presentation, along with robust trafficking to primary lymphoid tissues. Two recent studies evaluated oral vaccination to induce HIV-1 immunity [<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233577.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Both studies utilized vectored vaccines combined with recombinant protein and found that oral mucosal immunization induced systemic antibody responses that were similar in magnitude to that of systemic immunization. However, the induction of immunity by oral or IM immunization appears to be qualitatively different, eliciting nuanced innate responses.</p><p>We previously evaluated a recombinant HIV-1 Env trimer 10042.05 derived from an elite neutralizer, subject VC10042, in rabbits and found that it induced high titers of cross-clade reactive V1V2 antibodies and low potency neutralizing antibodies [<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Here, the recombinant Env was maintained as a native-like trimer by engrafting the C5-MPER region of BG505.SOSIP.559 native-like trimer and introducing disulfide bonds to increase the stability of the V3 loop [<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and ensured that this 10042.05.SOSIP binds to the trimer-specific antibody PGT151 [<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The goal was to conduct a pilot study in non-human primates to evaluate the induction of immunity by native-like SOSIP trimers via oral vaccination in comparison to peripheral IM vaccination. We undertook immunizations at the oral mucosa by two approaches, intra-epithelial injection (iEp) and needle free (NF), as well as through IM injection. Innate immune responses were evaluated through transcriptomics and flow cytometry, in addition immune cell phenotypes (B cells) and anti-HIV serological responses to the vaccine were measured. Our findings indicate that oral vaccine delivery results in the initiation of the adaptive immune response with similarities to IM with regard to numerous immunologic and serologic responses. Importantly, the oral delivery route the 10042.05.SOSIP induced high titers of anti-V1V2 antibodies in NHP. Overall, our findings indicate that the iEp oral delivery route was superior to the needle-free approach with regard to the extent of the anti-V1-V2 antibody induction and that oral vaccination of Env trimers is a viable route for inducing immunity against HIV-1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Immunization of non-human primates</title><p>The fused trimeric 10042.05 Env previously tested was re-designed to express as a cleaved SOSIP trimer molecule.

Although groups of three animals were sufficient for this exploratory pilot study, the small group size limited our statistical power to detect differences in the serological readouts. All groups received the same dose of 100 micrograms of 10042.05.SOSIP trimer. All vaccines were combined with R848 (Resiquimod), a TLR 7/8 agonist known to stimulate B cell maturation, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), a TLR 4 agonist, and Alhydrogel (aluminum hydroxide) as adjuvants. IM doses were split and injected into each tricep. The dose and volume for NF and iEp were equivalent. Thus, all animals received the same amount of Env trimer per immunization, but the volume and absolute amount of Alhyrdogel differed between oral and IM routes. However, all immunizations contained the same vol/vol percentage of Alhydrogel, which was prepared according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.

This system uses compressed air to drive a jet of liquid that penetrates into the tissue and disperses, rather than creating a fluid body as is thought to occur with needle injection. This delivery method differs from that of Jones and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which uses sonication to drive the fluid injection into the tissue. Injex NF uses a mechanical device to create pressure behind a needle-free injection syringe.

Other potential pathways induced by iEp vaccination include: NFkB (NFkB1A (alpha subunit of IKK protein complex) and RIPK2 (Receptor-Interacting serine/threonine Protein kinase 2) and cell cycle regulation (CDC42 and RAC1). Conversely, iEp immunization significantly down-regulated four gene transcripts that are generally associated with different immune cell subsets: KLRD1 (NK cells), CD8b (T cells) as well as CD22 and CD79A (B cells), which could indicate cell egress from the oral mucosa to other sites for induction of adaptive responses. From these data we conclude that although the oral mucosa is predisposed for immune tolerance due to high antigen exposure, oral immunization can overcome this immune anergy to induce potent local immune responses. Most likely the delivery of TLR adjuvants directly into the tissue significantly contributed to the observed induction of immune-associated gene transcripts as both NFkB signaling and adaptive immunity signatures that were observed in the transcriptome are both downstream of TLR activation, highlighting the importance of adjuvant selection in oral vaccination strategies.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Systemic maturation/activation of blood dendritic cells following vaccination</title><p>The ability of vaccination to influence the activation status of important innate antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes, within the peripheral blood has been observed following a number of different vaccination strategies [<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]; however, these responses have been poorly characterized in HIV-1 vaccine studies.

Both the iEp and NF methods were tested and compared to IM injection of the identical vaccine formulation. Oral vaccine delivery resulted in the initiation of innate and adaptive immune response in a manner similar to IM delivery approach, although differences in the peripheral B cell compartment were noted. Importantly, irrespective of oral delivery method 10042.05.SOSIP induced high titers of anti-V1V2 antibodies, indicating an immunogenic bias toward the V1V2 regions. Finally, the iEp oral delivery method was determined to be best at inducing anti-V1-V2 antibodies.</p><p>One aspect of this study was to transcriptionally evaluate the earliest/innate immune response that were occurring at two different sites following the oral administration of the vaccine. We reasoned that the one-week post-vaccination timepoint would reveal key changes in the transcriptomic profile of innate immune cells at these two sites. The submandibular lymph nodes revealed an upregulation of a number of key pathways, with the genes associated with the adaptive immune response upregulation in both the iEp and NF vaccinated macaques. Further, evaluation of oral mucosal cheek tissue adjacent to the site of vaccination revealed an upregulation of gene transcripts associated with NFkB and cell cycle regulation likely reflecting an activation of immune cells due to the adjuvants (R848 and MPLA) utilized. Surprisingly, there was a down-regulation of gene transcripts associated with a number of key immune cell subsets (NK cells, B cells, T cells) at this site at 1-week post-infection. This could be attributed to these cells migrating from the mucosa to initiate the adaptive immune response in secondary lymphoid organs, such as the draining lymph node, where indeed a strong adaptive immune signature was observed. These early transcriptomic changes provide insights into the impact of the vaccine/adjuvant and how the vaccination at the oral mucosa sets the stage for the induction of the adaptive immune response, providing confidence that the oral mucosa was a good option for use as a site of vaccine delivery.</p><p>Both IM and oral immunization induced mDC maturation in peripheral blood, whereas only IM immunization induced measurable changes in the peripheral blood B cell subsets. Thus, although oral immunization induced systemic innate stimulation, it did not result in changes in the circulating peripheral B cell populations, despite inducing similar IgG titers as IM immunization. Further, oral immunization induced antibodies with similar binding avidity to IM immunization, indicating that both immunization routes induced a maturing antibody response. Thus, both routes are capable of inducing robust class-switched antibody responses, and presumably both immunization routes resulted local germinal center maturation, plasmablast tracking to the bone marrow, and the deposition of long-lived plasma cells to secrete serum IgG. This disparity in peripheral memory B cell proliferation may reflect that the cycles of B cell proliferation and maturation were somewhat compartmentalized in the oral lymphoid tissue, or that B cell trafficking in these tissues fundamentally differs from peripheral lymphoid tissue.</p><p>The lack of neutralizing antibodies was not particularly surprising based on previous studies, where thus far SOSIP Envs have not been successful in eliciting broad and potent heterologous neutralizing activity [<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and the extreme neutralization resistant phenotype of the parental 10042.05 virus [<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, our observation that immunization with 10042.05.SOSIP reliably elicited antibody responses biased toward the V1V2 regions is intriguing, and indicates that this Env may have utility as a vaccine aimed at inducing V1V2 responses. The fact that the fused and SOSIP versions of this Env both induced V1V2 antibodies implies that this Env is intrinsically structurally tuned to bias antibody responses toward the V1V2 region, rather than being a consequence of the assembly of this Env into native-like trimeric structure. Further, the low levels of vaccine-elicited anti-V3 antibodies also indicates that stabilization of the V3 in the SOSIP trimer was successful in dampening anti-V3 responses as measured by peptide binding. Thus far, research on V1V2 antibody responses, such as those induced in RV144, indicate that they are likely to mostly mediate non-neutralizing activities. Thus, it will be of significant interest to dissect the V1V2 responses that can be induced by 10042.05.SOSIP and to assess their Fc-mediated functional capacity.</p><p>While the oral mucosa remains a promising vaccine route, methods for immunizing in the oral mucosa need further refinement. Our comparison of oral immunization methods indicated that the iEp oral needle injection delivery route was superior to the NF approach in eliciting high levels of V1-V2 antibodies. This discrepancy in the two delivery routes is possibly due to variability in delivery of the vaccine utilizing the Injex NF device, which is commonly used to deliver liquid jets into the oral gum tissue that has a different structure and consistency than the cheek mucosal tissue [<xref rid="pone.0233577.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, it may be that needle free approaches need to be fine-tuned to deliver the vaccines to the proper depth and dispersion for maximal uptake in the subepithelial tissue. Although our results indicate that iEp injection was more reliable as a delivery route, needle delivery in the oral mucosa would likely face resistance to implementation due to needle fear. Thus, the optimization of needle free methodology would likely be important in developing vaccines reliant on oral inoculation.</p><p>Our findings from this pilot immunization study indicate that oral vaccination of Env trimers is a viable route for inducing systemic humoral immunity against HIV-1, capable of inducing immune responses similar in magnitude to that of intramuscular routes. Importantly, oral immunization induced robust systemic activation of innate immunity as well as driving relevant activation and transcriptional changes in the local lymph nodes, although we did not detect systemic changes in the circulating B cell populations. The lack of proliferation in the peripheral memory B cell compartment after oral mucosal immunization, despite robust antibody responses, will require further investigation, as does why IM was not superior in inducing peripheral antibody responses. Our ongoing studies are focused on evaluation of whether oral immunization results in antigen specific phenotypic differences in B stimulation and maturation, as well as assessing Fc-mediated effector functions of the V1V2 antibodies. Overall, our results indicate that the lymphoid rich oral mucosal tissues may be a powerful entry point into the immune system and warrants further investigations into how the induction of adaptive immunity in the oral mucosa can be harnessed to drive protective antibody responses against HIV-1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Animal care and ethics statement</title><p>All animal studies were conducted in accordance with protocol 4213&#x02013;04 approved by the Washington National Primate Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
