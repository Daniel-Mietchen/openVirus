    "This study was performed to describe the epidemiologic characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and explore risk factors for severe infection. Data of all 131 confirmed cases in Tianjin before February 20 were collected. By February 20, a total of 14/16 districts reported COVID-19 cases, with Baodi district reporting the most cases (n = 56). A total of 22 (16.8%) cases had a Wuhan-related exposure. Fever was the most common symptom (82.4%). The median duration of symptom onset to treatment was [1.0 (0.0-4.0) days], the duration of symptom onset to isolation [2.0 (0.0-6.0) days], and the duration of symptom onset to diagnosis [5.0 (2.0-8.0) days]. The analysis of the transmission chain showed two cluster infections with 62 cases infected. Transmission from a family member constituted 42%, usually at the end of transmission chain. Compared with patients with non-severe infections, patients with severe infections were more likely to be male (46.2 vs. 77.3%, P = 0.009) and had a Wuhan-related exposure (14.0 vs. 40.9%, P = 0.004). Multivariate logistic regression showed that male (OR 3.913, 95% CI 1.206, 12.696; P = 0.023) was an independent risk factor for severe infection. This study provides evidence on the epidemic of COVID-19 by analyzing the epidemiological characteristics of confirmed cases in Tianjin. Self-quarantine at an outbreak's early stage, especially for those with high-risk exposures, is conducive to prevent the transmission of infection. Further investigation is needed to confirm the risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection and investigate the mechanisms involved."
