Perinatal infection can cause severe neurological complications, including fetal and neonatal microcephaly, and in adults there is an association with Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome (GBS). ZIKV is transmitted to humans by <italic>Aedes</italic> sp. mosquitoes, yet little is known about its enzootic cycle in which transmission is thought to occur between arboreal <italic>Aedes</italic> sp. mosquitos and non-human primates. In the 1950s and &#x02018;60s, several bat species were shown to be naturally and experimentally susceptible to ZIKV with acute viremia and seroconversion, and some developed neurological disease with viral antigen detected in the brain. Because of ZIKV emergence in the Americas, we sought to determine susceptibility of Jamaican fruit bats (<italic>Artibeus jamaicensis</italic>), one of the most common bats in the New World. Bats were inoculated with ZIKV PRVABC59 but did not show signs of disease. Bats held to 28 days post-inoculation (PI) had detectable antibody by ELISA and viral RNA was detected by qRT-PCR in the brain, saliva and urine in some of the bats. Immunoreactivity using polyclonal anti-ZIKV antibody was detected in testes, brain, lung and salivary glands plus scrotal skin. Tropism for mononuclear cells, including macrophages/microglia and fibroblasts, was seen in the aforementioned organs in addition to testicular Leydig cells. The virus likely localized to the brain via infection of Iba1<sup>+</sup> macrophage/microglial cells. Jamaican fruit bats, therefore, may be a useful animal model for the study of ZIKV infection. This work also raises the possibility that bats may have a role in Zika virus ecology in endemic regions, and that ZIKV may pose a wildlife disease threat to bat populations.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>The rapid spread of Zika virus through a na&#x000ef;ve population in the Americas resulted in novel and severe disease manifestations, including fetal and neonatal microcephaly, and GBS. These disease complications make understanding the pathology and ecology of ZIKV a priority. Captive Jamaican fruit bats were challenged with ZIKV to determine their susceptibility, to assess whether bats may play a role in virus ecology, and if they might serve as an animal model to better understand ZIKV pathophysiology. The bats became acutely infected and mounted an antibody response. Three terminally euthanized inoculated bats had antibody titers of 3200, 28 days PI. Evidence of virus replication and associated pathologies were found in the brain, testes, lungs and salivary glands of some of the inoculated bats. The virus showed predilection for mononuclear cells, including resident Iba1<sup>+</sup> macrophage/microglial cells, and Leydig cells.</p><p>With no discernible disruption to the blood brain barrier nor distribution of viral antigen indicative of circumeventricular neuroinvasion, microglia cells may be a possible route of entry of ZIKV into brains of bats. Further investigations are needed to determine the mechanisms of neuroinvasion of ZIKV in bats, further determine feasibility of bats as an alternative animal-model for congenital Zika syndrome, and what role bats might play in ZIKV viral ecology.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Office of the Vice President for Research, Colorado State University</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1292-7650</contrib-id><name><surname>Schountz</surname><given-names>Tony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by startup funds from the Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology and the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, and the Vice President for Research at Colorado State University.

The first human cases were identified in 1954 in Nigeria and serosurveys found evidence of a broad geographic distribution for ZIKV throughout Africa and Asia with sporadic cases in humans [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The first recognized ZIKV epidemic occurred in Yap State, Federated State of Micronesia in 2007. An estimated 73% of residents were infected, and of those 18% presented with clinical disease [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In 2013, a second epidemic occurred in French Polynesia with 28,000 cases reported. During the latter outbreak, the incidence rate of Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome (GBS) increased 20-fold and first indication of a connection between ZIKV infection and GBS was established [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The virus spread to Brazil in 2015 [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and has since disseminated throughout much of tropical South America, Central America, the Caribbean, and the southern United States, with more than 200,000 confirmed cases [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. ZIKV can also cause congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) in na&#x000ef;ve populations and is therefore a virus of high concern [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Zika virus is maintained in an urban cycle, transmitted between an <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito vector and humans thereby maintaining endemicity [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is generally accepted that the virus transmits between non-human primates and vectors in a sylvatic cycle; however, the sylvatic cycle has not been well characterized in the Old World and little is known about a New World sylvatic cycle [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Molecular analysis of ZIKV to better understand viral phylogenetics suggests that animal hosts affected viral evolution and therefore may play an important role in viral ecology [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In the 1950s and &#x02018;60s, the susceptibility of bats to ZIKV was investigated. Shepherd and Williams [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] screened 172 wild bats from 12 different species in Uganda for antibodies against ZIKV and found 16/44 little free-tail bats (<italic>Tadarida pumila</italic>) and 26/36 Angolan free-tail bats (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>condylura</italic>) were seropositive by hemagglutination inhibition assay. Additionally, two Angolan free-tail bats were experimentally inoculated with ZIKV and serially bled to test for viremia. Both animals were viremic on days 2, 4 and 6 as determined by paralysis in mice inoculated with the sera from those two bats [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Simpson and O&#x02019;Sullivan [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] experimentally inoculated three straw-colored fruit bats (<italic>Eidolon helvum</italic>), three Egyptian fruit bats (<italic>Rousettus aegyptiacusi</italic>), and five Angolan free-tail bats. Two of the straw-colored fruit bats were viremic and had seroconverted. One of the Egyptian fruit bats was viremic and two had seroconverted. The Angolan free-tail bats were euthanized on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 days post inoculation and screened for viral tropism. At one day post infection, a kidney was trace positive [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Finally, Reagan et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] inoculated 20 New World little brown bats (<italic>Myotis lucifigus</italic>) by 5 different routes: intracranial, intraperitoneal, intradermal, intrarectal and intranasal. Bats in all groups, with the exception of the intranasal group, developed fatal neurological disease 4&#x02013;7 days post inoculation. Brain tissue was virus-positive in all animals with clinical disease, determined by inoculation of mice with brain homogenate suspension [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Considering the evidence that African bats are naturally susceptible to ZIKV and that little brown bats develop disease, the question emerged: could bats serve as a natural reservoir host for ZIKV in the New World? To test this hypothesis, we inoculated Jamaican fruit bats (<italic>Artibeus jamaicensis</italic>), among the most abundant bats in the Caribbean, Central America and Mexico, with ZIKV to examine virology, immunology and pathology of the infection. Although virus was detected in several organs, including the testes and brains, no overt clinical signs were detected, and substantial viremia or viruria was not evident. These results suggest that Jamaican fruit bats are unlikely to serve as amplification hosts but that ZIKV infection may constitute a wildlife disease threat to bats.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Experimental infections</title><p>Bats for this project were obtained from the Colorado State University breeding colony approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol 16-6512A).

In the pilot-study, three male bats (AJ-z7, AJ-z8, AJ-z9) were intradermally inoculated with 7.5x10<sup>5</sup> plaque forming units (pfu) ZIKV, strain PRVABC59; a high dose to assess susceptibility. No signs of disease were apparent during this 28 day experiment; however, all three bats had antibody titers of 3200 on day 28 (<xref rid="pntd.0007071.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). After demonstration of susceptibility in the pilot study, a time course study was conducted.

The goal was to determine whether bats can be used as an animal model for ZIKV pathogenesis and to assess the possible role of bats in ZIKV ecology in the New World.</p><p>In the pilot experiment, no signs of disease were apparent during the 28-day study. Sera collected at euthanasia indicated modest antibody titers of 3200 for each bat by ELISA (<xref rid="pntd.0007071.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), whereas the human -convalescent control serum titer was &#x02265;12,800. Bats typically have low to modest antibody titers, perhaps due to limited somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Concerning viremia, cell-serum supernatants, blind passage supernatants, and neat serum results were all negative. Although serum is routinely used for ZIKV diagnostics in humans, it may not be the most suitable sample [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In one investigation ZIKV patient had negative serum sample for the duration of the study, whereas whole blood yielded positive qRT-PCR results from days 9 to 101 [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. One possible explanation for the phenomenon of negative serum in human patients is that the virus during acute infection disseminates via a cell-associated viremia or as novel findings suggest that the virus gets phagocytized in neutrophils and therefore whole blood is a more sensitive diagnostic sample than serum.</p><p>Viruria is commonly detected in ZIKV-infected humans [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; therefore, urine may be an equally important diagnostic sample with higher viral load in early infection when compared to blood in humans and other primates [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although urine collection from bats was challenging, we collected urine from some of the inoculated bats in the time course study. AJ-z6 exhibited viruria only at 3 dpi, and AJ-z7 was equivocal only at 5 dpi, corroborating the findings in other mammals that urine may be a route of viral shedding early in infection. Urine from one human patient was positive from the first time point (6 dpi) through 14 dpi and again on day 56. Similarly, saliva from that same patient was positive from day nine through day 14 and again on day 49 [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Another investigation compared diagnostic samples of 80 infected patients and showed that urine was positive in 50 of them, whereas serum was only positive in 19 patients by qRT-PCR. The study concluded that viral loads in urine were ten-fold higher compared to serum and that uremia lasted longer [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These data corroborated the first study that identified ZIKV shed in urine in which there was a higher viral load in urine for longer duration compared to serum [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. ZIKV RNA in plasma was detected in the bats by qRT-PCR between 2 and 6 dpi, but between 2 to 17 dpi in urine [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The lack of detectable viremia in the serum of bats is congruent with some of the human and NHP investigations in that viremia is low and short-lived. Detached renal pelvic urothelial cells and degenerate salivary gland ductular epithelium as seen in the current study will make urine and saliva equally important fluids to collect in order to maximize detection of ZIKV in the acute and established stages of infections.</p><p>For this experiment, all male bats were used because female bats are prioritized for colony expansion. ZIKV exhibited tropism for the testes with strong immunoreactivity in reproductive organs (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007071.g004">4</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007071.g007">7</xref>). Histologically, minimal focal testicular degeneration in two bats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007071.g002">Fig 2</xref>) suggests viral related pathology may be minimal. In humans it has yet to be completely elucidated what reproductive organs harbor ZIKV, it has been determined that semen contains ZIKV both in both vasectomized and unvasectomized men [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This suggests that ZIKV is sequestered in the testes and/or accessory sex glands.

Limited investigation has been done relating to infection of accessory sex glands in mouse models, but one study that assessed the prostate found no virus, possibly due to differential expression of the receptor candidate in the testes but not in the prostate [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For this experiment the finding of viral antigen and viral RNA in the testes but not in the prostate is consistent with published animal models and may suggest the potential for bats to serve as another animal model.</p><p>Three bats had histopathological alterations in the hippocampus at later time points and one bat had viral nucleic acid present in the brain as determined by qRT-PCR demonstrating tropism for the CNS, a tissue predilection also documented in humans and animal models. ZIKV has a predilection for nervous tissue in animal studies and disease manifestation in humans. As a neurological teratogen, ZIKV has been detected in the brain mononuclear cells in human newborns with fatal microcephaly and fetal miscarriages. Histological lesions are varied but may include parenchymal calcification, microglial nodules, gliosis, cell degeneration, mononuclear infiltration and necrosis [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In non-human animal models, evidence for viral tropism has been found in brain and/or peripheral nervous tissue [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In immunocompromised mouse models, the virus has a predilection for the brain but with the mice engineered for specific immune traits it is difficult to know to what extent this recapitulates natural ZIKV pathophysiology [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In the bats used in this experiment, evidence of ZIKV-induced pathology in the brain is consistent with what has been seen in human newborns and fetuses.</p><p>The novel finding of co-localizing ZIKV antigen in bat Iba1<sup>+</sup> microglial/macrophage cells lends support to the earlier evidence of microglial cell infection via Axl ligand bridging ZIKV particles to glial cells [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Iba1 (aka, allograft inflammatory factor 1, Aif1) is a microglia/macrophage-specific calcium-binding protein, which has actin-bundling activity that participates in membrane ruffling and phagocytic activity of activated microglia. Activated microglial cells appeared with increased ability of cell migration and phagocytosis, which is controlled by remodeling of membrane cytoskeleton [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The morphology of cells with co-localization in the brain of infected bats is consistent with activated microglia depicting prominent branched processes. Recent primate models in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques demonstrated similar viral distribution of ZIKV antigen to that in bats, described herein. High-level of ZIKV was evident in cerebellar neurons and the same studies documented involvement of Iba1 positive microglial cells in CNS infections. In primate models there is increasing evidence that ZIKV antigen was detected in individuals with the highest peak plasma viremia, which in part implies that ZIKV may initially seed the CNS by a passive spillover from circulating monocytes to resident microglial cells. This is further substantiated in all of human and animal studies, which did not show any evidence of disruption to BBB or viral distribution reminiscent of circumventricular distribution seen in alphavirus animal models [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>In addition to brain and testes immunoreactivity, scrotal skin and mandibular salivary gland also harbored viral antigen. Distribution of viral antigen in bat tissues suggests that infection in this species recapitulates human infection, which is thought to start with infection of epidermal and dermal cells with subsequent dissemination to multiple organs including salivary glands as viral RNA can be detected in human saliva [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The histopathology for AJ-z5, 5 dpi showed sialoadenitis and the presence ZIKV antigen by IHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007071.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This suggests ZIKV may be shed in the saliva, although additional animal experiments need to be performed to confirm such a route of shedding. The results presented here suggest that Jamaican fruit bats may be a suitable animal model for examining ZIKV infection to elucidate its pathogenesis. Jamaican fruit bats may also serve as a model to ascertain sexual transmission, in utero transmission, teratogenesis and neurological pathophysiology. It may be that ZIKV is a wildlife disease threat for bats that could lead to infertility in some males, which could impact bat populations.</p><p>ZIKV is thought to be maintained in two different distinct cycles: sylvatic&#x02014;cycling between non-human primates (NHP) and mosquito species, and urban&#x02014;cycling between humans and mosquito species [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While there are limited data on what mosquito species feed on Jamaican fruit bats, evidence for natural flavivirus infection has been identified in wild New World bats. Dengue virus (DENV) RNA and antibodies to DENV were detected in multiple species of bats, including Jamaican fruit bats, in Mexico [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Additionally, antibodies to DENV were detected in multiple bat species including those of the <italic>Artibeus</italic> genus in Costa Rica and Ecuador [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. These data indirectly provide evidence for mosquito-bat interactions in the wild; either through consumption of bat-blood meals taken by mosquitoes or bat consumption of infected mosquitoes.</p><p>As it pertains to a wildlife reservoir, wild NHPs have antibody to ZIKV including several monkey species trapped near Ziika Forest [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and wild and semi-captive orangutans in Borneo [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Not only have NHP been found to be seropositive, but also many other mammals, including rodents, horses, cows, and goats [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Furthermore, experimental inoculation of various North American species resulted in seroconversion (cottontail rabbits, boar goats, pigs, and leopard frogs) and demonstrated viremia (nine-banded armadillo and leopard frogs) [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Molecular epidemiology suggests animals play an important role in an enzootic cycle [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Much about the enzootic cycle of ZIKV has yet to be understood but it stands to reason that bats may be capable of maintaining the virus in nature. Jamaican fruit bats are found in northern South America, Central America, and the Caribbean&#x02014;areas that now have ZIKV potentially exposing bat populations to the virus [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. However, the data presented here suggest it is unlikely that Jamaican fruit bats can serve as amplification hosts of ZIKV, unless virus sequesters in some as-yet unidentified way that could lead to periodic shedding of virus. It may also be that some bats become persistently infected and can transmit sexually to maintain virus within populations of bats. Further experimental and field studies will be necessary to fully understand the ecological role of bats in ZIKV maintenance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the Colorado State University (CSU) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol 16-6512A) and were in compliance with U.S. Animal Welfare Act.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Bats</title><p>CSU has a captive colony of Jamaican fruit bats (<italic>Artibeus jamaicensis</italic>), a neotropical fruit bat indigenous to much of South America, Central America and the Caribbean [<xref rid="pntd.0007071.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].

Hanging clothes were provided for roosting and coverage. Food and water are placed in open trays in the bottom of the cage and changed daily. Tray liners were changed every two days, and cages and hanging clothes are changed every two weeks. Due to the social nature of these bats, minimums of two bats were kept in cages at all times to mitigate potential stress.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Experimental inoculations</title><p>Two sets of experiments were performed; a pilot study and a time course study. Zika virus strain PRVABC59. PRVABC59 was isolated in 2015 by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Fort Collins, CO) from an infected individual who traveled to Puerto Rico (GenBank accession no. HQ234499). The virus stock titer is 3x10<sup>7</sup> plaque forming units (pfu) per ml of media, and the fourth passage was used for both studies.</p><p>For the pilot study, three male bats were anesthetized with 1% to 3% isoflurane to effect with an oxygen flow rate of 1.5 L/min, administered with a gas mask. Animals were placed on a heating pad to maintain body temperature and respirations continuously monitored. The dorsum of each animal was disinfected with 70% ethanol and 25ul containing 7.5x10<sup>5</sup> p.f.u of virus was administered subcutaneously (sc) at the level of the scapula with a sterile hypodermic 25 gauge needle in a biosafety cabinet. When procedures were finished, bats were removed from isoflurane and placed back in the cage in ventral recumbency. Respirations were monitored until animal was fully awake and ambulated normally. Bats were identified as AJ-z7, AJ-z8 and AJ-z9. Animals were euthanized at 28 days post-inoculation (dpi).</p><p>For the time course study, six male bats were anesthetized under the same protocol as the pilot study. Animals were placed in ventral recumbency. After disinfecting the dorsum of each animal with 70% ethanol, 0.15mls of 1% lidocaine was administered sc at the level of the last rib with a 25 gauge sterile hypodermic needle as a local anesthetic. IPTT300 transponders (BioMedic Data Systems, Inc., Seaford, DE) were inserted sc at the level of the caudal edge of the scapula. Twenty-five microliters containing 7.5x10<sup>5</sup> p.f.u of virus was administered sc at the level of the cranial edge of the scapula. Recovery followed the same protocol as for the pilot study bats. Animals were identified as AJ-z1 through AJ-z6. AJ-z1 and AJ-z2 were euthanized at two dpi. AJ-z3 and AJ-z4 were euthanized at 5 dpi. AJ-z5 and AJ-z6 were euthanized at 10 dpi.</p><p>Female bats were excluded from the study because they are prioritized for breeding to sustain and expand upon the colony.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Monitoring</title><p>For the pilot study, bats were visually monitored twice daily for fourteen days, and then monitored once a day for an additional fourteen days. For the time course study, bats were monitored twice a day throughout the experiment.

Urine was collected by allowing bats to grasp screen cloth with their feet and then the bat was placed in a clear solo cup (Dart Container, Lake Forest, IL) with the screen covering the top of the cup as a lid, and kept in place with a rubber band. This allowed the bats to hang in a clear container. Bats were monitored for 45 minutes. If they urinated, bats were removed from the collection contraption and placed back in the cage without disrupting the urine. Urine collection was attempted on all remaining bats at each time point, but not all bats would urinate at each collection attempt. Urine was successfully collected as follows: two dpi from AJ-z3 and AJ-z4; three dpi from AJ-z3, AJ-z5 and AJ-z6; five dpi from AJ-z3, AJ-z4, AJ-z5 and AJ-z6; and ten dpi from AJ-z5 and AJ-z6.

RTTs sat at room temperature for one hour to allow a clot to form and then centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min at room temperature. Serum was removed from the clot, placed in a new microcentrifuge tube and stored at -20&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Serum from bats at 2 and 5 dpi were used to assess for viremia. Serum from 10 dpi and the 28 dpi pilot study bats were used to determine antibody titers. Because blood draws yield a small volume of blood (50 &#x003bc;l whole blood for a non-terminal blood draw, 500 &#x003bc;l whole blood for terminal blood draw) it was necessary to prioritize samples to optimize data retrieved. In order to assay the serum for viral RNA and perform serology, earlier time points were used to assess for viremia and later time points for seroconversion. Along with sample partitioning for data maximization, the small blood volume led to concerns that there would be an undetectably small viral load. To circumvent this issue, neat serum and 1:10 diluted serum were inoculated onto Vero cells to amplify any virus that may have been present at low levels. One blind passage on Vero cells was done and cell supernatants assayed by qRT-PCR. The remaining serum from three of the four bats was assayed directly for ZIKV RNA.</p><p>Necropsies were performed immediately after euthanasia. Bats were assessed for gross pathology. The following tissues were collected for both experiments: heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, urinary bladder, prostate, testes, and brain.
