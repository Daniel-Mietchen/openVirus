Impact of gram negative organisms on clinical disease is well known but exotic bacterial pathogens such as Ralstonia sp are lesser known members of this group. Infections related with exotic pathogens are often reported in mechanically ventilated patients particularly associated with those who are immunocompromised. This study aims to analyse the gram negative pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibility profile from various clinical and environmental samples (blood, urine, IV and fomites) from an urban multi-speciality hospital in Chennai, Tamilnadu, India using standard protocols and the data discussed.</p><p id="Par2"><bold>Methods:</bold> Basic microbiological techniques were used to screen the clinical and hospital environmental specimens for gram negative bacteria and their antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by standard disc diffusion method according to CLSI guidelines. Bacterial isolates which could not be confirmed by basic phenotypic techniques were identified by using automated bacterial identification system (VITEK-2, Biomerieux) and their antibiogram was noted.</p><p id="Par3"><bold>Results</bold>: A total of 40 clinical samples (39 urine and 1blood) and 60 environmental samples were collected. Among these 16/39 urine samples and 17/60 environmental samples were positive for gram negative bacilli. All the gram negative isolates were resistant to nitrofurantoin used to treat UTI.</p><p id="Par4"><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Gram negative organisms and exotic gram negative pathogens are most often associated with hospital acquired UTIs. All Ralstonia sp isolated showed resistant pattern for nitrofurantoin, one of the antibiotic commonly used to treat urinary tract infections.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>ISSHID Abstract-47 A quick method for designing and screening effective chemically modified siRNA against viruses &#x02013; A perspective to employ RNAi in antiviral research</title><p id="Par5">Showkat Ahmad Dar, Manoj Kumar</p><p id="Par6">Virology Discovery Unit and Bioinformatics Centre, Institute of Microbial Technology, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Chandigarh, India</p><p id="Par7"><bold>Background:</bold> Viral infections have a massive negative impact worldwide as evident from recent outbreaks. For example, dengue is emerging as global health problem affecting around 400 million people per year and nearly half of world population at its infection risk. The siRNAs are one of the natural antivirals and some of them are already FDA approved (Patisiran).</p><p id="Par8"><bold>Methods:</bold> We employed virus specific computational algorithms (VIRsiRNApred and SMEpred) for siRNA designing against dengue virus (DENV2) genome. We selected eleven siRNAs (si1 to si11) based on different criteria like varying inhibition efficacy, off targets and different genomic regions (5&#x02032;-Untranslated region, Capsid, Pre-Membrane, Envelope and 3&#x02032;-Untranslated region). The siRNAs were further chemically modified with deoxy-nucleotide at the two 3&#x02032;overhangs. We cloned these genes in PsiCheck-TM2 plasmid and used dual luciferase assay for knockdown efficacy screening of the siRNAs. We tested the knockdown efficacy of siRNAs at three concentrations, their combinations and their toxicity using MTT assay in HeLa cells. Statistical analysis was done by one-way ANOVA with Tuckey post hoc test using R.</p><p id="Par9"><bold>Results:</bold> The designed siRNAs and their combinations performed according to their prediction efficacies. Also, the two siRNAs from earlier studies (for external validation) showed similar silencing efficacies. The siRNAs showed almost no toxicity compared to the scrambled siRNA.</p><p id="Par10"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We demonstrate a rapid method to design, test and construct a repertoire of chemically modified siRNAs as antivirals without the use of live viruses or biosafety facilities. Our method also showed similar performance as compared to external live dengue virus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>ISSHID Abstract-63 Herpes Zoster of the Maxillary Division of Tri-germinal Nerve with superadded Streptoccocus viridans infection , in an Immunosuppressed Individual - A Case Report</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Kiran.M<sup>1</sup>, Madhusudhan.B<sup>2</sup>, Pujita.B<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec7"><title><sup>1</sup>Department of Microbiology, Sree Balaji Medical College &#x00026; Hospital, Bharath University (BIHER), Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; <sup>2</sup>Department of Surgery, BRS Hospitals Pvt.

Though a self-limiting condition, it may take weeks to resolve especially in immunosuppressed individuals. There is a potential for developing aseptic meningitis, ocular sequelae, post herpetic neuralgia, disseminated zoster and superadded bacterial infections, which pose a great challenge to treating clinicians.</p><p id="Par12"><bold>Case Report:</bold> We report a case of an 80 year old woman, who came with complaints of burning sensation and multiple painful vesicular lesions on the right half of her face and palate associated with fever of one week duration. She had edema of right eye and an ulcer (2x1cm) below her right lower eyelid. Ophthalmic examination was normal. Radiological and blood parameters were normal, except for neutropenia. Blood and wound swab culture from ulcer showed, presence of Streptococcus viridans. Clinical diagnosis of Herpes Zoster involving Maxillary division of Tri-germinal nerve (right side) was made. Written informed consent was obtained from the guardian of the patient for the publication of this case report and accompanying images.</p><p id="Par13"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Treatment using antiviral agents, antibiotics, corticosteriods, analgesics, anti-inflammatory drugs and corneal protection with ocular lubricants were started and patient showed good improvement. In case of severe Post herpetic Neuralgia, nerve block injections are suggested. Clinicians must be aware of the various complications and treatment modalities associated with the disease, especially in such immunosuppressed and aged patents.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>ISSHID Abstract-76 Study of expression of Brennan Krohn virus in saliva of HIV seropositive and seronegative children</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Kamaleswari P<sup>1</sup>,Ranganathan K<sup>1</sup>, Uma Devi K Rao<sup>1</sup>, Kiran Kumar<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec10"><title><sup>1</sup>Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology, Ragas Dental College &#x00026; Hospital, Chennai, India; <sup>2</sup> Director, Genes N Life Health Care, Hyderabad, India</title><p id="Par14"><bold>Background:</bold> Salivary gland disease is defined as an enlargement of the salivary gland and/or complaint of xerostomia and histologically characterized by lymphocytic infiltrate of the salivary gland causing acinar atrophy. It has been reported in the literature that in an immunosuppressed setting, Brennan Krohn Virus(BKV) could infect the salivary gland eliciting a CD8T lymphocyte infiltrate and also be expressed in the saliva. In the setting of immunosuppression and immature immune system, Children infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus are prone to reactivation of BKV if previously infected by the virus leading to disease progression thereby increasing the morbidity.</p><p id="Par15"><bold>Methods:</bold> This study was approved by the IRB of Ragas Dental College and Hospital. Saliva samples were collected from HIV seropositive and seronegative children after obtaining the consent from their parents/guardian. DNA was extracted from the saliva samples and subjected to Real time polymerase chain reaction to study the expression of BKV; the data collected were analyzed using SPSS 20 software.</p><p id="Par16"><bold>Results:</bold> Among the 30 HIV seropositive and seronegative children 27%(8/30) of them had detectable BKV load, 25%(2/8) crossed the threshold level of 200 copies/ml from both groups. We assessed the salivary flow rate and found that there was a decreased salivary flow rate(p=0.05) among the HIV seropositive children who crossed the threshold level of BKV.</p><p id="Par17"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this study we detected and quantified BKV in the saliva of both HIV seropositive and seronegative children, indicating that saliva is a potential source of BKV infection. <bold>"</bold></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>ISSHID Abstract-81 Seroprevalance of Hepatitis B in pregnant females - a decade after introduction of Hepatitis B vaccine in Universal Immunization Program of India</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Shilpee Kumar, Rojaleen Das</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Department of Microbiology, VMMC &#x00026; Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi, India</title><p id="Par18"><bold>Background:</bold> In India, Introduction of HBV vaccine was pilot-tested in 2002 and expanded to the entire country in 2011 under the Universal Immunization Program (UIP). It has been a decade since Hepatitis B vaccine has been introduced in UIP. The study was conducted to analyze the change in seroprevalence status of Hepatits B in females of reproductive age group.</p><p id="Par19"><bold>Methods:</bold> This was a retrospective observational study. The cohort enrolled for the study were pregnant females who attended the antenatal clinic of VMMC &#x00026; Safdarjung Hospital in 2019. The blood sample was collected as a part of routine screening for HBV, HIV and syphilis. The samples were tested for HBsAg by qualitative indirect ELISA.</p><p id="Par20"><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 5513 pregnant females were enrolled in the study and 89 were seropositive for HBsAg. The seroprevalence was found to be 1.6% and highest in the age group of 30-35 year (2.7%). Studies before 2011 have shown seroprevalence of 2.3&#x02013;6.3%.</p><p id="Par21"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The seroprevalence of HBsAg has decreased over the years. However as India is the second most populated country, the seroprevalence of 1.6% amounts to nearly 4 million women in reproductive age infected with HBV and putting 4 Lakhs babies at risk of acquiring HBV by vertical transmission yearly. Vaccine delivery assessment is required to identify the gaps that may help in strengthening the national viral hepatitis control program of India.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>ISSHID Abstract-101 Marine brown algal compounds inhibits HSV-2, an invitro analysis</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Manikannan Mathaiyan, Lavanya Babu, Krupakar Parthasarathy</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Center for Drug Discovery and Development, Col.Dr.Jeppiaar Research Park, Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology, Chennai, India</title><p id="Par22"><bold>Background:</bold> Herpes Simplex Virus-2 (HSV-2) belongs to the family Herpesviridae, a causative agent of genital herpes. Wild-type HSV-2 may cause severe infections in neonates and HSV-2-infected individuals are placed at approximately three fold higher risk for acquiring human immunodeficiency virus. Vaccines against HSV-2 remain a challenging approach and also drug resistance is increasing. In this context, it is important to identify newer HSV inhibitors. In this study we aimed to identify the inhibitors from marine brown algae, Sargassum species.</p><p id="Par23"><bold>Methods:</bold><italic>Sargassum swartzii</italic>, a Marine brown algae were collected from south coastal of Tamilnadu. Crude extracts were prepared by standard extractions procedure and phytochemicals present in the crude extracts were separated. Vero cells 2.5x105/well were infected with stranded HSV-2 strain and cytopathic effect (CPE) was calculated. 50- 200&#x003bc;g of phenolic compounds and flavonoids treated with HSV-2 infected vero cells for up to 72 hours. Percentage of inhibition was calculated based on number of plaques reduction. Acyclovir used as a drug positive control.</p><p id="Par24"><bold>Results:</bold> Number of plaques was calculated as 1.7x105/ml PFU/ml. Among the different conc. of test compounds tested 200&#x003bc;g/ml of flavonoids have shown less no of plaques. At tested 200&#x003bc;g/ml virus yield decreased by 90 fold indicates that plaques reduction was due to virus inhibition mediated by flavonoids antiviral property. This suppression is not due to cytotoxic effects of compounds, it was confirmed by MTT assay. Up to 500&#x003bc;g/ml of flavonoids were non toxic to vero cells.</p><p id="Par25"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Flavonoids are the principle compounds potentially inhibit HSV-2 in invitro condition.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>ISSHID Abstract-116 Early diagnosis and drug resistance detection of Pulmonary Tuberculosis by TRUENAT and LPA in a tertiary care hospital</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>D.Shireesha, A.Surekha, A.Renuka Devi, B.Nagajyothi, J.Vijayalakshmi</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>Dept of Microbiology, Kurnool, 518002, A.P.</title><p id="Par26"><bold>Background:</bold> Tuberculosis is one of the most important diseases in india.

But there are reports indicating only one or two of the serotypes dominates for certain period of time in few regions and causes significant morbidity and mortality. The reason for this uniqueness is not known. Hence this study was undertaken in order to understand the dynamics of dengue virus circulation in Hyderabad, India from 2014 to 2019.</p><p id="Par31"><bold>Methods:</bold> Viral RNA was isolated from the dengue virus infected serum samples using the Qiagen viral isolation kit. cDNA was synthesized using the reverse primer of the pre-Membrane region which was further amplified (511bp) by using the forward primer. Serotyping was carried by using the above template with serotype specific primers as described in earlier reports.</p><p id="Par32"><bold>Results:</bold> The data suggested the circulation of all four serotypes with equal proportion during the year 2014. 60% of the infections were co-infections with more than one serotype and caused severe dengue ie either dengue hemorrhagic (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome. But over the time, dengue virus serotype-1 emerged as single serotype circulating alone in 2019 in Hyderabad. The nucleotide sequence analysis indicated the significant mutations throughout the genome which might played crucial role in better adaptation and hence in circulating for the past five years.</p><p id="Par33"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The adaptive mutations acquired by the dengue virus serotype-1, might played crucial role in better adaptation and hence in circulating for the past five years continuously circulating in Hyderabad, India.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>ISSHID Abstract-135 CD4 COUNT- A measure of drug resistance in HIV patients who are on 1st line ART in a tertiary care hospital</title><sec id="Sec24"><title>A.Praveen, A.Surekha, A.Renuka Devi, B.Shanthi Reddy, R.Hymavathi</title><sec id="Sec25"><title>Kurnool, A.P,518002</title><p id="Par34"><bold>Background:</bold> Measuring CD4 (T- Cell) count in HIV patients gives us a measure of the response to ART and also provides an assessment of disease progress.

These three viruses express the polyprotein encoded by 5'-C-prM-E-NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5-3' gene for their life cycle in the host cells in common. This polyprotein is cleaved into the active protein components with the aid of protease activity of NS2B/NS3pro complex. Thus, the NS2B/NS3 is considered as a potent target for designing inhibitors against these viruses.</p><p id="Par55"><bold>Methods:</bold> We have performed a structural analysis of NS2B/NS3pro complex using molecular modeling and dynamics simulations and explained the structure-function relationship of this complex based on the similarity and differences in the structural features. Further, we have employed screening of protease inhibitor chemical space using high-throughput virtual screening.</p><p id="Par56"><bold>Results:</bold> We have obtained the structures of substrate peptide (GLKR&#x02019;GGAK) bound NS2B/NS3 protease of DENV, WNV and Zika virusus. These complex structures represent the model for the protease activity in cleaving the substrate peptide and it is robust for designing high affinity and low risk compounds with specific as well as non-specific protease inhibitors. We also present some of the compounds selected from the in silico studies as promising inhibitors against DENV and WNV proteases.</p><p id="Par57"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results provide a strong platform for structure/ensemble-based screening of large chemical libraries and also to prepare NS2B/NS3pro focussed compound libraries. Further, NS2B/NS3pro specific/non-specific inhibitors can also be designed based on our pipeline.

Nagajyothi, J.Vijaylakshmi</title><sec id="Sec43"><title>Department of Microbiology, Kurnool Medical College, Kurnool AP India</title><p id="Par58"><bold>Background:</bold> Hepatitis C virus is an RNA virus and a known cause of infection transmitted in patients undergoing haemodialysis. The source of infection stems from improper washing and disinfecting equipment used in haemodialysis. Infection can also occur due to improper hygiene practises while handling the dialysis equipment and patient. Transmission through contaminated blood while treating anaemic patients is another source of HCV infection. HCV infection has been implicated in the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis leading to worsening of the already compromised kidney. Therefore prevention of HCV transmission and early diagnosis and treatment of HCV is very essential.</p><p id="Par59"><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a prospective observational study conducted for 3 months done to identify HCV patients on hemodialysis in the geographical location ( Kurnool, AP). Blood samples were collected and screened for HCV antibodies by ELISA for all patients who came for hemodialysis. Ethical clearance was obtained and prior consent from patients was taken before testing.</p><p id="Par60"><bold>Results:</bold> Among 139 patients who were on hemodialysis 104 patients were males and 35 patients were females with a mean age of 51&#x000b1;15 years. 4 patients were identified as having HCV infection. All 4 patients were old cases of HCV infection. No new cases were found in the time period of the study</p><p id="Par61"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study looks at the disease burden and rate of transmission of HCV in hemodialysis patients. Use of proper protocols and infection control practices prevents the incidence of Hepatitis-C infection in haemodialysis patients.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>ISSHID Abstract-168 Role of antimicrobial peptides against the biofilm formation in MRSA strains</title><sec id="Sec45"><title>Thenmozhi Ramalingam<sup>1</sup>, Beema Shafreen Rajamohamed<sup>2</sup>, Thajuddin Nooruddin<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec46"><title><sup>1</sup>Department of Microbiology, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamilnadu, India; <sup>2</sup>Department of Biotechnology, Alagappa University, Karaikudi, Tamilnadu, India</title><p id="Par62"><bold>Background:</bold> Biofilm formation imposes a major threat in clinical manifestations. Still Methicillin Resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) is a greater challenge to the physicians in controlling its emergence.

The diagnosis of HSV 2 infection is primarily clinical as Tzanck smear lacks sensitivity and specificity. Serology helps in screening but unreliable for diagnosis and culture is difficult to perform in all laboratories. So, molecular methods are much promising for efficient diagnosis. Hence, this study proposes to use a nested PCR assay for the diagnosis of HSV-2 infection from genital swabs of patients with GUD and compares its diagnostic efficiency with that of real-time PCR.</p><p id="Par67"><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 40 genital ulcer swab samples collected from GUD patients attending a tertiary Sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinic were included in this study. DNA was extracted using the Nucleospin virus kit and nested PCR assay was performed using specific primer sets targeting POL gene (163-bp) of HSV-2.

Being a relatively cost-effective (under $1.00) microscope made of paper, it could offer an alternative for diagnostic roles. It would be especially advantageous in resource poor regions of the world. We procured several foldscopes and assembled them (<bold>&#x0201c;</bold>fold on the dotted lines<bold>&#x0201d;</bold>) taking help from our under-graduate students. We analysed their application as a diagnostic tool for detecting N. gonorrhoeae, which causes a sexually transmitted disease - Gonorrhoea.

Chandipura virus (CHPV), a vector-borne rhabdovirus causing fatal paediatric encephalitis, following local infection, disseminates to the central nervous system via blood. The study unravels the effect of human complement on CHPV.</p><p id="Par137"><bold>Methods:</bold> CHPV was cultured and titrated in Vero cells. Complement susceptibility was tested with normal human serum (NHS) or heat-inactivated NHS by either varying concentrations or time followed by plaque assay. Complement dependency and pathways responsible for CHPV neutralization were dissected with respective complement-depleted/reconstituted NHS. Complement reconstitution was confirmed by haemolytic assays with rabbit or sheep RBC&#x02019;s against NHS. Mechanism of neutralization and evasion were assessed with Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, Jeol) and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (Beckman)</p><p id="Par138"><bold>Results:</bold> The concentration and time-dependent neutralization of CHPV by NHS (not HI) was complement dependent as CHPV was resistant to C3-depleted serum. Neutralization was classical pathway- dependent as EGTA treated serum, C4, and C1q-depleted sera had no effect contrary to Factor B-depleted serum. As CHPV was sensitive to C8 depleted NHS, terminal complement pathway had no role in neutralization. A marked shift in sucrose gradient suggested the mechanism of neutralization as aggregation, further validated by TEM. CHPV grown in HeLa cells were relatively less sensitive to NHS due to the presence of CD46 and CD55.</p><p id="Par139"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Although sensitive to complement, CHPV possesses mechanisms to evade complement.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec100"><title>ISSHID Late Abstract-10 New-age microbicidal compounds from Cyanobacteria</title><sec id="Sec101"><title>Damodharan Rajesh, Sannyasi Elumalai</title><sec id="Sec102"><title>Department of Biotechnology, University of Madras, Guindy Campus, Chennai, India</title><p id="Par140"><bold>Background:</bold> In the past recent decades, antibiotic resistance is the alarming issue in the field of medical treatment.

Many pathogenic microbes have developed multi-drug resistance against single and combination of antibiotics. Therefore, search for a novel and potential natural compound would be a solution to this global issue. Cyanobacteria are oxygenic, photoautotrophic prokaryotes evolved approximately 3.5 billion years ago.

Within HIV-1 infected individuals, roughly 20% individuals generate broadly neutralizing antibodies against the envelope glycoprotein, a trimer of heterodimers of gp120 and gp41. The mapping of epitopes on viral envelopes vulnerable to immune evasion will aid in defining targets of vaccine immunogens and understanding the coevolution of plasma antibodies and viral variants in HIV-1 infected individuals provides key information for vaccine strategies. Herein, we report a HIV-1 infected pediatric elite neutralizer, AIIMS_330, who developed potent plasma bnAbs against HIV-1.

Identification of a genetically variant strain has led to reconsider the presumption of VZV immutability. The study was aimed to identify mutations in open reading frame-68(ORF-68), a highly conserved gene that expresses only during active infection among clinical strains of VZV causing meningoencephalitis, inflammatory bowel disease and typical varicella.</p><p id="Par266"><bold>Methods:</bold> The study was approved by Institution-ethics-committee. DNA was extracted from colon biopsy (IBD(n=15), control group(n=10), cerebrospinal fluid(n=40) and vesicular fluid(n=1) by DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen, Germany). Conventional PCR was performed using specific primers to amplify ORF-68(1876bp). The amplified products were sequenced using Big-dye terminator kit, ABI-GA3730 (V3.2,Applied Biosystems, USA). The bidirectional sequences were analyzed against standard sequences-blastn(https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Multiple sequence alignment was carried out for three sequences against VZV-Dumas prototype and structure prediction was done by Swiss model.</p><p id="Par267"><bold>Results:</bold> The male-female ratio was 1:1; mean age of the participants was 17+ 15.7 (range from 3-59years).

Screening of donated blood for HBsAg, antiHCV and Anti-HIV 1&#x00026;2 are mandatory in India. Whereas Nucleic acid testing (NAT) and Core antibody testing (Anti-HBc) for Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are standard requirements of the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB), they are not mandated in developing countries like India; hence there exists a risk of transfusion transmissible HBV in developing countries. Anti-HBc serves as a surrogate marker for detecting occult Hepatitis B infections. This study was carried out with an objective of estimating prevalence of Anti-HBc among voluntary blood donors at our institution.</p><p id="Par282"><bold>Methods:</bold> Informed consent was obtained from blood donors to screen their donated units for transfusion transmissible infections (TTI) as per National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) guidelines.

Ligands interacting with CCR5 could thus function both as effective HIV-1 entry inhibitors and as valuable tools for studying receptor biology. Use of natural CCR5 ligands for therapeutic purposes has often been hampered by the potential side effects due to the high degree of promiscuity evident in chemokine system. In the present study we designed a hybrid chemokine by attaching the N terminus of the most potent agonist of CCR5 to the core region of the viral macrophage inflammatory protein-II to obtain a ligand with high affinity for CCR5.</p><p id="Par293"><bold>Methods:</bold> The hybrid chemokine was synthesized by Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis and structural characterization was done using CD spectroscopy. The Interaction of hybrid chemokine with CCR5 was analyzed by calcium efflux studies, chemotaxis assay and receptor internalization studies.

Blood samples of 100 beta-thalassemia patients and 100 age-matched controls were screened for antibodies against HCV by an Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a rapid immunochromatographic method, and the chemiluminescence Assay using the Abbot.</p><p id="Par306"><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 100 cases of beta-thalassemia 28 (28%) were HCV positive and all the controls were negative for HCV infection. The prevalence among the patients attending the hospital was found to mere 0.19%.</p><p id="Par307"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> HCV infection among the beta-thalassemia patients was abnormally high as compared to the control group. Thalassemia patients were predisposed to HCV infection and other blood-borne viral infections. Thorough screening of blood prior to transfusion is warranted. HCV infection may further increase the morbidity and mortality of beta-thalassemia patients and other patients with blood disorders who acquire the infection due to frequent blood transfusions.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec229"><title>ISSHID Abstract-40 Physagulin-F Inhibits HIV-1 Replication through Reverse Transcriptase Inhibition</title><sec id="Sec230"><title>Estari Mamidala, Swapna Gurrapu</title><sec id="Sec231"><title>Infectious Diseases Research Lab, Department of Zoology, Kakatiya University, Warangal-506009, (Telangana State), India</title><p id="Par308"><bold>Background:</bold> People living with HIV/AIDS ofen choose traditional or complementary and alternative medicine to complement or replace conventional treatment.

In immunocompromised patients, CMV infection can cause life-threatening consequences.Females, though by a small margin, are at a higher risk of CMV infection than males.While CMV infection is known to cause abortions in pregnant women, it is very rare and uncommon in the female genital tract (FGT).</p><p id="Par313"><bold>Case report:</bold> A 50year old diabetic patient presented to the gynecology department with abdominal pain since 5 months.Ultrasound of the abdomen revealed a fibroid uterus. Vaginal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingectomy was performed. Grossly, the specimen showed a leiomyoma; however, rest of the uterus, cervix and tubes looked absolutely unremarkable. Surprisingly, on microscopy, cervix, endometrium, myometrium and tubes showed dense acute on chronic inflammation studded with numerous organisms with owl&#x02019;s eye inclusions resembling CMV in the epithelial, endothelial and mesenchymal cells. Immunohistochemistry for CMV confirmed these organisms.Serology also revealed that the patient was HIV positive.</p><p id="Par314"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Though infection with CMV has been reported elsewhere like the colon, retina and oesophagus; few studies have reported CMV primarily in the FGT. In immunocompromised patients, infection with CMV has to be considered as it may result in significant morbidity and may be associated with pelvic inflammatory disease and cervical dysplasia. Recognition of CMV may help clinicians institute appropriate optimum management, follow up the patient and screen the family members too.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec235"><title>ISSHID Abstract-42 Development of Machine-learning tool to classify Plasmodium species based on its shape and texture features</title><sec id="Sec236"><title>N.

Clinical manifestations vary from dengue fever, dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome in which exhaustion of T-cells accounts for viral persistence and disease severity. Dengue virus infection results in increased production of cytokines by infected monocytes, B lymphocytes and mast cells. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells are likely targeted by DENV, particularly during secondary infection when serotypes cross-react with bystander CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Cross-reactive memory T-cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of secondary dengue (SD) by altering the cytokine profiles. In the present study we have assessed the clinical and cytokine profile in primary and secondary dengue cases.</p><p id="Par332"><bold>Methods:</bold> Serum samples from patients of Govt.

MicroRNAs are short non coding RNA involved in the post transcriptional process. miRNA networks play critical role in many physiological conditions and can change disease conditions. Here we look at global miRNA profile in human primary astrocytes on being activated with recombinant HIV1 TAT protein. We also test whether endogenous anti-inflammatory agents, the endocannabinoid AEA affect miRNA profile in astrocytes.</p><p id="Par348"><bold>Methods:</bold> Primary human astrocytes were cultured and treated with HIV1 TAT protein and AEA. Subsequent analysis was done by Real Time PCR, miRNA global microarray, DCFDA, and appropriate antagomirs/ mimics.</p><p id="Par349"><bold>Results:</bold> Global microRNA profiling in HIV1 TAT activated astrocytes showed significant changes in many miRNAs. Implicated pathways included AKT1, MAPK and Hippo. miR- 192-5p was suppressed in a dose dependent manner but not miR-543, in activated cells. Endocannabinoid AEA reverses these changes for both miRNAs. HIV1 TAT treatment increases the expression of inflammation genes, IL-18, IL-1&#x003b2;, ASC and NLRP3. Using antagomirs/mimics of miR192 and miR 543, we show that these regulate only specific inflammatory components.</p><p id="Par350"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> HIV1 TAT, a coat protein shed by HIV increases the inflammatory cascade. miRNA study in viral infection can give better understanding about the regulation in disease progression.

Ophthalmologist opinion was sought and diagnosed as panophthalmitis with corneal abscess for which the patient underwent right evisceration and orbital implant was placed. The intraocular contents were sent to microbiology lab. The patient was started with IV. Liposmal amphotericin B, Atropine eye drops and Natamycin eye drops empirically. Gram stain showed moderate epithelial cells, occasional pus cells and no bacteria. KOH wet mount showed sparsely septate broadly branching hyphae. Culture on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar showed light brown coloured fungal colony with no conidia. Lactophenol Cotton Blue Mount showed sparsely septate, broadly branching hyphae. The isolate was identified as <italic>Pythium insidiosum</italic> by gene sequencing. Consent has been taken from the next of kin of the patient for publication of this data as the patient had expired.</p><p id="Par361"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Human pythiosis is often misdiagnosed as it creates confusion with zygomycosis entailing improper and delayed specific treatment leading to fatal consequences. Hence, prompt identification is necessary as most isolates of pythium are ignored as lab contaminants.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec271"><title>ISSHID Abstract-74 Morphological spectrum of Histoplasma in HIV and non-HIV patient- Report of two cases</title><sec id="Sec272"><title>Abinaya Devi, Jayalakshmy, LillykuttyPothen, Sankar</title><sec id="Sec273"><title>Department of Pathology, GMC, Kottayam, Kerala, India</title><p id="Par362"><bold>Background:</bold> Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection caused by <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic> and is acquired by inhalation of dust particles from soil contaminated with bird or bad droppings.

Resistance mutations have been identified for INSTIs. Easy and cost-effective methods are needed for integrase resistance analysis. Data on Integrase resistance in India is limited. This urges research into INSTI drug resistance genotyping, prevalence and mechanisms.</p><p id="Par368"><bold>Methods:</bold> An in-house RT-Nested PCR protocol was standardized for multiple HIV-1 subtypes. Integrase gene was amplified and sequenced from 20 plasma and Dried Blood Spots (DBS) specimens from different HIV-1 subtypes (including B, C, B/D, A/E and F). The sequence data was analyzed using various tools like MEGA, REGA, JPHMM and HIVDRDB program for subtype analysis and interpretation of resistance mutations.</p><p id="Par369"><bold>Results:</bold> The standardized in-house assay could successfully amplify and sequence integrase gene from both plasma and DBS specimens. Integrase sequences showed high level of conservation across all samples. Sequence analysis of integrase gene using REGA and JPHMM identified two unique recombinants (G/AE and C/A1) within the integrase sequence. INSTI resistance analysis showed absence of major mutations while two accessory mutations were noted, E157Q in subtype C and G163R/K in subtype F as well as subtype C.</p><p id="Par370"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The RT-Nested PCR protocol could successfully amplify the integrase gene from plasma and DBS specimens from different subtypes. This can be useful for analysis of resistance to INSTIs across various HIV-1 subtypes in INSTI naive and failed individuals. Presence of accessory mutations in INSTI naive samples warrants nation-wide larger studies to understand INSTI resistance.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec277"><title>ISSHID Abstract-78 The Prevalence and Pattern of Superficial Fungal Infections among patients visiting dermatology OPD of a tertiary care hospital in Warangal</title><sec id="Sec278"><title>G.V.

Several studies have established that host genetic factors play a role in determining host susceptibility to mycobacteria as well as the course of disease. There is evidence suggesting that there is a direct inter-relationship between Interleukin-10 (IL-10) and the severity of PTB, since IL-10 plays an important role in controlling inflammation. Certain single nucleotide polymorphisms within the promoter region of the IL-10 gene have been associated with altered levels of circulating IL-10.

They are the most common sexually transmitted viral diseases worldwide and are easily diagnosed and misdiagnosed in different circumstances. Urethral and intrameatal extension of warts are seen in 5% of men. On the other hand, urinary calculi which usually pass spontaneously while voiding, may get impacted rarely in the urethra during their passage and produce variable symptoms.</p><p id="Par445"><bold>Case Report:</bold> A 20-year-old male presented with history of growth over the tip of the penis for 1 week associated with difficulty in micturition. There is a positive history of unprotected sexual contact with female commercial sex worker 2 months back. On examination, the patient had a verrucous papule impacting the urethral meatus. No other lesions elsewhere in the skin or genital or perianal region. The patient was investigated for HBsAg, anti-HCV, HIV Elisa and VDRL which were all nonreactive. Differential diagnoses considered were inverted papilloma of urinary tract and intrameatal condyloma acuminatum. The patient was then referred to urology for removal.

Transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) is an important cytokine which is shown to be associated with increased cervical viral shedding, however, the causal relationship is yet unknown. Hence we aimed to determine the effect of TGF-&#x003b2; on HIV shedding at CVM using in vitro assays.</p><p id="Par499"><bold>Methods:</bold> Two cervical epithelial cell lines were used: ME-180 (lacking CD4 receptor) and TZM-bl (transgenic expressing CD4 and CCR5). For HIV infection, TZM-bl cells were infected with cell-free HIV (NL4.3) while ME-180 cells were co-cultured with HIV-infected T cells. At different intervals, levels of TGF-&#x003b2; and HIV-p24 were determined using qPCR and ELISA.</p><p id="Par500"><bold>Results:</bold> ME-180 cells showed a significant increase in HIV release from day 3 onwards. Interestingly, TGF-&#x003b2; mRNA was significantly reduced in HIV infected ME-180 co-cultures than uninfected co-cultures. TZM-bl cells showed a significant increase in p24 levels by day 1 pi and also showed reduced expression of TGF-&#x003b2; gene in HIV-infected cells than uninfected cells. After blocking TGF-&#x003b2; using neutralizing antibodies, there was an increase in extracellular HIV-p24 level in ME-180 cells while neutralizing the TGF-&#x003b2; levels did not influence HIV-p24 release in TZM-bl cells.</p><p id="Par501"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> These findings indicate HIV infection suppresses TGF-&#x003b2; expression in cervical epithelial cells and neutralizing TGF-&#x003b2; facilitates HIV shedding.

However, repeated isolation of the same tube coagulase negative staphylococci with significant colony count (&#x0003e;10<sup>5</sup>cfu/ml) from a symptomatic case is regarded a pathogen. Significance of CoNS as a pathogen in genital infections is due to the fact that it serves as a reservoir of virulence and antibiotic resistant genes which could facilitate transfer to more pathogenic strains of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, thereby causing persistent infection and possible treatment failure. Thus, this work was designed to study the resistance and virulence profile of CoNS from genital infections.</p><p id="Par507"><bold>Methods:</bold> 51 CoNS isolates obtained from a tertiary care centre in Chennai were included (Source-High vaginal swab-n=27, Endocervical swab-n=1, semen-n=16).

Signs and symptoms can be variable through its 3 clinical stages. Syphilis has been known as &#x0201c;The Great Imitator"" as it can mimic many other diseases. Syphilis infection has a great impact on Indian population and therefore a better understanding of trends in its prevalence could help improve the efforts of public health measures in STI prevention and their integration with HIV prevention.</p><p id="Par511"><bold>Methods:</bold> Case series of 11 cases of early infectious syphilis in a 1-year time period.</p><p id="Par512"><bold>Results:</bold> Among the 11 cases presented, 7 of them were young males (1 boy), 3 were young females and 1 a transgender. Of the 3 females, 2 were pregnant. All patients presented with features of secondary syphilis; confirmed with reactive VDRL and positive TPHA. None of them were HIV positive. In this series of secondary syphilis cases, an early infectious stage of syphilis is a clear pointer towards resurgence of syphilis in recent times.</p><p id="Par513"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Syphilis, which was previously endemic in low income countries, has now re-emerged in several high-income countries. From a dermatological perspective- a suspicious mind, a detailed history, along with careful clinical examination by an astute clinician is required to make the diagnosis of syphilis. Secondary syphilis with its relatively innocuous presentations can be difficult to identify and if misdiagnosed or left undiagnosed leads to detrimental consequences in individual and community. The role of preventive measures to reduce prevalence of syphilis in pregnancy and in young cannot be overemphasised.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec382"><title>ISSHID Abstract-141 A case of stubborn Cryptococcal meningitis in an immunocompetent patient</title><sec id="Sec383"><title>P V Anto, N Maheedhar Reddy, Vidya Krishnan, Anupma Jyoti Kindo</title><sec id="Sec384"><title>Department of Microbiology, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, Chennai, India</title><p id="Par514"><bold>Background:</bold> Cryptococcus is an opportunistic fungus, an important cause of CNS infections among immunocompromised patients, but it has only sporadically been reported in non-HIV positive persons.</p><p id="Par515"><bold>Materials and Method:</bold> A 64-year-old female was brought to emergency with complaints of fever, severe head ache, vomiting with known case of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.

It evades immune response by displaying antigenic variations thereby preventing elimination of malaria. Therefore, malaria elimination can be achieved through an efficacious vaccine. However, vaccines that have undergone clinical trials have demonstrated upto 30-40% efficacy. In addition, the design of any vaccine with a global efficacy must take into consideration epitope variation among different parasite isolates. Hence, we present an extensive antigenic (T-cell epitope) variation analysis of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> to detect natural variation that might be involved in immune evasion.</p><p id="Par562"><bold>Methods:</bold> 600 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> epitopes were retrieved form IEDB database and proteome sequences were downloaded from Genbank to detect conserved and non conserved epitopes across multiple isolates.

On examination, his abdomen was distended with tenderness and guarding in the right hypochondrium. Computerised tomographic scan showed discontinuity in body of gall bladder with a pericholecystic collection and multiple intraabdominal lymph nodes, few necrotic. On emergency laparotomy, gall bladder was found distended with thinned out fundus and thickened proximal body. Seropurulent fluid was present in pelvis with pus flakes which was sampled for GeneXpert and bacterial culture. Due to frozen Calot&#x02019;s triangle, subtotal cholecystectomy was done. Subpyloric necrotic node was biopsied for histopathological examination. Post-operatively the histopathological report was suggestive of acute suppurative cholecystitis and lymph nodes showed features of granulomatous inflammation. Bacterial culture of intraabdominal pus had no growth whereas GeneXpert detected high levels of mycobacterium tuberculosis sensitive to rifampicin.

Immune activation persists despite antiretroviral treatment (ART) and correlates with a higher occurrence of non-AIDS morbidities in HIV-infected individuals. Gut microbial dysbiosis during chronic HIV infection in adults is associated with persistent systemic immune activation and inflammation. Previously, we showed altered gut microbial composition regardless of ART and its association with inflammation in perinatally HIV-infected children. Here, we study the level of immune activation and its association with gut microbial dysbiosis in them.</p><p id="Par645"><bold>Methods:</bold> Frequency of activated T cells was analyzed in treatment na&#x000ef;ve, ART-suppressed perinatally HIV-infected children and uninfected controls using flow cytometry.

The development of initial cytokine milieu stimulated by the innate immune cells plays a vital role in TB. Later on with the progression of immune response, certain specific cytokine lineages are produced by the adaptive immune system and this includes the Th1 and Th2 lineages of cells equipped with specific functions. A Th1 and Th2 cell response determines the outcome of several disease conditions. Hence it is with this background the current study was performed to measure the cytokine status of TB patients in comparison with the controls.</p><p id="Par661"><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 300 serum samples were collected from TB patients (156 treatment na&#x000ef;ve and 144 under therapy) and 100 age cum sex matched control subjects were collected. Institutional Human Ethics Committee Approval was obtained. These samples were subjected to evaluation of the levels of Th1 cytokines IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; and Th2 cytokines- IL-10 and IL-6 by employing ELISA technique.</p><p id="Par662"><bold>Results:</bold> Results revealed higher production of Th2 cytokines among untreated TB cases. In contrast treated TB cases showed a reversal of cytokine trend towards Th1 type cytokines. These differences in cytokine pattern among untreated versus treated patients were not biased with gender or age.</p><p id="Par663"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Cytokine niche plays a major role during TB. It is assumed that immune phenotype matures into Th2 during TB (non protective) and treatment with anti TB drugs reverses the cytokine phenotype back to Th1 type (protective).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec493"><title>ISSHID Abstract-201 Hidradenitis Suppurativa Complicating HIV &#x02013; A rare case report</title><sec id="Sec494"><title>Murugan Sundaram, Adikrishnan.S, Krishnakanth.M, Sudha.R, Mahalakshmi.V, Anandan.S, Sukesh Gautam.S</title><sec id="Sec495"><title>Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprosy, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, Porur, Chennai, India</title><p id="Par664"><bold>Background:</bold> Hidradenitis suppurativa (Acne inversa/Pyoderma fistulans significa/Verneuil&#x02019;s disease) is a chronic suppurating infection that affects the apocrine glands of the axilla, groin and the perineum. There is the formation of multiple intradermal abscesses, which lead to the development of multiple sinuses, fistulae, and scarring of the skin. Herewith, we report a rare case of hidradenitis suppurativa in a HIV seropositive individual.</p><p id="Par665"><bold>Case Report:</bold> A 35-year-old presented with complaints of swellings in both axilla associated with pain.

Karumbati, Satyajit Mayor</title><p id="Par755"><bold>Background:</bold> HIV/AIDS remains to be one of the world&#x02019;s foremost health challenges. With anti-HIV-1 drugs rapidly becoming ineffective unless administered in multi-drug combinations due to viral resistance there is a need for alternative therapeutic strategy. HIV-1 Nef protein is expressed during early phases of viral replication and helps in maintaining a constant state of infection, thereby playing a pivotal role in pathogenesis and AIDS progression. In infected APCs, Nef protein binds and internalizes the host B7 co-stimulatory CD80/CD86 surface receptors, leading to loss of T-cell activation, hence circumventing immune clearance of the infected cells.</p><p id="Par756"><bold>Methods:</bold> Small peptides mimicking the cytosolic tails of CD80/CD86 were able to reverse the Nef effects, hence establishing this protein-protein interaction as a potential target. Based on this target, small chemical molecule from a focused library were tested for disruption of Nef-CD80/CD86 interaction in biochemical assay as well as in phenotypic functional T-cell activation and viral assays.</p><p id="Par757"><bold>Results:</bold> Active molecules belonging to 3 scaffold series namely AP, PA and BC were identified from biochemical and cell-based viral infection assays. To begin with, the &#x02018;AP&#x02019; scaffold was selected to initiate Hit to lead optimization study and we came up with a few active compounds. In preliminary PK and solubility studies, these molecules showed very good solubility, AUC and Cmax values showing druggable potential. Currently lead optimization of molecules and understanding the structural biology aspects of the target are in progress.</p><p id="Par758">Conclusions: Based on our studies, &#x02018;AP&#x02019; series candidates show attractive therapeutic potential for HIV-1 drug discovery program.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec554"><title>ISSHID Abstract-236 Fabrication of Drug Eluting Buccal Film by 3D Printing Technology Loaded With Anti-HIV Drug</title><sec id="Sec555"><title>Priya Dharshini K, Ramyadevi D, Vedha Hari BN</title><sec id="Sec556"><title>School of Chemical &#x00026; Biotechnology, SASTRA Deemed University, Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, India</title><p id="Par759"><bold>Background:</bold> In healthcare, 3D printing technique is primarily used in different fields such as multifunctional drug delivery systems, dental implants, skin/tissue regeneration, orthopaedics, etc. For the first time, coupling of two techniques namely, 3D printing and Dip Coating is investigated in the present study to produce oral disintegrating buccal films (ODFs) for anti-HIV therapy in paediatrics / geriatrics and bed ridden patients.</p><p id="Par760"><bold>Methods:</bold> The ODFs loaded with anti-HIV drug Dolutegravir were prepared by fused deposition modelling (FDM) from polyvinyl alcohol filament with or without a coating layer.

Around one third of the world population is thought to be affected by the agent mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is identified as one of the leading infectious disease. Due to the resistance offered by M. tuberculosis to different drugs, development of novel anti TB drugs is of urgent priority in this crucial time. There is also alarming increase in several new cases with multi drug resistant TB. Owing to high biological activity of 4-aminoantipyrine derivatives, these may offers as potential candidate towards the treatment of tuberculosis.</p><p id="Par764"><bold>Methods:</bold> Agar well diffusion method is adopted to evaluate the antimycobacterial activity. Standardized inoculums of the test organism were spread uniformly on the surface of the plates using sterile cotton swab. Mycobacterium smegmatis was compared with gentamycin as standard. DMSO was used as negative control.</p><p id="Par765"><bold>Results:</bold> On comparing with MIC value of standard, the tested Schiff base and mixed ligand zinc complexes exhibited MIC values in the range 10-14 &#x003bc;g/ml, indicating high antimycobacterial activity</p><p id="Par766"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Among the metal complexes studied, the 4-amino antipyrine derived mixed ligand zinc complex exhibits higher antimycobacterial activity. The higher antimycobacterial activity of the mixed ligand zinc complex is due to the presence of additional biologically active pharmacophore. Drugs with different pharmacophore act at more than one target and effective for treating drug resistant infectious agents. So the 4-aminoantipyrine derived mixed ligand zinc complex may serve as promising agent to treat tuberculosis.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec560"><title>ISSHID Abstract-239 Antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of Resveratrol Nano-dryemulsion developed by spray drying technique for improved efficacy against methicillin-resistant bacteria</title><sec id="Sec561"><title>S.Punitha<sup>1,2</sup> K.Ruckmani<sup>1,2</sup></title><sec id="Sec562"><title><sup>1</sup>Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, University College of Engineering, BIT Campus, Anna University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India; <sup>2</sup>The National Facility on Drug Development (NFDD), University College of Engineering, BIT Campus, Anna University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India</title><p id="Par767"><bold>Background:</bold> Antimicrobial resistance has led to the evaluation of other potent microbial agents.

The factors attributing to fungemia are prolonged use of antibiotics, immunosuppressive agents, parenteral nutrition and failure of vital organs. The most trivial genesis for invasive mycosis is due to aspergillosis. The increase in drift has been acclaimed subsequently after organ transplantation, chemotherapy, and other antecedents of immunosuppression.</p><p id="Par1101"><bold>Case Report:</bold> We report the case of a 49-year-old male who was hospitalized due to acute exacerbation and worsening of chronic kidney disease. He was managed intensively and discharged with advice of weekly twice and regular hemodialysis. After few weeks, he was brought dead to our hospital with history of breathlessness and sudden collapse. Up on request, an autopsy was performed and vital organs such as heart, lungs and kidneys were examined, dissected and was sent for histopathological examination. Meanwhile history was recorded from the relatives, older admissions in various hospitals and medical records were perused which confirmed the diagnosis of aspergillosis which also corroborated with the findings from autopsy, which itself is a rare quintessence. Presence of peculiar and incidental findings in the 4th rib of the patient indicates a secondary infection of Tuberculosis. Consent was obtained from the next of kin to the patient for publication of the patient&#x02019;s data, as the patient had expired.</p><p id="Par1102"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This case highlights that a continual stay in the critical care unit in a tertiary center is a major source of cross and nosocomial infection which is a potential risk factor for aspergillosis.

Severity was described using the maximum clinical severity score ( between 0 to 8 ) during hospitalization based on SpO2 ( &#x0003e; 95% = 0 , 91-95%=1, &#x0003c;91% = 2) , Retraction (None = 0 , Present =1, Present with nasal flare = 2 ), Ability to feed ( Normal= 0, Reduced = 1, Requires IVF = 2) and Respiratory rate ( &#x0003c;45/min=0 , 45-60/min =1, &#x0003e;60/min = 2). Mild severity was taken as a score &#x0003c; 3, moderate as 3-6 and severe as &#x0003e; 6. Multivariate analysis was done to identify the independent risk factors</p><p id="Par1144"><bold>Results:</bold> Out of the 150 children in our study, 35 (23.3%) had a score of &#x0003c; 3, 69 (46%) had 3 to 6 and 46 (30. 7%) had &#x0003e; 6. The independent risk factors for moderate to severe bronchiolitis (Score &#x0003e; 3) were RSV positivity (OR 1.46) , preterm birth (OR1.57) , passive smoking (OR 1.64) and family history of asthma (OR 1.63).</p><p id="Par1145"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Children with these risk factors should be monitored for severe disease. Anticipatory guidance to parents to avoid smoking is important since it is the only preventable factor.</p><p id="Par1146">IEC approval has been obtained from institution ethics committee.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec834"><title>ISSHID Abstract-P-9 Pyogenic Liver abscess, complicating Urinary Tract Infection in a toddler</title><sec id="Sec835"><title>Subiksha K, Latha Ravichandran, Sarala Premkumar, Elayaraja Sivaprakasam</title><sec id="Sec836"><title>Department of Paediatrics, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India</title><p id="Par1147"><bold>Background:</bold> Pyogenic liver abscess is a disease characterised by solitary or multiple collections of pus within the liver. The most common causative organisms are <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and Klebsiella. Pyogenic liver abscess, in a child with urinary tract infection (UTI) is a rare complication.</p><p id="Par1148"><bold>Case report:</bold> A 3 year old female child came to SRIHER with complaints of fever for 5 days which was low grade and intermittent. She was diagnosed with congenital right dysplastic kidney. The child was given amikacin for UTI in a nearby hospital as urine culture grew Escherichia coli, but fever continued. She was referred here for further management. There was a previous episode of UTI 1 year back.</p><p id="Par1149">Systemic examination was normal. Blood investigations showed anaemia and leucocytosis. Urine culture grew <italic>E. coli</italic>. USG KUB showed right dysplastic kidney. Child was given piperacillin tazobactam for UTI, but fever spikes continued and the child did not improve. Further investigations were done. USG abdomen showed cystic lesion in the liver. CECT abdomen revealed a large abscess in caudate lobe of liver. Pus from liver abscess (pigtail drainage) showed sterile necrotising inflammatory process. AFB and PAS stains were negative.</p><p id="Par1150">Patient was started on Cefaperazone Sulbactam and Metronidazole. Repeat urine culture showed no growth and IV antibiotics was continued for 14 days. Patient clinically improved and was discharged on oral antibiotics. Informed consent has been taken from parents for publication of their personal data.</p><p id="Par1151"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Any child with primary infection not responding to appropriate antibiotics, a search should be made for secondary septic focus and must be treated early.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec837"><title>ISSHID Abstract-P-10 A rare case of <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> induced AKI and rhabdomyolysis</title><sec id="Sec838"><title>Divya R, Sangeetha G, Umapathy P, Shuba S, Rajakumar PS, Shruthi TK, Krithika P, Ram Mohan</title><sec id="Sec839"><title>Department of Paediatrics, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education &#x00026; Research, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India</title><p id="Par1152"><bold>Background:</bold> Salmonella typhimurium infection usually presents with acute enteritis. However, rhabdomyolysis with acute kidney injury is a rare presentation in non-typhoidal salmonella species induced septicaemia (NTS). The incidence of such invasive NTS infections is extremely low, even in endemic areas.</p><p id="Par1153"><bold>Case Report:</bold> A previously healthy immunocompetent 3year old female child came to ER with high grade fever, vomiting, multiple episodes of diarrhoea for 2 days and an episode of seizure. On presentation she was drowsy with a GCS of 8/15. She was febrile, tachypnoeic, tachycardic with cold peripheries and feeble peripheral pulses. She was intubated and mechanically ventilated. In view of hypovolemia and suspected septic shock, she received fluid boluses, started on ionotropic support and IV antibiotics. Investigations revealed severe metabolic acidosis, deranged renal function and increased creatine phosphokinase suggestive of anuric AKI secondary to sepsis and rhabdomyolysis. Subsequently she developed microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, deranged coagulation profile and elevated transaminases. She was initiated on peritoneal dialysis and her urine output improved gradually with RFT showing an improving trend. Her blood culture showed Salmonella typhimurium and the diagnosis of non-typhoidal Salmonella species induced septicemia with Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) and acute kidney injury secondary to rhabdomyolysis was reached. Informed consent has been taken from parents for publication of their personal data</p><p id="Par1154"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> An immunocompetent child presenting with S. typhimurium septicemia resulting in MODS is rare. Also, rhabdomyolysis in such cases is highly unusual. A high index of suspicion for early recognition of rhabdomyolysis, extensive fluid replacement and appropriate treatment with antibiotics may help to reduce significant morbidity and mortality.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec840"><title>ISSHID Abstract-P-11 A rare complication of a common cold &#x02013; A case report on extra pulmonary manifestation of <italic>Mycoplasma Pneumoniae</italic></title><sec id="Sec841"><title>Sakti Priya, Pinnaka Subbarao, Dinesh kumar J, Sangeetha G, Ramachandran P</title><sec id="Sec842"><title>Department of Paediatrics, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, Chennai, India</title><p id="Par1155"><bold>Background:</bold><italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> is an important etiological agent in Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) It is frequently seen in children 3 to 15 years of age. <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> may present with varied extra pulmonary manifestation.</p><p id="Par1156"><bold>Case report:</bold> A 5 year old child presented with fever and cough for 6 days.

Neurological complications previously described include encephalopathy, encephalitis, immune-mediated syndromes and dengue-associated stroke. We present here a child with acute leukoencephalopathy with restricted diffusion (ALERD) triggered by dengue infection. This is the first report of this association to the best of our knowledge.</p><p id="Par1167"><bold>Case Report:</bold> A 9 month old girl presented with complaints of loose stools for three days, fever for one day, seizure followed by status epilepticus. She was intubated and seizures were controlled with four antiepileptics. Evaluation for cause of fever revealed Dengue infection. Her biochemical, metabolic, electrolyte parameters, CSF analysis were normal. On day five of illness she again developed left focal seizures followed by left hemiparesis and persistent drowsiness. MRI brain showed areas of restricted diffusion in the deep cerebral white matter of bilateral frontal, right parietal lobes and bilateral thalami without any signal changes in the corresponding T2 weighted/FLAIR images establishing the diagnosis of ALERD, with a classic central sparing pattern. Child was treated with IVIG following which neurological symptoms improved.</p><p id="Par1168">ALERD is a clinico-radiological diagnosis. Previously termed acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and late restricted diffusion (AESD), it develops in association with a systemic or CNS viral or bacterial infections. It is hypothesised that hypercytokinemia causing neuronal damage plays an important role. Informed consent has been taken from parents for publication of their child&#x02019;s personal data.</p><p id="Par1169"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Many novel treatable causes of acute encephalopathy are emerging.

A population-based study in USA states that 77% of children had primary HHV-6 infection by 24 months of age. Similar study in Japan showed 86% seroprevalence. Most children are asymptomatic and most common clinical presentation in symptomatic is Roseola (Exanthem Subitum). HHV-6 infection and association with febrile seizure is increasingly recognised but underreported or remains undiagnosed in India. HHV-6 encephalitis is rare manifestation but can have permanent neurologic sequelae. CSF analysis may be normal or suggestive of aseptic meningitis; PCR assay for HHV-6 DNA is reasonably sensitive and specific.</p><p id="Par1171"><bold>Case Report:</bold> We present 3 cases of HHV-6 encephalitis, all presenting with short febrile illness and multiple episodes of seizures. Diagnosis was confirmed within hours of presentation by CSF viral DNA-PCR assay and antibiotics empirically started were stopped. All were immunocompetent and recovered without antiviral therapy, one case had difficult to control seizures requiring multiple anti-epileptics (AEDs). There was no mortality and two cases are seizure free off AEDs. This is probably first case series of HHV-6 encephalitis to be published in India to our knowledge.</p><p id="Par1172"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This case series highlights HHV-6 as important cause to be considered in infants with encephalitis and multiple seizures. CSF PCR study is a rapid test with good sensitivity and specificity and is of significant value in antibiotic stewardship.</p><p id="Par1173">Informed consent has been taken from parents.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group></back></article>
