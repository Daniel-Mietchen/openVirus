    "The treatment of microbial infections has suffered greatly in this present century of pathogen dominance. Inspite of extensive research efforts and scientific advancements, the worldwide emergence of microbial tolerance continues to plague survivability. The innate property of microbe to resist any antibiotic due to evolution is the virtue of intrinsic resistance. However, the classical genetic mutations and extrachromosomal segments causing gene exchange attribute to acquired tolerance development. Rampant use of antimicrobials causes certain selection pressure which increases the resistance frequency. Genomic duplication, enzymatic site modification, target alteration, modulation in membrane permeability, and the efflux pump mechanism are the major contributors of multidrug resistance (MDR), specifically antibiotic tolerance development. MDRs will lead to clinical failures for treatment and pose health crisis. The molecular mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance are diverse as well as complex and still are exploited for new discoveries in order to prevent the surfacing of “superbugs.” Antimicrobial chemotherapy has diminished the threat of infectious diseases to some extent. To avoid the indiscriminate use of antibiotics, the new ones licensed for use have decreased with time. Additionally, in vitro assays and genomics for anti-infectives are novel approaches used in resolving the issues of microbial resistance. Proper use of drugs can keep it under check and minimize the risk of MDR spread."
