They die for causes that are very often preventable or treatable. Despite the convergence on the concept of health as a human right, there still exist intolerable global inequalities in accessing health and health services and in terms of life expectancy and morbidity and mortality from communicable and non-communicable diseases. The persistence of inequalities in terms of health &#x02013; not only between rich and poor countries, but also between different regions in the same country &#x02013; is also a contradiction to science, given the growing geographic interdependence of the biomedical causes and of the social determinants of health and diseases.</p><p id="JVEv4_501-para-0002">The causes of poor health for millions globally are rooted in political, social and economic injustices. Poverty is both a cause and a consequence of poor health. Marginalized groups and vulnerable individuals are often worst affected, deprived of the information, money or access to health services that would help them prevent and treat disease.</p><p id="JVEv4_501-para-0003">Global health is the health of populations in a global context. It is an area for study, research, and action that places a priority on improving health and achieving equity in health for all people worldwide, transcending the perspectives and concerns of individual nations. It emphasizes transnational health issues, determinants, and solutions; involves many disciplines within and beyond the Health Sciences; is a synthesis of population-based prevention with individual-level clinical care; with specific attention to the poor, the marginalized, the underserved.</p><p id="JVEv4_501-para-0004">The way the HIV pandemic has been addressed, despite being still an unfinished job, may be a model to fight wider health inequalities. Indeed, HIV/AIDS drew together &#x02013; towards the common objective of fighting a major health inequality &#x02013; scientists, and clinicians, governments and the UN, visionary politicians and economists, international organizations, pharmaceutical industry, both proprietary and generics, NGOs and faith based-organizations and patient organizations. It recognized the supranational character of problems of disease and their amelioration, and the fact that no individual country can adequately address diseases in the face of the movement of people, trade, microbes, and risks. It mobilized innovative drug production, pricing and procurement, both from generic and proprietary manufacturers. It recognized that people affected by disease have a crucial role in the discovery and advocacy of new modes of treatment and prevention and their equitable access. It based the action on ethical and moral values that recognize that equity and rights are central to the larger goals of preventing and treating diseases worldwide.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="JVEv4_1_502-sub-0001" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>S2&#x02003;Total HIV DNA as guidance for simplification strategies</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rutsaert</surname><given-names>Sofie</given-names></name></contrib><aff id="JVEv4_502-aff-0001">

Fewer drugs can reduce cost, avoid drug-drug interactions, improve tolerability and reduce toxicity for a lifelong treatment. The efficacy of mono and dual therapy has been explored in numerous clinical trials and the applicability depends on the individual patient and regimen. When a simplified regimen is applicable, total HIV DNA which reflects the number of infected cells in treated patients can aid in selecting eligible patients. A significant higher level of HIV DNA is observed in patients who fail virologically while on a simplified regimen, when compared to patients who maintained an undetectable viral load. This has been observed in different regimens (DRV/r monotherapy, RAL+ETR.) and indicates the validity of total HIV DNA in guiding the treatment strategies. However, to be clinical useful, this observation will have to be confirmed in a long-term and in other regimens, such as DTG/3TC or DTG/RPV dual therapy.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="JVEv4_1_503-sub-0001" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>S3&#x02003;A Platform for the Integrated Control of Arbovirosis in CATalonia (PICAT): Mosquito Alert 2.0</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bartumeus</surname><given-names>Frederic</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="JVEv4_503-aff-0001 JVEv4_503-aff-0002 JVEv4_503-aff-0003"><sup>1&#x02013;3</sup></xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Molina</surname><given-names>Israel</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="JVEv4_503-aff-0004"><sup>4</sup></xref></contrib><aff id="JVEv4_503-aff-0001">

Citizen science offers a set of innovative tools for public health management, allowing sustained and flexible data collection while facilitating public participation in problem solving. There is increasing evidence that combining citizen scientist data with other sources of information significantly improves our knowledge in a given area. In particular, once we adjust for sampling bias, vector data obtained through the Mosquito Alert citizen science program has almost the same quality and predictive power as the one obtained from traditional surveillance. We are now further integrating vector data with epidemiological and social relevant data into a digital platform to augment the information already available from public health sources and provide risk models and key information to public health authorities at near real-time. The scientific exploitation of citizen science programs and big data solutions, should effectively help to reduce the presence of targeted mosquitoes and minimize current health threats.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="JVEv4_1_2-sub-0001" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>S4&#x02003;Climate change, socio-political changes and emerging pandemics</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gonzalez</surname><given-names>Jean-Paul</given-names></name></contrib><aff id="JVEv4_1_2-aff-0001">

While pure liver steatosis is considered benign with low risk of progression to more severe liver disease, approximately 20% of NAFLD patients have histologic signs of necroinflammation with or without fibrosis, indicating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and are at risk of developing cirrhosis, end-stage liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Out of liver-related complications, it has been suggested that NAFLD may promote cardiovascular disease, maligancy and chronic kidney disease.</p><p id="JVEv4_504-para-0002">The persistence of comorbidities such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and NAFLD, after the cure of HCV infection may explain the progression of liver disease in some patients. In the French Cirvir cohort of HCV cirrhotic patients, the presence of metabolic syndrome was associated with a significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in SVR patients. In this setting, comorbidities should be managed once HCV infection is cured. Lifestyle interventions, control or treatment of diabetes should be encouraged. In case of persistent fibrosis, new molecules targeting NASH and/or fibrosis should be evaluated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="JVEv4_1_4-sub-0001" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>S7&#x02003;Lyme disease: where is the controversy?</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Perronne</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></contrib><aff id="JVEv4_1_4-aff-0001">

Despite its previous description in Europe at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century and at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, it has been officially described in the USA in the early seventies. A small group of experts from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) described the disease on expert opinion basis and not on scientific data. They declared and published that the disease was rare, easily diagnosed with very efficient serologic tests, easily cured with 2 or 3 weeks of antibiotic treatment, and that a chronic form of the disease did not exist.</p><p id="JVEv4_1_4-para-0002">However, the medical literature, including articles in major journals, is rich in publications showing that the causative agent, <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi,</italic> could be isolated by culture or PCR from seronegative patients and providing evidence that <italic>Borrelia sp.</italic> can persist in blood and tissues despite several weeks or months of antibiotic treatment. As emphasized by the ECDC in April 2016, Lyme serology is quite impossible to calibrate properly. The cause is the fact that, in absence of a diagnostic gold standard, it is impossible to define for sure populations of patients or controls. A meta-analysis published at the end of 2016 showed that the sensitivity of Lyme serology was less than 60%.</p><p id="JVEv4_1_4-para-0003">Moreover, serologic tests only exist for one strain of <italic>Borrelia</italic> in North America and 3 strains in Europe. There is no test available for the numerous <italic>Borrelia sp.</italic> found in ticks and already isolated from patients. We know from publications that patients suspected to have a chronic Lyme disease may harbor other bacteria such as <italic>Anaplasma, Bartonella</italic> (including strains previously unknown in humans), <italic>Ehrlichia, Neoerlichia, Rickettsia, Coxiella, Francisella, </italic>etc. They can also harbor parasites such as <italic>Babesia sp</italic>. Some labs, including veterinary labs, have developed promising PCR methods.</p><p id="JVEv4_1_4-para-0004">The consequence of the lack of reliable diagnostic tests in routine for Lyme and co-infections is the suffering and the wandering of millions of patients in the world, rejected by the medical community and often ending in psychiatry wards. Not a single controlled randomized study has evaluated the efficacy of prolonged anti-infectious treatment (longer than 3 months) on the chronic form of the disease. Despite the important underestimation of the incidence measured on serology, the official incidence of the disease is rising in many countries in America and Europe in huge proportions (such as 10 fold increase or more in a decade). Research funding is urgently needed to better manage this public health threatening infectious disease.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="JVEv4_1_7-sub-0001" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>S8&#x02003;HIV and lungs at the time of effective ART</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Routy</surname><given-names>Jean-Pierre</given-names></name></contrib><aff id="JVEv4_1_7-aff-0001">

Indeed, latently infected long-lived memory CD4+ T cells are the major obstacle in order to achieve a sterilizing cure. They not only remain invisible to the immune system, but are also unattainable by both antiretroviral therapy and cure approaches because of lack of targeting specificity of &#x02018;shock and kill&#x02019; strategies involving reactivation of the dormant virus. In a recent Nature article, Descours et al. (Nature 2018; 543: 564&#x02013;567) reported that CD32a, the low-affinity receptor for the immunoglobulin G Fc fragment may be a cell surface signature of CD4+ T cells harbouring latent HIV genomes.

Regarding the results of several phase 3 showing a significant impact upon overall survival compared with conventional chemotherapy, some ICI (ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, darvelumab) has already got FDA and/or EMA approval providing new standard of care for some cancer patients. PD-1 receptor for instance, which is expressed on activated T cells, in link with ligands PDL-1 and PDL-2 expressed in tumor cells, remains the cornerstone for the rational for the development of such drugs. For sure, like other antitumor therapies, ICI can cause some sides effects and for the majority of them we have improved in their understanding and some recommendations have already been published to take care of them. Moreover, a new strategy in immunotherapy field has also recently emerged: the CAR T-cells. In HIV setting, cancer remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. PD-1 expression on HIV-specific T cells is associated with T cell exhaustion and some preclinical studies have suggested that blocking the PD-1/PDL-1 axis with monoclonal antibodies would be of highest interest during HIV associated lymphoma and may be other cancers. As HIV infected patients are generally excluded from the clinical trials in oncology, we need some data about tolerance and efficacy of using ICI in HIV infected patients with cancer.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="JVEv4_1_8-sub-0001" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>S11&#x02003;HPV vaccination: use in prevention and in cure</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Konopnicki</surname><given-names>Deborah</given-names></name></contrib><aff id="JVEv4_1_8-aff-0001">

Participants also described concerns about whether informal ARVs offer sufficient protection against HIV, and exhibited limited knowledge about the proper use of PEP or PrEP.</p></sec><sec id="JVEv4_v4_01-sec-0004"><title id="JVEv4_v4_01-title-0004">Conclusions</title><p id="JVEv4_v4_01-para-0004">This study documented informal ARV use among HIV-negative MSM.

HIV-1 infection is relied majorly on virological synapses (VS) to mediate and bud free virions from infected cells to susceptible target cells. Galectin is the &#x003b2;-galactoside binding lectin. We previously proved that Galectin-3(Gal-3) promoted HIV-1 NL4-3 budding via association with Alix and p6Gag and Gal-3 was localized in membrane lipid rafts.

This phenomenon could be compensated when repairing a.a. deletions in the 07_BCp6Gag. Immunofluorescent staining indicates that Gal3 expression facilitated Gag, GM1 (lipid raft marker) and LFA-1 to have higher colocalization in VSs of CD4 T cells infected with NL4-3 than with CRF07_BC viruses.

DTG and STR trough concentrations were adapted. No change among renal markers studied. Nevertheless, we found a significant decrease of eGFR with DTG, reflected the interactions with efflux renal transporters. Despite the presence of Cobi and TDF no impact on eGFR was observed in STR arm, probably due to lower creatininemia at D0.

HCMV, a virus that infects people of all ages, is not overly pathogenic in immunocompetent people. However, in HIV-infected individuals, HCMV is associated with a wide range of serious clinical diseases, such as retinitis, pneumonitis, colitis and other end organ disease, as well as with indication of more rapid HIV disease progression and increased occurrence of AIDS-related events. Recently, HCMV has also been associated with a higher risk of HIV transmission. The combined use of antivirals targeting HIV and HCMV may be beneficial both for patients already infected with HIV-1 as well as for prevention of HIV-1 transmission. The development of dual-targeted drugs that combine anti-HIV-1 activity and anti-co-pathogen activity constitutes a new step in therapeutic strategy. Potentially such drugs may be less toxic than combinations of several compounds.</p></sec><sec id="JVEv4_v4_34-sec-0002"><title id="JVEv4_v4_34-title-0002">Materials and methods</title><p id="JVEv4_v4_34-para-0002">Compounds were synthesized starting from corresponding 1-[&#x003c9;-(4-bromophenoxy)alkyl]uracil derivatives and 2&#x02019;,3&#x02019;-dideoxy-3&#x02019;-azidothymidine (AZT).

The side effects of PrEP were limited to 7% digestive disorders and 1% cephalgias. No HIV or hepatitis B seroconversions were observed. 2 patients had acute hepatitis C, including 1 with a co-infection hepatitis A that required the cessation of PrEP. 4 acute hepatitis A were diagnosed. Among the 228 MSM, 17 showed Syphilis, 40 had Gonorrhea, 33 Chlamydiae and 10 with a Lymphogranuloma Venereal. There were a total of 123 episodes of treated STDs (17 Syphilis, 56 Gonorrhea, 40 Chlamydiae, 10 LGV).

Each year in Mali, CC claims the lives of over 1,000 women. Existing HPV vaccines are safe and increasingly accessible.
