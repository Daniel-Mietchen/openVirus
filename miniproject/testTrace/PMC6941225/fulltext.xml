A series of algorithms were applied to identify potentially destabilizing residues in the framework of the Fv region. Of 17 residues defined, a variant was identified encompassing 1 light and 3 heavy chain residues, with significantly increased conformational stability while maintaining full neutralization activity. Central to the stabilization was the replacement of the heavy chain residue T108 with R108 at the base of the CDR3 loop which allowed for the formation of a nascent salt bridge with heavy chain residue D137. Three additional mutations were necessary to confer increased conformational stability as evidenced by differential scanning fluorimetry and isothermal chemical unfolding. In addition, we observed increased stability during low pH incubation in which 40% of the parental monomer aggregated while the combinatorial variant showed no increase in aggregation. Incubation of the variant at 100 mg/mL for 6 weeks at 40&#x000b0;C showed a 9-fold decrease in subvisible particles &#x02265;2 &#x003bc;m relative to the parental molecule. Stability-based designs have also translated to improved pharmacokinetics. Together, these data show that increasing conformational stability of the Fab can have profound effects on the manufacturability and long-term stability of a monoclonal antibody.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>analytical biochemistry</kwd><kwd>antibody(s)</kwd><kwd>biopharmaceutical characterization</kwd><kwd>developability</kwd><kwd>fluorescence spectroscopy</kwd><kwd>high throughput technology(s)</kwd><kwd>HIV/AIDS</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>physical stability</kwd><kwd>protein aggregation</kwd><kwd>protein folding</kwd><kwd>protein structure</kwd><kwd>stability</kwd><kwd>stabilization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group id="kwrds0015"><title>Abbreviations used</title><kwd>bnAbs, broadly neutralizing antibodies</kwd><kwd>CDR, Complementary determining region</kwd><kwd>COGs, Cost of goods</kwd><kwd>DSF, Differential scanning fluorimetry</kwd><kwd>Gdn-HCl, Guanidine hydrochloride</kwd><kwd>HC, Heavy chain</kwd><kwd>HMW, High molecular weight</kwd><kwd>HP-SEC, High performance size exclusion chromatography</kwd><kwd>LC, Light chain</kwd><kwd>mAb, monoclonal antibody</kwd><kwd>PK, Pharmacokinetic</kwd><kwd>PBS, Phosphate buffered saline</kwd><kwd>PEG, Polyethylene glycol</kwd><kwd>CDCA, Stability design by covariance analysis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">With more than 30&#x000a0;years of the HIV epidemic, there is still no cure or an effective vaccine for HIV.

Because of the large number of potentially destabilizing sites we identified in the Fv region of the antibody, we developed a dual-stage approach for the molecular optimization procedure. Focusing on conformational stability by DSF using an information-rich metric, the weighted shoulder score (WSS), enabled the identification of 5 sites that retained activity and showed improvement as single mutations. Combination of these sites allowed for identification of multiple variants with significant increases in conformational stability as measured by both thermal and chemical methods. In addition, molecules with both increased thermal and chemical stability demonstrated improvements during low-pH treatment and in long-term stability at 40&#x000b0;C, both factors which are important for improved manufacturability and storage time outside of the cold chain, an important factor for supplying these drugs to the Sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, production of stable CHO cell lines with one of the variants has consistently resulted in productivity levels of &#x0003e;2 g/L/d, allowing for production in flexible manufacturing facilities at low cost.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Calculation of Covariance Violations</title><p id="p0035">Mutational impacts on stability were calculated using Stability Design by Covariance Analysis which uses a method known as covariance analysis<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> to evaluate all possible residue pairs in an underlying antibody sequence database to search for specific residue positions that covary, meaning their residue properties for those sites tend to be correlated. This correlation was based not on specific residue types but on residue groupings of acidic (DE), basic (KRH), hydrophobic (ALIMCVP), aromatic (FWY), neutral (NQSTBZ), and deletion (G*X). Positions for the 10-1074 were assigned based on the AHo<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> numbering system. Positions that break the covariance with multiple covarying states within the underlying reference set are considered to be covariance violators and potential stability-degrading sites. 10-1074 contains 17 strong covariance violations (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). There were also one potential isomerization site and one potential deamidation site which could impact the neutralization function. In addition, 4 missing residues that normally present in the N-terminal peptide were identified and included in a subset of the variant design. Structure considerations, structurally aligned<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> positional frequency analysis, and germline background were used to determine modifications that would repair these violations. Building all possible combinatorial variants with a single remediation at each site would have resulted in 524,287 variants of the parental antibody. To reduce the variant production set, the variant space was explored in 2 rounds of engineering. The initial round included all the sites as individual site variants, one variant with all the sites deemed potentially structurally safe for maintained activity, one variant grouping the sites structurally near the LC N-terminal region, and one variant grouping the sites sequentially near the LC N-terminal region, resulting in 22 variants. Activity and biophysical characterization data from the initial round were then used to downselect the positions to be combined in a second engineering round. This resulted in 5 positions combined in all combinations not explored in the initial round, resulting in 26 variants.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>10-1074 Residues Identified as Potential Destabilizing and Variant of Each Site for Production</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Molecule Set<xref rid="tbl1fna" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref></th><th>Light Chain</th><th>Heavy Chain</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>MS-194<xref rid="tbl1fnb" ref-type="table-fn">b</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>MS-203</td><td>LmdV:Y2P</td><td/></tr><tr><td>MS-204</td><td>LmdV:R7P</td><td/></tr><tr><td>MS-205</td><td>LmdV:P9S</td><td/></tr><tr><td>MS-206</td><td>LmdV:E17Q</td><td/></tr><tr><td>MS-207</td><td>LmdV:H46Q</td><td/></tr><tr><td>MS-208</td><td>LmdV:P81.1N</td><td/></tr><tr><td>MS-209</td><td>LmdV:I81.3S</td><td/></tr><tr><td>MS-210</td><td>LmdV:N82G</td><td/></tr><tr><td>MS-211</td><td>LmdV:R88T</td><td/></tr><tr><td>MS-212</td><td>LmdV:D110E</td><td/></tr><tr><td>MS-213</td><td>LmdV:A142G</td><td/></tr><tr><td>MS-214</td><td/><td>HV:D29G</td></tr><tr><td>MS-215</td><td/><td>HV:S47P</td></tr><tr><td>MS-216</td><td/><td>HV:V79T</td></tr><tr><td>MS-217</td><td/><td>HV:R82V</td></tr><tr><td>MS-218</td><td/><td>HV:L89F</td></tr><tr><td>MS-219</td><td/><td>HV:T108R</td></tr><tr><td>MS-220</td><td/><td>HV:K141Q</td></tr><tr><td>MS-224</td><td/><td>HV:<italic>N</italic>75Q</td></tr><tr><td>MS-221</td><td>LmdV:Y2P LmdV:R7P LmdV:P9S</td><td/></tr><tr><td>MS-222</td><td>LmdV:Y2P LmdV:R7P LmdV:P9S LmdV:A142G</td><td/></tr><tr><td>MS-223</td><td>LmdV:Y2P LmdV:R7P LmdV:P9S LmdV:E17Q LmdV:H46Q LmdV:A142G</td><td>HV:S47P HV:K141Q</td></tr><tr><td>MS-257</td><td>LmdV:Gap5L LmdV:Gap6T LmdV:R7Q LmdV:Gap8P LmdV:Gap10S</td><td/></tr><tr><td>MS-258</td><td>LmdV:Gap5L LmdV:Gap6T LmdV:Gap8P LmdV:Gap10S</td><td/></tr><tr><td>MS-259</td><td>LmdV:Gap5L LmdV:Gap6T LmdV:R7Q LmdV:Gap8P LmdV:P9L LmdV:Gap10S</td><td/></tr><tr><td>MS-260</td><td>LmdV:Gap5L LmdV:Gap6T LmdV:Gap8P LmdV:P9L LmdV:Gap10S</td><td/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tbl1fna"><label>a</label><p id="ntpara0015">All variants including the MS-194 contain the Xtend mutation (LS) in the Fc of the heavy chain.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tbl1fnb"><label>b</label><p id="ntpara0020">MS-194 is also referred to as parental (+LS) in the manuscript.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="p0040">In addition to the mutations to increase conformational and colloidal stability, it was desirable to increase half-life, and therefore, the Xencor Xtend mutation set consisting of Fc-C:M104L and Fc-C:N112S was introduced to all variants in both the first and second rounds.

A number of issues can arise during the manufacturing process including low titers, aggregation, undesirable posttranslational modifications, poor purification performance, and low pH instability during viral clearance. In addition, inherent instability of the antibodies based on colloidal and thermodynamic parameters may manifest during long-term storage as aggregation, precipitation, viscosity, and chemical instability. A series of algorithms including covariance analysis,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> hotspot analysis, and structural analysis were applied to the Fv region (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table&#x000a0;1</xref>) to identify residues that were either potentially destabilizing, susceptible to chemical degradation, or may have led to aggregation or increased viscosity. Stability Design by Covariance Analysis uses a method known as covariance analysis to evaluate all possible residue pairs in an underlying antibody sequence database to search for specific residue positions that covary, meaning their residue properties for those sites tend to be correlated. An evaluation of the query sequence against the underlying alignment identifies its residues that violate covariance. To aid in engineering of the Fv, the Fab structure was built using the Antibody Modeler tool within the Molecular Operating Environment.<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> This analysis (see <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="sec">materials and methods</xref>) resulted in 17 stability violations, one potential isomerization site, one potential deamidation site, and identification of 4 missing residues normally present in the N-terminal peptide, all of which were included in the variant design process. The first round of variant designs included the production and characterization of each site individually. Other designs included combinations of residue substitutions to build a single variant with all the sites deemed unlikely to impact function, a single variant combining the LC N-terminal residues clustered structurally, a single variant combining the LC N-terminal sequence cluster, and a series of variants containing the deleted N-terminal residues (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>).<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Hot spots identified in the 10-1074 parental molecule. 10-1074 hot spots were identified as described in materials and methods.

Therefore, we devised a method to initially explore the combinatorial space by determining which of the residues potentially affected HIV neutralization, along with defining residues that increased the conformational stability of the Fab domain.

While many variants consisting of substitutions in both the LCs and HCs showed HMW of less than 10%, there were variants consisting of only substitutions in the LC that exhibited HMW levels of almost 40% by a single mutation. Two of the single LC variants, MS-204 and MS-205, which correspond to LmdV:R7P and LmdV:P9S, are near the N-terminus and exposed to the solvent. They reached aggregation levels of 34% and 28%, respectively. In contrast, modification at the LC position N+1, Y2P, showed no increase in aggregation and stabilized the Fab during thermal unfolding as discussed in the following paragraphs. Two other variants, MS-207 (H46Q) and MS-209 (I81.3S), also showed high levels of aggregation reaching 35% and 39%. Interestingly, the variant with the lowest %HMW species was MS-221, with a value of 2.5%. This variant consisted of a cluster of N-terminal residues containing the sites for MS-203, MS-204, and MS-205, supporting our contention that multiple modifications will likely produce the greatest stability. Variants with less than 10% HMW were considered for the second round combinatorial variants.</p><p id="p0190">In addition to HP-SEC analysis, DSF was used to define molecules with increased thermal stability. DSF analysis of antibodies generally results in multiple transitions, with the earliest being the unfolding of the CH2 domain between 65&#x000b0;C and 70&#x000b0;C for an IgG1, followed by the Fab domain between 70&#x000b0;C-85&#x000b0;C and possibly a third transition for the CH3 domain.<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> The first derivative of the raw absorbance curve for the 10-1074 parental (+LS) molecule (MS-194) showed only a single transition with a Tm of 69.9&#x000b0;C and no clear Tm for a second transition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>) likely due to the CH2 and Fab domains unfolding at similar temperatures. In contrast, a single mutation in the HC, HV:T108R, clearly produced a second transition with a Tm2 of 75.7&#x000b0;C while maintaining the original transition with a Tm1 at 70.3&#x000b0;C. Because only a single mutation was introduced, we posit that the second transition is due to a greater thermal stabilization of the Fab and, more specifically, the Fv domain. The presence of a second transition occurred in a subset of the variants with a distribution across both the HC and LC. The second transition in most variants though was weak as exemplified by the first derivative trace of MS-203 in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2a</xref>. To provide a more quantitative analysis of the DSF data rather than only identifying the presence of Tm1 and Tm2, a metric termed the WSS was developed which accounts for the complexity and the relative temperature shift of the Fab-related peaks in the DSF curves. The results of the quantitation are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2b</xref> and provide for differentiation of the variants relative to their thermal stability. Based on these data, the HV:T108R mutation shows the greatest degree of stabilization as compared to the parental molecule. Other molecules with significant increases in stabilization include LmdV:Y2P (MS-203), LmdV:I81S (MS-209), LmdV:N82G (MS-210), HV:79T (MS-216), HV:R82V (MS-217), and HV:L89F (MS-218). Interestingly, the grouped combinations of variants including those with and without a second transition did not result in the observation of a second transition for those variants, see MS-221, MS-222, and MS-223. In fact, for MS-221, the Tm and WSS were lower than those of the parental molecule, suggesting a slight destabilization of the domain. Similar results were observed for the variants, with the N-terminal insertions illustrating the complex balance of amino acids defining the structural integrity of this region.<fig id="fig2"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Increased thermal stability was observed for multiple round 1 variants.

The loss of neutralization activity across only a few virus isolates was confirmed by expanding the data set to an additional 6 pseudoviruses and showed that, in some cases, the neutralization activity was not concordant with the parental molecule (data not shown). Variant MS-209, which is positionally equivalent to MS-208 but a mutation to Ser rather than Asn, retained full activity across all 12 pseudoviruses tested. The combinatorial variants, MS-221 and MS-223, also showed retention of full activity, demonstrating that multiple mutations can be made in the framework region of the Fv domain and still retain full activity of the bnAbs.

With the DSF data, the transition temperatures alone did not clearly differentiate the thermal stability differences between the variants. For this reason, we developed the WSS, that is, an empirical aggregate quantitative measure of the difference in transition temperatures and intensities of the transitions which more clearly differentiates the thermal stability of the variants. The cumulative effects of the combinatorial modifications are plotted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref> and demonstrate the presence of 2 distinct groups, with and without HV:T108R. While this mutation appears to be a major driving force in the conformational stability, the other 4 mutations provide complementary effects. Those effects were differentiated for each of the 5 mutations on the 3 conformational stability measures and the 2 &#x0201c;detrimental&#x0201d; species seen by HP-SEC (oligomer and dimer) using analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing looking only at first-order effects.

From these results, the beneficial and detrimental effects of each mutation can be seen. Of note again was the mutation HV:T108R which was present in all the combinatorial variant sets displaying the highest WSS and is calculated in the ANOVA as having a large, significant effect. Combinatorial variants without HV:T108R and variant MS-247 which contained all 5 mutations including HV:T108R did not display a Tm2 (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table&#x000a0;4</xref>), while all the variants with HV:T108R are differentiated from the other variants by the presence of Tm2. The range of WSS for the variants with a Tm2 was from 16.01 to 29.39. The WSS for variants without a Tm2 ranged from 7.22 to 10.03, demonstrating an increase in thermal stability for some variants albeit they did not show the presence of a distinct Tm2.<fig id="fig3"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>HVT108R is central to stabilizing the 10-1074 variants.

This is seen in the ANOVA results as notable positive inflection point effects for 3 of the 5 mutations. Only one variant, MS-225, with a double mutation of LmdV:Y2P and HV:V79T, showed a decrease in the inflection point from that of the parental molecule. The reduction in conformational stability correlated with a reduction in the WSS and Tm1. The variants with the highest inflection points all have HV:T108R, with an average value of 2.94 M compared to an average value of 2.57 M for variants without the mutation and a value of 2.44 M for the parental molecule.</p><p id="p0220">Colloidal stability was measured by aggregation after low-pH incubation and by PEG solubility. For the low-pH assay, the antibody is first incubated at pH 3.3 followed by neutralization and analysis by HP-SEC. This technique allows us to interrogate both the conformational (low-pH unfolding) and colloidal stability (aggregation upon neutralization) of the molecule in a single experiment. The technique also allows us to define the expected performance of the antibody during viral inactivation. After neutralization, the aggregate level of the parental 10-1074 antibody, MS-194, increased from 8% to 40% with the majority of the aggregate being oligomer. In contrast, the second round variants showed a change in aggregate levels from&#x000a0;&#x02212;3.3% to&#x000a0;+29.5% after neutralization with combinatorial variants containing the HV:T108R mutation showing postneutralization aggregate level changes of&#x000a0;&#x02212;3.3% to&#x000a0;+4.5%. Other than the variant MS-228, all the molecules containing the HV:T108R mutation showed a decrease in the level of aggregation by an average of 2.2%. Solubility was also used as a measure of colloidal stability to understand the aggregation propensity at high protein concentration in the final drug product. The solubility profile of the parental molecule with increasing concentrations of PEG was mapped out, and the inflection point at 50% solubility determined to be 7.9% in PBS. This point was used to test each of the variants for either increases or decreases in solubility due to the modifications made in the framework region of the Fab. All the variants showed an increase in the solubility profile with the values ranging from 7% to 42% increase over the parental molecule indicative of an increase in colloidal stability for the variants. The ANOVA results show small decreases in aggregate levels (reported as percent high molecular weight, %HMW) for the first 3 heavy-chain mutations and a large effect for the HV:T108R mutation.</p><p id="p0225">The neutralization capacity of a subset of the combinatorial variants was also examined to ensure no loss in neutralization occurred (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table&#x000a0;6</xref>).

With average daily temperatures up to 30&#x000b0;C,<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr"><sup>52</sup></xref> it may be possible to obtain enough time outside the cold chain to avoid or significantly reduce refrigeration requirements at rural health posts by designing more stable therapeutics. Similar to viral inactivation, protein aggregation, a major degradant during room temperature storage, is related to conformational stability. This would suggest that it is reasonable to expect that increasing conformational stability, thereby lowering protein aggregation, will lead to increased storage stability necessary for delivery of a product in more remote regions of sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p id="p0265">Multiple publications have shown that modification of residues within the Fv region can increase the conformational stability of the Fab<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> with greater increases associated with multiple modifications. Here we specifically targeted residues in the framework regions 1-4 using a purely computational approach based on the method of Gunasekaran et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> to determine which could potentially destabilize the domain. Residues of the CDR loops 1-3 were considered integral to the binding and neutralization activity of the bnAb and were not modified. Prior work by Klein et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> showed that somatic mutations of the framework region, which we targeted, were required for the broad and potent HIV-1 neutralization and that mutations at these sites back to germline lead to a loss in neutralization activity. In our work, we identified potentially destabilizing residues based on covariance violations analysis by comparing with publicly accessible databases. By doing this, not all somatically hypermutated residues were targeted, and in fact, many of the residues mutated to germline by Klein et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> did not demonstrate significant covariance violations and were not mutated. In addition, we did not always mutate residues back to germline but rather back to residues in line with covariance based on our database.</p><p id="p0270">We identified 17 potentially destabilizing residues in the framework region. Ideally, we would test all combinations of the residue replacements resulting in 2<sup>&#x02227;</sup>17 combinatorial variants. Because it is unreasonable to produce and characterize this number of molecules, we devised a strategy based on first determining which residues, as single variants, were important for neutralization activity. Surprisingly, only 2 of the residues, LmdV:H46Q and LmdV:P81N, showed a loss in activity, and this was only for a limited number of HIV isolates with full neutralization activity for other isolates with these variants. LmdV:H46Q is at the bottom of the Fv but points toward the variable light core and may partially disrupt packing. LmdV:P81N is on the outside edge of the framework 3 loop and interacts with the gp120 glycan. Mutation from a Pro to an Asn may disrupt the interaction either directly or indirectly through perturbation of the structure leading to a decrease in binding. Together, this not only demonstrates the high degree of specificity of interactions with different HIV isolates but also the plasticity of the interactions of residues within the framework. We also found that as long as a modified residue retained neutralization activity, combinations of these residues retained activity, demonstrating the independent nature of the interactions with the HIV.</p><p id="p0275">To explore the conformational space of the combinatorial variants, we used DSF to characterize the conformational stability during thermal unfolding, Gnd-HCl denaturation to characterize conformation and side chain packing stability of the core residues during chemical unfolding, and low-pH stability to explore the conformational and colloidal stability during low-pH stress. Combining these 3 techniques allowed us to gain a more global view of different energetics leading to the stability of the Fab domain. Based on these studies, the central role of the HV:T108R mutation stabilizing the HV-CDR3 became apparent. The parental molecule showed only a single melting transition likely comprised of both the CH2 and Fab domains based on differential scanning calorimetry thermal unfolding profiles of mAbs.<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> Of the single site mutations, the HV:T108R mutation showed the highest WSS and the most distinct Tm2 transition. Similar observations were made for the combinatorial variants that contained the HV:T108R mutation compared with the parental molecule and variants without the mutation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>). This central role was confirmed through studies using chemical unfolding with Gnd-HCl in which the combinatorial variants with the HV:T108R showed an average increase in guanidine concentration of 0.5M for the inflection point. The stabilization carried through to resistance by low pH unfolding in which the single variant showed a 4% increase in HMW formation while the parental molecule showed a 40% HMW formation after neutralization. In the context of combinatorial variants, those containing the HV:T108R mutation all demonstrated resistance to aggregation upon neutralization from the low-pH incubation.</p><p id="p0280">In the parental form of 10-1074, the antibody contains Thr at the ASN position HV:108, which forms hydrogen bonds the backbone of HV:V138 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;7</xref>) with a calculated energy of&#x000a0;&#x02212;9.3 kcal/mol. The presence of HV:T108 in 10-1074, however, produces a high number of covariance violations in the IGHV4 subgroup. A positional frequency analysis of this position indicates that within this subgroup, the site is Arg at a frequency of 82%. An evaluation of the germlines closest to 10-1074 also indicates that Arg is preferred at this position and that Asp is preferred at position HV:137, which is the residue found at HV:137 in 10-1074. A mutation of HV:T108R removes the covariance violation. Examination of the Fv structure in the region of HV:T108 clearly demonstrates the stabilizing role in the structure. HV:T108 is located at the base of the extended HC-CDR3 loop forming a hydrogen bond contact between the hydroxyl oxygen and the HV:V138 amide hydrogen of the opposing &#x003b2;-strand on the base of the other side of the HC-CDR3 loop. The calculated energy of this H-bond is&#x000a0;&#x02212;9.3 kcal/mol. By mutating the HC:T108 to an Arg residue (structure modeling performed using the antibody modeler tool within the Molecular Operating Environment<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref>), the guanidino group of the Arg can now interact with the carboxyl group of HV:D137 on the opposing &#x003b2;-strand at the C-terminus of the CDR3 loop resulting in a calculated&#x000a0;&#x02212;36.3 kcal/mol through ionic interactions with HV:D137 and&#x000a0;&#x02212;4.9 kcal/mol through H-bond interactions with HV:V138, effectively stabilizing the CDR3 loop. We believe it is this stabilization that is manifested in the thermal, chemical, and low pH unfolding of the molecule. We hypothesize that during low-pH incubation of the parental molecule, the carboxylate of HV:D137 is protonated and destabilizes the HC-CDR3 loop such that when the antibody is neutralized, the hydrophobic and nonpolar residues of the loop interact with those of other molecules forming dimers and oligomers. The salt bridge between the guanidine group of HV:R108 with the carboxylate of HV:D137 prevents protonation of the carboxylate such that the Fv remains folded at low pH. An evaluation of existing antibody structures was performed using the SAbDab<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr"><sup>55</sup></xref> database to list human antibodies with Kabat-defined HC-CDR3s with a crystal structure resolution better than 3.0 &#x000c5;. This analysis indicates that the presence of HV:R108-HV:D137 occurs 290 times in the 664 structures evaluated, illustrating a high occurrence of this ionic interaction.<fig id="fig7"><label>Figure&#x000a0;7</label><caption><p>HV:T108R mutation forms multiple ionic interactions to stabilize CDR3.

Initially, we picked the mutations LmdV:Y2P, HV:V79T, HV:R82V, and HV:L89F based on stabilization observed through thermal analysis and proceeded with the combinatorial variants. The double combinatorials with the LmdV:Y2P appeared to destabilize the molecule through a decrease in the value of the WSS from the single variants to the combinatorials. The WSS analysis was developed after we proceeded to round 2 combinatorials making the analysis of the singles retrospective. The destabilizing effect carried through to the triple combinatorials as well, with the addition of the LmdV:Y2P only modestly affecting the WSS and the chemical unfolding inflection point value while causing a significant increase in the %HMW after low-pH hold and neutralization. For instance, the HV:V79T/HV:L89F had an HMW value of 12%, while the presence of LmdV:Y2P increased the value to 22%. The 10-1074 parental bnAb has a 3 amino acid deletion between residues 4-6, 8, and 10 at the N-terminus of the LC causing a dramatic change in the position of the N-terminus from other antibodies without the deletions.<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr"><sup>56</sup></xref> An evaluation of the LC N-terminal strand via LowMode molecular dynamics (MOE) was performed with both LmdV:Y2 and LmdV:P2 versions, resulting in no obvious stabilizing interactions for the LmdV:Y2 form. However, the presence of a hydroxyl group on the tyrosine would allow for hydrogen bonding interactions after some loosening of the structure during low pH stress and that could stabilize the LmdV:Y2 form during pH neutralization. Other double combinatorials demonstrated increased stability with those containing the LmdV:T108R showing the most improvement across all assays with the double combinatorial HV:L89F/HV:T108R performing the best. Structurally, HV:L89 is in a hydrophobic pocket between HV-CDR1 and HV-CDR2 containing the indole ring of HV:W41 and side chain of HV:I58. Substituting Phe for Leu at position 89 would allow for pi-pi ring stacking interactions after some rearrangement of the residues leading to increased stability with this carrying into the triple and quadruple variants.</p><p id="p0290">The effect of the optimization process was clearly defined by molecules with increased conformational stability, but other factors were necessary to consider to define a molecule with the needed manufacturability and stability profiles. Three molecules were picked with varying degrees of conformational stability to test in our models. While scale-down studies of the purification process showed no obvious problems with purification, they did validate the use of the low-pH model to predict aggregation during the viral inactivation step. The results of the stability studies at 40&#x000b0;C were unexpected in demonstrating that while the rates of HMW formation were unchanged, the formation of subvisible particles was greatly reduced, with the quadruple combinatorial variant, MS-202, showing the greatest reduction during storage. This itself provides an advantage toward achieving some room temperature stability in&#x000a0;sub-Saharan Africa because of the expected variation in temperatures across the region.<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr"><sup>57</sup></xref> In addition, this would provide for greater time outside the cold chain as is expected in rural areas without a consistent source of electricity. Recent approvals of mAb-based biologics such as Amjevita&#x000ae; (Amgen) and Dupixent&#x000ae; (Regeneron) have shown that the agencies are willing to allow for room temperature stability albeit an upper temperature limit of 25&#x000b0;C for 14 days is placed on the product. While this is reasonable, it would be difficult to verify, necessitating the need for stability above the stated temperatures or the length of time.</p><p id="p0295">The modifications of these antibodies were based on those commonly observed in mAb databases based on the structural identity at each residue and not necessarily based on germline residues. It was not necessarily surprising then that one combinatorial variant, MS-201, showed an increased signal in the polyreactivity assay. Studies by Wardemann et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> have demonstrated that during the somatic mutation process of antibody maturation, numerous mutations from germline are introduced that result in increased polyreactivity. A major difference between MS-201 and the other 2 combinatorial variants was the presence of HV:L89F, which by itself, would not be expected to increase polyreactivity as it is buried within the interior of the Fv. It seems likely then that the increased polyreactivity was the result of minor structural rearrangements on the exterior surface of the bnAb possibly exposing the HV:F89 to the solvent. Tissue cross-reactivity studies against a variety of human tissue samples (data not shown) were negative for any of the bnAbs other than nonspecific cytoplasm-binding ones. Because 10-1074 is already in the clinic and negative for polyreactivity, the increase for MS-201 was enough to exclude it for being chosen as the final optimized variant.</p><p id="p0300">The elimination half-life of 10-1074 in humans is 24 days<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and not optimal for maintaining adequate trough levels in preexposure prophylaxis if injections are delivered every 3&#x000a0;months. Therefore, the Xencor Xtend<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr"><sup>58</sup></xref> Fc mutations were introduced to increase half-life and maintain adequate trough levels with dosing every 3&#x000a0;months. The final dose is dependent on a low-enough COGs allowing for treatment in the sub-Saharan Africa region. Testing of the variants in a Tg276 mouse model,<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> which has been shown to correlate to half-life in humans, interestingly demonstrated a possible effect of mutations in the Fv region on the half-life of the molecule. All variants with the Xtend mutation had a longer elimination half-life than the parental molecule without the Xtend mutation. The MS-202 variant showed a half-life that was greater than that of the other 2 variants leading us to pick the MS-202 variant as the final optimized form. The reason for the differences in half-life between the variants is unclear and may be related to variability in the assay due to the minimal purification of the molecules. We state this as comparison of the MS-202 variant with the Parental-LS in the same model shows no difference between the 2 molecules when both are produced using stable cell lines and GMP manufacturing practices even though they show a statistically significant difference here. Because of the inherent variability in animal studies, statistically significant differences between variant elimination half-lives should be interpreted cautiously when applied to human studies. However, studies by Wang et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr"><sup>61</sup></xref> of mAbs with the same wild-type human Fc sequences but different Fab domains were shown to bind FcRn with considerable differences in both the binding at acidic pH and the dissociation at neutral pH, suggesting that the Fab domain may also have an impact on FcRn interaction. Therefore, we cannot rule out a true difference between the variants although additional studies in the <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> model used here would be required to sort this out.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0305">Bringing biologics such as bnAbs into developing countries is a daunting task because of multiple issues including logistics, COGs, and cold chain distribution. While cold chain distribution lanes are in place for vaccines, they are often filled to capacity such that bringing in bnAbs through these established systems may initially be difficult. Rural areas outside of the major cities will prove to be problematic because of the lack of a stable electric grid and transportation of the drug product within a cold chain. Designing the molecule to better deal with these problems such as time outside the cold chain and high temperature stress will go a long way toward helping solve many of the problems we expect to encounter. COGs is another issue that will be just as difficult but manageable with the manufacturing costs decreasing over time. Many areas of manufacturing are ripe for cost reduction from the bioreactor productivity to downstream processing and size and flexibility of the manufacturing plant. These improvements, together with dose reductions due to increased half-life, will help lead to introduction of these products to the market in low- and middle-income countries to reduce, and eventually eliminate, the global spread of HIV.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="other"
