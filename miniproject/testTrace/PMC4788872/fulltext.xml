Following detection in the US swine population during May, 2013 the virus spread rapidly throughout the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. During the initial outbreak, the American Association of Swine Veterinarians, the National Pork Producers Council and the USDA Center for Epidemiology and Animal Health conducted an epidemiological investigation involving case and control herds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Of the 100 variables surveyed, 7 were significantly associated (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) with having higher odds of acquiring PED, with all associated with the process of feeding animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In 2014, the risk of contaminated feed and feed ingredients was confirmed, when studies describing the ability of PEDV to survive for extended periods in feed (7&#x000a0;days in dry feed and 28&#x000a0;days in wet feed when stored at room temperature), and proof of concept that contaminated complete feed and feed ingredients could serve as vehicles for transmission to na&#x000ef;ve pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Shortly thereafter, the transmission of PEDV via ingestion of contaminated complete feed was validated, along with calculation of the minimum infectious dose of the virus in feed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This information heightened the awareness of the need for strategies to mitigate the risk of contaminated feed, through thermal processing or chemical treatment. In regards to the latter approach, data are now available demonstrating the ability of a liquid antimicrobial product containing formaldehyde and propionic acid or a medium chain fatty acid blend to successfully degrade PEDV RNA in contaminated feed and prevent infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Despite these advances at the domestic level, the risk of PEDV infection at the global level still exists, as the source of the initial PEDV introduction to the US remains unidentified. During the widespread epidemic, the role of feed in transboundary spread of the virus was downplayed, based on lack of data supporting survival of PEDV in feed ingredients over time and under conditions representative of trans-oceanic transport. Recently, extended survival of PEDV in individual feed ingredients under wintertime ambient conditions has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Most notably, survival of PEDV was demonstrated in soybean meal for 180&#x000a0;days, along with evidence of virus survival in lysine hydrochloride, choline chloride, DDGS and several porcine by-products for at least 30&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. One feature that was consistent across several of these ingredients was that they are imported to the US from China. As the original PEDV detected in the US is closely related to a Chinese variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], it raises the question whether contaminated feed ingredients imported from China could have served as a source for viral entry to the US in 2013. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> is a summary of data derived from the US International Trade Commission Harmonized Tariff Schedule website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hs.usitc.gov/">www.hs.usitc.gov</ext-link>) which is a publicly available database that provides a transaction of specific trade commodities between the US and its international trading partners. These data provide insight into the types of and quantities of ingredients that entered the US from China during the height of the PED epidemic in 2013 and 2014 (G. Patterson, personal communication, May 2015). This collective information justifies renewed investigation into the transboundary risk of PEDV and the potential role that contaminated feed ingredients could play in the spread of disease during the process of trans-oceanic shipping. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a model to evaluate the transboundary risk of PEDV-contaminated swine feed ingredients during a simulated shipment from China to the US, as well as test the effect of two mitigation strategies. The study was based on the hypothesis that while select non-treated ingredients could provide a protective effect on PEDV survival, mitigation would reduce risk.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of quantities (kg) of representative feed ingredients imported to the US from China in 2013 and 2014<sup>a</sup>

Here it was assumed that PEDV contamination of select ingredients would occur, either at the manufacturing plant or post-processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In an effort to determine if PEDV could be delivered in a viable state from Beijing to a major pork production region in the US, Des Moines, IA was selected as the final destination. Based on these assumptions, a commercial website (SeaRates.com) was used to develop a representative route and timetable. Specifically, it was modeled that contaminated ingredients would travel for 1&#x000a0;day from Beijing to the Anquing terminal in Shanghai, where they would be held for 7&#x000a0;days in preparation for shipment to the US. Cargo would then travel across the Pacific Ocean over a 17&#x000a0;day period and enter the US at the port of San Francisco. Following a 7&#x000a0;day period to clear customs, it would then be transported for 2&#x000a0;days via Interstate 80 to Des Moines, where it would remain for 3&#x000a0;days, for a total transit period of 37&#x000a0;days (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Description of locations and events involved in the 37-day shipping model period</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Day</th><th>Location</th><th>Events</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Beijing</td><td>Ingredient manufacturing &#x00026; contamination</td></tr><tr><td>2&#x02013;8</td><td>Anquing terminal, Shanghai</td><td>Transport to Shanghai, awaiting shipment to US</td></tr><tr><td>9&#x02013;25</td><td>Pacific ocean</td><td>Departure from China, crossing the ocean</td></tr><tr><td>26&#x02013;32</td><td>San Francisco terminal, CA, US</td><td>Entry to the US, clearing customs</td></tr><tr><td>33&#x02013;34</td><td>Interstate 80</td><td>Transport from California to Iowa</td></tr><tr><td>35&#x02013;37</td><td>Des Moines, IA</td><td>Storage</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

This decision was based on the timing of the initial detection of PEDV in the US (April 2013) and the availability of data summarizing temperature and % RH in shipping containers traveling from Asia to the US during the period of December 31, 2012 to January 16, 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Using this information, we designed a temperature and % RH curve for the oceanic segment of the study. In addition, we accessed historical meteorological data for the land segments of the model using Weather Underground (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wunderground.com/">www.wunderground.com</ext-link>) encompassing the periods of December 23&#x02013;30, 2012 and January 17&#x02013;27, 2013, which were paired in conjunction with the oceanic transport period. To simulate the effect of daily fluctuation we collected historical temperature data at 4 designated times each day (6&#x000a0;AM, 12&#x000a0;PM, 6&#x000a0;PM, 12&#x000a0;AM) and at 3 designated times each day for % RH (8&#x000a0;AM, 12&#x000a0;PM, 4&#x000a0;PM). All data were then entered into the computer of an environmental chamber used to house samples during the model shipping period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Processing of feed ingredients</title><p id="Par16">A panel of 14 swine feed ingredients known to be imported to the US from China were selected for this study, including organic &#x00026; conventional soybeans and soybean meal, lysine hydrochloride, D-L methionine, tryptophan, Vitamins A, D &#x00026; E, choline chloride, two ingredient carriers (rice hulls or corn cobs) and feed grade tetracycline. In regards to the soy-based products, the guaranteed analysis of conventional meal indicated a 48&#x000a0;% crude protein, 1&#x000a0;% fat and 3&#x000a0;% fiber while the organic product had lower protein (44&#x000a0;%) and higher fat and fiber (7.5 and 6.5&#x000a0;%, respectively). Furthermore, the process of manufacturing organic soybean meal was void of chemical (hexane) use and no chemical fertilizer had been used during the soybean growing period. Ingredients were screened by PCR to insure a PEDV-negative status prior to the onset of the study. The treatments selected for the study included a liquid antimicrobial (LA) (SalCURB&#x000ae;, Kemin Industries, Des Moines, IA USA) or a medium chain fatty acid blend (MCFA). SalCURB&#x000ae; is a premix of aqueous formaldehyde solution 37&#x000a0;% (for maintenance of complete animal feeds or feed ingredients <italic>Salmonella</italic>-negative for up to 21&#x000a0;days) and propionic acid (as a chemical preservative for control of mold in feed or feed ingredients). While SalCURB&#x000ae; provides effective <italic>Salmonella</italic> control for up to 21&#x000a0;days, it is not approved for use by the U.S. Food &#x00026; Drug Administration or the U.S. Department of Agriculture as a treatment for PEDV. The second treatment, MCFA, was a 2&#x000a0;% custom medium chain fatty acid blend of caproic, caprylic and capric acids, blended at a 1:1 ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Control ingredients were treated with sterile saline.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Sample management</title><p id="Par17">Samples were organized into 1 of 4 identical batches, each representing a specific segment of the 37-day shipping period. Batch 1 (segment 1) was designed to represent the transport of contaminated ingredients from manufacturing plants in Beijing to the Shanghai Anquing terminal (day 1 post-contamination (DPC)). Batch 2, a compilation of segments 1 and 2, simulated manufacturing and delivery to Shanghai, as well as time in the Anquing terminal awaiting shipment (1&#x02013;8 DPC). Batch 3, a compilation of segments 1, 2 and 3 represented time in China, the crossing of the Pacific and arrival to the US at the San Francisco, CA terminal (1&#x02013;27 DPC). Finally, batch 4 was a compilation of segments 1&#x02013;4, thereby representing the entire process, including transport to and storage in, Des Moines, IA (1&#x02013;37 DPC). On designated days post-contamination, a batch of samples was removed from the environmental chamber and submitted for testing. Specifically, batch 1 was submitted on 1 DPC, batch 2 on 8 DPC, batch 3 on 27 DPC and batch 4 on 37 DPC. In other words, the same sample was not repeatedly opened and tested, but rather a new batch of samples was submitted on a designated day. This method of sample management would insure that all sample containers remained sealed from the time they were inoculated until the time they were tested at the lab, minimizing the risk of cross-contamination, as well as enhancing repeatability of results as several segments were replicated across batches. Finally, to increase statistical power, each of the 4 batches contained 2 replicates of each ingredient in the control group and 2 replicates of each ingredient within each treatment group, for a total of 90 samples per batch.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Sample contamination procedures</title><p id="Par18">A goal of the study was to limit the variability to the level of the ingredient; therefore, the same quantity of ingredient, the same container type and the same environmental settings were used and samples were contaminated equally. To initiate this process, 30&#x000a0;g of each ingredient were added to food storage containers (Oxo Tot Baby Blocks, Oxo International, El Paso, TX, USA) to simulate a shipping container [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Ingredients in the non-treated control group were treated with 0.1&#x000a0;mL of sterile saline. Ingredients in the LA group were treated with 0.1&#x000a0;mL of product, based on an inclusion rate of 3&#x000a0;kg/ton of complete feed. Ingredients in the MCFA group were treated with 0.6&#x000a0;g of product based on a 2&#x000a0;% inclusion rate. Individual treatments and saline placebo were added to the designated samples using separate tuberculin syringes. To promote proper mixing, the feed was stirred manually for 10 clockwise rotations and 10 counter-clockwise rotations using individual wooden applicator sticks per ingredient. Following mixing, each individual container was manually shaken vigorously (50 times in a 10&#x000a0;s period). All samples were then inoculated with 2&#x000a0;mL PEDV (passage 18, Ct&#x02009;=&#x02009;17.15, total dose 491,520 FFU) and mixed as described. This quantity of PEDV was selected in an effort to provide a final mean Ct value in feed ingredient of approximately 25 (range&#x02009;=&#x02009;19&#x02013;30) following mixing, based on data from actual field cases of PEDV-contaminated feed, a challenge level used in published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Controls</title><p id="Par19">For the purpose of negative controls, 30&#x000a0;g samples of PEDV-negative complete feed were inoculated with sterile saline.

As of this writing, the route(s) of entry of these pathogens has not been identified; however, phylogenetic analyses support the possibility of a Chinese origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Since the initial detection of PEDV in the US, feed has been proposed as a possible route of entry and widespread, rapid distribution throughout the country; however, objective data supporting this hypothesis were lacking. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to develop a model to evaluate the transboundary risk of PEDV-contaminated swine feed ingredients and test the effect of two mitigation strategies during a simulated transport event from China to the US. This approach allowed us to design a study to successfully simulate the introduction of PEDV into the US in feed ingredients; the first such objective data of its kind.</p><p id="Par36">The central component of the study was the development of a model to accurately represent the conditions of a trans-oceanic shipping event to determine whether the virus could actually survive the process. Key components of the model were the selection of the proper ingredients, the calculation of an accurate timetable, and the simulation of representative environmental conditions to challenge virus viability. In regards to ingredient selection, we utilized the US Government Harmonized Tariff Schedule to include products regularly imported to the US from China, 5 of which ended up harboring viable PEDV throughout the 37-day period: vitamin D, lysine hydrochloride, choline chloride, organic and conventional soybean meal. It was interesting to note that viable virus was once again recovered from 3 ingredients, (conventional soybean meal, lysine and choline chloride). This was similar to our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], despite the fact that the 2 studies were conducted under very different environmental conditions and that laboratory personnel were blinded to sample identity/origin in both studies. This level of repeatability strengthens the conclusions drawn from both studies, thereby increasing the significance of these specific ingredients as potential transboundary risks.</p><p id="Par37">Besides the consistency of the results, these ingredients were interesting for several other reasons. In regards to soybean meal, it was surprising to learn of the large quantity of soy products imported to the US from China, as the US is a major producer/exporter of soybeans and soybean meal. Using Google to search for sources of both organic and conventional soy products from China, we identified multiple soybean and soybean meal manufacturers in the eastern region of the country supplying product for agricultural use in bags, totes, containers or bulk quantities, including products designated as &#x0201c;organic&#x0201d;, targeted specifically for organic livestock feeding. Therefore, these data, in combination with our previous work demonstrating extended PEDV survival in soybean meal in cold climates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] suggest that soy-based ingredients could be considered a significant transboundary risk for pathogen transmission, including the organic variety. Another ingredient which harbored viable virus throughout the 37-day transport period was lysine hydrochloride, a similar finding to that reported in the 30-day wintertime study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Lysine is an interesting ingredient as the volume imported to the US from China is large (particularly in 2013) which could enhance the significance of this ingredient as a potential risk factor for transboundary spread of PEDV. Finally, this study brought forth new information on the risk of PEDV survival in vitamins, specifically vitamin D. During the early stages of the PED epidemic in 2013, vitamins and trace minerals were proposed as a route of viral entry, based on the volume of product imported from China. While viable PEDV was not recovered from previously tested vitamin/trace mineral mixes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], it was speculated that this may have been due to the potentially caustic effect of the minerals on the virus. Therefore, we decided to investigate vitamins individually, and while vitamin A and E did not support virus, results were different with vitamin D. Finally, as in the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], choline chloride again proved capable of harboring viable PEDV over time, thereby raising its significance as a possible transboundary risk factor.</p><p id="Par38">Along with ingredient selection, the second key component of the model was the calculation of the shipping timetable in order to truly represent this journey. Using Searates.com, we developed an accurate estimate of time required to move from the various cities and ports within the model. It did not, however, include time in port for preparation for shipping or clearance of customs. Therefore, a 7-day period of time was added at the point of each port to better represent reality (T. Schmitt, APC Inc., personal communication, 2015), increasing the calculated timetable from 23 to 37&#x000a0;days. This modification further challenged the viability of the virus, thereby strengthening the model.</p><p id="Par39">Finally, perhaps the most novel component of the model was the development of the environmental curve which included actual temperature and % RH data from ocean containers travelling from Asia to the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This interesting project was carried out by the technical staff of the Xerox Company and involved the use of data loggers placed inside the actual containers, collecting real time temperature and % RH data as they traveled around the world. As one of the datasets involved a shipping event from Asia to the US in the months of December and January, we used this information as the centerpiece of our model and were able to reproduce the consistent trans-Pacific temperatures and % RH described in their publication along with the greater variability observed on land. Combining this with historical data from the various cities and ports using Weather Underground, we were able to develop a representative temperature and % RH curve, allowing us to program the environmental chamber accordingly (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). One interesting observation was the rapid reduction in stock virus titer observed from the initial titer used to inoculate batch 1 (mean titer&#x02009;=&#x02009;245,760 FFU) to that detected 8&#x000a0;days later in batch 2 (mean titer&#x02009;=&#x02009;30 FFU) with the eventual loss of viability (batch 3) in the stock virus control, despite storage in MEM, an ideal medium for virus storage. This observation indicates that the environmental conditions used in the study were rigorous, thereby challenging virus survival. This was most likely due to the warmer temperatures and high % RH present in the model, conditions quite unlike the winter time project where long-term PEDV stock virus survival was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. We insured that ingredients would be exposed to the effect of the % RH by adding the holes in the sides of each container model. It also suggests the need for a supportive matrix to maintain viability in the container during shipment and that under the correct conditions, PEDVis highly susceptible to environmental pressures if left unprotected in its respective shipping container. Finally, the fact that viable PEDV was recovered from only 5 of 14 ingredients suggests that individual ingredient chemistry may provide a protective effect, potentially shielding virus from the environment and allowing it to survive and this may be particularly true of the meal form of soy versus the intact bean. In contrast, the high alkalinity of feed grade tetracycline (pH&#x000a0;13) apparently degraded the RNA immediately post-contamination, resulting in PCR-negative readings in all 4 batches.</p><p id="Par40">In an effort to assess the potential for chemical mitigation of ingredient risk, two interventions, the liquid antimicrobial SalCURB&#x000ae; and the medium chain fatty acid blend were included in the design. While we had validated the LA in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], this was our first opportunity to assess the MCFA option. While the effect of the LA on PEDV RNA degradation over the course of the study was significantly different than the response to MCFA, both products appeared to have equivalent effect on virus viability. This outcome supports the validity of chemical mitigation as a means to reduce the risk of PEDV in feed ingredients stored under conditions modeling the trans-oceanic voyage, as well as provides options for treatment.</p><p id="Par41">In addition to an improved understanding of risks and mitigation, other strengths of the study included an experimental design where the only variables in the study were the individual ingredients, and the presence or absence of the treatment. Specifically, we inoculated equal amounts of each ingredient with an equivalent quantity of virus in an attempt to mimic published viral loads associated with field cases of PEDV in feed. All ingredients were stored in identical models of shipping containers, exposed to the same environment and tested in a single laboratory, involving consistent, trained personnel and validated assays for the detection of PEDV. We organized samples in a manner to prevent cross-contamination by insuring that the individual sample storage containers were never opened from the time of PEDV inoculation until testing occurred at the laboratory. While this may have resulted in some variability of the PCR assay since a new batch was submitted each time, the fact that our negative control samples remained free of contamination throughout the entire project validated these protocols. Finally, we used multiple metrics (PCR, VI and bioassay) to document viral load across a total of 360 samples, exceeding our previous work.</p><p id="Par42">However, as with all studies there were both strengths and limitations. For example, we were limited to 14 ingredients primarily due to cost; however, the decision to use similar ingredients across the 2 studies enhanced replication and confidence in the data. While we were limited in the number of replicates, each batch contained 2 replicates/ingredient/batch; resulting in 8 replicates per ingredient. Furthermore, these results were derived from gram quantities of feed and may not directly equate to the vast quantity of tonnage used in actual swine production or feed manufacturing facilities. The bioassay protocol, while helpful at identifying ingredients containing low levels of virus was costly and difficult to carry out. As we evaluated only one shipping route over a defined period of time under a specific set of environmental conditions, this does not allow for extrapolation of results across other climates, other routes or over longer periods of time. Finally, as this was an experiment and did not take place in China, we could not provide proof on how the contamination of ingredients could actually take place. However, from our experiences in the US, we could speculate that contamination of feed could take place through the inclusion of contaminated ingredients or through contact with the virus in the environment, either at the farm or at the mill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. As PEDV dispersion throughout the mill setting appears to be widespread, contact with ingredients within a milling storage facility seems logical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">In closing, under the conditions of this study, we provided the first proof of concept data indicating that a subset of contaminated feed ingredients could successfully transport live PEDV into the US using a novel transboundary shipping model. These are the first objective data suggesting that feed ingredients could potentially serve as vehicles for pathogen transfer between countries, as well as providing a plausible explanation regarding how PEDV was introduced to the US in 2013. This study also provides insight on how the onset of organic farming could serve to elevate risk of pathogen introduction into the US, secondary to the entry of organic soy products. This study also introduces a model which could enhance further transboundary research efforts, possibly employing surrogate viruses (bovine viral diarrhea virus for swine fever virus or Seneca Valley virus for foot-and-mouth disease virus) to test feed-related risks for other foreign animal diseases, further the investigation of the risk of organic ingredients, along with the continuing validation of mitigation strategies. With this information, it is hoped that veterinarians, feed industry experts and government officials will work together to develop a comprehensive plan of ingredient management to reduce global risk. It is time for discussions on how to adequately treat feed, how to increase biosecurity at the port level, as well as where to purchase biosecure ingredients, with the end result being a lowered incidence of feed-related disease transmission around the world.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par44">These results indicate the ability of PEDV to survive in specific feed ingredients under modeled conditions simulating shipment from China to the US.
