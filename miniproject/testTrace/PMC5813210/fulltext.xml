Here we report the development and characterization of a recombinant chimeric ZIKV vaccine candidate (termed ChinZIKV) that expresses the prM-E proteins of ZIKV using the licensed Japanese encephalitis live-attenuated vaccine SA14-14-2 as the genetic backbone. ChinZIKV retains its replication activity and genetic stability in vitro, while exhibiting an attenuation phenotype in multiple animal models. Remarkably, immunization of mice and rhesus macaques with a single dose of ChinZIKV elicits robust and long-lasting immune responses, and confers complete protection against ZIKV challenge. Significantly, female mice immunized with ChinZIKV are protected against placental and fetal damage upon ZIKV challenge during pregnancy. Overall, our study provides an alternative vaccine platform in response to the ZIKV emergency, and the safety, immunogenicity, and protection profiles of ChinZIKV warrant further clinical development.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Given the recent Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic, development of an effective vaccine is of high importance.

Since 2007, ZIKV has caused epidemics in Polynesia, in the South Pacific, and most recently in the United States. Increasing evidence supports a casual association between ZIKV infection, microcephaly, and other congenital malformations in infants, as well as Guillain&#x02013;Barr&#x000e9; syndrome in adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In addition, unlike most other flavivirus members, ZIKV has the potential for significant human-to-human transmission through sexual and vertical routes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. These unexpected and unique properties underscore the urgent requirement for the development of a safe and effective ZIKV vaccine. The existence of a number of successful flavivirus vaccines and multiple vaccine development platforms, has facilitated remarkable progress in the field of ZIKV vaccine development. Recently, a range of non-replicating ZIKV vaccine candidates including; DNA vaccines expressing the viral prM-E genes, purified inactivated vaccines, and messenger RNA vaccines have been developed and evaluated in animals with promising results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and some have now entered clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The immune mechanisms that mediate protection against ZIKV infection are not fully understood. In comparison with non-replicating vaccines, live-attenuated vaccines are designed to mimic the natural life cycle of the wild-type virus and are capable of inducing long-lasting immune responses with low production cost. These characteristics make live-attenuated vaccines the most effective countermeasure against many viral diseases, as exemplified by the two flavivirus vaccines, YFV vaccine strain 17D (YFV 17D), and JE vaccine virus SA14-14-2 (JEV SA14-14-2). Both vaccines are recognized for their excellent safety and efficacy profiles in humans. Neutralizing antibodies targeting flavivirus structural proteins prevent or reduce viral replication, leading to the clearance of extracellular viruses and commonly correlate with protection from disease. For example, neutralizing antibody titers (&#x0003e;&#x02009;10), which correlate with protective efficacy, have been reported for flavivirus vaccines including YFV, JEV, and TBEV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells limit the spread of viruses by either recognizing and killing infected cells or secreting specific antiviral cytokines, whereas CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells contribute to protection through cytokine production and support the generation and maintenance of antibody and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses. Multiple studies have suggested that the T-cell response is a critical contributor to protective immunity in flavivirus infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Recently, two live-attenuated ZIKV vaccine candidates have been generated by reverse genetics and shown capable of inducing sterilizing immunity in animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Flaviviruses have an 11&#x02009;kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome that contains a single open reading frame (ORF) flanked by two untranslated regions (5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-UTRs). The ORF encodes a single polyprotein, which is proteolytically processed into three structural proteins (C, prM, and E) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). One platform for the development of flavivirus vaccine candidates has been the creation of a recombinant chimeric flavivirus in which the prM and E genes of a live-attenuated flavivirus vaccine strain are substituted with the corresponding genes of a heterologous flavivirus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Recombinant live-attenuated chimeric DENV (CYD-TDV) and JEV vaccines, using YFV 17D as a backbone, have been well characterized in terms of immunogenicity and safety, and are now commercially available in several countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

The phenotypic and genotypic characteristics that correlate with attenuation are highly stable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

As expected, the resulting chimeric ChinZIKV showed a significantly attenuated phenotype in multiple animal models. ChinZIKV is highly attenuated in mouse neurovirulence, even more strongly than the two commercial flavivirus live-attenuated vaccine strains JEV SA14-14-2 and YFV 17D (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Recently, we have identified the major mouse neurovirulence determinant in the prM protein, which is closely linked to neurotropism and severe microcephaly in the fetus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. However, the chimeric ChinZIKV did not contain this virulence determinant, which further supports its safety profile. Significantly, immunocompetent mice and non-human primates inoculated s.c. with ChinZIKV did not exhibit detectable viremia (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

We speculate that this difference to YFV-based chimeric vaccines may be attributed to the intrinsic characteristics of the JEV SA14-14-2 genetic backbone.

In our study, a single dose of ChinZIKV can induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV and provide a complete prevention of vertical transmission to the fetus during pregnancy, even as late as day 210 post immunization.

Our study showed that ChinZIKV inoculation was able to elicit obvious secretion of IFN-&#x003b3; from PMBCs isolated from monkeys upon stimulation with the ZIKV E protein. Both ChinZIKV and ZIKV infections also resulted in similar patterns of cytokine induction, with a slight weaker induction for ChinZIKV. Notably, the increased secretion of the chemokines MCP-1, involved in monocyte infiltration and IP-10, involved in the recruitment of activated effector T cells were observed in both groups. Notably, increased levels of IP-10 and MCP-1 have been found in ZIKV-infected monkeys and pregnant women with neonatal microcephaly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>.

Interestingly, following ZIKV challenge, the levels of IFN-&#x003b3;, MIF, and MCP-1 were significantly lower in the ChinZIKV-immunized animals than that in the PBS control group. MIF has a broad range of immune and pro-inflammatory activities, and has been reported to be correlated with the severity of dengue disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>.

Reduction in the levels of these disease related cytokines indicates that immunization with the chimera confers a strong protective immune response against ZIKV infection in monkeys. On the other hand, the induction of a number of cytokines, including IL-2, IL-Ra, RANTES (CCL-5), and eotaxin diverged markedly between the ChinZIKV-immunized and PBS-inoculated animals after ZIKV challenge.

In particular, recent reports that DENV antibodies can either neutralize or enhance ZIKV infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> have brought additional levels of complexity to efforts to develop a safe and effective ZIKV vaccine.
