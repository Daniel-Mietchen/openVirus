source of HIV infection. Epidemiological investigation was carried out among HIV-infected individuals. Blood transfusion recipients infected with HIV were tracked for the date of transfusion, reason for transfusion, hospital where transfusion was received, source of blood, components of transfusion, number of transfusions, and transfusion volume. A total of 285 blood transfusion recipients infected with HIV-1 were detected in Hebei over the study period, with 42.81% (122/285) detected through clinical diagnostic testing. These cases showed a concentrated distribution in southern Hebei, with local outbreak characteristics. A census of the population in Shahe County, which had a high concentration of cases, revealed that recipients of blood transfusions had an HIV infection rate of 15.54% (92/592). Post-transfusion infection frequently occurred among blood transfusion recipients at township medical institutions, with a peak in 1995. Owing to late detection of HIV infection among blood transfusion recipients, the rates of spousal transmission and mother-to-child transmission reached 20.87% and 28.05%, respectively. Around 1995, community medical institutions did not screen for HIV antibodies among paid blood donors, which was an important cause of the outbreak of HIV-1 infection among blood transfusion recipients. Our findings indicate that cases of blood transfusion-related infection decreased rapidly with gradual improvement in the HIV screening system for blood donors that began in 1995, particularly after full implementation of HIV nucleic acid testing of volunteer blood donors was begun in 2015.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>natural science fund of Hebei province</institution></funding-source><award-id>H2016303006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4613-2028</contrib-id><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Xinli</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the natural science fund of Hebei province (H2016303006).

It borders Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Henan, and Shandong provinces and has a population of 74.24 million. The first patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Hebei was found in 1989 [<xref rid="pone.0202265.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and a total of 8233 cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS had been reported in the province as of 2015. Around the year 1995, a local epidemic of HIV infection occurred among paid blood donors on the Central Plain of China [<xref rid="pone.0202265.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Before the Blood Donation Law of China was put into effect in 1998, blood management was disordered and community medical institutions did not properly implement HIV screening systems among blood donors. Therefore, this situation caused a risk of HIV infection for recipients of blood transfusions [<xref rid="pone.0202265.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Over the years, Hebei Province has been carrying out surveillance and research on HIV infection among blood transfusion recipients, and a considerable amount of epidemiological testing data have been accumulated. We analyzed data of blood transfusion recipients infected with HIV based on transfusion history and an investigation of blood management in Hebei, to trace possible sources of infection. The results of our analysis are reported below.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all participants enrolled in this study. This study was approved by the local Ethics Committee at Hebei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Case definition and surveillance</title><p>HIV antibody-positive individuals were defined as blood transfusion cases infected with HIV if they met the following criteria: 1) history of having received blood and blood products; 2) no factors related to sexual activity, intravenous drug use, and intrafamilial transmission; and 3) current residence within the territory of Hebei Province. The basic information of all cases was derived from the database of the National Information System for Comprehensive HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control in China. Hebei Province has 600 HIV testing laboratories, 2271 rapid testing points, 521 voluntary counseling and testing points, and 12 western blot laboratories at various levels of medical and health care institutions and blood centers in the province. An expanded free testing policy has been advocated in Hebei, and epidemiological investigation has been carried out among HIV-infected individuals. Collected information is entered into the national database and HIV-infected cases are regularly followed up. Blood transfusion recipients infected with HIV are tracked for the date of transfusion, reason for transfusion, hospital where transfusion was received, source of blood, components of transfusion, number of transfusions, and transfusion volume.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Outbreak investigation</title><p>A number of blood transfusion recipients were infected with HIV in Shahe County over the period 1999&#x02013;2002. To determine the HIV infection rate among local recipients of blood transfusions, a local population census was conducted from November 2003 to February 2005. All individuals who had a history of transfusion between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 1998 were included in the epidemiological case investigation, and blood specimens were collected for HIV antibody screening.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Investigation of intrafamilial transmission</title><p>For blood transfusion recipients infected with HIV who had a spouse, those who were pregnant, had given birth, or who were breastfeeding after blood transfusion, infection factors other than spousal transmission and mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) were excluded for the spouses and children.

The latency period was considered to be the time between the date of transfusion and date of onset; the survival period was the time between the date of onset and date of death owing to AIDS. The earliest detection date of CD4 &#x0003c;200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> was defined as the date of onset according to the Diagnostic Criteria for HIV/AIDS (WS 293&#x02013;2008) [<xref rid="pone.0202265.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The incidence rate was calculated as the number of patients divided by the number of person-years of observation; the mortality rate was calculated as the number of deaths owing to HIV/AIDS divided by the number of person-years of disease during the observation period. Observation ended on December 31, 2010.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>HIV antibody testing and subtyping</title><p>Primary screening was conducted using ELISA reagents for the detection of antibodies to HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV type 2 (HIV-2). Blood specimens from HIV-positive individuals were subjected to a confirmatory test by western blot assay (HIV Blot 2.2; MP Biomedicals Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd, Singapore), and positive specimens were considered to be HIV-positive cases. In this study, a total of 37 HIV-1 <italic>pol</italic> gene sequences were obtained from 285 blood specimens with paid blood and post-transfusion HIV infection. These blood specimens with <italic>pol</italic> sequences were collected between 1995 and 2013, and included paid blood donors from Langfang and blood recipients from Xingtai. No spouse- or vertical-paired specimens were obtained owing to death of the mother (or her child) or spouse. We attempted to amplify and sequence HIV-1 <italic>pol</italic> (HXB2: 2147&#x02013;3462) gene sequences in the reverse transcriptase gene coding region from as many samples as possible. However, sequences were not obtained from all the samples owing to limited blood plasma volume, poor quality of the samples, and limited long-term storage conditions. Maximum likelihood (ML) tree analysis was performed using MEGA 6.0 with 1,000 replicates [<xref rid="pone.0202265.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and HIV genotyping was performed.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The data under investigation were entered into a database and frequency analysis was conducted using SPSS Version 11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

transfusion and only 7 were screened as negative for HIV antibodies. Prior to 1998, different levels of medical institutions in Shahe County were required to obtain blood from the blood center of Xingtai City. However, most medical facilities did not implement this system, and the collection and supply of blood in some of these institutions was common owing to the poor management system. It was known that there was an overuse of blood transfusion at certain community medical institutions in Shahe. The main source of blood was from a mobile team of paid blood donors that could be booked by telephone if needed. There was no screening for HIV antibodies before blood donation. Blood donors on this team came from other regions such as Yunnan, Guangxi, Sichuan, Henan, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and Jilin provinces. Donors had worked in local mines for many years and would donate blood when needed by a hospital. Among local residents of Shahe, a small number of blood donors also participated in paid blood donation.</p><p>During a census of local blood recipients in Shahe (November 2003 to February 2005), 37 local residents were found to have been blood donors between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 1998. Blood specimens were collected from these individuals and all 37 cases tested negative for HIV antibodies. Owing to a lack of blood donor registration information at local medical institutions, it was difficult to track and investigate the infection status of migrant workers in mining enterprises who came from other provinces, particularly those from the southern provinces of China where there was higher prevalence of HIV infection owing to injection drug use; Henan was another area affected by HIV infection among paid blood donors. In this case, we could not rule out the possibility that HIV-infected individuals participated in local paid blood donation in Shahe.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 strains</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202265.g005">Fig 5</xref>, all prevalent HIV-1 strains among blood transfusion recipients were identified as HIV-1 subtype B&#x02032;. In the ML tree, two clusters (Sex_Cluster and Blood_Cluster) were indicated. Within the Blood_Cluster, our sequences closely clustered together with the reference sequences from patients infected with HIV-1 via contaminated blood from Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, and so on; our sequences were far away from those patients (such as 2006019s) infected with HIV-1 through sexual contact within Sex_Cluster. The mean genetic distance within Blood_Cluster was 0.031&#x000b1;0.003, less than twice that (0.067&#x000b1;0.003) between the sexual transmission sequences, such as 2006019s, within Sex_Cluster and blood transmission sequences within Blood_Cluster. Moreover, the study sequences were also clustered with strains from Yunnan, such as from Ruili city and Dehong Prefecture. In particular, the root of the ML tree was the sequence from Dehong Prefecture in Yunnan. This indicated that blood transfusion cases were in fact related to the contaminated blood obtained from paid blood donors, and suggested that HIV-1 subtype B&#x02032; strain from Yunnan might have been introduced into Hebei through paid blood donors.</p><fig id="pone.0202265.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0202265.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>The connection between donors and recipients.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0202265.g005"/></fig><p>The international reference subtype B&#x02032; (&#x025cf;) was obtained from the HIV database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/index">http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/index</ext-link>).

Subsequently, the transmission of HIV/AIDS among this population was successively found in the Sichuan, Guangxi, and Xinjiang regions. Around 1995, migrant workers from Yunnan, Guangxi, Sichuan, Henan, and other provinces who worked in local mining enterprises of Shahe served as blood donors at county and township medical institutions. Poor local management of blood collection and supply, as well as no screening for HIV antibodies before blood donation, were the causes leading to an HIV/AIDS epidemic among local blood transfusion recipients in Shahe. In 1995, there was an outbreak of HIV infection among paid blood donors in the Gu&#x02019;an and Yongqing regions of Langfang City. The area affected by HIV infection among blood donors in Langfang was about 400 km from Shahe. There were no indications that blood donors from Langfang had donated blood in Shahe city in Hebei. Nonetheless, given its close proximity, we could not rule out this possibility as a source of infection.</p><p>Molecular biological analysis showed that the prevalent HIV-1 strain was the B&#x02032; subtype in blood recipients from Shahe, similar to the B subtype found among injection drug users from Yunnan. The prevalent HIV-1 strain found among drug users from Yunnan belonged to the Thailand subtype B strain [<xref rid="pone.0202265.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This suggests that the prevalent viral strains detected in blood recipients from Shahe originated from the Thailand subtype B in Yunnan. Our result is in agreement with previous findings by Yan et al. that the prevalent HIV-1 strain among blood recipients and donors from Guangdong Province was dominated by Thailand subtype B [<xref rid="pone.0202265.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; this is in line with the prevalent HIV-1 subtype among paid blood donors in Hebei Province[<xref rid="pone.0202265.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>In 1985, an epidemic of hepatitis C occurred among paid blood donors in China [<xref rid="pone.0202265.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; during 1993&#x02013;1994, an epidemic of malaria emerged in this population [<xref rid="pone.0202265.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; and in 1995, an outbreak of HIV infection developed in the same group [<xref rid="pone.0202265.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. All these events were caused by cross-infection during plasmapheresis, a form of blood donation. HIV infection among paid blood donors was the direct cause of HIV infection among blood recipients. The blood HIV screening policy already specified that blood and blood products must be tested for HIV/AIDS in the &#x0201c;Provisions for the Monitoring and Control of HIV/AIDS&#x0201d;, approved by the State Council of China on December 26, 1987. In April 1988, the Ministry of Health promulgated the &#x0201c;Notice on Rectifying the Production Management of Blood Products&#x0201d;, which required the surveillance of blood product sources and testing of blood donors for HIV antibodies. On April 11, 1990, the Ministry of Health and the National Price Bureau issued the &#x0201c;Provisions for Strengthening the Work of Blood Transfusion&#x0201d;, which proposed unified blood source management as well as unified blood collection and supply, as well as only one blood station in each region (city), to improve the management of blood transfusion processes. In 1993, the Ministry of Health proposed the &#x0201c;Basic Standards for Blood Stations&#x0201d;, which required blood stations to perform second tests of all items, including testing of collected whole blood for HIV indicators. Since 1995, the Ministry of Health has required anti-HIV screening of all blood donors at blood stations. Our study results showed that the occurrence of blood transfusion recipients being infected with HIV-1 was associated with improper implementation of HIV screening policies and poor management of blood sources in local areas, particularly at community medical institutions. In 1998, the &#x0201c;Blood Donation Law&#x0201d; came into effect in China. A voluntary blood donation system was then put into practice and an HIV antibody screening system was widely implemented, resulting in a rapid decrease in transfusion-transmitted cases. In 2015, an HIV nucleic acid testing system was fully implemented and the risk of HIV infection through blood transfusion was thus further reduced.</p><p>Around 1995, government investment in medical institutions was inadequate and these facilities had to expand their medical income and reduce costs so as to maintain normal operation. Therefore, medical institutions commonly collected blood for use in patients admitted to their own facilities. Meanwhile, the scope of blood transfusion was also expanded. Particularly for pregnant women and during childbirth, community medical institutions generally used blood transfusion to treat postpartum hemorrhage, leading to a large number maternal HIV infections. Most of these medical institutions were located in rural areas and mainly served farmers, who were unaware that these facilities had violated the blood screening policies for transfusion recipients. Local governments ignored the situation and did not organize a census or blood screening until the appearance of HIV/AIDS in the region. From the perspective of the detection date of blood transfusion cases, there was a 9-year gap between the first detection date of HIV infection and the peak date of blood transfusion-related HIV/AIDS infections. This suggests that cases were detected relatively late, resulting in high rates of spousal transmission and MTCT. By contrast, HIV infections among paid blood donors were detected earlier in Hebei, which resulted in relatively low rates of spousal transmission and MTCT in that population [<xref rid="pone.0202265.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. At that point, hospital closings or a lack of adequate records management caused difficulties in tracking the sources of infection and investigation of the relevant evidence.</p><p>With regard to suspected blood transfusion infection date, only a few transfusion-related cases were detected from 1990 to 1994. Nevertheless, as inferred from the HIV infection dates of blood recipients in Shahe County, Xingtai City, HIV infections among paid blood donors in that city occurred earlier than among paid blood donors in Langfang [<xref rid="pone.0202265.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which further supports the possibility of transmission from migrant mining workers in Shahe who came from the southwest areas of China. According to the time distribution of the 285 blood transfusion-related HIV/AIDS cases in Hebei Province and time analysis of the cases at the outbreak site in Shahe, 1995 was the peak year of blood transfusion infections, and blood transfusion recipients had the highest HIV infection rates in that year. The second highest number of blood transfusion cases was recorded in 1996 and 1997, when HIV infection rates among blood transfusion recipients were second only to 1995.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the staff of local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Xingtai for their assistance, especially with the fieldwork.
