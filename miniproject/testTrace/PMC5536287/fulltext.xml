Testing is usually performed in clinical pathology laboratories on automated analysers. To investigate the cause of false positive results on 4<sup>th</sup> generation HIV testing platforms in public sector laboratories, the performance of two automated platforms was compared in a clinical pathology setting, firstly on routine diagnostic specimens and secondly on known sero-negative samples.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>Firstly, 1181 routine diagnostic specimens were sequentially tested on Siemens and Roche automated 4<sup>th</sup> generation platforms. HIV viral load, western blot and follow up testing were used to determine the true status of inconclusive specimens. Subsequently, known HIV seronegative samples from a single donor were repeatedly tested on both platforms and an analyser was tested for surface contamination with HIV positive serum to identify how suspected specimen contamination could be occurring.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Serial testing of diagnostic specimens yielded 163 weakly positive or discordant results. Only 3 of 163 were conclusively shown to indicate true HIV infection. Specimen contamination with HIV antibody was suspected, based on the following evidence: the proportion of positive specimens increased on repeated passage through the analysers; viral loads were low or undetectable and western blots negative or indeterminate on problem specimens; screen negative, 2<sup>nd</sup> test positive specimens tested positive when reanalysed on the screening assay; follow up specimens (where available) were negative. Similarly, an increasing number of known negative specimens became (repeatedly) sero-positive on serial passage through one of the analysers. Internal and external analyser surfaces were contaminated with HIV serum, evidence that sample splashes occur during testing.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Due to the extreme sensitivity of these assays, contamination with minute amounts of HIV antibody can cause a negative sample to test positive. Better contamination control measures are needed on analysers used in clinical pathology environments, especially in regions where HIV sero-prevalence is high.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Quality Assurance division, National Health Laboratory Service</institution></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>The cost of reagents was covered by the Quality Assurance Division of the National Health Laboratory Service.

In the public sector, HIV testing is usually performed in clinics using rapid test devices. However, ensuring a uniform quality of testing at point of care can be difficult [<xref rid="pone.0182167.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0182167.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In hospitalised patients, blood is sent to a laboratory for testing. Laboratory screening involves the use of 4<sup>th</sup> generation antibody/p24 antigen combo immunoassays. Initially reactive specimens are tested with a second 4<sup>th</sup> generation immunoassay. Patients who are reactive in both are considered HIV-infected, in line with World Health Organisation recommendations [<xref rid="pone.0182167.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Public health laboratories routinely request a second specimen in newly diagnosed patients, but frequently clinicians fail to send follow up samples.</p><p>4<sup>th</sup> generation HIV immunoassays have superior sensitivity and specificity to 3<sup>rd</sup> generation rapid tests currently in use in clinics in South Africa [<xref rid="pone.0182167.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. They are designed to detect infection as early as possible after infection and specimens containing minute amounts of HIV antibody can test positive. In the interest of logistic efficiency, serology is commonly performed on automated chemistry analysers in consolidated clinical pathology laboratories. In this setting, weakly positive HIV serology is commonly encountered. Use of confirmatory assays seldom resolves the problem and the HIV diagnosis remains uncertain, requiring follow up serology and molecular testing to resolve. Factors responsible for false reactivity in HIV immunoassays include: presence of cross-reacting antibody [<xref rid="pone.0182167.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], inadequate centrifugation, haemolysis or lipaemia in the specimen. Inadvertent contamination of negative specimens with HIV positive serum during the analytical process may also be responsible.</p><p>Following the recognition of an unacceptably high rate of false positive results on several 4<sup>th</sup> generation HIV testing platforms, a field study was done to compare the performance of two platforms and identify the cause of false positive results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Design</title><p>Ethics approval for this study was obtained from the University of Cape Town Research Ethics Committee (reference number 632/2016).</p><p>This was a prospective study to evaluate the performance of two automated serology platforms through co-testing of routine specimens in three different laboratories. Routine diagnostic specimens from two medium sized public sector laboratories (KD and JE) were tested on the ADVIA Centaur 4<sup>th</sup> generation HIV Ag/Ab combo assay (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Deerfield, USA) over a 6 week period (April to May 2016). Irrespective of the result, specimens were referred to laboratory (UN) for blind repeat testing on the COBAS HIV Ag/Ab combo assay (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany). (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182167.g001">Fig 1</xref>) In all three laboratories, analysers were located in clinical pathology environments and used to perform routine chemistry as well as viral serology.

Possible explanations could be: low sensitivity of the Siemens assay, greater non-specificity of the Roche assay, or more contamination because specimens were tested on the Roche analyser second. To investigate this, 26 S-/R+ specimens with sufficient volume were retested on the Siemens analyser at JE laboratory. On retesting, the S/CO increased in 25 of 26 specimens. Eleven specimens which had been negative became positive. Positive values ranged from 1.0 to &#x0003e;12 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0182167.t001">Table 1S</xref>). The only explanation for this is that samples had become contaminated with HIV antibody during the testing process.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Follow up records</title><p>Follow up results were available on 38 patients with inconclusive serology (32 HIV serology and 6 viral loads). In all instances follow up results confirmed the status we attributed to the study sample: 30 were HIV antibody negative and 2 strongly positive. The latter two were from patients JE562 and KD136, (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0182167.t001">Table 1</xref>). Five viral load follow up samples were lower than detectable limits (LDL) and one (KD902 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0182167.t001">Table 1</xref>).) 5558 copies/ml. Taking the laboratory investigations and available follow up HIV testing into consideration, only 3 inconclusive sample were considered true positive and 47 were confirmed to be false positive (negative western blot and HIV viral load or negative follow up serology). It was not possible to confirm conclusively the status of the rest, due to the lack of follow up samples.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Testing of known negative samples on both platforms</title><p>To provide more convincing evidence that sample contamination was responsible for the discordant results, specimens from the same HIV antibody, NAT negative donor were tested on the Roche and Siemens analysers. All 105 samples tested on the Roche analyser at UN were negative on first and second passage through the analyser. However, on the Siemens analyser at JE laboratory, 2 of 105 samples were positive on first passage through the analyser and 6 on second testing. Six of the 8 false positives remained positive on testing for a third time. (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0182167.t002">Table 2</xref>) Three of the 8 false positives occurred on the same day, suggesting a possible contaminating event could have occurred on that day. Of concern, one sample was repeatedly positive with a S/CO value &#x0003e;12. Thus the assay specificity dropped from 98.1% to 94.3% between first and second testing.

Both the ADVIA Centaur and the Roche 4<sup>th</sup> generation HIV Combo assays are sensitive and specific and have excellent reliability in low prevalence settings [<xref rid="pone.0182167.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0182167.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0182167.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0182167.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] where the priority is to detect HIV infection as early as possible. Assays are thus designed to detect minute amounts of HIV antigen or antibody, and nucleic acid testing is performed if serology is inconclusive [<xref rid="pone.0182167.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In resource limited settings, reactivity in 2 HIV immunoassays (and in a follow up sample, if tested in a laboratory) is used to confirm infection [<xref rid="pone.0182167.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Assay performance in routine clinical pathology settings has not been extensively tested in regions of high HIV sero-prevalence. This study was initiated to investigate a problem of non-specificity encountered in clinical pathology laboratories in South Africa. Weakly positive 4th generation HIV results were common and most were probably false positive: HIV RNA was rarely present at levels compatible with primary infection and follow up samples (available on 38 patients) were either antibody or viral load negative. In all, based on information available to us, 47 samples were conclusively shown to be false positive. Only 3 patients were shown conclusively to be HIV infected. These were probably early infections as viral loads were high, serology was weak on both platforms, western blots were positive or indeterminate and HIV serology on follow up was strongly positive. It is possible that there were additional true HIV infections amongst the inconclusive samples: virus replication is responsible for boosting antibody and levels can decline in elite controllers and patients on prolonged ART. [<xref rid="pone.0182167.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0182167.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>],[<xref rid="pone.0182167.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Such patients might have undetectable viral loads and low HIV antibody. However, this is rare and unlikely to account for the large number of weakly positive results we encountered.</p><p>The most common problem results were negative on the screening assay, but weakly positive on the second test. The most likely explanation is that samples were contaminated with HIV positive serum during the analytical process. Lines of evidence that support this interpretation include: 1) when Siemens negative/Roche positive samples were retested on the Siemens platform, the S/CO values increased, and up to half became positive. 2) Western blots of many HIV RNA negative samples showed evidence of low levels of HIV antibody (weak reactivity with one or more HIV bands). 3) Follow up samples on 35 patients were HIV antibody or RNA negative. 4) Eight known HIV negative specimens became HIV sero-positive on passage through the Siemens analyser at JE laboratory and six remained positive on repeated testing.</p><p>In a separate experiment to test the sensitivity of the Roche assay, a strongly positive sample was serially diluted. At a dilution of 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>, the sample still tested positive with a S/CO of 6, proving that contamination with minute amounts HIV antibody can cause positivity. Bearing in mind that 20&#x02013;30% of hospital/clinic-attending patients in South Africa are HIV positive, it is easy to envisage contamination occasionally happening during analysis. To test this, known negative samples from the same donor were repeatedly tested on both Siemens and Roche platforms. While no positives were detected in this experiment on the Roche analyser, an increasing number of positive events was observed during first and second passage on the Siemens analyser in JE laboratory. Of concern, one sample was repeatedly positive with a value of &#x0003e;12.</p><p>Sample contamination is a stochastic event and probably happens due to aerosols accidentally generated during the testing process. Evidence that sample splashes do indeed occur during the testing process came from swabbing experiments: 10 of 25 swabs from the surface and insides of a COBAS analyser in use in a clinical pathology laboratory tested positive for HIV antibody, with S/CO values ranging from 1.18 to 136.8. High risk areas were the sample loading bay, the chemistry module, and the internal sample transport system. Shortcuts with maintenance and prior passage of specimens through the chemistry module could exacerbate this. Serology modules use a separate tip for each sample, but the same probe enters each sample on most chemistry analysers.</p><p>Contamination may not only occur on the analyser, other pre and post analytic activities that could generate aerosols and cause contamination to surrounding samples include: de-capping the tubes, manual pipetting, agitation as samples are moved around the laboratory. The apparently poorer performance of the Roche analyser in the first experiment could have been due to the fact that the specimens were tested on this platform second. Some of the S-/R+ specimens may already have been contaminated prior to loading. No contaminating events were detected during the second experiment on the analyser at UN laboratory.</p><p>Sample contamination with HIV antibody was not the only cause of false positive results. Seven samples were first test positive on the Siemens, but negative on the Roche second test, HIV RNA and western blot. Also, not all S-/R+ specimens were Siemens positive on re-test (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0182167.t001">Table 1S</xref>). In a review on the causes of false positive HIV serology, Klarkowski et al [<xref rid="pone.0182167.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] identified polyclonal B cell activation as the commonest cause of biological false positive results. Low avidity polyclonal antibody can cross react with antigens in one assay, but not in another and this is the basis for the use of an alternative HIV immunoassay to confirm a screening positive result [<xref rid="pone.0182167.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>This study highlights problems that can occur when HIV serology is performed in clinical pathology laboratories on general chemistry analysers, especially when they are used in a setting of high HIV prevalence. Contamination can easily occur and results must be carefully scrutinised before release. Contamination control measures need to be improved and workflow modified to ensure integrity of the specimen. To limit this problem, instrument cut offs should be adjusted based on local gray zone data, HIV serology testing should be prioritised on samples where chemistry tests are also needed. Ideally an HIV diagnosis should not be based on serology alone, but, in cases of doubt, confirmed with viral load and follow up testing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0182167.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Siemens screen and retest levels compared on a subset of 26 Siemens negative/Roche positive (S-/R+) samples.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0182167.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the NHLS laboratories and staff that performed the testing of study samples; Mr R Cable of Western Province Blood Transfusion Service for donation of HIV negative unit of whole blood and Dr Colleen Bamford for critical appraisal of the manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0182167.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Simbayi, L.
