It is endemic in a number of sub-Saharan African countries with infection rate of &#x0003e;50%. The high prevalence of HIV-1 coupled with late presentation of advanced cancer staging make KS the leading cancer in the region with poor prognosis and high mortality. Disease markers and cellular functions associated with KS tumorigenesis remain ill-defined. Several studies have attempted to investigate changes of the gene profile with in vitro infection of monoculture models, which are not likely to reflect the cellular complexity of the in vivo lesion environment. Our approach is to characterize and compare the gene expression profile in KS lesions versus non-cancer tissues from the same individual. Such comparisons could identify pathways critical for KS formation and maintenance. This is the first study that utilized high throughput RNA-seq to characterize the viral and cellular transcriptome in tumor and non-cancer biopsies of African epidemic KS patients. These patients were treated anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable HIV-1 plasma viral load. We found remarkable variability in the viral transcriptome among these patients, with viral latency and immune modulation genes most abundantly expressed. The presence of KSHV also significantly affected the cellular transcriptome profile. Specifically, genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism disorder pathways were substantially affected. Moreover, infiltration of immune cells into the tumor did not prevent KS formation, suggesting some functional deficits of these cells. Lastly, we found only minimal overlaps between our in vivo cellular transcriptome dataset with those from in vitro studies, reflecting the limitation of in vitro models in representing tumor lesions. These findings could lead to the identification of diagnostic and therapeutic markers for KS, and will provide bases for further mechanistic studies on the functions of both viral and cellular genes that are involved.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Kaposi&#x02019;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and cause Kaposi&#x02019;s sarcoma (KS). KS is one of the most common cancer among HIV-1 patients in this region. Despite anti-retroviral treatment, prognosis for KS is poor with high mortality often due to presentation of late cancer stage. In order to identify biomarkers or therapeutic targets against KS, a better understanding of the viral and cellular genes expression/transcriptome in the tumor will be necessary. We used RNA-seq, a highly efficient method to sequence transcriptome, to characterize and compare the viral and cellular transcriptome in tumor and non-cancer tissues from KS patients. We found that viral genes involved in latency and immune modulation are most commonly expressed among KS patients. Additionally, cellular genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism disorder pathways are significantly affected by the presence of KSHV. Despite the detection of immune cells in the tumor, it did not prevent the tumor progression, suggesting some level of immune cell dysfunctions in KS patients. Lastly, we found limited overlap of our data, derived from actual KS biopsy, with other cell culture models, suggesting that the complexity of tumor is difficult to be reflected in cell line models.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA75903</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wood</surname><given-names>Charles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54CA190155</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wood</surname><given-names>Charles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20 GM103509</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wood</surname><given-names>Charles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000061</institution-id><institution>Fogarty International Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>D43 TW01492</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wood</surname><given-names>Charles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA117830</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lieberman</surname><given-names>Paul M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 CA174439</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lieberman</surname><given-names>Paul M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award007"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA010815</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lieberman</surname><given-names>Paul M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health grants (CA75903, U54CA190155, P20 GM103509 and Fogarty D43 TW01492) to CW, (R01 CA117830, P01 CA174439 and P30 CA010815) to PML.ON was a Fogarty Fellow.

KS mostly manifest as cutaneous lesions, but it can also be detected in the oral mucosa, lymph nodes and all visceral organ systems. There are four types of KS: iatrogenic, classic, endemic and epidemic/AIDS-related KS [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Endemic and epidemic KS are the most common forms in sub-Sahara Africa. Endemic KS occurs in HIV-1 negative African patients of both genders. The presentation in both genders at varying ages differentiates this form of KS from classical KS found mostly in elderly Mediterranean men. Epidemic KS occurs in patients who are HIV-1 positive, and along with iatrogenic KS, which results from chemical immunosuppression, highlights the role of immune dysregulation in KS development. Depending on the location of lesions, KS patients may display signs and symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, dysphagia and dyspnea. Cutaneous lesions may also disfigure and lead to social stigma for KS patients [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The prognosis of KS patients in sub-Sahara Africa is generally poor, often due to delayed diagnosis and late initiation of treatment [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Even after receiving anti-retroviral drugs therapy (ART), the mortality of epidemic KS patient is often high due to advanced KS disease staging, simultaneous advanced HIV-1 diagnosis and both HIV-1 and KS-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndromes [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The etiologic agent associated with KS is the Kaposi&#x02019;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) or human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8) which is a member of the gamma-herpesviridae. It is an enveloped virus with a double-stranded viral DNA of approximately 170-Kb. The KSHV genome encodes more than 80 genes that are expressed in a regulated transcriptional program that promotes latency with very limited viral expression, or supports lytic replication with the production of progeny virions. The cellular tropism of KSHV includes epithelial, endothelial, B cells, and more recently has been expanded to include neurons [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Depending on the host cell environment encountered upon infection, the virus may establish latency and only express latency related genes such as latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA). LANA expression helps KSHV prevent programmed cell death and circumvent host immune surveillance [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. During reactivation, the entire KSHV genetic repertoire is expressed enabling virus replication and propagation.</p><p>KSHV has a high seroprevalence in sub-Sahara Africa, where over 50% of the population has detectable anti-KSHV antibodies [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The virus can be transmitted by saliva and sexual routes [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In addition to KS, KSHV is also the etiological agent of other lymphoproliferative disorders such as multicentric Castleman&#x02019;s disease (MCD) and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. KS can be an opportunistic malignancy commonly presenting in untreated HIV-1 infected patients [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Due to the high HIV-1 prevalence in sub-Sahara Africa countries such as Zambia and Tanzania, KS is the leading cancer in men and the third leading cancer in women in Africa [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In contrast to the drastic reduction of KS in resource-rich regions, widespread implementation of ART in sub-Saharan Africa, has only modestly reduced KS incidence among the resource-limited countries of the region [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>There are currently no existing targeted immunotherapies against viral or host proteins in KS, and there is no vaccine against KSHV infection. Indeed the correlates of KS development or protection are ill-defined. A more complete understanding of changes in host and viral gene expression in KS lesions compared with non-tumor tissues could provide insights into the interactions between KSHV and the host that drive development of KS. Moreover, it would allow exploration for any potential biomarkers that are unique to KS neoplastic cells. These biomarkers could make early detection of KS possible and perhaps help to eliminate one of the major malignancies in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, gene expression profiles of KS lesions may also lead to identification of pathways required for KS neoplasia. Inhibition of such essential pathways could potentially provide therapeutic benefit for KS patients.</p><p>RNA-Seq is an extremely high density, unbiased sequencing technique that allows high-throughput assessment of total cellular transcription. It exhibits a broader dynamic range and specificity than microarray analyses [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Thus RNA-Seq is an ideal tools for defining the gene expression profiles or transcriptome of KS lesions. RNA-Seq has been utilized in transcriptomic analysis of various forms of cancers to identify pathways that could provide potential targets for future diagnosis or therapy [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, only a limited number of in vitro studies on KSHV infected cell lines or infected monocultures of specific lineages of cells, have utilized either RNA-Seq or microarray for transcriptomic analyses [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In the current study, epidemic KS lesion biopsies were collected from Zambia and Tanzania for comparative transcriptomic analysis using RNA-Seq. Ipsilateral or contralateral sampling of normal tissues from the same KS patients provided for direct intra-subject comparison of gene expression profiles. We found that KSHV has significantly impacted the cellular gene expression that were involved in the lipid and glucose metabolism disorder pathways. To our knowledge, this is the first study to utilize RNA-Seq to provide unbiased gene expression profile directly from KS lesions in comparison to that of non-neoplastic tissue from the same subject. Our study provides unique insights into the interactions between KSHV and the host and may point to previously unrecognized pathways in KS pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Permission to conduct this study was obtained from Tanzania National Institute for Medical Research, Ocean Road Cancer Institute Review Board, University of Zambia Biomedical Research Ethics Committee and the Institutional Review Board of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

Our data derived from lesion and contralateral control tissue biopsies of African epidemic KS patients showed a desultory pattern of KSHV gene expression in the tumor tissue between the patients. This is likely due to the multi-cellular lineage composition of the lesions, where diverse cell types in various stages of KSHV infection co-exist. However, we did find that the most dominantly expressed KSHV genes in all the lesions were involved in the establishment and maintenance of latency or in immune modulation. The high expression of viral immune modulation genes such as K2 (viral interleukin-6), K5 (modulator of immune recognition), K7 (viral inhibitor of apoptosis) and ORF75 (degradation of ND10 protein) in the lesions, could have severely hindered the immune system from eliminating these KSHV infected cells and contributed to the development of cancer. The upregulation of K2 in our data is consistent with a previous KS lesion gene expression study using real time-PCR [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In contrast to a prior report suggesting the potential oncogenic properties of the viral genes K1, ORF74 and vIRF1, we detected very few reads for these genes (ranged from 1 to 8 reads) in tumor tissues, suggesting either a very limited role of these genes in KS neoplastic growth or that their function is only essential at a temporally earlier stage in tumor development [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].

This observation is reminiscent of the limited sporadic lytic replication in various cell lines experimentally infected with KSHV, suggesting that sustained growth of KSHV transformed cells does not require robust lytic replication [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, we found that patients with longer exposure to ART tended to have lower KSHV viral gene expression in their lesion and vice versa. For example, the patient p32 received ART for 60 months and had the least number of reads aligned to KSHV. The low viral gene expression also had a moderate inverse-correlation (<italic>r</italic> = &#x02212;0.56) with higher lesion KSHV DNA copy number, as determined by real time-PCR. This suggests that prolonged ART treatment might suppress KSHV viral gene expression, but result in an increase of latent viral genome as shown by a higher KSHV DNA copy number in the lesions. A potential explanation is that the immune surveillance in these HIV-1 positive individuals improved after prolonged ART, effectively suppressing KSHV gene expression. However, a larger sample size will be needed to confirm these observed relationships.</p><p>Our study also revealed that expression of KSHV genes had a tremendous impact on the cellular gene expression profile. This is illustrated by the significant differences in gene expression between the lesion and control tissues that demonstrate KSHV mediated global transcriptional reprogramming in the lesion. Despite the disparity in KSHV gene expression, the cellular gene expression in the lesions was relatively similar between patients. By analyzing these common cellular gene changes with the IPA package, several upstream regulator genes were predicted to be altered in the lesions. These regulators, for example, upregulation of the transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGFB1), could potentially impact a series of proteins and pathways involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and growth. Moreover, our analysis predicted the activation in lesions of expression of several CXCR3 chemokine ligands, CXCL-9, CXCL-10 and CXCL-11 that are known to play an important role in the recruitment of immune cells, and in particular, T cells. Interestingly, these 3 ligands were also reported to be upregulated in classic KS lesions, suggesting a potential universal phenomenon that is primarily driven by KSHV [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>In agreement with the prediction of upregulation of CXCR3 chemokine ligands, CIBERSORT analysis implicated the lesion contained significant infiltration of various immune cells such as B cells, macrophages and natural killer cells in all patients. However, dendritic cells infiltration was predicted only in patients p32 and p83, whereas patients p22 and p23 had over 4-fold decrease than control tissues in apparent dendritic cells infiltration. It is worth noting that patients p32 and p83 had been on ART for an extended period of time, suggesting that ART might have stimulated some recovery of innate and adaptive anti-KSHV or anti-tumor immune response, but still was insufficient to suppress the KS development. The CIBERSORT also detected no significant infiltration of T cells in tumors, despite the apparent expression of the CXCR3 T cell chemo-attractants. This brings into question the functionality of the infiltrating immune cells. It is possible that these immune cells were able to migrate into the lesions but were incapable of activating their effector functions due to suppression by cytokines, anergy or checkpoint regulation [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Unfortunately, we were not able to confirm or refute these concepts using the current RNA-seq analyses alone. Transcriptomic, proteomic and functional assays on separate lineages of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes with additional samples will need to be analyzed.</p><p>From the unique depth of the cellular transcriptomic data, we were also able to infer which biological functions in the lesions were most likely to have been affected by the alteration in cellular gene expression. Intriguingly, beyond a plethora of previously enumerated cancer-related functions, we discovered profound activation of glucose metabolism disorder, coupled with significant decreases in multiple lipid anabolic and catabolic pathways. The relationships between glucose and lipid metabolism in tumor is clearly complex, nevertheless, it is widely accepted that the Warburg effect, where multiple metabolic processes are altered in the tumor to sustain the rapid proliferation and expansion of cancerous cells, is common [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Our finding of an increased glucose metabolism disorder in KS lesions could be an indication of the Warburg effect and can be explained by the need for the cancer cells to replicate. Several studies have shown that KSHV is indeed capable to induce Warburg effect in cell-lines and resulted in up-regulation of metabolic pathways such as glycolysis [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Moreover, KSHV latency genes have been shown to affect glucose metabolism in vitro [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. However, the decrease in lipid metabolism activities in these KS lesions is puzzling. Previous in vitro studies have suggested that KSHV requires and activates fatty acid synthesis for survival as latently infected endothelial cells. Additionally, multiple cellular genes (SCP2, PRDX5, ACSL3, MLYCD, AGPS, EHHADH, PEX19, PEX12, PEX5 and ABCD3) involved in lipid metabolism were up-regulated in these in vitro models [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Increased lipid metabolism was also observed in other forms of cancer [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Moreover, hypoxia conditions in the core of tumor should have stimulated lipid synthesis [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Surprisingly, we observed a down-regulation of lipid metabolism genes in the context of KS lesions. Among the lipid metabolism genes identified in the previous studies [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], we observed only marginal increased expression for ACSL3, AGPS and PEX12, the remaining genes were all down-regulated in our KS lesions [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Why lipid metabolism is not up-regulated, as suggested by in vitro models, in the KS lesions is unclear. Since KS lesion is a mixture of both normal and tumor cells, it is plausible that we are seeing an averaging effect with the KSHV-infected tumor cells undergoing up-regulated lipid biosynthesis, whereas the non-tumor cells were down-regulated. Interestingly, it had been reported that both ART and HIV-1 are capable of inducing lipid dysregulation, which is therefore a plausible cause for the decreased lipid metabolism observed in these epidemic KS patients [<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006844.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. It will be important to analyze the transcriptomes of lesions from HIV-1 negative endemic KS patients in order to differentiate the impacts due to ART, HIV-1 and KSHV alone on these metabolic changes.</p><p>Given the lack of suitable animal models for KSHV pathogenesis, in vitro cultures have been the only feasible mechanism to address the effects of KSHV on the infected cells. However, in vitro systems may not recapitulate the unique and complex microenvironment within the lesions. By comparing our lesion-based transcriptomic database with several in vitro studies, we showed that the TIME model reported recently is the most similar in its cellular gene expression profile to KS tumor biopsies. For example, the downregulation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARG) that regulates glucose metabolism and fatty acid storage was observed in both studies. Nevertheless, only 19% overlap between the lesion transcriptomes and in vitro derived expression repertoires was detected. More than 2901 genes were uniquely expressed in the lesions but not observed in the KSHV infected cell line models, suggesting that one needs to be cautious in extrapolating the gene expression data from cell lines to the human disease.</p><p>Finally, although the ipsilateral /contralateral control tissue collected from each KS patient served as an ideal intra-patient comparator for the lesion, the transcriptomes from these control tissues may not represent the gene expression profile of a KSHV negative patient. It is possible that the gene expression of these control tissues was already indirectly or directly altered by KSHV or by chronic immune responses. Skin tissue from KSHV negative patients will need to be tested to address this issue. Despite this shortfall, our data provide unique initial insights into the close relationship between the cellular and KSHV genes in tumorigenesis, as well as the profound impact of KSHV on numerous cellular regulatory and metabolic pathways that could potentially be targeted for future treatment of KS patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1006844.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Primers for real time-PCR validation.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="ppat.1006844.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1006844.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Comparison of gene expression among the 4 lesion/control pairs.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="ppat.1006844.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1006844.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Genes involved in lipid-related functions and/or glucose metabolism disorder in lesions.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="ppat.1006844.s003.XLSX"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1006844.s004"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>In vitro studies compared with the current study.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="ppat.1006844.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1006844.s005"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>Comparison of gene expression and functions with other in vitro studies.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="ppat.1006844.s005.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1006844.s006"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Top 30 most differentially expressed cellular genes in the lesions.</title><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="ppat.1006844.s006.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank all the tissue donors for their participation in this study.
