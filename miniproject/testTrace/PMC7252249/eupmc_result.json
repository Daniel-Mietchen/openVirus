    "The important role of proper sanitation in maintaining good public health has been confirmed in the past years. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) serve as efficient processes in removing pathogens, organic pollutants, nutrients, and pharmaceuticals from wastewaters. However, the advance systems of treatment that we use today are the result of a series of inventions that have been performed since 19th century. This chapter explains the evolution of the wastewater origin and the treatment processes along with the developments in microbiology and pathology that led to the present-day scenario of research and advance facilities. Pharmaceuticals can easily enter the environment due to their incomplete degradation in the treatment processes and because of their adverse effects on organisms and environment they are becoming a matter of great concern. A brief discussion on the presence of pharmaceutical compounds in different environment sectors such as wastewater, WWTPs, and the natural aquatic environment has been provided."
