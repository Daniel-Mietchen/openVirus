  <title>Phylogeny of influenza A and B neuraminidase (NA) genes.</title>
  <p>Influenza NA genes form two groups (Group I and Group II), which correspond to influenza A and B, respectively. Influenza A NA is further classified into two subgroups (Subgroup I and Subgroup II). The viral strains are colored for different hosts: human in green, swine in blue, avian in red and equine in purple. The bootstrap support values are indicated at major nodes. The scale bar at the bottom indicates the numbers of nucleotide substitutions per site.</p>
