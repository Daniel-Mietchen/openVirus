<p>Homologous gene recombination was identified using the 3SEQ algorithm under RDP3 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Ideally, all influenza sequences are analyzed in a single run. However, because of computational limitations to the program when a large data set is used, we examined our dataset for gene recombination within each influenza A subtype and within influenza B. Sequences with mosaic recombination signals were identified using a cutoff p-value 0.05
