<p>The SeqMat program was used to collapse similar sequences from the same location and the same year, which results in âˆ¼1500 representative sequences, respectively, for N1 and N2 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Attaluri1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. For other subtypes, we used all available sequences to detect recombination. Fourteen influenza A N1, 14 N2, two N3, one N4, five N6, three N8, and one influenza B NA sequences were identified to have mosaic recombination signals and thus were excluded from the analyses. No mosaic recombination signals were found in N5, N7 or N9.
