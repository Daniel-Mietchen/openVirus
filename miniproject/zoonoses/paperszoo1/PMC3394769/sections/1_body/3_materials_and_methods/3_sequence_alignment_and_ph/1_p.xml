<p>Influenza A and B NA sequences are remotely related with around 40% nucleotide sequence similarity. We thus conducted both protein and nucleotide sequence alignments using Expresso - a program based upon protein structural information for alignment and TranslatorX - a program referring to the corresponding protein sequence alignment to align nucleotide sequences, respectively

 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Abascal1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. The resulting alignment between influenza A and B sequences was considered to be of good quality, which assured the reliability of the downstream analysis (
