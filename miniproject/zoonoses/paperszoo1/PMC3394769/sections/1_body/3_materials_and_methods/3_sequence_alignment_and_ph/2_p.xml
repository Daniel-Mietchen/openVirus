<p>Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using the Maximum-likelihood (ML) method in RAxML 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Stamatakis1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. RAxML uses rapid algorithms for bootstrap and maximum likelihood searches and is considered one of the fastest and most accurate phylogeny programs. Two hundred independent inferences starting from random MP trees were performed, and the tree with the highest likelihood score was selected as the representative. The GTRGAMMA model was employed to correct the biases of multiple substitution and rate heterogeneity in sequences. All the analyses were conducted on the supercomputing clusters at the Holland Computing Center (
