<p>Three clock models were compared statistically for each dataset using a Bayes factor test in the Tracer program 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Suchard1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>: a strict clock, an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock (UCLD) and an uncorrelated exponential relaxed clock (UCED) 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Drummond3" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. The UCED model was found to provide the best fit for all lineages. In addition, we used the newly developed random local clock model (RLC) that takes into account the rate variation among different branches within lineage by applying a series of local molecular clocks, each extending over a subregion of the overall phylogeny. All estimates also incorporated a different substitution rate for each codon position and a Bayesian skyline coalescent prior 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Rambaut1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. For each dataset, two independent Bayesian MCMC runs were conducted for 30 million generations to achieve convergence, with uncertainty in parameter estimates reflected in the 95% highest probability density (HPD). The Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) tree across all plausible trees was then computed from the BEAST trees using the TreeAnnotator program, with the first 10% of trees removed as burn-in.
