<p>The substitution rate and the time of most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) were estimated for each lineage/sublineage using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method available in the BEAST package

 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Drummond2" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>; significant outliers identified were then removed. To reduce excessive computational load, we followed the common strategy that achieves computer tractability while preserving the accuracy of the estimates 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Felsenstein1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. We wrote a Java program to select around 120 sequences from each lineage or sublineage, which represent viruses sampled from different locations and at different time points. In all cases, the data were analyzed under the GTR (General Time Reversible) +
