<p>Lineages were determined based upon the topology of phylogenetic trees and strong bootstrap support values (100 for influenza A and approximately 90 for influenza B). The genetics distances between lineages were calculated using the Kimura-2-Parameter (K2P) distance matric under MEGA 5.0 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Tamura1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Additional information such as the distribution of viruses in hosts and geographic regions were also considered in the classification. The aim was to identify the lineages of clearly related sequences, which might interest the virology-epidemiology community and could be used for further evolutionary dynamics analyses. The lineage and sublineage were named according to the following notations: a single digit is used to represent one of the nine influenza A NA subtypes and a letter is used to represent a lineage. A sublineage is also represented using a digit. A dot is used to separate a lineage and a sublineage. For example, 1A.2 means N1 subtype, lineage A, and sublineage 2. For influenza B, two lineages were assigned and named following the conventions well-accepted by the influenza research community. To make our lineage assignment scheme justifiable and extensible, we use alphabetic letters to represent lineages in the order of avian, swine, human, and equine for hosts and in the order of the North America followed by Eurasian/Oceanian in geography.
