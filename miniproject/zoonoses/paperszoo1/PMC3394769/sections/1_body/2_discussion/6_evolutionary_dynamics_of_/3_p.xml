<p>In addition to the complexity found in Eurasian swine N2 viruses, similarly, in North America in 1998 there were outbreaks of influenza observed in swine herds in Minnesota, Iowa, and Texas. The outbreaks were caused by a triple-reassortant H3N2 virus which contained genes from human (HA, NA, and PB1), swine (NS, NP, and M), and avian (PB2 and PA) influenza viruses

 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Christman1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. These reassortment events, coupled with interspecies transmission between swine and humans, have led to the complexity seen within lineage 2A.
