 <bold>In summary</bold>, we analyzed 14,328 influenza A and B NA sequences and studied the evolutionary history and phylodynamics of the influenza NA gene. The divergence of influenza NA into influenza A and B NA occurred first, and nine NA subtypes further diverged within influenza A, with two to three lineages identified within each NA subtype. The analyses of substitution rates,

Further analyses of other influenza segments are needed in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of influenza virus evolution, which will facilitate influenza surveillance and control.
