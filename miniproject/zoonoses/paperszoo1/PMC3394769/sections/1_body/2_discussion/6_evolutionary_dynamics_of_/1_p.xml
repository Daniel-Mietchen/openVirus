<p>Two major swine virus groups, Eurasian (avian-like) swine (1A.4) and North American swine (1B), were found within N1 (

 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Fourment1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Our tMRCA analysis of the Eurasian (avian-like) swine lineage revealed that an avian virus crossed the species boundary from birds to pigs in 1978, which is seven years later than previously described
