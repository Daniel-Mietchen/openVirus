<p>Lineage 2B includes human influenza viruses isolated from two different subtypes, H2N2 between 1957 and 1968 and H3N2 after 1968, which share the same N2 gene maintained in human influenza virus after the antigenic shift from H2 to H3 occurred in 1968

(2009a), but further supporting the hypothesis that emerging lineages circulate years prior to their initial detection in humans. Furthermore, the human lineages have relatively high non-synonymous to synonymous (
