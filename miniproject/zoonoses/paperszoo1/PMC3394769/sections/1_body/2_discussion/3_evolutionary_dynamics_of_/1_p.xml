<p>This study demonstrated that human influenza viruses were shown to have little geographical restriction, indicating that human viruses were transmitted globally and probably rapidly as well 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In addition, this study provides new insights into the emergence time of the human pandemic influenza virus because of the employment of the new random local clock model. This model takes into account the rate variation among different branches within lineage and has been considered superior to other models. For the H1N1 human lineage (1C), which includes the sequences from the 1918 Spanish Flu, the tMRCA under the random local clock model was estimated to be 1898 (95% HPD: 1882–1909), which is earlier than the years previously reported. Using the uncorrelated exponential relaxed clock model, the tMRCA of pandemic 1918 H1N1 viruses was estimated to be 1905–1918
