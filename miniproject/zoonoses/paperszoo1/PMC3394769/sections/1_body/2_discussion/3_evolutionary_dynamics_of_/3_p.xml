<p>In addition to the above discussed human lineages, pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza viruses are believed to have arisen from a reassortment between North American and Eurasian swine lineages, and as expected, the pandemic H1N1 2009 viruses grouped with the Eurasian swine lineage

 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Smith4" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. This increase could be attributed either to the adaptations of pandemic H1N1 2009 viruses to humans or to intensive sampling (more frequent mutations detected)
