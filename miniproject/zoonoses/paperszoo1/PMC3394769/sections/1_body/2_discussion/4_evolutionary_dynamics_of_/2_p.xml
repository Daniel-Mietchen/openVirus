<p>The two subtype-specific avian sublineages, 1A.1 for H5N1 and 2A.1 for H9N2, are considered to have pandemic potential and were found to evolve relatively faster compared with other avian lineages from multiple subtypes (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038665-t002">Table 2</xref>). In addition, these two sublineages were found to be relatively young (23 years for H9N2 and 17 years for H5N1), indicating a more recent emergence likely indicative of their adaptation from a wild bird reservoir to domestic poultry and their ensuing establishment in poultry populations. Together, the higher substitution rates and contemporary divergence of sublineages, 1A.1 (H5N1) and 2A.1 (H9N2) may be attributable to the rapid geographical dissemination of these viruses in wild birds and poultry, followed by the establishment of endemicity in poultry-dense regions and consistent transmission and outbreaks

It will be interesting in future studies to determine if sampling biases (over-sampling in the case of H5N1 and H9N2) may also play a role in the higher substitution rates and recent divergence times observed compared to other avian influenza virus lineages. Nonetheless, it is important to continue systematic surveillance of these high-risk viruses in both birds and humans to better understand these processes.
