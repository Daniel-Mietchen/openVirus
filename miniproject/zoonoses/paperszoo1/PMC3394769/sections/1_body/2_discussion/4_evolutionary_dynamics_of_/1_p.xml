<p>Influenza viruses circulating in non-human species have evolved in association with their various hosts on different continents for extended periods of time 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Olsen1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Avian influenza viruses were usually classified into Eurasian and North American lineages in the past, which was attributed to confinement of birds to distinct flyways in each hemisphere

 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Wahlgren1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.This phylo-geographic pattern is evident in the lineages designated for N4â€“N9 subtypes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038665-g006">Figure 6</xref>). We also found that the viruses isolated from Oceania were grouped together with Eurasian viruses. Therefore, we expanded our geographic designation and used Eurasian/Oceanian to define theses lineages. Avian lineages were found in all nine subtypes, whereas the mammalian lineages occurred in only four subtypes, providing support for the hypothesis that wild aquatic avian viruses are considered the natural reservoir of all influenza viruses (
