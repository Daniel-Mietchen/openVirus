<p>It is notable that substitution rates are not the same across all branches within a phylogenetic tree. The relaxed clock model was developed to cope with this issue. An average rate across all branches in the tree is estimated under relaxed clock model in BEAST with 95% HPDs summarized from average rates, which are estimated from the sampled trees 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Drummond1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The 95% HPDs thus reflect the topological uncertainty among the sampled trees, but do not show the rate variation across different branches within a tree. In previous studies, the relaxed clock model was used to estimate the substitution rate and 95% HPDs and the resulting values were used for comparison

 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Vijaykrishna1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In fact, such comparison is less accurate. For example, if a phylogenetic tree is mixed with branches of very high and low rates, it might result in an average rate that is similar to that from another tree with branches of a constant rate. We cannot simply conclude the two virus lineages evolve at the same rate. Using the random local clock (RLC), we not only computed the mean substitution rate and 95% HPDs but also estimated rate heterogeneity among different branches of a phylogenetic tree, which reflects evolutionary dynamics of influenza viruses with a given lineage.
