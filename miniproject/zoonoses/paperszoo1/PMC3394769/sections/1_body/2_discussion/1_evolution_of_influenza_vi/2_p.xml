<p>In this study, 23 NA lineages were determined within influenza A based upon both theoretical (e.g., phylogenetic tree topology) and empirical criteria (e.g., pandemic events). The majority of lineages were found to be specific in hosts, or geographical locations, with a genetic distance around 0.2, ranging from 0.117 to 0.349. These results are generally consistent with previous findings
