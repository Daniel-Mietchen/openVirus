<p>The ML and Bayesian MCMC analyses revealed that the divergence of influenza A and B NA genes occurred earlier than the divergence of influenza A NA subtypes. Similar findings were reported for the hemagglutinin (HA) genes 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, in which influenza A and B HA genes were found to diverge first, followed by the division of influenza A HA subtypes. Interestingly, within influenza A, both subgroups (I and II) consist mainly of human, swine, avian, and equine viruses and show similar patterns of host-specific lineage composition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038665-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This strongly supports the hypothesis that subgroup I and II viruses experienced parallel evolution due to similar rates of genetic mutation and adaption to host environments
