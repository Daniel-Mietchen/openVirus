<p>Classification and designation of the lineages and sublineages within the influenza A virus are essential for studies of viral evolution, ecology and epidemiology. However, how to accurately identify an evolutionary lineage of influenza A viruses is challenging. Whether the naming system will be accepted and used by influenza researchers is even more challenging. To trace the evolutionary change of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, a hierarchical nomenclature system for HPAI hemagglutinin clades and sub-clades has been implemented by the WHO/OIE/FAO H5N1 Evolution Working Group and widely adapted by the research community 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Group1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The work presented here is one of the first steps toward the development of a nomenclature system for influenza A virus lineages (at the segment level) and genotypes (at the genome level). We will incorporate the findings of lineages and genotypes into our FluGenome database for the detection of newly emerging viral lineages and genome reassortment, which will improve influenza surveillance
