<p>Two lineages, H7N7 (7C) and H3N8 (8B), were revealed in equine influenza viruses. The H7N7 equine influenza viruses have not been detected since the late 1970s 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Webster3" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, whereas H3N8 was first isolated in 1963 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Waddell1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> and is still circulating in equine populations throughout most of the world. Lineage 8B (H3N8) is composed predominantly of equine viruses, but canine influenza viruses are also found in this lineage. This observation is consistent with the fact that equine influenza virus has crossed the species barrier and become established as a respiratory pathogen of dogs 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Crawford1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. The equine influenza viruses share ancestors with avian viruses in the same subtype, indicating their possible avian origin.
