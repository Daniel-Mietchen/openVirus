<p>Different selection pressures were revealed in different lineages as indicated by the ratio of non-synonymous (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038665-t003">Table 3</xref>). Within influenza A, the highest

  <sub>N</sub>/d
  <sub>S</sub>
 </italic> ratio was observed in 2B - human N2 lineage (0.313), which was slightly higher than that of 8B - equine N8 lineage (0.281), 1C - human N1 lineage (0.261), 1A.1 - H5N1 (0.274) and 2A.1- H9N2 (0.252), most likely reflecting host immune selection pressure, as a result of continuous circulation within the respective hosts and/or vaccination. The lineages under the most purifying selection were lineage 9C (0.068), 4B (0.062) and 5B (0.078). In comparison, the

  <sub>N</sub>/d
  <sub>S</sub>
