<p>Protein structure analyses revealed all the positively selected sites were located at the surface of the NA protein and pertained to antibody binding and/or interactions with the sugar molecules of host cells (

In addition, a number of positively selected sites reside in regions of the NA protein where neuraminidase inhibitors have been known to bind, indicating strong selection in influenza viruses with molecular markers predictive of antiviral resistance.
