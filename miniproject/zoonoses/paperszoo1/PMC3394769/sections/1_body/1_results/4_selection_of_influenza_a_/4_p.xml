<p>In the human H1N1 lineage (1C), amino acid positions 151, 222 and 344 were found to be under a strong positive selection, and the amino acids in these appear to interact with the NA inhibitor â€“ zanamivir, a drug molecule according to the NA structure (

The amino acid position 319 in human H1N1 lineage, identified to be under positive selection, forms a hydrogen bond with position 379, whose backbone carbonyl is involved in interactions with calcium ions (

 <sup>2+</sup> ion interacts with positions 379, 389, 387, 382, and 381, forming H-bonds with position 385 and position 383. These interactions are crucial in protein folding to create the appropriate tertiary structure for sialic acid binding (which allows the NA to cleave the sialic acid) or for NA inhibitor binding.
