<p>With regard to another human lineage (2B), positions 126 and 127 were found to be within the binding pocket of influenza A virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038665-g005">Figure 5</xref>-B). These two residues, along with residues 120 and 151 were found to be under positive selection. All these sites fold in close proximity to each other, providing a hydrogen-bond network that is essential for NA inhibitor binding. Specifically, position 151 forms a hydrogen bond to position 75, which itself is predicted to bind to zanamivir.
