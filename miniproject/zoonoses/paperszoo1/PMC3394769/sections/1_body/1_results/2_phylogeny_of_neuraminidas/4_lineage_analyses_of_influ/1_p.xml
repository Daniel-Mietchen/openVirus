 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038665.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Lineage 3A consists mainly of North American avian viruses (n = 173), but includes several avian strains from South America (n = 8). In addition, within lineage 3A, 166 sequences were isolated from avian, 4 from swine, 1 from human, and 9 from environmental samples. Lineage 3B is a Eurasian/Oceanian avian lineage, while 3C is also an avian lineage, but does not show any geographical pattern. Lineage 3B and 3C were all composed of avian influenza viruses.
