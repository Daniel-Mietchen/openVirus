<p>The N2 sequences (3,754 in total) were classified into two major lineages, 2A and 2B (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038665-g002">Figure 2</xref>-B, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038665-t001">Table 1</xref>). The genetic distance between lineages 2A and 2B was estimated to be 0.204. Lineage 2A is a major avian lineage whereas 2B consists of mainly mammalian (i.e., human and swine) influenza viruses. Three sublineages were further classified in 2A, 2A.1 for H9N2, 2A.2 for Eurasian avian, and 2A.3 for North American avian.
