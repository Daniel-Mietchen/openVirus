<p>Lineage 1B consists of mainly North American swine influenza viruses, while 1C is a human lineage, consisting mainly of H1N1 human influenza viruses. The viruses in 1B correspond mostly to the classical H1N1 isolates from swine (n = 126), but include 9 isolates from humans and 9 from birds, indicating sporadic interspecies transmissions of influenza viruses from swine to humans or birds. Lineage 1C consists predominantly of human viruses (n = 1204), with a few exceptions, namely, swine (4 isolates) and birds (2 isolates). Within the influenza A N1 subtype, avian influenza viruses include sequences from multiple HA subtypes (e.g., H1N1, H3N1, H5N1, H6N1, H7N1, H9N1, and H11N1), whereas human and swine viruses have limited HA subtypes (human: H1N1; swine: H1N1, H3N1).</p>
