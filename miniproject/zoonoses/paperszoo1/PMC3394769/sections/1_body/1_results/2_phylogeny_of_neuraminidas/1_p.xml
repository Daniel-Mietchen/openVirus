<p>A total of 23 lineages, two to three lineages for each subtype, were identified within influenza A viruses, while two lineages were classified within influenza B (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038665-t001">Table 1</xref>). Lineages 1A and 2A were further divided into five and three sublineages, respectively. Human lineages were found in influenza A N1 and N2 subtypes and influenza B, swine lineages in N1 and N2, equine lineages in N7 and N8, and avian lineages in all influenza A subtypes. In addition, avian lineages were found to have more combinations of HA and NA compared with mammalian lineages.
