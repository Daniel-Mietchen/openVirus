<p>Within 2B, most of the influenza viruses are from human H2N2 and H3N2 influenza viruses (n = 2,340) and swine H3N2 and H1N2 viruses (n = 214). However, avian influenza H3N2 viruses (n = 11) were also found in this lineage. Interestingly, there were five major clades of swine influenza viruses scattered within lineage 2B, suggesting these viruses originate from human viruses through either genome reassortment or direct transmission events. It is also noted that the branch lengths of the swine clusters are much longer as compared to those of the closely related human viruses, indicating extensive evolution of the N2 gene in swine viruses after transmission from humans to swine.</p>
