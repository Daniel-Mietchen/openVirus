<p>Sublineage 1A.1 originated from the recent highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza epizootic that started in Asia around 1996 and has spread throughout the Eastern Hemisphere. The viruses in 1A.1 are mostly from birds (n = 1,031), but some are from humans (n = 164), swine (n = 8), tigers (n = 2) and mink (n = 1). Sublineage 1A.2 is composed of mostly Eurasian avian influenza viruses (n = 230), whereas some human highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses (n = 24) sampled in 1997 in Hong Kong were also found in 1A.2. Sublineage 1A.4 consists of Eurasian swine influenza viruses which were originally derived from Eurasian avian viruses and first detected in Belgium in 1979. Not surprisingly, 1A.3 (Pandemic H1N1 2009) is grouped together with Eurasian swine, which confirms previous findings that the NA segment of pandemic H1N1 2009 viruses originated from the Eurasian swine influenza viruses. Sublineage 1A.5 is composed of viruses mainly from North American avian species (n = 162), with a few exceptions: 1 viral sequence from human and 3 from environmental samples.</p>
