<p>The NA genes of influenza B viruses were divided into two distinct lineages, B/Victoria/2/87-like (Vic87) and B/Yamagata/16/88-like (Yam88) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038665-g003">Figure 3</xref>). All influenza B viruses were found from humans, with no obvious geographical separation in either lineage. The genetic distance between Vic87 and Yam88 lineages was estimated to be 0.06.
