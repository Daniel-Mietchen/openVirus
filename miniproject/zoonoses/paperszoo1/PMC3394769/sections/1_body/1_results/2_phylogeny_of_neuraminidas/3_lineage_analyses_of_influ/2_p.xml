<p>The 2A.1 is a subtype-specific sublineage consisting of mainly H9N2 avian influenza viruses, with the majority from birds (n = 412), but with 24 sequences from swine and 4 from humans, which indicates the occurrence of interspecies transmissions. The 2A.2 and 2A.3 correspond to Eurasian and North American avian viruses, respectively. The viruses of 2A.2 are mainly from birds (n = 342), but a few are from swine (n = 7) and humans (n = 2). A similar result was also found in 2A.3, which includes 291 avian viruses, 1 H7N2 human virus, and 29 viruses isolated from environmental samples.</p>
