<p>The N4, N5 and N6 subtypes were each classified into two lineages, one corresponding to North American avian (4A, 5A and 6A) and the other Eurasian/Oceanian avian (4B, 5B and 6B) (

The genetic distance between lineages was estimated to be 0.198 for N4, 0.254 for N5, and 0.250 for N6 viruses, respectively. All N4 and N5 viruses are from avian species. Lineage 6A is composed mainly of North American avian viruses (n = 336), with a few exceptions (n = 2) from Asia avian viruses. Lineage 6B consists mainly of Eurasian/Oceanian avian viruses (n = 121), but contains 6 avian viruses from North America.
