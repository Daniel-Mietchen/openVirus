<p>Three lineages, 1A, 1B and 1C, were identified based upon strong bootstrap support values (100%) of the phylogenetic tree, which was generated from 4,146 sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038665-g002">Figure 2</xref>-A, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038665-t001">Table 1</xref>). The genetic distances between lineages ranged from 0.191 to 0.238. Lineage 1A is a major avian lineage, which is further divided into five sublineages: 1A.1 (H5N1), 1A.2 (Eurasian avian), 1A.3 (Pandemic H1N1 2009), 1A.4 (Eurasian avian-like swine) and 1A.5 (North American avian).
