<p>Outliers were identified and removed before the estimation of substitution rate and tMRCA for each lineage (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038665.s017">Table S1</xref>). The mean substitution rate and 95% HPD range for each lineage are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038665-t002">Table 2</xref>. Our results demonstrated that the mean substitution rates estimated under random local clock (RLC) model were generally lower than the corresponding rates estimated under uncorrelated exponential relaxed clock (UCED) model (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038665-t002">Table 2</xref>). In the following, we present the results based upon the RLC model, a new model that can reveal the rate heterogeneity among branches.
