<p>The time of most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) varies from lineage to lineage (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038665-t002">Table 2</xref>). The tMRCA for human H1N1 (1C), which includes viruses causing the 1918 Spanish Flu, was dated to 1898 and the 95% HPD interval was between 1882 and 1909. The tMRCA of H5N1viruses (1A.1) was estimated to be at 1988 (95% HPD: 1984–1992), eight years before the outbreak of H5N1 avian virus in 1996 in Asia. For 1A.2 (Eurasian avian in N1), the tMRCA was estimated to be at 1927 (95% HPD: 1922–1931), with the earliest sampling time being 1934. For the pandemic H1N1 2009 (1A.3), it can be dated back to Nov 19, 2008 (95% HPD: June 7, 2008– Mar 16, 2009). The most recent common ancestor of the Eurasian (avian-like) swine (1A.4) can be dated back to 1978 (95% HPD: 1977–1979), one year earlier than the first detection of this lineage in 1979. For lineage 2B, the tMRCA was dated to 1956 (95% HPD: 1955–1957), one year before the occurrence of human H2N2 in 1957. The tMRCAs for other lineages are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038665-t002">Table 2</xref> and the MCC trees are available from the authors upon request. The above results suggest that pandemic or epidemic viruses emerged several months or several years before their initial detection, indicating the crucial role for enhanced surveillance of newly emerging viruses.
