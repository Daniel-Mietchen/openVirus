<p>The Bayesian consensus tree for each lineage, along with posterior mean branch lengths scaled in real time, is depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038665-g004">Figure 4</xref>. To reflect the rate variation, we colored branches by their posterior mean relative rate of nucleotide substitution. Blue branches reflect a slow substitution rate, whereas red branches indicate rapid change. For H5N1, the mean substitution rate was estimated to be 3.06×10
 <sup>−3</sup> subs/site/year (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038665-t002">Table 2</xref>), with a low rate (1.5×10
 <sup>−3</sup>) found in earlier branches (blue) and a high rate (4.20×10
 <sup>−3</sup>) in later branches (red) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038665-g004">Figure 4</xref>-A). In contrast, N1 genes of North American swine viruses have a mean rate of 2.55×10
 <sup>−3</sup>, with a decrease in rates during evolution: a high rate (3.2×10
 <sup>−3</sup>) in earlier branches (red) and a low rate (0.9×10
 <sup>−3</sup>) in later branches (blue) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038665-g004">Figure 4</xref>-B). It is noted that human H1N1 viruses were found to evolve at two different rates in two circulation periods, with a low rate (1.3×10
 <sup>−3</sup>) during 1918–1957 (blue) and a high rate (2.9×10
 <sup>−3</sup>) after 1977 (red) (
