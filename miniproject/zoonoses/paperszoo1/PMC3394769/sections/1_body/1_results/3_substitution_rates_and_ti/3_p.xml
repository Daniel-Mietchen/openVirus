<p>The H9N2 lineage was found to have a mean substitution rate of 4.45×10
 <sup>−3</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038665-t002">Table 2</xref>), with a constant rate of 4.9×10
 <sup>−3</sup> in the majority of branches (red) and a low rate (2.6×10
 <sup>−3</sup>) in a small number of branches (blue) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038665-g004">Figure 4</xref>-D). The substitution rates with the equine N7 lineage decreased from earlier branches (red) (3.4×10
 <sup>−3</sup>) to late branches (blue) (1.6×10
 <sup>−3</sup>) and averaged at 2.65×10
 <sup>−3</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038665-g004">Figure 4</xref>-E). The influenza B Yama88 viruses has a mean substitution rate of 2.3×10
 <sup>−3</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038665-t002">Table 2</xref>), with a consistent rate of 2.4×10
 <sup>−3</sup> in the majority of branches (red) and a rate of 1.5×10
 <sup>−3</sup> in a small number of branches (blue) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038665-g004">Figure 4</xref>-F). Different rate heterogeneity patterns were also found in other lineages (Data available from authors on request).
