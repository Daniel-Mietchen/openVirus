<p>The Maximum Likelihood (ML) and MCMC Bayesian analyses demonstrate that the influenza NA gene diverged first into A and B (Group I and Group II), followed by the division of influenza A subtypes (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038665.s018">File S1</xref>). The monophylic origin of influenza A and influenza B was strongly supported by the bootstrap values (100%). Within influenza A, two subgroups were found, one consisting of subtype N2, N3, N6, N7 and N9 (Subgroup I) and the other consisting of the remaining four subtypes, N1, N4, N5 and N8 (Subgroup II) (
