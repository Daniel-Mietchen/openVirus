<p>Each of the influenza viral genes is thought to be important in viral replication and interaction with host cells; therefore, understanding the evolutionary tempo and mode of each viral gene can provide new insight into the epidemiology of influenza viruses

 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Furuse1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Among the eight segments, neuraminidase (NA) is of particular significance. NA is a major surface glycoprotein of influenza A and B, but does not occur in influenza C 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Nerome1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. It plays a key role in virus replication by removing sialic acids from the host cell surface and thus releasing newly formed virions 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Palese1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Drugs that inhibit this NA activity, known as neuraminidase inhibitors, are often used for the treatment of influenza 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Bloom1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, drug resistance mutations (e.g., H275Y) have been broadly observed in epidemic viruses
