<p>Genetic mutation is considered one of the most important molecular mechanisms in the evolution of influenza virus 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Webster2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Like most RNA viruses, the influenza virus has low fidelity RNA synthesis, which results in a high mutation rate - around one mutation per genome per replication 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Drake1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, several orders of magnitude higher than those in most DNA-based organisms 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Holmes1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Evolutionary forces such as natural selection acting upon rapidly mutating viral populations could shape the genetic structure of influenza viruses in different hosts, geographic regions and periods of time 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Ghedin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Ferguson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Importantly, rapid evolution could partially facilitate the ability of influenza viruses to cross host species barriers and successfully emerge in new hosts with often important public health and/or veterinary health implications. One such example is the Eurasian avian-like H1N1 swine virus, which was first detected in pigs in Belgium in 1979, with all of the eight segments found to be derived from a Eurasian avian H1N1 virus, presumably following adaptive mutation
