<p>Influenza virus belongs to the viral family Orthomyxoviridae and has a segmented negative-sense RNA genome in an enveloped virion 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. According to the antigenic properties of nucleoproteins (NP) and matrix proteins (MP), influenza viruses are classified into three types - A, B and C. The microscopic structural features and genome organization of influenza A, B and C viruses suggest that they descended from a common ancestor 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Webster1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The influenza A virus infects a wide variety of bird and mammalian species and can cause moderate to severe epidemics annually and catastrophic pandemics sporadically

 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The influenza B and C viruses are considered less pathogenic compared with influenza A and are found mainly in humans, although there is increasing evidence that B and C viruses can also infect other species
