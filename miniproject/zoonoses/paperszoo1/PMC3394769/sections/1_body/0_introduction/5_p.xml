<p>Influenza A viral neuraminidases are classified into nine subtypes (N1–N9) according to their antigenic properties, whereas influenza B neuraminidases are classified into two lineages 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Chi1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Previous phylogenetic analyses of influenza viral NA sequences have provided important insight into understanding the evolution of influenza viruses; however, these studies mainly focused on either specific types or subtypes 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Fourment1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Reid1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. A global perspective of the evolutionary history of influenza NA genes and their spatial, temporal, and host associations remain lacking. In addition, evolutionary rates of influenza viral genes were estimated (∼10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitution/site/year) in previous studies 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Vijaykrishna1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>; however, only the average values across all branches were presented. It is unlikely the evolutionary rates are the same in all branches within a phylogenetic tree. The investigation of rate variations among different branches is thus of significant importance in understanding the interior evolutionary behavior of the influenza virus. Moreover, selection pressure and positive/negative selection sites were described in previous studies 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, but only a small number of representative sequences were selected for the estimations. Finally, the structural analysis of positively selected amino acid sites, although essential for the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines, has largely been neglected in previous studies. In this study, we employed all influenza NA sequences available in public repositories and conducted large-scale evolutionary, phylodynamic and structural analyses to address the above issues.
