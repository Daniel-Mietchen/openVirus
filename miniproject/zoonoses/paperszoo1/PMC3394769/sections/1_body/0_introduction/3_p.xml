<p>Influenza virus has also shown the propensity to escape immunity because of continuous antigenic drift, i.e., mutation at the epitope positions of HA and NA segments 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Bush1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Smith2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Antigenic drift may often result in structural changes in antigenic sites, which must be recognized by the host immune system in order to suppress viral infection 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Plotkin1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This antigenic drift often requires the update of annual influenza vaccines to assure a match between the vaccine and currently circulating viral strains 
 <xref rid="pone.0038665-Schwartz1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Additionally, influenza viruses undergo more dramatic antigenic changes, known as antigenic shifts, which occur following reassortment between different subtypes of influenza viruses within a single host
