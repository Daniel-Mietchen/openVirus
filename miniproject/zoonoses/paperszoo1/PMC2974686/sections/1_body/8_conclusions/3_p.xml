<p>The primary focus of our proposals is discovering and predicting the consequences of climate change on VBZDs and driving public health action for the development of more effective disease-prevention strategies. We are not the first to suggest research goals to address the understanding and mitigation of climate change effects on VBZDs and other infectious diseases. However, for many aspects there is a clear convergence of conclusions and research recommendations (see, for example,

 <xref rid="b95-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Semenza and Menne 2009</xref>). The sooner these studies are undertaken, the sooner intervention strategies can be developed and instituted.
