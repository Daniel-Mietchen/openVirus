<p>This is another type of longitudinal monitoring program, but the list of pathogens and hosts would be broader and the data collected more restricted (e.g., geographic coordinates, dates, number of cases). These data can be used to track geographic and temporal trends in VBZD incidence, identify vulnerable populations, and test predictions based on forecasting models. Several existing databases provide useful formats (e.g., U.S. Geological Service’s Global Wildlife Disease News Map; 
 <xref rid="b68-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">National Biological Information Infrastructure 2010</xref>), the CDC’s ArboNet, and the Global Early Warning System for Major Animal Diseases including Zoonoses [
 <xref rid="b105-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization (WHO) 2010</xref>]. Integration of such formats with the monitoring, data gathering, and data dissemination capacity of CDC and WHO networks would provide a powerful tool, making geographic and incidence data quickly available to the broad community of public health professionals, researchers, and modelers.
