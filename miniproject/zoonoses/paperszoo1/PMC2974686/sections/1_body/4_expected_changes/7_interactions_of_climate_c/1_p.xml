<p>Just as the interaction effects between various aspects of climate change (e.g., temperature and precipitation) must be considered to accurately predict the influence of climate on VBZDs, so too must the interactions between climate change and other anthropogenic and natural factors. Human activities facilitate host or vector range shifts by transporting hosts or vectors to new geographic areas (
 <xref rid="b6-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Benedict et al. 2007</xref>), including new continents, as was the case with vectors of plague (
 <xref rid="b75-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Parmenter et al. 1999</xref>) and West Nile virus (
 <xref rid="b48-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Komar 2003</xref>) and hosts of monkeypox in the United States (
 <xref rid="b52-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Likos et al. 2005</xref>). Human migrations in response to climate change may make them more vulnerable to some VBZDs. For example, increases in leishmaniasis were associated with drought-related clustering of humans near water supplies where sand fly vectors were concentrated (

 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, the primary vector of Dengue virus, is likely to achieve northward range expansions in the United States as winter temperatures become warmer, this may not result in dengue epidemics in the United States. In southern Texas, where 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is already established, dengue has remained rare despite epidemics on the Mexican side of the border. This is thought to be due to human-related factors, such as the greater use of air conditioning in the United States, which decreases exposure to mosquitoes (
 <xref rid="b87-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Reiter et al. 2003</xref>). Finally, the degree of human intervention to prevent or mitigate adverse effects of climate change on health will affect the eventual outcomes of all of the mechanisms discussed above. This is a large field of study (
 <xref rid="b21-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Confalonieri et al. 2007</xref>) but is outside the scope of our discussion.
