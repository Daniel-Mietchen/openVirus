<p>It seems intuitive that extinctions resulting in fewer species of host animals should decrease the number of potential zoonotic pathogens and thus the incidence of VBZDs. Several scientists have suggested that high biodiversity is causally related to high levels of infectious disease, both locally and regionally (

 <xref rid="b107-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Wolfe et al. 2005</xref>). Indeed, some highly specific pathogens are likely to disappear with their hosts. Nevertheless, extinction and biodiversity loss may have some counterintuitive affects on the incidence of some VBZDs. Extinctions will occur selectively with habitat and dietary specialists being affected first (

 <xref rid="b103-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Warren et al. 2001</xref>). Meanwhile more opportunistic, generalist species may not only survive but thrive in the absence of competition from specialists. In their study of climate change and altitudinal migration in Yosemite National Park, 
 <xref rid="b65-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Moritz et al. (2008)</xref> found that opportunistic small mammal species (those that were short-lived and had more litters per year) were more likely to expand their range upward than were their long-lived, less fecund counterparts. The host species for most of the known rodent-borne hemorrhagic fever viruses that affect humans are opportunistic species (
 <xref rid="b61-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Mills 2006</xref>). Although it is possible that this pattern is due, at least in part, to sampling error (diseases associated with anthropophilic species would be the first to come to our attention), the pattern could be the logical consequence of several characteristics of opportunistic species (high vagility, rapid growth, early reproduction, high fecundity, and capacity to sustain high population densities that are conducive to the transmission of pathogens) that would facilitate the evolution and maintenance of pathogens. Further, decreases in the species diversity of potential host assemblages have been associated with increased prevalence of infection by zoonotic pathogens in host populations both for vector-borne diseases (
 <xref rid="b74-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Ostfeld and Keesing 2000</xref>) and for nonvector-borne zoonoses (
 <xref rid="b60-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Mills 2005</xref>). Thus, selective extinctions associated with climate change can result in a net increase in the risk of some zoonotic infections in both wildlife and humans.
