<p>Altitudinal temperature gradients are about 1,000 times steeper than latitudinal gradients (
 <xref rid="b20-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Colwell et al. 2008</xref>), which makes altitudinal transects more practical models for studying the effects of temperature change on plant and animal distributions. A recent range survey of small mammals in Yosemite National Park, California (USA), serves as a model (
 <xref rid="b65-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Moritz et al. 2008</xref>). Compared with similar surveys conducted approximately 100 years earlier (when minimum temperatures were 3°C lower), half of the 28 species monitored showed large (average = 500 m) upward changes in elevational limits (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ehp-118-1507">Figure 1</xref>). Low-altitude species shifted both their lower and upper range limits upslope (e.g., the piñon deer mouse, 
 <italic>Peromyscus truei</italic>) or expanded their upper range upslope while maintaining a stable lower range limit (e.g., the California pocket mouse, 
 <italic>Chaetodipus californicus</italic>). High-altitude species such as the alpine chipmunk (
 <italic>Tamias alpinus</italic>) showed overall range contractions because of upslope shifts in their lower limits. A continuation of this pattern suggests the ultimate extinction of some high-altitude species.
