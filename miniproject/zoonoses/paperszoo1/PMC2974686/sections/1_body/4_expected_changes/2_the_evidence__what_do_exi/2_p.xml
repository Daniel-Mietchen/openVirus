<p>The hispid cotton rat (
 <italic>Sigmodon hispidus</italic>), which occurs in the southern United States, is the host of Black Creek Canal hantavirus (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ehp-118-1507">Table 1</xref>), a known cause of HPS (
 <xref rid="b88-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Rollin et al. 1995</xref>) as well as Muleshoe hantavirus (
 <xref rid="b86-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Rawlings et al. 1996</xref>), and Tamiami arenavirus (
 <xref rid="b15-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Calisher et al. 1970</xref>). The distribution of the hispid cotton rat is climate limited, and precise temperature minima for the speciesâ€™ distributional limits have been described (
 <xref rid="b64-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Mohlhenrich 1961</xref>). Nevertheless, that distribution has undergone a northward expansion (

 <xref rid="b94-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Schmidly 2002</xref>) in the last few decades, and a new altitudinal record was described for hispid cotton rats in New Mexico (
 <xref rid="b24-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Dunnum 2002</xref>). The white-footed deer mouse (
 <italic>Peromyscus leucopus</italic>), a host for the agents of Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and HPS, has extended its range northward in Wisconsin (
 <xref rid="b55-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Long 1996</xref>) and Minnesota (
 <xref rid="b42-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Jannett et al. 2007</xref>). Hispid cotton rats and white-footed deer mice are common species in the United States and have been studied by generations of mammalogists. Little or no baseline data are available for the huge number of rodents in the tropics, the area where hosts (especially rodents and bats), vectors, and pathogens have their greatest diversity, yet they are the least studied [for a discussion of tropical disease diversity, rodents, and bats, see Supplemental Material (doi:10.1289/ehp.0901389)]. Known and unknown tropical host and pathogen systems are likely to shift their ranges closer to subtropical and temperate population centers as climate changes at higher latitudes.
