<p>Geographic changes in the distributions of wildlife species in response to climate change are difficult to document because of the absence of current and historic data on distributions of many species and populations (

 <xref rid="b101-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al. 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, range shifts have been observed for a variety of taxa, including important mammalian hosts and arthropod vectors. These range shifts have generally been poleward and upward (toward higher elevations) (

 <xref rid="b90-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Rosenzweig et al. 2007</xref>), and they have resulted in overall expansions, contractions, or no change in the total area occupied by a population or species. Altitudinal and latitudinal range shifts have occurred for

 <xref rid="b31-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Gage et al. 2008</xref>), and these shifts are associated with (“association” as used throughout this review is not proof of causation) new foci of disease and an increase in incidence of TBE (

 <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic>, a vector of Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis in North America. Models indicate that this species will extend its range farther into Canada while contracting its southern range (
