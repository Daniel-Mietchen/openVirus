<p>If climate change is to affect the frequency of VBZDs through acting on nonhuman hosts, vectors, and pathogens, it is likely to act by one (or a combination) of four primary mechanisms: 
 <italic>a</italic>) range shifts in host or vector distribution that bring these hosts and vectors into contact with new human populations; 
 <italic>b</italic>) changes in the population density of the host or vector that would result in increased or decreased frequency of contact with humans or with other hosts and vectors; 
 <italic>c</italic>) changes in the prevalence of infection by the pathogen in the host or vector population that would increase or decrease the frequency of human (or other host or vector) contact with an infected host or vector; and 
 <italic>d</italic>) changes in pathogen load brought about by changes in rates of pathogen reproduction, replication, or development in hosts or vectors that would affect the likelihood that a human (or other host or vector) contact would result in pathogen transmission.
