<p>The increases in host or vector populations discussed above can lead to increased frequency of contact between hosts or between hosts and vectors (density-dependent transmission) (
 <xref rid="b5-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Begon et al. 2002</xref>) and increased prevalence of infection in host or vector populations. The increased North American deer mouse population density in the southwestern United States that followed the 1997 ENSO was followed, a year later, by increased prevalence of hantavirus infection in North American deer mouse populations [

 <xref rid="b109-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Yates et al. 2002</xref>]. This delayed density-dependent increase in infection in host populations may be a general phenomenon affecting horizontally transmitted pathogens in wildlife hosts in strongly seasonal climates (
