<p>Recurrence of viral replication (recrudescence) under stress, including heat stress, has been documented for human viral diseases (

 <xref rid="b49-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Kuenzi et al. 2005</xref>). Although mechanisms for the reactivation of viral replication are poorly understood, stress-related immunosuppression has been suggested (

 <xref rid="b49-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Kuenzi et al. 2005</xref>). The relationship between stress and pathogen transmission, replication, persistence, and shedding in hosts and vectors is poorly studied. A clearer understanding of this relationship would lead to more accurate predictions of the effects of climate change on VBZD risk to humans.
