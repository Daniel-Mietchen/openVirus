<p>The effects of environmental extremes on vertebrate host populations can be pronounced. High summer temperatures have resulted in increased mortality of hosts, such as bats in tropical or subtropical areas (

 <xref rid="b99-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Straile and Stenseth 2007</xref>). After an ENSO event in 1997, investigators recorded increased rainfall, improved quality of vegetation, and increased population density of North American deer mice (
 <italic>Peromyscus maniculatus</italic>) in the southwestern United States. These events preceded increased numbers of HPS cases in the area over 3 years (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ehp-118-1507">Table 1</xref>) in the western United States was influenced by the effects of above-normal temperatures and status of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The PDO resulted in precipitation increases (
 <xref rid="b2-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Ari et al. 2008</xref>) that were believed to enhance small-mammal food resources and flea survival (

 <xref rid="b75-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Parmenter et al. 1999</xref>). Although less attention has been paid to decreases in host populations, lower rainfall is accompanied by decreasing populations of North American deer mice in the southwestern United States (
 <xref rid="b109-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Yates et al. 2002</xref>), whereas increasing rainfall during cold periods was associated with abrupt population declines in some ecosystems (
