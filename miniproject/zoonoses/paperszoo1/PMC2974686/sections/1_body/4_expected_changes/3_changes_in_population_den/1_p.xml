<p>Climate change has been associated with conditions that alter the carrying capacity of ecosystems for some plant or animal populations (

 <xref rid="b100-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Sutherst 2004</xref>). Such changes can result in dramatic increases, or sometimes decreases, in host or vector population densities. Examples from vector-borne diseases are numerous. Populations of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes (vector for the agent of Rift Valley fever in East Africa) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ehp-118-1507">Table 1</xref>) increase dramatically after periods of high rainfall associated with El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events (

 <xref rid="b54-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Linthicum et al. 1999</xref>). Increases in mosquitoes and mosquito-borne malaria were associated with ENSO events in South America (

 <xref rid="b11-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Bouma et al. 1997</xref>) and southern Africa (
 <xref rid="b56-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Mabaso et al. 2007</xref>). Increasing temperatures also can decrease the development time of mosquitoes allowing greater population densities to be reached (
 <xref rid="b31-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Gage et al. 2008</xref>). Increased incidence of malaria was linked to precipitation and higher temperatures in Kenya (
 <xref rid="b33-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Githeko and Ndegwa 2001</xref>) and Madagascar (
 <xref rid="b9-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Bouma 2003</xref>). Conversely, reduced rainfall in Senegal and Niger was associated with decreases in malaria (

 <xref rid="b66-ehp-118-1507" ref-type="bibr">Mouchet et al. 1996</xref>), presumably resulting from decreased mosquito reproduction.
