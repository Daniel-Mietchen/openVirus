<p>We have made several assumptions in our model. We have used status-based variables for tractability, simplifying the immune structure of the population. We have also imposed a one-dimensional strain structure on influenza evolution. Although this reflects the sequential appearance of strains implied by the ladder-like phylogenetic tree of influenza A [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C7">7</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C44">44</xref>], the causes of this phylogeny are likely to be complex, with several explanations having been proposed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C1">1</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C17">17</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C18">18</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C45">45</xref>] for the observed evolution. By using a simple line of strains, this paper does not address the issue of strain dimensionality. Instead, it assumes that, in the long term, through some mechanism not included here, strain evolution follows a one-dimensional path through antigenic space, with cross-reactivity between strains decaying exponentially as the distance between them increases.
