<p>As influenza vaccines are selected around nine months in advance of each hemisphere's annual winter epidemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C42">42</xref>], it would be interesting to see whether there is any indication in historical data that a particularly transmissible season elsewhere in those nine months leads to a higher rate of emergence of new strains, and hence a vaccine update. This may be possible in retrospect, but it would be difficult to monitor the transmissibility of a strain in real-time, with the aim of providing an indication of the level of drift to be expected, as the accuracy of transmissibility estimates are reduced by reporting errors and gaps in surveillance [
