<p>Like several status-based models, we have also assumed that cross-immunity acts to reduce transmission. We do not consider spatial structure, which may also affect how transmission rates impact on strain emergence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C12">12</xref>], nor seasonality: this paper presents a single population with influenza constantly circulating. Our parameters, although chosen to be plausible, are also approximate. In particular, mutation rates can affect the steepness of the drop-off: an increase leads to easier emergence and a slightly flatter relationship, whereas a slower rate hinders the appearance of new strains and accentuates the drop (results not shown). Further, the mechanism of fitness loss and regain, via compensatory mutation, is necessarily approximate: a better understanding, ideally quantitative, of how antigenic escape might incur a fitness cost is needed if the effects of evolutionary constraints are to be modelled more accurately. If it was the case that the process of emergence involved several mutations, we would expect that the
