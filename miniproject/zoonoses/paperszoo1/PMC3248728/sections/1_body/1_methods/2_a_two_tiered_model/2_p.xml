<p>A first approach to adding fitness costs to a multi-strain model, suggested by Gog [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C19">19</xref>], was to take the one-dimensional line of strains used in many previous models [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C16">16</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C30">30</xref>] and extend it to a two-dimensional space. Each variant had an intrinsic fitness, as well as an antigenic type (which changed in one direction). Mutation to a new antigenic type caused a reduction in fitness, and compensatory mutations were included so that strains can also regain fitness lost. A simple stochastic approximation was included; a test was imposed on new strains present in less than one individual to ensure that they did not emerge automatically. This meant that stochastic effects were present in a basic way, although the approximation had some drawbacks, which will be discussed here.
