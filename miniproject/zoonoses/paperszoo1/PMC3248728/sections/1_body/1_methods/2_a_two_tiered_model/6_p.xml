<p>A discrete-time deterministic model of infection at the population level forms the top tier; this is described in ยง2
 <italic>c</italic>. Mutation to a lower fitness strain occurs at a constant rate but the actual emergence of new strains, including compensatory mutation, is dictated by the bottom tier: a stochastic approximation, which has boiled down the details of emergence to a simpler process. This is outlined in ยง2
 <italic>b</italic>, and allows calculation of the probability that the new strain appears and causes an epidemic. This probability is then used in the top tier of the model as a test of the viability of a new strain appearing at each point in time.
