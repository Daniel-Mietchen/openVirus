<p>Let 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> be the number of individuals infected with the new strain. If large numbers are infective with the dominant strain, even a low rate of mutation will lead immediately to 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 1. Hence it circumvents the stochastic test, and means a possible ‘overspill’ effect, whereby a circulating strain can prop up its weaker mutant, allowing it to persist long enough to undergo a compensatory mutation, despite the fact that would not necessarily survive if both fitness loss and compensation were modelled as a branching process. Conversely, if 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &lt; 1 always, as can happen when the dominant strain is endemic at low numbers, the stochastic test will not allow the weaker mutation to ever emerge if it has 
 <italic>R</italic> &lt; 1. However, it has been shown that if emergence is modelled stochastically, infections with 
 <italic>R</italic> &lt; 1 may still survive long enough to subsequently undergo a compensatory mutation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C19">19</xref>], is that, for 
 <italic>χ</italic> = 1, there are still two versions of each strain circulating, whereas ideally the two-dimensional space should collapse to a one-dimensional line as 
 <italic>χ</italic> approaches 1, and revert to a simple drift model similar to that of Gog &amp; Grenfell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C16">16</xref>].
