<p>As in Gog [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C19">19</xref>], unrealistic strain survival is avoided by setting any strain that decreases in prevalence to 
 <italic>I</italic> &lt; 1, with an 
 <italic>R</italic> &lt; 1, equal to zero. This avoids the decay to infinitesimal levels (i.e. attostrains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C37">37</xref>]), and potential re-emergence, which can occur in purely deterministic systems.
