<p>Although we have two routes to emergence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20111168F1">figureÂ 1</xref>), and hence two possible values of 
 <italic>R</italic> for 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>a</italic>+1
 </sub>, it is reasonable to assume that if the virus does cause an epidemic, its numbers will end up sufficiently large for it to undergo the compensatory mutation during this epidemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C26">26</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C36">36</xref>]. 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>a</italic>+1
 </sub> therefore represents individuals infective with the full fitness strain.
