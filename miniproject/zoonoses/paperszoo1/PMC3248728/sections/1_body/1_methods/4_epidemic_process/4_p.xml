<p>A moving strain space, as outlined by Gog [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C19">19</xref>], is also used to hasten computation. At each point in time all strains with 
 <italic>I</italic> &gt; 0 are identified. By the nature of mutation in the model, these cluster together and hence form a set of adjacent strains on our line. This set is active in the model, in that the above equations only use the variables corresponding to these prevalent strains. We update this active set at each time step. If the backmost (i.e. least recent) strain in the set falls below one infective, then we drop that variable, and if a new strain appears (see ยง2
 <italic>b</italic>), we add new variables. There is also a buffer in practice: if a new strain emerges, we create variables associated to the next strain on the line, in anticipation of its emergence.
