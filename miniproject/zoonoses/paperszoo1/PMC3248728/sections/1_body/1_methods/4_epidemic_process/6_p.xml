<p>This approximation underestimates immunity (in the form of reduced transmissibility) slightly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C19">19</xref>]; this could affect accuracy under a high mutation rate, as more frequent appearance of mutants would mean that the strain space moves faster. However, it is less of an issue for rates similar to those considered in this paper.
