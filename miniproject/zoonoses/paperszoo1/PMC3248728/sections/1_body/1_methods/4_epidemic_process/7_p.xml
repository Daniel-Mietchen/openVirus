<p>Drift speed, used to measure the speed of evolution in our model, is defined as the rate of emergence: the mean number of strains that appear per year, over twenty 50-year simulations. If the system goes extinct, we only look at the behaviour up to the point of extinction. Over many runs, this rate approaches a fixed value for each

 <sub>0</sub> and

 <italic>χ</italic> ∈ [0.6,1], however, as below these values a tendency to lock or go extinct reduces the accuracy of the mean.
