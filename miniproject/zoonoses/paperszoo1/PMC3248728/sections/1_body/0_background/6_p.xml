<p>In studies

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C22">22</xref>]. If random mutation carries a fitness cost, there is a possibility that mutations associated with antigenic change also affect the phenotype in some other way, reducing viral fitness of antigenic escape mutants through antagonistic pleiotropy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C23">23</xref>]. Alternatively, or additionally, ‘deleterious hitchhikers’—mutations elsewhere on the genome that happen to be picked up in the process of emergence of the antigenic escape mutant—could have a negative effect (M. Lässig 2011, personal communication). The ill-fated side branches of influenza's evolutionary tree could be the result of costs incurred by either mechanism (M. Lässig 2011, personal communication; [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C25">25</xref>]; this ongoing antigenic mutation and survival could be possible through subsequent compensatory mutations [
