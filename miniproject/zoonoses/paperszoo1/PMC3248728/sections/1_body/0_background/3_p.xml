<p>Transmissibility, or more specifically the basic reproductive ratio 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, the average number of secondary cases generated by the average infective individual in a na√Øve population, has been much studied for influenza [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C9">9</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C10">10</xref>]. The probability that a strain will become established is determined by its effective reproductive ratio, which depends on 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and the level of population immunity. Seasons in which H3N2 was the dominant subtype have been associated with a higher effective reproductive ratio [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C11">11</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C12">12</xref>]; there are also typically more deaths from pneumonia and influenza in seasons where H3N2 is the dominant strain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C13">13</xref>]. Transmissibility must be therefore considered as a possible mechanism behind the difference in antigenic drift speeds between the two subtypes.
