 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C19">19</xref>] developed a simple model of these processes to show that a high-level fitness loss could in fact stop viral evolution (‘strain lock’), and that vaccination could also nudge the system into this state. In this paper, a two-tier framework is used to separate the interaction of strains via population immunity, modelled deterministically, and the emergence of new strains, treated as a stochastic process. This improves the realism of the fitness loss and compensatory mutation processes, and makes the model computationally far more tractable, allowing the examination of a variety of assumptions.
