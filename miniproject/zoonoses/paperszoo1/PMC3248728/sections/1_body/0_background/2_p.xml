<p>The two influenza A subtypes common in humans, H1N1 and H3N2, frequently escape population immunity by changing their antigenic properties. Between 1983 and 2009, H3N2 fixed more amino acid changes in antigenic sites than H1N1 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C4">4</xref>], and vaccines against H3N2 were updated more often than vaccines against H1N1 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C6">6</xref>]. The higher rate of appearance and fixation of non-synonymous mutations in H3N2 could be owing to a combination of factors, presumably including effective virus population size, and selective pressures according to host prior immunity. However, the root cause of the epidemiological and evolutionary differences between subtypes of influenza in humans remains poorly understood [
