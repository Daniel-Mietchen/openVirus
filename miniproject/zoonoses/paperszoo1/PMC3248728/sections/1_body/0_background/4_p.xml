<p>One strain of influenza may confer partial immunity to another [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C14">14</xref>], and multi-strain models can be used to study the evolutionary dynamics of the disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C15">15</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C17">17</xref>]. Here, we define a new strain to be a virus in which the surface proteins have undergone sufficient change, as a result of mutation, to affect people who were previously immune to it. We will use such a model to examine the role that transmission plays in the emergence of new strains.
