<p>When 20 per cent of the population is vaccinated, the rate of emergence of the strain with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 1.6 is slowed much more than that of the one with

 <sub>0</sub> = 2. Taking the mean from 200 runs,

 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> makes little difference when 
 <italic>χ</italic> = 1, for 
 <italic>χ</italic> &lt; 1, the infection with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 2 can be far harder to control.
