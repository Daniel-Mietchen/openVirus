<p>This is because, for a strain with reduced fitness 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> barely above 1, vaccination can lower susceptibility and put 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> below 1, and on the slow side of the drop-off. If 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 1.6, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> = 
 <italic>Ï‡</italic>
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>
 <italic>S</italic>/
 <italic>N</italic> falls into this region. By contrast, with a small increase in transmissibility (in this case 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 2), 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> is far enough from 1 so as to be far less affected by vaccination. Even a 20 per cent reduction in the number of susceptibles is not enough to push the strain into the area of the drop-off, showing how 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> has become disproportionately important.
