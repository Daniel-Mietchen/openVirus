<p>Such a result is not possible for a stochastic system of equations, but using 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 
 <italic>β</italic>/
 <italic>γ</italic>, we can compare the above theoretical result with the speed observed in our model (using the same values of 
 <italic>γ</italic>, 
 <italic>μ</italic> and 
 <italic>m</italic>). Simulations were run for several values of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, with the model deliberately started in a drifting state, and calculated rate of emergence over twenty 50-year runs. This gives a measure of the speed of antigenic drift.
