<p>However, when fitness costs are introduced we see something quite different. The left-hand side of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20111168F3">figure 3</xref> shows that when 
 <italic>χ</italic> &lt; 1, the impact of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> can become nonlinear. A drop-off appears, along which small changes in transmission can have a disproportionate effect on the speed at which strains appear. Moreover, at the base of this ‘drift cliff’, the relationship is much flatter, and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> has even less effect on evolution than it did at when there were no fitness constraints.
