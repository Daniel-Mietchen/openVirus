<p>In a manner similar to that of Gog [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20111168C19">19</xref>], our model exhibits three dynamical behaviours: 
 <italic>locked</italic>, where only one strain circulates; 
 <italic>drifting</italic>, with the continuing emergence of strains; and 
 <italic>extinction</italic>, where no strains remain. Once drift is established, the system is more likely to continue drifting than switch to the other two, especially when 
 <italic>χ</italic> is larger. As 
 <italic>χ</italic> is reduced, a drifting system will have an increasing tendency to fall into a locked state, or go extinct.
