 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20111168F2">Figure 2</xref> shows that the qualitative relationship between 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and speed of emergence is very similar, with the rate of emergence dependent on 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> ∈ [1.4,3] in a near-linear way. Although the model presented in this paper evolves at a slower rate, this is most probably owing to the stochastic step that tempers emergence.
