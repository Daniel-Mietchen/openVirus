<p>However, in our model, 
 <italic>S</italic> is not fixed because immunity to each strain varies, and depends heavily on other circulating infection. Therefore, we can only estimate this relationship between 
 <italic>χ</italic> and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>. Simulations show that susceptibility 
 <italic>S</italic> to new strains falls between 0.75 and 0.9, so, by finding the region where 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>
 <italic>S</italic>/
 <italic>N</italic> &lt; 1, this can be used to estimate the location of the drop-off in the rate of emergence. The right-hand side of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20111168F3">figure 3</xref> shows that this theoretical result agrees with the simulated behaviour, and hence provides an explanation for the location of the drop-off in emergence.
