<p>We can elucidate this result by considering the role of the stochastic step in the rate of emergence. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20111168F4">Figure 4</xref> shows the probability a strain emerges for a particular effective reproductive ratio, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> = 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>
 <italic>S</italic>/
 <italic>N</italic>, equal to 1 − 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> in equation (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="RSPB20111168M2.3">2.3</xref>). As 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> decreases towards 1, it becomes less likely a new strain will emerge at that step. If 
 <italic>S</italic> were fixed this would imply that, for each 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, there is a critical value of 
 <italic>χ</italic> below which the appearance of strains is relatively rare. Although a subsequent compensatory mutation and emergence event can still occur, as shown by the solid line in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20111168F4">figure 4</xref>, this is rare for 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> &lt; 1 and the long wait for the appearance of a new strain slows down the rate of emergence.
