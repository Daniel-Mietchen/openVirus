<p>We describe annual AIV epidemics in BHGU colonies. These epidemics were caused by AIV subtypes H13 and H16 and occurred in FY birds during the second half of the breeding season, with prevalence rates of up to 72% per week. On most sampling days, infected and noninfected FY birds had similar body conditions, suggesting H13 and H16 viruses are nonpathogenic for BHGU. These findings broaden our view on AIV dynamics in populations of gull species often closely associated with humans and facilitate more targeted sampling of colonial nesting waterbirds. Further research is needed to show if the same AIV dynamics apply to other gull species and other geographic areas and to clarify the epidemiology of AIV in wild birds and factors that influence emergence of influenza in domestic animals and humans.</p>
