<p>Outside the breeding season, AIV prevalence was much lower, and no H13 or H16 viruses were isolated; AIV were exclusively isolated from AFY birds and were typed as H1N3, H7N1, and H11N9 (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, a single H5 virus was detected by using H5 RT-PCR in an AFY gull sampled in December 2006. H13 viruses have been isolated from ring-billed gulls (

 </xref>). The lack of detection of H13 and H16 viruses in BHGU outside the breeding season in our study provides no support for virus circulation at low prevalence in overwintering FY birds. Our sample size of FY birds sampled outside the breeding season (n = 1,200) may be around the theoretical limit to detect the presence of these viruses in the population, assuming a virus prevalence of 0.5% in a homogeneously distributed population (

 </xref>). However, a nonhomogeneous BHGU population structure outside the breeding season might support a situation in which susceptible FY gulls are present year-round and thus facilitate the circulation of AIV throughout the year at an even lower prevalence.
