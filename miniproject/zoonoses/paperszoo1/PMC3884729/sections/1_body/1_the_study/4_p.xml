<p>Body condition did not differ notably between virus-positive and virus-negative FY birds sampled on the same day (p&gt;0.05, Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon test), except for during the third week of July during 2009 (p = 0.046) and 2010 (p = 0.0004), when virus-positive birds had lower body condition. This suggests that, overall, H13 and H16 virus infections are nonpathogenic for BHGU. Previous studies found no clinical signs (
