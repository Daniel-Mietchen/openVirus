<p>Our results showed that AIV epidemics in black-headed gulls occurred annually during June and July, with a peak monthly prevalence of 47% during 2008 (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). These epidemics were detected in FY birds only and were limited to subtypes H13 and H16; subtype H13 and H16 viruses represented 100% of all virus isolates and 55% of RT-PCR positive birds. In contrast, no AIVs were detected in 524 AFY birds sampled during the breeding season. Annual epidemics were detected in 2 of 3 colonies sampled annually during 2008–2010 (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). More detailed investigation on Griend showed that, although H13 and H16 viruses were detected each year, H13 was the only (2008, 2009) or predominant (2010) subtype detected on the first day of virus detection of each breeding season (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). In 2008 and 2009, H16 was detected the next sampling day, which was 1–2 weeks later. H16 was or became the predominant subtype during 2008–2010; H13 prevalence decreased during that period. The source of H13 and H16 viruses causing these epidemics is unknown. Possible sources are breeding or nonbreeding BHGU, other gull species at the colony sites, and freshwater ponds (if present) at the colony sites. Nonbreeding BHGU tend to wander among colony sites. BHGU that breed north of the Netherlands arrive in the Netherlands from July 1 onwards (F. Majoor, unpub. data).
