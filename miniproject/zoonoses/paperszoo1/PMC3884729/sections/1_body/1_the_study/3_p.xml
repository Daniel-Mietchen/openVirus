<p>Results from Griend also showed that these epidemics occurred after onset of fledging. The first detection of AIV on Griend (during the last week of June 2008, the first week July 2009, and mid-July 2010) occurred 1â€“3 weeks after onset of fledging. Also, of 871 FY birds, AIV was detected only in FY birds with an average length of &lt;200 mm, above which they are considered to be fledged (

Possible explanations for timing of the epidemic could be increased mobility after fledging and, therefore, increased contact rate; access to water, facilitating more efficient virus transmission; and increased susceptibility of fledglings as a result of immature body condition and loss of maternal antibodies.
