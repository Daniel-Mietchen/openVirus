<p>Black-headed gulls (n = 7,511) were sampled year-round at multiple locations in the Netherlands during 2006–2010. Birds were captured by hand, leg-noose, or clap net; then, we determined their sex and age (first-year [FY] bird: nestling, fledgling; after first-year [AFY] bird) and weighed them. During the breeding season (April–July), 2,839 FY and 524 AFY birds were sampled at colony breeding sites. Three breeding sites were monitored annually during 2008–2010: Griend, De Kreupel, and Veluwemeer. At Griend, BHGU breeding success was also measured and used to compare breeding chronology to timing of infection (

Cloacal and oropharyngeal swab samples were collected from each bird and tested for AIV by using matrix (M)–specific reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and, if positive, for H5 and H7 subtypes by using hemagglutinin (HA)–specific RT-PCR. Virus culture was attempted on all M RT-PCR–positive samples by egg inoculation. Virus isolates were classified to HA subtype by hemagglutination inhibition assay and to neuraminidase (NA) subtype by using RT-PCR (

Additional analyses on AIV prevalence among male versus female birds, dead versus live birds, recaptured birds, and capture bias were performed (online Technical Appendix).
