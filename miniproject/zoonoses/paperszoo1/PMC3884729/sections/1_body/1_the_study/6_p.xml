<p>Prevalence of anti-AIV antibodies detected in FY birds sampled outside the breeding season was statistically more significant (15/59 [25.4%]) than in FY birds sampled during the breeding season (4/75 [5.3%]) (p&lt;0.01, Fisher exact test). The 4 seropositive FY birds were fledglings (n = 55); nestlings (n = 20) were seronegative. There was no statistically significant difference in the seropositivity of AFY gulls sampled during (40/101 [39.6%]) and outside (45/113 [39.8%]) the breeding season (p&gt;0.05, Fisher exact test). These results suggest that FY birds during the breeding season are the most susceptible category to become infected with AIV.</p>
