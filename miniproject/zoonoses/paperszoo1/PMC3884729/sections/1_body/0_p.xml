<p>Wild waterbirds of the orders Anseriformes (ducks, geese, swans) and Charadriiformes (gulls, terns, shore birds) are the ultimate source of influenza A viruses for domestic birds and mammals, including humans (

 </xref>). Knowledge of the epidemiology of these avian influenza viruses (AIVs) among wild waterbirds is necessary to improve surveillance and better clarify underlying factors in host-switching of AIV. Epidemiology of AIV in wild waterbirds has been studied mainly among ducks (order Anseriformes) (

 </xref>) but is poorly known among gulls, despite their abundance and close association with humans (
