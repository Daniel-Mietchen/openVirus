  <p>Avian influenza virus prevalence among 7,511 black-headed gulls, the Netherlands, 2006â€“2010. Cloacal and oropharyngeal samples were collected once from each gull for virus detection. Influenza virus subtypes detected are shown above virus positives. Bars indicate virus prevalence (No. PCR-positive samples/no. gulls sampled per month). Black bars represent gulls in their first year (FY) of life, comprising nestling and fledgling stages; gray bars represent after-first year (AFY) gulls.</p>
