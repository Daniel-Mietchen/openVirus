<p>Estimating the contribution of human-to-human transmission of LASV and related patterns of transmission (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> existence of super-spreaders) is of fundamental importance when considering risk assessment and control of LF and related diseases such as the one caused by the arenavirus, Lujo virus 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003398-Briese1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, not least because LF is one of the more common haemorrhagic fevers exported from endemic areas

 <xref rid="pntd.0003398-Beeching1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In addition, perceiving LF as essentially a zoonotic disease only acquired from rodents with little or no infection arising from human beings, may have prevented investigations of the role, if any, of human-to-rodent transmission (i.e. spillback) in the epidemiology of LF.
