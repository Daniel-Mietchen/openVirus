<p>The current model is based on the assumption that the distribution of the generation times observed in the extra-nosocomial outbreak is representative of the generation times in the Sierra Leonean situations. This is probably reasonable, but public health measures may impact on this in the future. The predictions are based on the assumption of uniform mixing, 
 <italic>i.e.</italic> each case from KGH is potentially in contact with each other case. Although this is a reasonable assumption, considering the large human mobility in Sierra Leone, for livelihoods, work and trade, social visits and events

Although the two factors might compensate for each other, if KGH could reduce reporting bias and increase information on network contacts, it would be highly beneficial to studies such as this, especially as human mobility and overcrowding has been associated with an amplification of LF
