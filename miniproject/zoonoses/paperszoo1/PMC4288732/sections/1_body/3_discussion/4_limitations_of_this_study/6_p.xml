<p>The basis of our work is that, to the best of our knowledge, the nosocomial and extra-nosocomial outbreaks in Jos and Zorzor were instances of pure human-to-human chains. This is a message too important to be neglected. Despite some improvement in the implementation of barrier nursing in hospital structures, there is no evidence that in the last decades prophylactic measures have significantly changed in ordinary situations as in households and villages, and this issue has been abundantly clear during the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa. It is therefore reasonable that chains of human-to-human transmission, like the extra-nosocomial outbreak that occurred in Jos more than 40 years ago are much more common than expected.</p>
