<p>The estimations here are based on the assumption that probability of cross-species transmission occurs at random throughout outbreaks, although these events are expected to be strongly driven by a multitude of interacting causes, including ecological (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> seasonality in the abundance of the reservoir), epidemiological (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> seasonality in the prevalence of the pathogen), genetic variation (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> broad set of pathogen life histories) and socio-economic (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> the practice of burning the fields after harvesting affecting the ecology and dispersal patterns of 
 <italic>M. natalensis</italic>) factors.
