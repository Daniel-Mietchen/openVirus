<p>Disentangling the contribution of different hosts in spreading a zoonotic, emerging disease is a key challenge for determining effective, proportionate public health and safety measures. Such a conundrum has steered a scientific debate on LF, which appears to fluctuate around whether or not human-to-human transmission plays a major role compared to rodent-to-human transmission. The current work reconciles these two opposing paradigms. Here, we adopted a relatively simple mathematical approach to analyze data of hospitalized patients in KGH, Sierra Leone. The daily mean effective reproduction numbers,

 </inline-formula>, observed in the nosocomial outbreaks (only human-to-human transmission) are much larger, and thus incompatible, with the ones estimated from the data from KGH, even if we assume

  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pntd.0003398.e286.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula> human-to-human transmission. If we regard the extra-nosocomial cases observed in the Jos outbreak as representative of disease transmission in an endemic area, then a significant proportion of LF cases (

 </inline-formula>) arise from human-to-human transmission. A significant proportion of these secondary cases, however, are attributable to a few events with disproportionately large effective reproduction numbers: super-spreading events. In general, the distributions of the individual reproductive number,

  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pntd.0003398.e289.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula>, exhibits a tail heavier than the exponential or Poisson distributions, here used as benchmarks for thin-tailed distributions. This reveal over-dispersion indicating the presence of super-spreading events.
