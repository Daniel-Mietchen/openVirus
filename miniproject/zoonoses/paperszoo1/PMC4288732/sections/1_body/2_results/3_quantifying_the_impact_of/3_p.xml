 </inline-formula> from KGH with an exponential and a log-normal distribution. The observed KGH distribution is ‘fatter’ than the corresponding exponential fit, although not as heavy as the log-normal. Furthermore we fitted two standard discrete distributions, the Poisson, representative of thin-tailed distributions, and the negative-binomial, representative of fat-tailed distributions, with the distribution for the integer part (as we are considering discrete distributions) of
