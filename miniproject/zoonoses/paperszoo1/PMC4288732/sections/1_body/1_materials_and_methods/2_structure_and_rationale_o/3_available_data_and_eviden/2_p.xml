KGH is the only health facility in Sierra Leone where people can be diagnosed and treated for suspected LF. The hospital facilities include an isolation ward specifically for LF patients with a highly trained clinical staff equipped with appropriate personal protective equipment. KGH records provide hospitalized patient data (day of admission, day of discharge, etc.) for suspected and confirmed cases of LF, divided by age, gender, ethnic group, location and other factors
