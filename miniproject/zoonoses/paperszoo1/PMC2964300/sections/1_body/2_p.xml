<p>VBDs are easily targeted for cutbacks in public health funding because their incidence, prevalence, morbidity, and associated mortality are routinely underestimated. Their impact is not adequately captured by current disease burden assessments, and therefore VBDs are often not included in top-level discussions of disease-control priorities

In the absence of a proactive surveillance system that provides valid national and regional data on VBD transmission, outbreak epidemiology would likely be done by “official denial”, and subsequent public health responses would likely be poorly managed and of limited effectiveness
