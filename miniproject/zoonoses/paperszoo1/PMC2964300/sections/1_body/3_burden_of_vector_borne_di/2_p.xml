<p>Similarly, arthropod-borne viral infections, or arboviral infections, are common causes of disabling fever syndromes worldwide. These often progress to complications such as encephalitis or hemorrhagic fever, which result in severe long-term physical and cognitive impairment, or in early death

The majority of these (21,277) were neuroinvasive disease, a statistic that reflects the serious underreporting of mild cases of WNV–associated disease. Several other menacing arboviruses are considered to be “emerging pathogens”, based on their recent geographic spread and their increasing impact on susceptible human populations

The US is now threatened by the potential emergence of public health threats such as Rift Valley fever and chikungunya virus, which could easily establish themselves within our ecosystems. The recent emergence of dengue in Texas (2005) and Florida (2009–2010) demonstrates our continuing vulnerability to such arboviral pathogens
