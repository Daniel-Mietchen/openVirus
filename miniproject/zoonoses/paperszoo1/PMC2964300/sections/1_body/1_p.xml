<p>Many organizations, including the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, the Infectious Disease Society of America, the American Society for Microbiology, the American Red Cross, and others, appealed to restore funding for the DVBID program. At the end of July, the Senate restored this funding completely at US$26.7 million in their version of the FY 2011 appropriations bill, and currently we are waiting for the House to reveal its version. It is our hope that after reconciling the two bills, DVBID program funding will be completely restored.</p>
