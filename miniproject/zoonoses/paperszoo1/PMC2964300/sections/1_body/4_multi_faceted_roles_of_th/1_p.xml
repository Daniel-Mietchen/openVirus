<p>The Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases program supports work on agents such as WNV, plague, tularemia, yellow fever, Lyme disease, dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, and other arboviral encephalitides. The mission of the division is to 1) develop and maintain effective surveillance for vector-borne viral and bacterial agents and their arthropod vectors; 2) conduct field and laboratory research and epidemic aid investigations; 3) define disease etiology, ecology, and pathogenesis in order to develop improved methods and strategies for disease diagnosis, surveillance, prevention, and control; 4) provide diagnostic reference and epidemiologic consultation, on request, to state and local health departments, other components of the CDC, other federal agencies, and national and international health organizations; and 5) provide intramural and extramural technical expertise and assistance in professional training activities

In addition, the program maintains vital expertise for other vector-borne infectious diseases that occur only sporadically or in periodic epidemics. The DVBID program integrates local, state, and national labs to create and maintain national and regional data that lead to quick identification of the causes of outbreaks and rapid, effective response.
