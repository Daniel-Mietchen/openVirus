<p>Not only does DVBID provide state, national, and international support for surveillance of threatening VBDs, it also creates opportunities for training, cutting edge research, and new control methodologies. The program currently allocates about half of its budget to state epidemiology programs to track and control VBDs. The surveillance that DVBID supports in local and state health departments allows for the estimation of prevalence and incidence data that funnels to other crucial programs, such as safety testing of our blood supply. In addition to tracking diseases that are currently circulating, the DVBID program also provides the infrastructure and expertise to identify emerging or new pathogens. As such, it is part of our first line of defense against the accidental or intentional introduction of biodefense pathogens such as plague, tularemia, typhus, dengue, and many other viral hemorrhagic fevers and encephalitides.</p>
