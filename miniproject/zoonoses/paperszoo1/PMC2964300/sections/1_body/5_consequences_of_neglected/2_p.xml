<p>The proposed cut in this program would also lead to significant delays in outbreak response and the identification of new pathogens. This, in turn, would result in unnecessary costs and patient harm when VBD outbreaks occur. In this issue of 
 <italic>PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases</italic>, Vazquez-Prokopec and colleagues show us that the costs of surveillance are far lower than the costs of delayed outbreak response, even without considering the costs of infection-related deaths and disability 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000847-VazquezProkopec1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Because many VBDs are also zoonoses, cuts in control would also place animal health in jeopardy. For example, if Rift Valley fever virus is imported to the US, livestock, wildlife, and humans will all be affected. The monetary cuts would lead to irreplaceable cuts in expertise and human capital and lead to delayed recognition of new VBDs. Research in new diagnostics, prevention, and control efforts would also be decimated, undoubtedly with major global repercussions.
