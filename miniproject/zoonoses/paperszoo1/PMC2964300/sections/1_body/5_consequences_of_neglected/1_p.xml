Funding cuts would dismantle the current system and erase the effects of the US$200 million and human capital that has already been invested in the DVBID program. The CDC estimates this cut could lead to job losses for 100 state and 24 CDC employees and devastate the CDC's Dengue Branch in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which also acts as a World Health Organization (WHO) reference center.

As a result, the American public would become more vulnerable to some of the most threatening emerging and reemerging diseases of our time.
