<p>We have witnessed the devastation these infections can inflict on healthy children in the US and abroad. As the world becomes increasingly networked through globalization, and as climate change continues to modify vector distribution and abundance worldwide, infections that were once contained in remote tropical locations, such as Japanese encephalitis and Rift Valley fever, are likely to spread to new areas. Just as WNV emerged in the US in 1999, other arboviral pathogens will escape control to infect large susceptible populations

Continuing public health surveillance for VBDs and continuing vector control (outside the standard health care delivery systems) are crucial to preventing these diseases and the morbidity and mortality that they cause. The benefits of continued (and improved) surveillance for VBDs are undeniable.
