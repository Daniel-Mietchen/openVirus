<p>Control is the only way to stop these infections from emerging, and in order to control these infections, we need to know where they are circulating. In the past five years, dengue virus has spread along the Texas and Florida borders, and is expanding rapidly in Puerto Rico. Meanwhile, WNV continues to cause severe neurological disease across America. Other persistent VBDs, including La Crosse virus in the Midwest and Eastern equine encephalitis in Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Georgia, and Louisiana, have caused significant outbreaks this year. Although the numbers appear small by national health statistics, they are kept small by the persistence and focus of the DVBID surveillance program (

Any one of these infections could result in a major, multi-state outbreak if weather conditions were favorable and control wasn't immediate and effective. To appropriately address VBDs, the US requires an energetic infrastructure for detection, diagnosis, response, and prevention at the national, state, and local levels.
