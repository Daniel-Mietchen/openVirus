<p>As new diseases emerge and old diseases reemerge, we believe that the government should actually increase the budget for the DVBID. The old dictum states that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. In no other part of the nation's health system is this truer than with regard to VBDs. No treatments exist for many of these infections, and vaccines are under development for only a few VBDs, such as WNV and dengue. Therefore, surveillance and vector control remain our only practical tools for prevention of disease. Continued development of vaccines for VBDs should remain a priority. Evidence suggests that a recent surge in global yellow fever cases has been due to the decline in mosquito control and yellow fever virus vaccination efforts. This fact highlights the tenuous hold we maintain over these infections, and draws attention to the immediate increase in disease burden that should be expected from any lack of persistent focus on surveillance and control
