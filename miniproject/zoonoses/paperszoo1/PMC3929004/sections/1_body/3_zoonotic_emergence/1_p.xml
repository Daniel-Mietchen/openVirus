 <bold>Pathogen:</bold> there are 1400 known human pathogens, the majority (60%) of which are transmitted to humans zoonotically and depend on an animal reservoir for their survival. An additional smaller proportion (5–10%) is environmentally transmitted, and the remainder consists of pathogens that can be maintained by an exclusively human-to-human transmission cycle. Among emerging infections, the proportion of zoonotic infections is even higher (73%), indicating that the human–animal interface presents a risk for emergence.
