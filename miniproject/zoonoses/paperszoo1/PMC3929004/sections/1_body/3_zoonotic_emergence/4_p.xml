 </xref> Based on data from 1940 onwards, the hotspots for emergence of infectious diseases were mapped for zoonotic infections from wildlife and domestic animals, and for drug-resistant and vector-borne organisms. 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows that these hotspots are primarily located in South and South East Asia, South and Central America and Subsaharan Africa.
