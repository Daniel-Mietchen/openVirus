<p>The emergence of novel zoonotic pathogens is appealing to the imagination and draws plenty of popular and scientific media attention, but does not necessarily represent the largest threat from infectious diseases. There is a rapid and increasing spread of antimicrobial drug resistance among bacteria and other pathogens, and the development of novel antimicrobial agents has almost come to a stop because drug companies do not consider them profitable: a combination that may set us back to the pre-antibiotic era. Drug resistance is a threat not only to the successful treatment of HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, but also, increasingly, of hospital- and community-acquired infections from ‘normal’ Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Failure of vaccination programmes because of bad press or religious conviction in developed countries can cause re-emergence of highly infectious viruses, such as those that cause measles or rubella, within years, as has happened in the UK and the Netherlands. Global food production and distribution processes may give rise to widely disseminated foodborne infections that are hard to tackle, as with

Finally, in South East Asia, while H5N1 and H7N9 influenza viruses attract most international attention, hand, foot and mouth disease, caused by the exclusively human pathogen, enterovirus 71, is now associated annually with hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations of children under 5, with a mortality of around 0.1%,
