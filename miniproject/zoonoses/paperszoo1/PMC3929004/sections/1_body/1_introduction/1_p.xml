Since then, the ongoing antimicrobial resistance development among many different pathogens, the continuous emergence of (mostly) viruses with potential for human-to-human or pandemic spread, the intentional release of pathogens as terrorist weapons and the heated debates about experiments to make avian influenza viruses transmissible in ferrets are continuously reminding us that infectious diseases are far from dull.
