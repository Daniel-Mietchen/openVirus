<p>For daily medical practice it is important for doctors, and especially infectious disease physicians, to be aware of events of emergence and countries where processes of emergence and species-jumping are occurring (e.g. by subscribing to ProMED, WHO influenza update or others). It is crucial that for each patient the history should include a travel history, which involves more than asking merely for the name of the country that a patient has visited. In the end, despite sophisticated surveillance programmes, it is usually an astute clinician who, after having seen or heard one or two extraordinary patient histories, makesÂ the connection and sees the first signs of an event of emergence.</p>
