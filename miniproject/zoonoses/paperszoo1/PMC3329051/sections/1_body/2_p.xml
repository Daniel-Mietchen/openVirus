<p>The California sea otter, a subspecies named on federal lists of threatened species, is found only along the central coast of California. More than 40% of California sea otter deaths are attributed to infectious agents, including some more typically associated with terrestrial animal and human disease, such as 
 <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>. Brain infection with 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> has been documented to cause significant numbers of sea otter deaths in California. Growing evidence supports a land-sea connection associated with contamination of the coastal environment, and the source of infection to sea otters.
