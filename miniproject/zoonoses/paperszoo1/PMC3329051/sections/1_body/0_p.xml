<p>Seventy-five percent of emerging infectious diseases are transmitted from animals to humans. The panel focused on different factors that have caused transmission from animals to humans for four diseases in recent years. The monkeypox infections in humans in the United States in 2003 were the first introduction of the disease into a human population outside Africa. This outbreak resulted from expanded global commerce and travel involving exotic rodents. Humans were infected through contact with ill pet prairie dogs, which had been housed with exotic rodents imported from Africa in April 2003. Laboratory evidence suggested that multiple species of imported rodents were infected, including rope squirrels, Gambian rats, and dormice. Through testing by classic laboratory methods and newer nucleic acid, real-time polymerase chain reaction methods, ultimately 37 human cases were identified. The disease in U.S. patients differed from that previously described in human outbreaks in Zaire/Democratic Republic of Congo. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration enacted a ban on importation of African rodents and distribution of prairie dogs in the United States to prevent additional introduction of infected animals. Zoonotic concerns remain, including whether monkeypox was transmitted to other North American mammals that may have come into contact with the imported infected rodents. Ongoing studies are focusing on the pathogenesis of infection, incubation period, length of transmissibility, and expression of disease in rodentsâ€”all which remain poorly understood.</p>
