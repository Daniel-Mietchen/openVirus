<p>An outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus subtype H7N7 occurred in the Netherlands beginning in February 2003. The Netherlands Ministry of Agriculture instituted an eradication program to control H7N7 avian influenza in poultry (30 million chickens culled; 255 farms; 20% symptomatic). An unexpectedly high number of H7N7 transmissions occurred in persons directly involved in handling infected poultry; evidence for person-to-person transmission was documented. Enhanced surveillance showed that 453 of an estimated 4,500 people thought to be exposed reported health complaintsâ€”349 reported conjunctivitis, and 67 reported other complaints. One veterinarian died. After 19 cases had been identified, all workers received mandatory influenza virus vaccination and prophylactic treatment with oseltamivir. Fifty-six percent of reported H7N7 infections arose before the vaccination and treatment program. By the time full prophylactic measures were reinforced (1 week after the first confirmation of human infection), &gt;1,000 persons from all over the Netherlands and from abroad had been exposed. Poor compliance was observed in the use of personal protective equipment among poultry farmers and cullers.</p>
