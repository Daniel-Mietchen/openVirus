<p>Domesticated cats, the terrestrial definitive hosts of 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic>, recently have been found to inhabit the coastal California landscape. From 1997 to 2001, 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> seroprevalence was 42% (49/116), in live sea otters and 62% (66/107) in dead otters. Risk factors positively associated with 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> seropositivity included male gender; older age; presence in Morro Bay, California; and freshwater outflow exposure. These findings illustrate pathogen pollution in the marine ecosystem and suggest that sea otters could be an indicator species for as-yet-unrecognized human health risks.
