<p>Several human and animal Ebola virus outbreaks have occurred in West and Central Africa since 2001, causing 313 human cases and 264 deaths. These outbreaks have consisted of multiple simultaneous epidemics caused by different viral strains, with each epidemic resulting from humans' handling of distinct gorilla, chimpanzee, or duiker carcasses. Wildlife die-offs coincided in time and space with human Ebola outbreaks. Based on these results, Ebola virus was proposed as the cause of the rapid local collapse of these wild animal populations. Carcasses were infected by a variety of Ebola virus strains, which suggests that Ebola outbreaks in great apes resulted from multiple virus introductions from an unidentified natural reservoir host. It was proposed that outbreaks in humans could possibly be prevented or predicted by monitoring animal deaths.</p>
