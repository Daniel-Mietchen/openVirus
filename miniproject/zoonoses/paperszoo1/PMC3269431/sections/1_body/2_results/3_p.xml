<p>Genotypes II and VII were detected only sporadically during the study. However, this is the first report of SLEV genotype II in Argentina. The nucleotide sequence corresponding to this genotype share 100% homology with SLEV strains SPAn-11916 (EF117302), was isolated in 1968 from rodents collected in Sao Paulo (Brazil), and Parton-MSI-7 (EF158070) was isolated from ill humans in Missouri (USA) in 1933. Only 2 positive pools (
 <italic>Ae. albifasciatus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes) collected in Bajo Grande and Guiñazú in 2003 proved to be infected with this genotype in our study (

 <italic>Calomys musculinus</italic>, 
 <italic>Mus musculus</italic>) in the province of Córdoba 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001489-Sabattini1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, there was no previous report of its activity neither in mosquitoes nor in the capital city.; it was detected in 3 sites (Guiñazú, Bajo Grande, San Carlos) during 2002 and 2003 (
