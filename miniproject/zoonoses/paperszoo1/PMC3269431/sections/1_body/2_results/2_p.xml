<p>Based on the classification proposed by Kramer and Chandler 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001489-Rodrigues1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, three different SLEV genotypes (II, V, and VII) were detected in CÃ³rdoba city before the encephalitis human outbreak associated to SLEV genotype III (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001489-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Genotype V was detected in 5 of the 8 collection sites during the 4 years (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001489-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and it was found in the 8 infected mosquito species collected in our study (

 <italic>Anopheles albitarsis</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. albifasciatus</italic>,

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001489-t002">Table 2</xref>). Sequences belonging to genotype V share a 100% of homology with SLEV strain 78V6507 (AF205481). This genotype was previously isolated from 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes in Santa Fe province in 1978
