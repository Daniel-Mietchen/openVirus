<p>During 2005, a human encephalitis outbreak was caused by SLEV in CÃ³rdoba city 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001489-Spinsanti2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, and two genotype III strains were isolated 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001489-Daz1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Molecular characterization determined that both variants are closely related to SLEV strain 79V-2533, isolated 27 years ago in Santa Fe province 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001489-Daz1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This evidence supports the hypothesis that the introduction of a more virulent genotype could have caused the mentioned outbreak. In a recent study, Diaz et al. 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001489-Daz2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> compared epidemic (CbaAr-4005) and non-epidemic (79V-2533) genotype III SLEV strains. The epidemic variant produced higher viremias in House sparrows (
 <italic>Passer domesticus</italic>) than the non-epidemic strain. According to this, the epidemic strain (CbaAr-4005) appears to broaden the number of avian species that are likely to be competent amplifying hosts relative to the non-epidemic 79V-2533 strain
