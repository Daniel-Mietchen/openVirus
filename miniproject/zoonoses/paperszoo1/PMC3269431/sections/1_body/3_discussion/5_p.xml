<p>Analyzing temporal and geographic patterns of SLEV in Texas by molecular techniques, Chandler et al. 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001489-Chandler1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> detected the presence of dominant and limited strains fluctuating in space and time. This activity pattern could be the result of multiple intermittent virus introductions by birds from neighboring regions 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001489-Kramer2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Other flavivirus such as Japanese encephalitis (JEV) and West Nile virus (WNV) showed similar dynamics

 <xref rid="pntd.0001489-Takhampunya1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. These dynamics are characterized by the introduction/persistence of certain genotypes and the presence/absence of clinical cases in the study area. Another possibility is that SLEV genotype III had been silently present in CÃ³rdoba prior to 2001. Although a Dengue virus has different ecological requirements compared with JEV, SLEV and WNV, it has been demonstrated that some serotypes can remain silent for many years causing periodic epidemics
