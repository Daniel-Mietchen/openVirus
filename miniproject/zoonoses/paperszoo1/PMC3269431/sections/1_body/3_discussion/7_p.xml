<p>The introduction of new strains and the extension of their geographic distributions are factors that can cause the emergence and reemergence of flaviviruses in different regions 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001489-Mackenzie1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. For example, the introduction, spread and establishment of WNV in America and Japanese Encephalitis Virus in Australasia and the annual introduction of SLEV strains in the USA (California state) 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001489-Kramer2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. During our four-year study a non-genotype III SLEV strain was detected. One year prior to the outbreak a total of 2,093 mosquitoes were analyzed and only one mosquito pool was positive (genotype V) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001489-t001">Table 1</xref>). The results here exposed suggest that genotype III was introduced in CÃ³rdoba city a few months before the outbreak and it could be one of the factors contributing to the outbreak.
