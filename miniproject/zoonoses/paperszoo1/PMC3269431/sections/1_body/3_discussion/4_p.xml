<p>In a different way, genotypes II and VII showed limited temporal and spatial activities (

 <xref rid="pntd.0001489-Powers1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> pointed out that arboviruses maintained by a rodents-mosquitoes cycle show limited and constrained geographic distributions, which agree with the limited dispersion capacity observed in rodents. In fact, Genotype VII SLEV strains (CorAn-9124, CorAn-9275) were isolated only from small rodents in Córdoba province

 <italic>Ae. scapularis</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. interfor</italic>) infected with Genotype VII frequently feed on mammals hosts
