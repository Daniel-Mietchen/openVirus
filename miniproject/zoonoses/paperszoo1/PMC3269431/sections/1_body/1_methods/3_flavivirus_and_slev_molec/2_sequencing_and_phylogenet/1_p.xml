<p>All PCR products obtained from mosquito pools were purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), submitted to direct nucleotide sequencing reaction using Big Dye Terminator v3.1 Cycle kit (Applied Biosystem), and analyzed in an automatic sequencer. The obtained sequences were submitted to BLASTn 2.2.19 -Basic Local Alignment Search Tool- (

A phylogenetic analysis of the SLEV alignment including 134 partial Envelope gene sequences was performed using neighbor joining (NJ) in MEGA v5 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001489-Tamura1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>; the proportion of differences between the sequences was considered as the distance measure (
 <italic>p</italic> distance). The NJ analysis was bootstrapped 10,000 replications.
