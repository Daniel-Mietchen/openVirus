 <xref rid="pntd.0001489-Monath1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0001489-Trent1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Based on complete Envelope gene sequencing, SLEV strains can be classified into 8 lineages or genotypes (I–VIII) 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001489-Rodrigues1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. According to a phylogeographic analyses, genotypes I and II are prevalent in the USA, while the others were found only in countries from Central and South America

 <xref rid="pntd.0001489-Auguste1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Exceptionally, genotype V strains were recently isolated in Florida 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001489-Ottendorfer1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. SLEV strains circulating in Argentina were clustered with genotype III (79V-2533 –year 1978-, CbaAr-4005, CbaAr-4006 – year 2005-), V (78V-6507 – year 1978-), both isolated from
