<p>SLEV reemerged in the central region of Argentina in 2002 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001489-Spinsanti1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In 2005, 47 laboratory-confirmed and probable clinical cases of SLEV infection, including nine fatalities, were reported in the central Córdoba Province 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001489-Spinsanti2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. During this outbreak two SLEV genotype III strains were isolated 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001489-Daz1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This was the first SLEV-induced encephalitis outbreak reported in South America. Although the causes of 2005 outbreak remain unknown, they might be related not only to virological factors, but also to changes in the structure and dynamics of vectors and/or avian amplifying hosts populations, and environmental conditions. We hypothesized that one of the factors for SLE reemergence in Córdoba, Argentina was the introduction of a new SLEV genotype, with no previous activity in the area. In order to evaluate this hypothesis we carried out a molecular characterization of SLEV detections from mosquitoes collected between 2001 and 2004 in Córdoba city.
