<p>Interestingly, neither measure of total community diversity was eroded from 1998 to 2002 (repeated-measures ANOVA, richness increased non-significantly: 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1,128</sub> = 3.78, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.054; evenness: 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1,128</sub> = 1.37, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.244), further supporting the notion of a fairly robust diversity-disease relationship even once WNV has impacted avian populations. However, it is clear that a difference in species richness is generally a better predictor of human WNV prevalence than a difference in community evenness.
