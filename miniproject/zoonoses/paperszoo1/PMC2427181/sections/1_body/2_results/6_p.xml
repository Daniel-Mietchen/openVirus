<p>Although we indicated that overall community evenness does not change within counties from 1998 to 2002, nonpasserine evenness significantly declines (repeated-measures ANOVA, 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1,128</sub> = 11.21, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) and this pattern does not differ between counties that do or do not report human cases of WNV (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1,128</sub> = 0.032, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.858). However, the opposite pattern is observed among passerines, with evenness increasing from 1998 to 2002 (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1,128</sub> = 11.25, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) with no difference in this increase in counties that do or do not report human WNV cases (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1,128</sub> = 0.475, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.492). These differences suggest that fundamentally different population processes are occurring for nonpasserines and passerines over the period that avian WNV becomes established in these 130 counties. We did not detect any changes in the relative or absolute abundance of corvids, house sparrows, or finches from 1998 to 2002 (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1,128</sub>&lt;1.09, 
 <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.299, in all cases). However, there was a slight increase in the relative (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1,128</sub> = 6.32, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.013) and absolute abundance (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1,128</sub> = 3.26, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.073) of thrushes, which was also associated with a large relative increase (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1,128</sub> = 17.09, 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) and absolute increase (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1,128</sub> = 9.34, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.003) in the abundance or American robins. This increase in robins did not differ between counties that did or did not report human cases of WNV (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1,128</sub> = 0.212, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.646).
