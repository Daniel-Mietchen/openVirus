<p>In both the 1998 and 2002 partial correlation analyses, the spatial contrast of avian species richness was strongly negatively related to the contrast in human incidence of WNV (species richness in 1998 predicted human disease in 2002: 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>61</sub> = −0.358, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.004; richness in 2002 also predicted disease in 2002: 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>61</sub> = −0.509, 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002488-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) and these relationships did not differ between years (ANCOVA, 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1,125</sub> = 1.11, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.294). There was also a negative but weaker relationship between the contrast of avian species evenness in 1998 and the contrast in human WNV in 2002 (
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>61</sub> = −0.333, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.008) and this relationship was somewhat diminished when comparing evenness contrast in 2002 with human WNV contrast in that same year (
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>61</sub> = −0.221, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.081; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002488-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). The change in slope of the evenness-disease relationship from 1998 to 2002 was not quite significant (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1,125</sub> = 3.52, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.063). If the apparent outlier in the 2002 evenness contrast dataset is removed, the relationship between 2002 evenness and disease becomes stronger, more negative, and more similar to the 1998 analysis (
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>61</sub> = −0.268, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.035). However, there is no biological reason to exclude this datum, hence we have included it in further analyses.
