<p>Our regression model selection procedure generated highly significant linear models relating the spatial contrast of 2002 human disease incidence to 1998 avian community structure contrasts (

 <italic>r</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.483,

 <italic>r</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.506, 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001 , AIC = −117.99). For the 1998 community analysis, there was a higher incidence contrast of human WNV in 2002 in counties that previously (in 1998) had lower total species richness contrasts (
 <italic>ß</italic> = −0.028, s.e. = 0.005, 95% CI −0.038 to −0.017, 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, partial 
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.514), fewer passerines compared with nonpasserines (
 <italic>ß</italic> = −0.036, s.e. = 0.015, 95% CI −0.067 to −0.006, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.021, partial 
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.228), a lower absolute abundance contrast of American robins (
 <italic>ß</italic> = −0.009, s.e. = 0.003, 95% CI −0.014 to −0.004, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002, partial 
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.320), but a marginally higher proportion of this same species relative to the total community (
 <italic>ß</italic> = 8.84, s.e. = 3.37, 95% CI 2.09 to 15.59, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.011, partial 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.252), relatively more corvids (
 <italic>ß</italic> = 4.13, s.e. = 1.71, 95% CI 0.707 to 7.55, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.019, partial 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.232), a greater total abundance of birds of all species (
 <italic>ß</italic> = 0.001, s.e. = 0.0002, 95% CI 0.00057 to 0.001, 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0013, partial 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.477), and a somewhat more urbanized population (
 <italic>ß</italic> = 0.233, s.e. = 0.171, 95% CI −0.109 to −0.576, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.178, partial 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.131) that does not vary systematically in socioeconomic status (
 <italic>ß</italic> = 0.021, s.e. = 0.066, 95% CI −0.112 to 0.153, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.755, partial 
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.030). This model does not alter qualitatively if both the non-significant socioeconomic and urbanization metrics are removed. Overall, this model is consistent with the simpler partial correlation analyses, indicating that a greater pre-existing (1998) avian species richness (within the uninfected-infected county pair) is associated with a lower incidence of human WNV cases during the epidemic. Additionally and independently of this diversity-disease relationship, communities in 1998 with relatively more birds overall, and relatively more corvids, robins, and nonpasserine species (contrasted to their nearest neighbor) are more likely to report human WNV once the epidemic occurs (in 2002).
