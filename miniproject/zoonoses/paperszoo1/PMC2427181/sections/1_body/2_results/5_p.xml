<p>For the 2002 community analysis, there was a higher incidence contrast of human WNV in counties with lower total species richness contrast (
 <italic>ß</italic> = −0.035, s.e. = 0.005, 95% CI −0.046 to −0.025, 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, partial 
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.636), a greater nonpasserine community evenness contrast (
 <italic>ß</italic> = 0.423, s.e. = 0.175, 95% CI 0.072 to 0.773, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.019, partial 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.223), a marginally greater contrast in relative abundance of house sparrows (
 <italic>ß</italic> = 2.90, s.e. = 1.78, 95% CI −0.666 to 6.48, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.109, partial 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.150), and a greater contrast in absolute abundance of finches (
 <italic>ß</italic> = 0.007, s.e. = 0.002, 95% CI 0.003 to 0.010, 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, partial 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.349), and a more urbanized human population (
 <italic>ß</italic> = 0.390, s.e. = 0.161, 95% CI 0.068 to 0.712, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.018, partial 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.224) that does not vary systematically in socioeconomic status (
 <italic>ß</italic> = 0.031, s.e. = 0.064, 95% CI −0.097 to 0.158, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.632, partial 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.044). Hence, greater species richness still appears strongly associated with fewer cases of human disease but, surprisingly, higher nonpasserine diversity (measured by evenness) may be an indicator of increased disease risk once the disease has taken hold in the avian population. It would also appear that, comparing the difference between neighboring counties, the absolute abundance of finches and, somewhat, the relative abundance of house sparrows are predictors of increased human WNV. In both the 1998 and 2002 analyses, species richness is notably a stronger predictor of human WNV incidence than any measure of community evenness. Also, there was a general trend for urbanization to be positively associated with a greater incidence of disease independently of the community structure-disease correlations.
