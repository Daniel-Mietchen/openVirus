<p>To explore whether the contrasts of relative or absolute abundance of the select avian families (and American robins) were better predictors of human WNV incidence we performed a series of partial correlations (controlling for human demographic PC1 and PC2) and tested whether the effect sizes (i.e., the unsigned partial correlation coefficients) were larger for relative versus absolute measures of abundance with a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, pooling correlations from the 1998 and 2002 analyses together (
