<p>The geospatial contrasts of relative abundance of corvids and of American robins before WNV was reported in the US (i.e., in 1998) were both moderate but independent predictors of future human infection. This pattern is somewhat consistent with a recent claim that American robins are largely responsible for transmission rates from birds to humans, because of mosquito vectors' affinity for feeding from robins

The role of the American robin in WNV epidemics is further implicated in our data by the increase in relative and absolute abundance of this species from 1998 to 2002. Although this increase in robins did not differ between counties that did or did not report human WNV, this pattern is still consistent with American robins being positively associated with the overall (human and avian) WNV epidemics. The 2002 community analysis also indicated that the geospatial contrast of absolute abundance of finches is positively associated with the contrast in human WNV incidence. This is not associated with an increase in finch abundance from 1998 to 2002 and suggests that this avian family may play an important role in determining a human epidemic
