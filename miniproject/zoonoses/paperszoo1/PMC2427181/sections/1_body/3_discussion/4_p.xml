<p>Overall, we are left with partially supporting the mechanism of susceptible host regulation and down-playing the roles of transmission and encounter reduction in explaining the diversity-disease relationship we show here. We do not intend to overstate these conclusions as our data are not experimental, which obfuscates any statements concerning causality in mechanisms, and we can also not exclude that there are other mechanisms that are yet to be formalized that can explain the general patterns in our data. However, we hope that this form of analysis helps others to consider further the relative strengths of mechanisms that can lead to a diversity-disease relationship.</p>
