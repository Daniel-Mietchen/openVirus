<p>Surprisingly, we recorded an increase in passerine community evenness from 1998 to 2002, further indicating that many more passerine species than is commonly accepted could be resilient to WNV. There is a fairly widespread perception that nonpasserines are, as a group, more resistant to WNV infection than passerines

As we observed the opposite, we hypothesize that there are many passerines that have not been studied in detail that may be poor viral hosts and, perhaps, many nonpasserine species that are more effective viral replicators than currently believed. Therefore, although substantial efforts have been made to compare the viral host properties of several species
