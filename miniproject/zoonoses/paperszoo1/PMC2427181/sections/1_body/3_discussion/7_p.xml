<p>We do not intend to put too much stock in interpreting the changes in particular avian families over the time period we studied as these data are correlational and many other factors could have changed in these counties from 1998 to 2002. However, we were surprised to see a lack of change in abundance of several passerine groups that are known to be affected by WNV. In particular, we were expecting to see a noticeable decrease in corvids

 <xref rid="pone.0002488-LaDeau1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, but observed neither pattern. Similarly, we were expecting to see a decrease in total avian diversity metrics associated with WNV, but did not observe this pattern. Both sets of (lack of) patterns may indicate that avian populations, at least those surveyed by BBS methods, are surprisingly resilient during the first years of a disease epidemic
