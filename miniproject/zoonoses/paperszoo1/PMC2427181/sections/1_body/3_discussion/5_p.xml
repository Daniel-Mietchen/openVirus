<p>Unexpectedly, the 2002 community analyses indicate that a greater contrast in community evenness (i.e., relative diversity) of nonpasserines may actually be associated with more cases of human disease, not less. This is consistent with this group of birds contributing transmission and/or encounter augmentation 
 <xref rid="pone.0002488-Keesing1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, which has not been suggested previously, and runs somewhat contrary to the one previous analysis of avian diversity and human WNV 
 <xref rid="pone.0002488-Ezenwa1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Therefore, we recommend further testing of nonpasserine species in monitoring WNV as our analyses are consistent with nonpasserine species being more effective viral reservoirs than is currently believed and/or that transmission of the virus among nonpasserine host species is more likely than transmission within a nonpasserine species
