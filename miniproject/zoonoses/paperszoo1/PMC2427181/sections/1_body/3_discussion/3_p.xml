<p>We ruled out the vector regulation mechanism by including a proxy for mosquito density in our analyses (i.e., the urbanization metric) and we do not have data to assess the merits of the recovery augmentation mechanism. Therefore, we are left to consider the density-dependent mechanism of susceptible host regulation. Our analysis of the effect sizes of absolute versus relative abundance contrast metrics in explaining human WNV incidence indicates that these measures have approximately equal explanatory value, which is not entirely consistent with the mechanism of susceptible host regulation. However, the geospatial contrast of total abundance of all avian (i.e., potential host) species in 1998 was a good predictor of human WNV incidence in 2002, with more disease occurring in neighboring counties with a higher density of potential hosts. Contrary to what has been assumed for many vector-borne diseases

 <xref rid="pone.0002488-Thrall1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> this pattern is consistent with a density-dependent mechanism of disease transmission, which further erodes confidence in frequency-dependent explanations of how WNV is transmitted from birds to humans.
