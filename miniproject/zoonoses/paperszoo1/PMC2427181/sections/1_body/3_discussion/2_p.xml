<p>Of the possible mechanisms that could help explain a general diversity-disease relationship, our data are not wholly consistent with either transmission reduction or encounter reduction being the major mechanisms (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002488-t001">Table 1</xref>). For example, under transmission reduction, the encounters between mosquito vectors and infected, highly competent avian hosts can be reduced when relatively more lower-competence hosts are introduced into the population 
 <xref rid="pone.0002488-Keesing1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Therefore, the density and relative abundance of lower-competence hosts is more important than the mere presence/absence of lower-competence hosts in driving this mechanism. If transmission reduction predominated, we would expect to see a stronger negative relationship between human incidence of WNV and community evenness (which incorporates aspects of relative abundance of all host species) than the negative relationship between human WNV and avian species richness (which is an index of presence/absence of host species). This was not the case. We found that the geospatial contrast of species richness was consistently a better predictor of human disease. A similar argument exists for encounter reduction, where encounters between hosts and infected vectors should decrease where there is a greater relative abundance of new species. Therefore, we cannot support transmission reduction or encounter reduction as being the major mechanisms driving the patterns we observed here. However, because our analyses are correlational, it is premature to rule out these mechanisms entirely.
