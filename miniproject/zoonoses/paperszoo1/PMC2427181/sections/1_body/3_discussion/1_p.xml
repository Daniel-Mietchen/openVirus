<p>The geospatial contrast in species richness, either assessed in 1998 or in 2002, was strongly negatively related to the disease prevalence in 2002, which supports our hypothesis that subtle differences in avian diversity between neighboring counties helps buffer humans against WNV infection. Even once WNV is established in all counties and the human epidemic is in full swing (in 2002), the between-county contrast in species richness remains strongly negatively associated with the incidence of human disease. Overall, avian community structure can explain approximately 50% of the variation in human WNV incidence, which seems a high proportion given the rather indirect mechanistic links that most likely underlie these relationships.</p>
