<p>As one of each pair reported zero human cases, we used the incidence of the infected counties as the contrasts (i.e., difference) in human WNV incidence between the neighboring pairs. The community structure contrasts were calculated by subtracting the relevant metric scores for the infected counties from the same metric scores from their uninfected neighbors. Hence, if the uninfected counties had greater avian diversity, we would expect to see a negative relationship between the contrasts for human WNV incidence and each metric of avian diversity. Therefore, this technique rendered 65 contrasts representing the 65 pairs of counties for which there were sufficient data. These contrasts are useful for several reasons. First, they account for the non-independence of neighboring data points. Essentially, they allow us to probe, within a county pair, whether an increase in diversity from one county to another is associated with an increase or decrease in the incidence of human disease. Also, the contrasts report a difference (or change) in community structure metrics over space which can be useful in making recommendations for management strategies. For example, the contrast can be used to plan for an increase (or decrease) in a metric of community structure over a specified time interval or spatial scale and that difference may be associated with a subsequent change in human disease incidence.</p>
