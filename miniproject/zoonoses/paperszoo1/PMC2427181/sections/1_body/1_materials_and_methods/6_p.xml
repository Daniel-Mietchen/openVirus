<p>We also performed a linear regression model selection procedure in which we started with a maximal model that had the following predictors of the contrast for human incidence of WNV: spatial contrasts for total species richness, total community evenness, nonpasserine community evenness, passerine community evenness, relative abundance of passerines to nonpasserines, relative and absolute abundances of Corvidae, Passeridae, Fringillidae, Turdidae, and American robins, the total abundance of all birds sampled on a route, and human demographic PC1 (socioeconomic status) and PC2 (urbanization). As we wanted to account for human socioeconomic and urbanization factors in all steps of the model, we retained human demographic PC1 and PC2 throughout the model selection procedure but otherwise removed the least significant predictor variable (if individual variable 
 <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.10) if the removal step led to a better fit according to Akaike's information criterion (AIC). This model-fitting procedure let us explore which variables had the greatest power in explaining variation in human incidence of human WNV while also simplifying toward a minimal adequate model. Following this procedure, we constructed two regression models, one that explained 2002 human WNV incidence by 1998 avian community metrics, and a separate model that explained 2002 human WNV by 2002 avian community metrics. We have included a correlation matrix of all the relevant contrasts in avian community structure metrics in
