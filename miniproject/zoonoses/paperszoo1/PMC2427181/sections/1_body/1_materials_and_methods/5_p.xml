<p>We performed Pearson partial correlation analyses of the spatial contrasts of human incidence of WNV in 2002 on contrasts for avian community structure in 1998 (before WNV was reported in the US) and in 2002 (the first year of the epidemic), while accounting for variation in county socioeconomic status (human demographic PC1) and urbanization (PC2). By comparing diversity-disease relationships with avian community data from before WNV was reported in the US (1998) to the time of the epidemic (2002) by ANCOVA, we explored whether the disease-community structure relationships changed as the bird populations changed in association with the WNV epidemic. Explicitly we used “year” as factor and the relevant diversity metric and the two human demographic PCs as covariates and interpreted the year-by-diversity interaction term to look for a change in the diversity-disease relationship across years.</p>
