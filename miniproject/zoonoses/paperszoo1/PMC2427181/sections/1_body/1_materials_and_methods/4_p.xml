<p>We performed a principal components analysis (employing the correlation matrix method) of 2000 Census Bureau data for all counties east of the Mississippi river. The PCA generated two components with eigenvalues greater than one. The first component (human demographic PC1) explained 46.7% of the variation and loaded highly negatively with median household income and loaded positively with percentage of the population under the poverty line and the percentage of the county population that was unemployed (

The second component (human demographic PC2) explained a further 20.6% of the variation in the data and loaded highly positively with population density and negatively with the percentage of people under 5 or over 65 years of age (

Human socioeconomic status may affect WNV incidence as lower socioeconomic populations are likely to be more susceptible to disease in general. Urbanization may affect the disease-community structure relationships as the primary mosquito vectors,
