<p>Disease prevalence can be affected by multiple factors other than host diversity. To minimize confounding factors we constructed a novel geospatial contrasts method that related avian community structure to human WNV incidence (per capita) using the between-county differences in avian community structure metrics and human disease incidence of neighboring counties in which one county did not report human WNV and the other did (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002488-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). All counties reported avian WNV. These pairs of contrasts let us compare the disease-community structure relationships while accounting for geospatial non-independence of human disease incidence and of avian community structure, and regional variation in climate and local mosquito vector type.
