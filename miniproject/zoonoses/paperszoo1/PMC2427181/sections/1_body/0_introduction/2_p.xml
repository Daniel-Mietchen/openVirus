<p>The mechanisms of these models and much of the empirical demonstration of effects have been explored in the context of Lyme disease, where there is lower probability of being bitten by an infected tick (vector) in woodland areas of relatively increased small mammal (host) diversity

 <xref rid="pone.0002488-Ostfeld1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, there is a need to explore whether the dilution effect is applicable to other diseases, whether such diseases vary in incidence and risk with diversity, and to attempt to identify the mechanisms by which the dilution effect operates 
 <xref rid="pone.0002488-Keesing1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Meeting these demands can help inform and refocus more effective public health, conservation, and bioterrorism-preparedness strategies by identifying ways in which wildlife (host) community structure can be utilized to minimize the health, ecological, and economic consequences of emerging infectious diseases, whether these diseases emerge naturally or are introduced deliberately.
