<p>To observe the predicted dilution effect in the context of WNV transmission the vector (mosquito) must feed from numerous host (bird) species and these hosts must vary substantially in their competence as disease hosts (i.e., the product of species susceptibility, infectiousness, and the duration of the infection, as defined in 
 <xref rid="pone.0002488-Komar1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>) and the least competent hosts must increase in relative abundance in more diverse host communities; and/or transmission of the virus within a host species must be greater than transmission among host species. These conditions appear to be met for WNV transmission: the mosquitoes that spread WNV feed from multiple bird species

 <xref rid="pone.0002488-Komar1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and will bite incidental hosts such as humans and horses; bird species vary substantially in their host competence 
 <xref rid="pone.0002488-Komar1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0002488-Bowen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>; and some of the most competent hosts (e.g., crows, jays, finches, sparrows, and thrushes) are frequently present in low diversity (suburbanized and urbanized) avian communities, whereas the least competent hosts (e.g. coots, quail, pheasants, geese, woodpeckers, and parakeets) tend to appear in more diverse assemblages

 <xref rid="pone.0002488-Chace1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The assumption that disease transmission is more likely within than among host species is less well-supported, partly because this is difficult to investigate directly in field studies. Transmission within-species by contact has been observed in the laboratory 
 <xref rid="pone.0002488-Komar1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0002488-McLean1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. This could mean that species living at high density can spread the virus to conspecifics through additional non-vector mechanisms. In terms of more likely vector transmission routes, the most prevalent vector species in the eastern US (
 <italic>Culex pipens</italic>) has notable affinities to feed from particular host species 
 <xref rid="pone.0002488-Kilpatrick2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, thereby increasing the probability of within versus among host species transfer of the virus.
