<p>In an attempt to assess the relative merits of the non-mutually exclusive mechanisms that could underlie a relationship between diversity and disease, we generated predictions of how aspects of diversity and community structure should relate to human WNV incidence under the principle mechanisms (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002488-t001">Table 1</xref>). These predictions were not straightforward to form as our data are correlational, hence it is difficult to assign any particular causal mechanism to the patterns in our data. We want readers to interpret our data with this caveat in mind. However, our analyses are an important first step toward indicating how a dilution effect may be manifest for a vector-borne zoonosis across a broad geographic scale and may also help to stimulate more specific hypotheses for how each mechanism can be diagnosed in future studies. Our predictions were as follows.
