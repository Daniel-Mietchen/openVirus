<p>The dilution effect is an outcome of a potentially broadly applicable set of mathematical models that could help explain human risks of contracting vector-borne zoonoses, i.e., infectious diseases that are spread among host animals by a vector and threaten to spill over into the human population

 <xref rid="pone.0002488-VanBuskirk1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Examples of zoonoses include avian influenza, anthrax, bubonic plague, Lyme disease, and West Nile virus, to name but a few. The fundamental principle underlying the dilution effect is that increased host diversity can dilute disease incidence through multiple mechanisms 
 <xref rid="pone.0002488-Keesing1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Such mechanisms include, in situations of increasing host diversity, a reduction in the probability of transmission of the disease from infected hosts to vectors (

 <xref rid="pone.0002488-Kilpatrick1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, a reduction in the rate of encounters between hosts and infected vectors (
 <italic>encounter reduction</italic>), a reduction in the number of susceptible hosts (
 <italic>susceptible host regulation</italic>), a reduction in infected vector density (
 <italic>vector regulation</italic>), and a faster disease recovery rate among infected hosts (
 <italic>recovery augmentation</italic>) 
 <xref rid="pone.0002488-Keesing1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. All of these mechanisms have a complementary augmentation (e.g., encounter augmentation) or reduction (i.e., recovery reduction) mechanism that can give rise to a positive relation between diversity and disease incidence in certain situations.
