<p>Here, we report a much broader geographic examination of whether avian diversity and community structure can predict the occurrence of WNV in humans by examining associations of human WNV cases with avian community structure in the eastern US from the year before WNV was introduced to the US, 1998, 
 <xref rid="pone.0002488-Roehrig1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> to the first year of the human epidemic in these states, 2002. Specifically, we related the per capita incidence of human WNV with metrics of bird diversity and the relative abundance of particular avian families, and one species, that are predicted to relate to human risks of contracting WNV: Corvidae, crows and jays

 <xref rid="pone.0002488-Komar2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>; Turdidae, thrushes; and the American robin

 <xref rid="pone.0002488-Kilpatrick2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Within these analyses we attempted to control for geospatial relations in the data, regional climate variation, regional variation in vector type, human socioeconomic factors, and county urbanization, all of which may confound any relationships between avian community structure and human incidence of WNV. We predicted that there would be lower incidence of human WNV in counties with greater avian diversity and a lower relative abundance of corvids, finches, house sparrows, thrushes, and American robins.
