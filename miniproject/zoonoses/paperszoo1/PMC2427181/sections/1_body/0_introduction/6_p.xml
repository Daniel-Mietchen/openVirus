<p>For WNV transmission, the models leading to a dilution effect predict that as the species diversity of local avian populations increases, the relative abundance of less competent avian host species will increase and/or transmission of WNV among hosts will be reduced by introducing more species. Either, or both, of these patterns will result in a lower probability of uninfected organisms contracting WNV and a lower probability of incidental hosts, such as humans, contracting WNV

 <xref rid="pone.0002488-Ezenwa1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> compared diversity to disease after WNV could have affected avian community diversity, therefore obscuring any causal implications between avian host community structure and the risks to humans from WNV. For example, the disease could have caused a reduction in avian diversity while also infecting humans. This study also ignored information from counties that reported no human WNV cases, which may be the most informative from a public health point of view, and also did not to account for any covariation with climate variables.
