<p>Transmission reduction is regulated by the relative densities of higher- versus lower-competence hosts in the local community 
 <xref rid="pone.0002488-Keesing1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. If relatively more lower-competence or uninfected hosts are introduced into a population then the encounter rate between the vector and the more-competent infected hosts will be reduced. As community evenness captures information about the relative abundances of hosts and this information is ignored by a species richness metric, we predicted that the importance of transmission reduction will be illustrated by a relatively stronger negative relationship between disease prevalence and evenness than the relationship between disease and species richness. Encounter reduction should follow a similar pattern, as adding relatively more individuals of an additional species will reduce rates of contact that could aid transmission of the pathogen. Hence, under encounter reduction, we also expect avian community evenness to be a stronger predictor than species richness of human WNV.
