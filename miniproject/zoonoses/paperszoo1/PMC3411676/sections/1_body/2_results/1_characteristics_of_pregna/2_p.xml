<p>On admission, six of the 82 pregnant women (7%) were in the first trimester, 33 (40%) in the second and 40 (49%) in the third (missing data  = 3). Fifty-nine (72%) pregnancies were reported to be single, and one multiple (missing data  = 22). Twenty-seven (33%) were admitted to hospital during the first wave of the pandemic and 55 (67%) during the second wave. The interval between onset of symptoms and admission ranged from 0–17 days (median 2.0; interquartile range 1–4; missing data  = 29). The main findings of the univariate analysis comparing the characteristics of pregnant and non-pregnant women aged 15–44 are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0041638-t001">Table 1</xref>. Pregnant women were significantly less likely to exhibit severe respiratory distress at initial hospital assessment or require supplemental oxygen on admission than non-pregnant women of a similar age.
