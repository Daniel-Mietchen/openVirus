<p>Data regarding foetal outcomes were taken from free text notes. Sixteen babies were delivered during admission, ten to mothers admitted for predominantly obstetric reasons and four to mothers admitted for predominantly respiratory illness (missing data = 2), although clearly it is impossible to rule out influenza having a detrimental effect on a pregnancy and precipitating an obstetric issue. Three of the four mothers with apparent respiratory illness required Level 2/3 care and delivered pre-term babies, two requiring emergency caesarean section and one induced labour resulting in a still-birth. The fourth mother required emergency caesarean section but not Level 2/3 care, and delivered at term. In comparison, none of the ten mothers admitted predominantly for obstetric reasons required Level 2/3 care and only one delivered a pre-term baby by elective caesarean section.</p>
