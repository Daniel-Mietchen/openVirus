<p>Three pregnant women died during admission, two with pneumonia and one following complications post delivery (coagulopathy, hypotension and cerebral infarction). There was no difference in the likelihood of death when compared with non-pregnant women (3 of 82 (4%) vs 11 of 313 (4%)) before (unadj. OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.28- 3.83) and after adjustment for co-morbidity, severity of illness on admission and in-hospital antiviral use (adj. OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.31- 4.53). In addition there was no difference in case-fatality between pregnant or non-pregnant women who were sick enough to require mechanical ventilatory support (2 of 10 (20%) vs. 7 of 32 (22%): unadj. OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.15â€“5.20).</p>
