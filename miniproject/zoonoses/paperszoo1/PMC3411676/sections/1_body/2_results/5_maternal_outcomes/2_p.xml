<p>After adjustment for co-morbidities (including recorded obesity), severity of illness on admission, and in-hospital antiviral use, pregnant women were no more likely to require a hospital stay ≥2 days (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.48–1.86, p = 0.865) or to experience severe outcomes including Level2/3 admission or death (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.46–1.92, p = 0.808) (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0041638.s002">Table S2</xref>).There was also no statistically significant difference in the risk of severe outcomes (Level 2/3 admission or death) by wave of the pandemic when comparing pregnant and non-pregnant women (first wave unadj. OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.42–3.69, p = 0.69; second wave unadj. OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.32–1.88, p = 0.58).
