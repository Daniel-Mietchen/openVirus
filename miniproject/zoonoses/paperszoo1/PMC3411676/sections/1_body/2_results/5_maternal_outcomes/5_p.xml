<p>Overall, pregnant women hospitalised with A(H1N1)pdm09 infection were no more likely to experience severe outcomes (Level 2/3 admission or death) when compared with non-pregnant women of a similar age (adj. OR 0.93, 95% CI: 0.46–1.92). Similarly, the sensitivity analysis considering only women without prior co-morbidities (Charlson index score = 0; pregnant = 62; non-pregnant = 152) and designed to exclude any residual confounding effects, also found no evidence that pregnant women had an increased risk of severe outcome either before (unadj. OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.47–1.83) or after adjusting for disease severity at admission (adj. OR 0.97, 95% CI: 0.39–2.45).</p>
