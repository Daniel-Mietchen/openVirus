<p>Anonymised data were analysed using STATA (Version 11.0, StataCorp Inc.) and univariate analyses performed using logistic regression to compare factors associated with length of hospital stay, need for higher level care (admission to Level 2 or Level 3 care), death and combined severe outcomes (defined as Level 2/Level 3 admission or death) in pregnant and non-pregnant women of similar age. Multivariable regression analysis was conducted to adjust for factors that could potentially confound the relationship between pregnancy and pandemic influenza outcomes, using a conceptual model based on a combination of expert opinion and existing evidence.

 <xref rid="pone.0041638-Myles2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>). Missing values were coded separately as a dummy variable for inclusion in the multivariable logistic regression model. Sensitivity analyses were performed adding pre-admission antiviral use as a covariate in the model and restricting analysis to women without underlying co-morbidities.
