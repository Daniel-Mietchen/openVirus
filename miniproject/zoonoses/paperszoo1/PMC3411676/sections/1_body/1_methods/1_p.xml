<p>The FLU-CIN project is described in further detail in an earlier paper. 
 <xref rid="pone.0041638-NguyenVanTam1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> FLU-CIN was an ‘emergency’ study with a purposive sampling frame based around 13 sentinel hospitals in five clinical ‘hubs’ (Nottingham, Leicester, Imperial College London, Sheffield and Liverpool), with contributions from a further 45 non-sentinel hospitals in England and 17 in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This included five children’s hospitals and five respiratory tertiary referral centres (three with facilities for Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO)). Children’s hospitals and tertiary referral centres were not mutually exclusive; one of three ECMO centres was a children’s hospital. Trained staff reviewed the hospital case notes and electronic records of patients with A(H1N1) pdm09 confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and completed a common, standardised data extraction form.

High dependency (Level 2) care was defined as patients requiring more detailed observation or intervention (including support for a single failing organ system and those ‘stepping down’ from higher levels of care),and intensive (Level 3) care was defined as patients requiring advanced respiratory support alone or basic respiratory support together with support of at least two organ systems (including all complex patients requiring support for multi-organ failure). Any missing data were coded as dummy variables and reporting of information otherwise assumed to be complete.
