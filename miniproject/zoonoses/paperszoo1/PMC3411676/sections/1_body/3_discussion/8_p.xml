<p>Vaccination status was inconsistently recorded in medical notes and may in part be explained by the fact that the pandemic vaccine was not introduced in the UK until late October 2009, so 54 of the pregnant women in the cohort would either not have had the opportunity to be vaccinated, or would not have seroconverted (if vaccinated), prior to illness onset. Although there were large amounts of missing data, the fact that only 7% of those for whom the pandemic vaccine would have been available in time to have offered protection were noted to have had it, compared with 25% noted not to have had it, suggests that coverage was low, as observed in other hospitalised cohorts.
