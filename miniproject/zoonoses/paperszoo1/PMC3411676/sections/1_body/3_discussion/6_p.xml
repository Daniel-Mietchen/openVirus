<p>Despite the apparent lack of effect of pregnancy on severe outcomes once hospitalised, it seems that influenza infection in pregnancy nevertheless has serious implications for maternal health since ten of the 11 pregnant women admitted to Level 2/3 care in this cohort required mechanical ventilation, and only three had co-morbid illnesses. Further studies with greater power are however required in order to definitively conclude this. Where co-morbidities were reported for pregnant women, asthma was most prevalent, which again aligns with observations in other case series.
