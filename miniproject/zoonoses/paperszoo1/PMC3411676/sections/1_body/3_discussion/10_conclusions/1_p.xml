<p>As judged by the need for hospital admission, this study corroborates previous evidence that pregnancy itself was a risk factor for significant illness due to A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. There is, however, little evidence from our data to suggest that maternal outcomes were any more or less severe than for non-pregnant women of a similar age in the UK, even when severity of illness at admission (indicated by respiratory distress), additional underlying co-morbidities and in-hospital anti-viral use were taken into account. However, some caution must be exercised due to the small numbers in the study. Despite national recommendations for early anti-viral treatment and vaccination, the former were either not accessed or not offered to one quarter of the pregnant women in this cohort at any point in the care pathway; and vaccine uptake was low amongst those for whom it was available. Both have been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency
