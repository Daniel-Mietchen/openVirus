<p>There was no evidence of a greater likelihood of severe outcomes in pregnant women as indicated by length of stay, requirement for Level 2/3 care or mortality. This held true even when adjusted for severity of illness on admission and underlying co-morbidities, or when comparing outcomes in women with no co-morbidities, through sensitivity analysis. The burden of mortality in other cohorts of pregnant women hospitalised with A(H1N1)pdm09 ranges from 1% 
 <xref rid="pone.0041638-Creanga2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> to 6% 
 <xref rid="pone.0041638-Louie1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and is not dissimilar from that observed in this case series. The risk of admission to intensive care does, however, appear to vary, some case series reporting this to be lower 
 <xref rid="pone.0041638-Creanga1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0041638-Creanga2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and others higher 
 <xref rid="pone.0041638-TheANZICInfluenza1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> when compared with infected non-pregnant women of a similar age. This may be explained by different criteria for admission to Level 2/3 care which exist in different countries, although even when considering only the most seriously ill women who required mechanical ventilation, there was still no apparent increase in the risk of death for pregnant women in this cohort. Other studies have found pregnant women with confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 in critical care experience higher rates of viral pneumonia despite a lack of difference in mortality 
 <xref rid="pone.0041638-MaraviPoma1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, but no statistically significant difference was observed in this cohort. Although this suggests that once hospitalised, outcomes for women of childbearing age in the FLU-CIN cohort were similar regardless of pregnancy, caution must be exercised due to the smaller number of observations and potential lack of power with which to detect a true underlying effect.
