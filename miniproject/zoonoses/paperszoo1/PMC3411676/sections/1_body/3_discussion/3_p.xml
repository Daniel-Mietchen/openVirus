<p>The high prevalence of pregnancy in this cohort of women aged 15–44 years, aligns with previous studies which suggest a marked increase in the likelihood of admission with A(H1N1)pdm09 when compared with non-pregnant women of similar age.

Pregnant women were significantly less likely to have underlying co-morbidities than non-pregnant women of childbearing age, emphasising the importance of pregnancy itself as a risk factor for hospitalisation. But despite the increased likelihood of admission for pregnant women, we found little evidence of greater illness severity at initial hospital assessment, as suggested by our findings that pregnant women were less likely to present with respiratory distress or require supplemental oxygen on admission. This does not appear to be confounded by the use of antiviral medication, since pregnant women were, if anything less likely to receive this pre-admission. Other factors such as a lower threshold, or alternative primary indication for hospital admission (such as obstetric complication) may be of more importance. The reason for admission was, however, not always reported making it difficult to explore this further by stratified analysis. Three quarters (74%) of the pregnant cohort required a hospital stay of two days or more, suggesting that ‘front door’ anxiety for the pregnant patient may not fully explain the increased admission rate.
