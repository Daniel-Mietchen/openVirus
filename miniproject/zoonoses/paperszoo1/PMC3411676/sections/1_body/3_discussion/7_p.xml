<p>Pregnant women were quickly identified as a priority group for both early anti-viral treatment and vaccination in the UK, as elsewhere. There was widespread availability of antiviral drugs in the community following establishment of a National Pandemic Flu Service in July 2009 
 <xref rid="pone.0041638-Department1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, and whilst 74% of pregnant women in this cohort were prescribed anti-viral medication only 10% (8/82) received these in the community prior to admission. It is difficult to determine whether earlier treatment would have altered the observed outcomes, but delayed treatment has been associated with an increased risk of severe illness in pregnant women in previous hospitalised case series.

 <xref rid="pone.0041638-Siston1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> Although differences in antiviral drug uptake between pregnant and non-pregnant women are small, this suggests an ongoing need to emphasise the use of early anti-viral therapy on suspicion of influenza and promote its acceptability for use during pregnancy in a pandemic situation.
