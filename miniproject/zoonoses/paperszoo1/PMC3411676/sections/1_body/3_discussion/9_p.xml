<p>Most women did not deliver during admission and were therefore not followed up as part of the FLU-CIN protocol. Of the sixteen women who did deliver during admission, three of the four who were admitted primarily with respiratory illness delivered pre-term babies and two mothers died post-partum. In comparison there was only one pre-term delivery and one maternal death amongst the ten women admitted for predominantly obstetric reasons. Adverse foetal outcomes following maternal influenza infection have previously been described,
