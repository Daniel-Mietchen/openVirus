<p>Serologic evidence of CCHFV in Turkey was reported in the 1970s (

 </xref>). The present survey indicates that the seroprevalence of CCHFV is higher in persons living in rural areas than in urban areas of the CCHFV epicenter in Turkey (12.8% vs 2.0%). However, because special markets for animal trading are located on the outskirts of large cities in Iran, CCHFV seroprevalence was found to be higher among persons living in urban areas than in persons living in rural areas of this country (
