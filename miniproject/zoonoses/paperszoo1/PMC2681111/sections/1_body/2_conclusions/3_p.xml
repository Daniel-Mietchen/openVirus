<p>We did not identify any association between seroprevalence and gender but found that CCHFV seropositivity increased with age. In these regions of Turkey, women contribute to farming and animal husbandry tasks and are exposed to ticks and livestock as often as men are. However, age &gt;40 years was significantly associated with CCHFV seropositivity and reflects the age of workers in Turkish agricultural areas (
