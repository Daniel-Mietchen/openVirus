<p>This study indicated that tick exposure is the most statistically significant transmission route for CCHFV in a high-risk population in Turkey. Effective tick prevention aids such as tick repellents may help reduce the risk. On the other hand, the absence of CCHFV seropositivity in 87.2% of the population after 4 CCHFV outbreaks in Turkey may suggest that this population remains at risk for infection in the future. This knowledge may help public health authorities determine appropriate CCHFV intervention and prevention methods.</p>
