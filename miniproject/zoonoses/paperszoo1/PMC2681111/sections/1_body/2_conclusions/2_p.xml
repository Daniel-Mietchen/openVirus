<p>In the present study, history of tick bite and history of tick removal from animals were found to be significantly associated with CCHFV seropositivity. The overall tick-bite frequency was 62% (483/782) among persons at high risk and has been reported among 40%â€“60% of CCHFV patients in Turkey (

Vector ticks are generally present on the ground and on animals, which explains the risk for CCHFV infection in persons who work in farming and animal husbandry. Personal protective measures such as regular examination of clothing and skin for ticks, tick removal, and use of repellents are important to prevent CCHFV infection (
