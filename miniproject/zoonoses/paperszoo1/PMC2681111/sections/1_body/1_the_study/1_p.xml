 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) who had a risk for CCHFV infection other than occupational risk (i.e., healthcare, slaughterhouse work, and veterinary care) were randomly selected for the study. Villages and districts were selected based on residences of patients who were diagnosed with CCHFV infection and treated at Cumhuriyet University Hospital, Sivas, Turkey, during the 2005 CCHFV outbreak. Men and women were included in the study, but children &lt;7 years of age were excluded because of difficulties in drawing blood samples and obtaining parental consent.
