<p>Of the 782 high-risk persons, 100 were positive for IgG against CCHFV (seroprevalence 12.8%). The sex ratio was ≈1:1 (390 females, 392 males). Forty-seven (12.1%) of 390 female participants and 53 (13.5%) of 392 male participants were seropositive for CCHFV (p&gt;0.05). Mean age was 41.5 years. Of the 100 serum samples collected in the urban population, only 2 (males 44 and 56 years of age) were seropositive. The CCHFV seroprevalence in the 782 persons at high risk increased significantly with age (p&lt;0.001). The highest proportion (23.5%) of seropositivity was found in persons 61–70 years of age (p&lt;0.001) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> shows distribution of the CCHFV seroprevalence in high-risk persons by age groups. The only variables significantly associated with presence of antibody against CCHFV were history of tick bite (p = 0.002) or of tick removal from the animals (p = 0.03), employment in animal husbandry (p = 0.01) or farming (p = 0.02), and age &gt;40 years (p&lt;0.001) (
