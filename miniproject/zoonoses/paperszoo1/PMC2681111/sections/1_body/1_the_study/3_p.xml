<p>The CCHFV Seroprevalence Study Team in Turkey included a physician and a nurse who went to the selected villages and approached the heads of the village and selected families. They explained the objectives of the study and asked for written informed consent from participants or parents of participating minors and then administered an interview-based questionnaire and collected a blood sample. The questionnaire considered the following variables: age; sex; history of tick bite, tick removal from animals, animal abortion, and animal slaughtering activity; close contact with a CCHFV patient or an animal; and occupation. Blood samples (10 mL each) were collected and later tested for antibodies to CCHFV by using immunoglobulin G (IgG) ELISA kits (Vector-Best; Kolsovo, Novosibirsk, Russia). SPSS version 10.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows software was used for statistical analysis. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used to compare categorical variables. Statistical significance was defined as a 2-tailed p value 
 <underline>&lt;</underline>0.05. Univariate analysis was used to identify the risk factors for seropositivity of CCHFV in the 782 participants.
