<p>Using EPI Info version 6 software (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA) and assuming a CCHFV seroprevalence of 10% in the study population with 99% confidence levels, we calculated error limits of Â± 3% and a design effect of 1. The estimated sample size required was 664, but the target sample size of high-risk persons was increased to 782. Another 100 persons who were not at high risk for CCHFV infection, but who lived in urban areas in the high-risk region and agreed to provide blood samples, were also included in the study. The study protocol was approved by the Cumhuriyet University Hospital Human Ethics Committee.</p>
