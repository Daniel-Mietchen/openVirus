<p>The 16 species of 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> collected in both zoos were typical of those in more rural areas of South Carolina. Suitable habitats for the immature stages of 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> are often abundant in zoos. The relatively higher numbers of 
 <italic>C. obsoletus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sanguisuga</italic> in this study are likely due to the abundance of larval habitats of these two species in the zoos, including moist leaves and dung-laden straw (

 <italic>C. guttipennis</italic> inhabits water-filled treeholes, a habitat found throughout the zoos and surrounding properties.
