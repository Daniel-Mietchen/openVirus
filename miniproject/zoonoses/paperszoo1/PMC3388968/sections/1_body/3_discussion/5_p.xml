<p>In zoos of South Carolina, surveillance for biting midges would best be served using UV traps because of the relatively greater abundance of biting midges caught by these traps and because no species was collected exclusively in incandescent traps. Competition from other incandescent light sources in and around a zoo likely reduces the collection efficiency of incandescent traps. The efficiency of traps for capturing biting midges differed geographically, and surveillance measures might need to be tailored for specific zoos. Surveillance programs should take into account the height at which biting midges seek hosts in the canopy. Some species in our study, such as 
 <italic>C. crepuscularis</italic> Malloch, 
 <italic>C. haematopotus</italic> Malloch, 
 <italic>C. hinmani</italic> Khalaf, 
 <italic>C. scanloni</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. villosipennis</italic> Root &amp; Hoffman, more frequently are collected higher in the canopy (
