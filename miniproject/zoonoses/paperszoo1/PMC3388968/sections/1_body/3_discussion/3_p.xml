<p>To our knowledge, 
 <italic>C. furens</italic> has never been collected as far inland as central South Carolina; it possibly reached this locale by following the Congaree River inland from coastal habitats. The salt marsh mosquito 
 <italic>Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus</italic> Wiedemann (Diptera: Culicidae) is routinely collected in the vicinity of the Riverbanks Zoo (Neider, unpublished data).
