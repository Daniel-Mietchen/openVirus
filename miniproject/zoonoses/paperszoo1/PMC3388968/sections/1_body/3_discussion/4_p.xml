<p>Several species of 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> in this study have been associated with vertebrate pathogens (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t03">Table 3</xref>). For example, 
 <italic>C. stellifer</italic> harbors Bluetongue virus in Alabama (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24">Mullen and Anderson 1998</xref>) and West Nile virus in Louisiana (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27">Sabio et al. 2006</xref>). Several species of 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> (e.g., 
 <italic>C. crepuscularis, C. haematopotus</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. hinmani</italic>) are vectors of 
 <italic>Haemoproteus</italic> spp. and filarial parasites. Some species also might transmit nematodes, protozoans, and viruses to captive animals in zoos. 
 <italic>C. obsoletus</italic> is a major vector of Bluetongue virus-8 in Europe and is the cause of epidemics throughout northern Europe (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22">Mehlhorn et al. 2007</xref>). However, in the United States and Canada, 
 <italic>C. sonorensis</italic> Wirth &amp; Jones is the primary vector of Bluetongue virus (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr05">Borkent 2005</xref>), and 
 <italic>C. obsoletus</italic> does not appear to be an effective vector in the Nearctic Region. Several other pathogens, if introduced into the United States, could possibly be transmitted by native species of 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic>. For example, 
 <italic>C. paraensis</italic> was collected from both zoos and is the only known vector of Oropouche virus, which causes nonfatal, febrile, flu-like infections in humans in South America and has been isolated from other primates and sloths (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23">Mullen 2002</xref>).
