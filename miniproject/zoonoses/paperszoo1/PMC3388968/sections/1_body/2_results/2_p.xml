<p>The incandescent traps, for both zoos combined, collected 38 individuals, representing 20% of the total number of 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> trapped. In the Greenville Zoo, the mean number of 
 <italic>C. guttipennis</italic> per trap night was significantly higher in UV traps than in incandescent traps (F
 <sub>2, 45</sub> = 12.8, p = 0.001) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t02">Table 2</xref>). In the Riverbanks Zoo, the mean number of 
 <italic>C. mulrenanni</italic> per trap night was not significantly higher in UV traps than in incandescent traps (F
 <sub>2, 45</sub> = 3.7, p = 0.06). Mean numbers of 
 <italic>C. obsoletus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sanguisuga</italic> caught per trap night were not analyzed statistically because they were not collected in incandescent traps.
