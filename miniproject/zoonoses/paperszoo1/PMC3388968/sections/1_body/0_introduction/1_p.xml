<p>Zoos can provide a valuable surveillance system for a variety of zoonoses. The initial isolation and identification of West Nile virus in the United States, for example, was performed by employees of the Bronx Zoo, New York, NY, in 1999 (

This initial isolation and recognition of West Nile virus became the impetus for a mosquito-surveillance program in the Bronx Zoo. However, most other American zoos have not initiated similar surveys to detect potential epizootics (Neider, unpublished). Eastern equine encephalitis virus was detected in whooping cranes,

 <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic>, was detected in a squirrel monkey, 
 <italic>Saimiri</italic> sp. (ca. 1989) and another unidentified monkey species (ca. 1988) in the Sacramento Zoo, California (
