<p>While the presence of arthropods such as mosquitoes and cockroaches has been documented in zoological settings (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14">Greenberg and Sanati 1970</xref>), biting midges have been overlooked, though there have been reports of the pathogens transmitted by these flies. For example, viral pathogens of birds (
 <italic>Avipoxvirus</italic> spp.), transmitted by biting midges and other biting flies, have been reported from two species of captive owls in two facilities in Florida (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr08">Deem et al. 1997</xref>). Species of 
 <italic>Haemoproteus</italic>, avian blood parasites transmitted by biting midges and other biting flies, have been recorded from infected birds in zoos of California (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28">Schrenzel et al. 2003</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36">Ziman et al. 2004</xref>), Michigan (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10">DeJong and Muzzall 2000</xref>), Oklahoma (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16">Halpern and Bennett 1983</xref>), and Texas (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13">Ferrell et al. 2007</xref>). These cases demonstrate that zoos can be foci of ceratopogonid-borne zoonoses, indicating the need for collaboration between veterinarians and entomologists.
