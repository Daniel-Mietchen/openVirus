 <italic>Phyllostachys aurea</italic> Carr. ex A. &amp; C. Rivière (Cyperales: Poaceae). Ground cover consisted of woody plants such as poison ivy 
 <italic>Toxicodendron radicans</italic> L. (Sapindales: Anacardiaceae) and Virginia creeper 
 <italic>Parthenocissus quinquefolia</italic> L. (Vitales: Fitaceae). To provide a source of CO2, all traps were baited with 2.0–2.5 kg of dry ice in insulated dry-ice containers placed immediately above the traps (Igloo, Trap Model 812, John W. Hock Company).
