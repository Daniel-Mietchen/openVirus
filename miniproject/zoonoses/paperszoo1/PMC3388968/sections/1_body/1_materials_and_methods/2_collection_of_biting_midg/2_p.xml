<p>Biting midges were collected from May to August 2007, using incandescent and UV traps. Two traps of each type were used in the Greenville Zoo, and three of each type were used in the Riverbanks Zoo. Incandescent and UV traps were run simultaneously for four consecutive nights per month, beginning at 16:00 h, and trap-collection containers (containing live biting midges) were retrieved at 08:00 h each of the four consecutive mornings. A trap night was defined as the period from deployment of a single trap until collection the next morning. Dead animals and nests, when available, also were examined for flies.</p>
