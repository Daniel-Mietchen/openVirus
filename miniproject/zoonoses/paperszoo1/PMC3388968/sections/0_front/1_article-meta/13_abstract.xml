 <p>Biting midges of the genus 
  <italic>Culicoides</italic> (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) were collected during the summer of 2007 at the Greenville and Riverbanks Zoos in South Carolina with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) traps equipped with ultraviolet or incandescent lights and baited with carbon dioxide. Sixteen species of 
  <italic>Culicoides</italic> were collected, four of which represented more than 80%. They were 
  <italic>Culicoides guttipennis</italic> (Coquillett), 
  <italic>Culicoides mulrenanni</italic> Beck, 
  <italic>Culicoides obsoletus</italic> (Meigen), and 
  <italic>Culicoides sanguisuga</italic> (Coquillett). 
  <italic>C. guttipennis</italic> was found on a dead colobus monkey and a dead golden-headed lion tamarin; 
  <italic>Culicoides husseyi</italic> Wirth &amp; Blanton was collected from an unidentified, abandoned bird's nest. Ultraviolet light-equipped traps captured significantly more 
  <italic>Culicoides</italic> specimens than traps with incandescent light. Half of the collected species previously have been associated with vertebrate pathogens, indicating a potential risk to captive animals.
