 <title>Human adaptation of avian H5N1 viruses</title>
 <p id="Par2">The importance and public-safety implications of two papers describing the production of ferret-transmissible H5N1 influenza viruses, one published in 
  <italic>Nature</italic> and one in 
  <italic>Science</italic>, have divided opinion among researchers and policy-makers. In this Perspective, David Morens, Kanta Subbarao and Jeffery Taubenberger review the scientific basis of assumptions underlying the decisions by the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity â€” first to postpone the publication of redacted papers, and then to recommended the publication of more complete manuscripts. When considering the threat of bioterrorism or accidental release of genetically engineered viruses, the authors point out that nature is the ultimate bioterrorist. To prepare for the possibility of future devastating influenza pandemics, the crucial importance of advancing scientific knowledge needs to be kept front and centre.
