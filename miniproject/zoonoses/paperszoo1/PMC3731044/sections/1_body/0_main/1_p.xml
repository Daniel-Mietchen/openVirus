 </sup>. Some have emphasized that understanding the underlying principles of influenza virus host adaptation and transmission can lead to better prevention and control of viruses that arise naturally, whereas others have drawn attention to ‘dual use’ implications—that is, bioterrorism—or to accidental release of potentially deadly viruses. The most commonly mentioned public safety concerns relate to three assumptions: (1) H5N1 viruses are currently highly lethal to humans but are poorly transmissible; (2) genetic manipulation of H5N1 viruses to increase transmissibility in mammals such as ferrets will create variant viruses that remain highly pathogenic and that become transmissible in humans; and (3) if accidentally or intentionally released, such a virus could precipitate a historically severe influenza pandemic. How do these assumptions hold up against scientific data? In this perspective, we address research evidence related to the epidemic/pandemic potential of genetically engineered H5N1 viruses, and discuss limitations in understanding how influenza viruses become pathogenic, transmissible and potentially pandemic in humans.
