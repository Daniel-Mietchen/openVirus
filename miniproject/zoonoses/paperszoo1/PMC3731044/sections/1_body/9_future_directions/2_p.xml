<p id="Par31">In the past two decades the question of pursuing and publishing potential ‘dual use’ infectious disease research has always been decided in favour of conducting and publishing the research; for example, delineating the genomes of smallpox

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>
 </sup> and SARS viruses
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>
 </sup>, defining the pathogenicity of neuraminidase-inhibitor-resistant influenza viruses
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>
 </sup>, genetically altering and making ferret transmissible both a more pathogenic pandemic H2N2 influenza virus
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>
 </sup> and an H9N2 avian influenza virus
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup>, and resurrecting from RNA fragments, recreating and studying 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> the 1918 pandemic influenza virus
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>
 </sup>. In the latter case, important findings already have markedly enhanced our understanding of the emergence, transmissibility and pathogenicity of that important virus, helping us to prepare for and respond to the emergence of other influenza viruses. Examples include using the 1918 HA crystal structure in vaccine design

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>,
