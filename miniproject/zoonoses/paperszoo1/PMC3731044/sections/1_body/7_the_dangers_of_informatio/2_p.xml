<p id="Par25">Such studies feature numerous pathogenicity-associated, and sometimes transmissibility-associated, mutations affecting the HA-receptor-binding site, including changes that enhance receptor affinity for Î±2-6-linked sialic acid receptors, thought to be important for human adaptation

Withholding or redacting them does not prevent anyone from piecing together the basic information that they contain. Most of this information is generally known and relatively obvious, has already been published, and is now being widely publicized and discussed as a result of increased attention
