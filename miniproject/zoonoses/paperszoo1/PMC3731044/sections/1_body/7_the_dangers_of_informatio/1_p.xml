<p id="Par24">Owing to global concern over a possible H5N1 influenza pandemic, the pathogenicity, immunogenicity and transmissibility of naturally occurring and laboratory-derived H5N1 viruses have been examined extensively and safely using high-containment facilities and appropriate regulatory and safety oversight (see later). The two H5N1 studies under discussion

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup> build upon and are the logical extensions of dozens of similar published studies performed in the wake of the 1997 Hong Kong H5N1 outbreak. This research includes another published study in which genetic engineering of the H5N1 virus was able to newly create transmissibility in ferrets

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>
 </sup>, and a study in which transmissibility was restored and arguably increased in guinea pigs
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>
 </sup>. None of these publications, including the prior publication of engineered H5N1 transmissibility in ferrets, led to concern among scientists, federal agencies or the public.
