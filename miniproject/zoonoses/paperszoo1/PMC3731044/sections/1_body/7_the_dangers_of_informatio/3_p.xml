<p id="Par26">Some would argue that even this background research should not have been done, or should henceforth be classified and made available only to ‘approved’ scientists who would be vetted by yet-to-be-determined mechanisms

 </sup>. But had these former studies not been made available in the open literature, the field of influenza research would have been considerably impeded and our current state of knowledge and readiness for responding to future outbreaks and/or pandemics would be lessened. Some proposed that ‘censoring’ this information actually increases the risk of bioterrorism

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup> can help augment surveillance to detect naturally emerging viruses with pandemic potential and expand our knowledge of the principles underlying host adaptation. Although the dangers of ‘information release’ in the case of these two studies is probably small or nil—because all or most of the critical information is widely available anyway—it nevertheless remains important to rethink larger questions about balancing safety (accidental or deliberate release of an influenza virus or any dangerous pathogen) with the need to study such viruses to learn enough of their biology to prevent and control them. These are important issues that should be discussed broadly among scientists, policy makers and the public.
