<p id="Par6">Among many other important research areas related to influenza, it is therefore critical to study the mechanisms by which influenza viruses emerge from birds to become adapted to mammals and ultimately humans, and to learn how the phenotypic properties of such evolving viruses may be associated with human transmission and disease. Among the many subtypes and strains of avian influenza A viruses that exist in nature, those that have at least occasionally infected mammals (for example, H5N1, H7N7 and H9N2) are of interest because they might theoretically be more likely than other influenza A viruses to adapt directly or indirectly to humans. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses have been of particular interest with respect to theoretical pandemic potential because they have been unusually pathogenic in domestic poultry and have infected and killed several hundred people over a 15-year period.</p>
