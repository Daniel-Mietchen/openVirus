<p id="Par5">Influenza is among the leading global infectious causes of death, periodically causing pandemics that can kill millions of people. Countless influenza A viruses circulate globally in a reservoir that consists of hundreds of avian species. Rarely, one of these viruses undergoes changes that enable it to switch hosts to infect mammals, including humans, although it is not clear whether human transmission can result directly from adaptation of an avian influenza virus (this has not been documented to occur), or only indirectly via further adaptation of pre-existing human or mammalian-adapted viruses, the mechanism that has been associated with all known pandemic and seasonal viruses after 1918. The factors underlying all such emergences are poorly understood

 </sup>. In the past 80 years of influenza virology, three pandemics have resulted from reassortments of pre-existing human-adapted or mammalian-adapted viruses with one or more avian-influenza-derived genes, but no purely avian influenza virus has emerged to cause a pandemic or human outbreak, or has even become stably adapted to humans. However, because avian influenza viruses have adapted to other mammals, it is considered plausible that such an emergence could occur in humans.
