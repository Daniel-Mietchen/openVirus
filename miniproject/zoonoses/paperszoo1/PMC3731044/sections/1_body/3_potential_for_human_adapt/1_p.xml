<p id="Par10">It is questionable to what extent HPAI H5N1 is adapted to, or capable of adapting to, humans. It is not clear why one evolving lineage of avian HPAI H5N1 viruses, out of a large and genetically divergent pool of H5 and other avian influenza viruses that rarely infect humans (much less cause severe human disease), has recently infected hundreds or perhaps thousands of people. It may be that the human cases are a result of unusual high-dose exposures or rare individual genetic susceptibilities. Alternatively, H5N1 viruses may be beginning to do something no other HPAI virus has ever been documented to doâ€”adapt directly to humans. And if H5N1 did adapt, could it cause a pandemic?</p>
