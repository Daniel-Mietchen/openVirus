<p id="Par12">Despite circulation of influenza A viruses of 16 HA subtypes in billions of birds over a very long time span, the four pandemics in the last century have been restricted to influenza viruses bearing HA subtypes H1, H2 or H3. Decades ago, many experts predicted that influenza pandemics could be explained by ‘recycling’ of a small number of HAs in new human generations; more recently, this belief has been expanded to posit that the other HA subtypes (including H5) are fundamentally incapable of adapting to humans, being selected against by biological constraints or unappreciated selection pressures

Despite widespread influenza virus circulation and dynamic evolution at the human–animal interface, with many billions of quasispecies, mutations and gene constellations circulating, only four influenza pandemics have occurred in the last century, and in the three of those with a known viral origin the viruses resulted from reassortment of pre-existing human or swine viruses
