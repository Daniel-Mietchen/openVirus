<p id="Par11">No HPAI virus in the historic record has ever been efficiently transmitted between humans, let alone caused a pandemic. Even when avian influenza virus genes have been imported by reassortment into existing human influenza viruses, as happened for example in 1957 with H2N2 influenza and in 1968 with H3N2 influenza, the sources seem to have been circulating low-pathogenicity avian viruses, not poultry-adapted viruses such as HPAI viruses

 </sup>. Conceivably, the considerable host-switching mutations associated with adaptation of wild bird viruses to gallinaceous poultry, or at least of wild viruses to HPAI poultry viruses, represent an evolutionary pathway divergent from those pathways associated with mammalian adaptation, seemingly presenting an additional challenge for poultry-adapted influenza viruses to achieve efficient mammalian adaptation

 </sup>. After 15 years of high-density enzootic circulation in domestic poultry around the world, no human-adapted H5N1 virus has emerged from a natural reservoir, suggesting the existence of unknown biological barriers.
