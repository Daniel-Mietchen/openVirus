<p id="Par8">The ongoing HPAI H5N1 enzootic continues to cause ‘spill-over’ human infections. World Health Organization (WHO) data indicate that since 2003, HPAI H5N1 viruses have infected 603 people and killed 356 (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>). Technically, the term ‘highly pathogenic’ refers only to the effects of certain H5 and H7 influenza viruses in poultry, not in humans or other mammals; most such viruses either cannot infect, or are relatively harmless in, humans. HPAI H5 and H7 phenotypes are both associated with mutations in the haemagglutinin (HA) gene that usually result from insertion of a sequence of codons encoding multiple basic amino acids at the location where the two linked protein domains comprising the mature HA are cleaved during infection

 </sup>. This cleavage site change leads to disseminated viral replication in multiple organs of avian species, resulting in high mortality. However, in humans, who cannot be easily infected with most low pathogenicity or HPAI viruses, if they can be infected at all, efficient replication outside the respiratory tract generally does not occur. Therefore, despite the current unusual situation with H5N1 viruses in humans since 2003 (see below), neither H5N1 nor other HPAI viruses would necessarily replicate systemically or cause extreme pathogenicity should human adaptation occur. Although the basis of HPAI H5N1 viral pathogenicity in severe and fatal human cases remains unknown, there is no evidence suggesting that it results from changes known to be associated with viral adaptation to gallinaceous poultry; in fact, no human-adapted or pandemic influenza virus contains genetic changes indicative of prior poultry adaptation.
