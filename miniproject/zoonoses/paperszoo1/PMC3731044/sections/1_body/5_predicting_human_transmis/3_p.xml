<p id="Par17">Moreover, because determinants of viral pathogenicity may be lost upon adaptation to a new host, H5N1 viruses, whether or not transmissible, do not always cause severe disease in ferrets or non-human primates

 </sup>. For these reasons viral phenotypes observed in animal models like the ferret may not predict what would happen in humans. Indeed, given that many influenza viruses that are non-pathogenic for humans easily transmit and may cause illness in ferrets, the ‘ferret model’ does not reliably predict human transmissibility or pathogenicity, although the model remains valuable for understanding the principles and dynamics of infection.
