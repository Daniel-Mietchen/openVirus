<p id="Par18">In addition to data from experiments in mammals, it is noteworthy that of the many mammalian-adapted influenza viruses that infect and transmit explosively among pigs, among horses and among dogs, few infect humans and none are transmitted between them

 </sup>, outbreaks associated with human influenza viruses are rare in pigs. It is even conceivable that H5N1 viruses have already become adapted to mammals without causing severe disease or onward transmission to humans. Evidence from Chinaâ€™s Qinghai Lake, for example, shows 13.4% H5N1 seropositivity and 3.4% active infection in apparently healthy, live-caught rodents called pikas

 </sup>. Clearly, adaptation of an influenza virus to a specific mammalian host does not necessarily predict its infectiousness, pathogenicity or transmissibility in other mammals, even though valuable insights into mechanisms of disease, host responses, and prevention and treatment may be obtained by studying these particular animals. Such insights can provide valuable clues in designing countermeasures against deadly epidemics and pandemics.
