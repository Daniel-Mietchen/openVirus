<p id="Par16">These useful traits of easy infectability and mildly symptomatic infection have rendered the ferret a ‘permissive’ influenza model. Specifically, many naturally occurring influenza viruses that infect, and often transmit between, ferrets are not known to infect people or cause human disease

 </sup>. Ferrets are thus an imperfect model for predicting human infectivity or transmissibility, let alone the high level of transmissibility characteristic of pandemic spread. On the basis of public presentations by the senior authors of the two studies in question, neither of the engineered H5N1 viruses was as efficiently transmissible in ferrets as the human-adapted 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus

 </sup>. Phenotypic properties such as replication, pathogenicity and transmissibility are likely to be polygenic traits driven by mutations that are independent and possibly competing

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. Transmissibility is a complex phenotype that probably requires cooperative changes in more than one gene segment, and these may differ greatly between different viruses that become transmissible. Mutations that confer transmissibility in a ferret may be species-specific and irrelevant to other hosts

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>
 </sup>. There are probably multiple unique virus-specific pathways to transmissibility for particular viruses infecting particular hosts

 </sup>. For example, transmissibility of the 1918 pandemic H1N1 virus has been linked to changes in the genes encoding HA and PB2 proteins

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup>, whereas transmissibility of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, which has a closely related HA, has been linked to gene segments encoding the neuraminidase and matrix proteins
