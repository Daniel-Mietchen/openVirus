<p id="Par15">It is unclear whether genetic manipulation of an H5N1 virus to achieve transmissibility in a particular mammal such as a ferret can predict human transmissibility. Because natural history and viral challenge studies cannot always be performed in humans, they have been conducted in experimental animals including mice, guinea pigs, ferrets, non-human primates and various other mammals. Unfortunately, there is no perfect animal model capable of reproducing all of the important variables involved in human influenza infection, although each animal model may be useful in understanding some aspect of influenza biology. Unlike most other mammals, ferrets generally can be infected with many or most avian, mammalian and human influenza viruses without prior viral adaptation, and often transmit efficiently between them
