<p id="Par27">As novel pathogens emerge, scientists must be able to continue to work with them safely and appropriately in teams using the talents of many highly trained researchers. Numerous layers of robust biosafety and biosecurity protection and oversight are in place to safeguard the scientists and the public alike, including rigorous safety training, biocontainment practices, regulations and oversight, select agent rules, background investigations and biosurety oversight
