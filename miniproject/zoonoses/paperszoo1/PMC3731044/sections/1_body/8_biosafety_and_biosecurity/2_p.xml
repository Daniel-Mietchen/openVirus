<p id="Par28">Few disagree that it is crucial to continue research with H5N1 and other emerging infections, including investigation of how emerging pathogens adapt to new hosts and cause disease. However, it is important to ask whether some types of infectious diseases research should not be done, or not published openly. If so, we need criteria to identify such research in advance, and processes to balance the importance of the research knowledge with the importance of preventing adverse consequences of the research
