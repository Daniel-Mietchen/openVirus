Continued discussion and decisions about how to deal with this research will be of importance to scientific progress and public health. We believe that it is important to consider the broader context of research aimed at understanding how influenza viruses adapt to humans. H5N1 is only one of many avian influenza viruses. If, as we believe existing data suggest, pathways to human adaptation are many, virus-specific, and with few common denominators, it will be important to study not just H5N1 but a wide range of avian and mammalian- and human-adapted viruses, including studies that feature backward genetic engineering to remove phenotypic determinants of adaptation, studies in nonhuman primates and, when safe and appropriate to do so, in human challenge studies
