<p id="Par22">Given such confusing information, there has been little agreement so far on the important question of asymptomatic and undetected H5N1 infections. But whatever the case, unless healthy seropositive people detected in seroprevalence studies temporally and geographically associated with H5N1 cases are all falsely seropositive, their addition to exposure denominators greatly decreases case-fatality determinations. For example, the 1997 Hong Kong H5N1 outbreak case-fatality rate of 33.3% (ref.

Similar recalculations of other data would yield far lower rates, and wider seroprevalence studies would undoubtedly lower case-fatality rates even further.
