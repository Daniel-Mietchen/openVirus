<p id="Par19">Belief that an H5N1 virus could produce a 59% pandemic case-fatality rate is the most frightening aspect of the current controversy surrounding aerosol transmission of H5N1 virus in ferrets. In 500 years of observation, no influenza pandemic is believed to have caused a case-fatality rate over about 2% (ref.

 </sup> features diagnostic severity criteria (evidence of an acute pneumonia on chest radiograph plus evidence of respiratory failure) that constitute a self-fulfilling prophecy for fatality; as with many illnesses studied epidemiologically, severe diseases are more likely to receive optimal diagnostic work-up (‘detection bias’); and most H5N1 cases have been reported from countries with limited resources for identifying milder cases, if they occurred. These factors together could combine to erroneously inflate case-fatality calculations by over-counting severe cases and under-counting mild cases
