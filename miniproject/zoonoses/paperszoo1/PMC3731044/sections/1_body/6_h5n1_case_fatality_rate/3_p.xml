<p id="Par21">A published meta-analysis of selected seroprevalence studies implies that the actual H5N1 case-fatality rate may be far below 1% (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>), and thus probably far below the case-fatality rates for seasonal influenza. This has been disputed because it has been difficult to find mild cases, and because of the possibility that some low-level antibody titres (&lt;1:80) might be false positives
