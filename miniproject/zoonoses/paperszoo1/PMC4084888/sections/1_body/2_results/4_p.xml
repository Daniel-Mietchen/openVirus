<p>According to the matrix scatter, we knew that natural logarithm of incidence and two variables of rat density and rat's virus carriage rate was basically in linear distribution. And most of the standardized residuals obeyed normal distribution depended on normal probablity plot of standardized residual plots. Through making residuals plot, it showed that standardized residual did not vary with the change of values of variable.</p>
