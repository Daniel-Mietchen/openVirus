<p>SPSS13.0 software was used to explore associations between HFRS incidence and relevant factors including rat density, rat's virus carriage rate, annual NDVI, yearly precipitation, yearly average temperature, and number of sunny days per year. A multivariate linear analysis was performed to build a model using the variables rat density(X
 <sub>1</sub>) and rat's virus carriage rate (X
 <sub>2</sub>). Other variables were tested to see if they would improve the model fit. Adding the variable annual NDVI(X
 <sub>3</sub>) did lead to a more accurate model.
