  <title>Neighbor joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) strains based on a 1677 nt fragment, which extends from the 3′ end of the capsid to the 5′ end of E1 within the structural protein genome region.</title>
  <p>The tree shows the clustering pattern of the sequences obtained from this study as well as representative strains that were available from the GenBank database. VEEV subtype IIIA Mucambo virus was used as the outgroup. Trees generated using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood (ML) methods had identical topologies. The numbers adjacent to the nodes indicate NJ bootstrap values for 1000 replicates. The scale bar represents the number of nucleotide substitutions per site, and the brackets indicate the genotypes of the subtype IE VEEVs and some geographical/temporal data within the Gulf/Caribbean IE genotype. Sequence names are marked by VEEV subtype, a two-letter abbreviation for the country of origin, a two digit number indicating year of isolation, and the strain name. Pacific IE genotypes are represented by blue, Gulf/Caribbean IE genotypes are represented by green, and Panama IE genotypes are represented by red. Recent isolates (2008–2010) are printed in bold.</p>
