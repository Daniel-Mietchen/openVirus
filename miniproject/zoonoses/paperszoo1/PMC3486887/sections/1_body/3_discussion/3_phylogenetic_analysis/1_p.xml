<p>Based on our phylogenetic analyses, all VEEV isolates from the municipality of Minatitlan fall within the Gulf/Caribbean IE genotype. The results indicate that the VEEV strains currently circulating in the State of Veracruz probably evolved from those circulating in this area nearly 50 years ago. These results also suggest that there have been no introductions of the VEEV Pacific genotype (or the Panama genotype) into this region of the Gulf Coast. Sequence analysis did not show a Serâ†’Arg change at amino acid position 218 of the envelope glycoprotein E2, which has been previously implicated in the adaptation of subtype IE VEEV to the epizootic mosquito vector,

 <xref rid="pntd.0001875-Brault1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Future phylogenetic studies should include isolates from all regions of the Gulf Coast to determine whether the Pacific Coast lineage with epizootic potential has been introduced into other areas of Mexico.
