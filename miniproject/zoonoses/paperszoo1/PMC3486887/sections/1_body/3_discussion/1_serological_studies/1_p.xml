<p>Almost 50 years since the first studies of VEEV in the State of Veracruz, we determined that this virus continues to circulate in this and other states in the Gulf Coast region and is primarily located in the coastal ecosystems. Based on equine serologic data obtained in 2003â€“2004, the VEEV endemic region probably extends from the State of Tamaulipas in the north, which borders Texas, to the State of Tabasco in the south. To confirm active transmission of VEEV, more direct studies should be performed that measure virus activity, including performing virus isolations from mosquitoes in these regions. The highest seroprevalence occurred in the State of Veracruz, primarily involving the municipalities of Minatitlan, A. R. Cabada, and Las Choapas in the southern region of the state. Our serological data also demonstrated that VEEV is probably circulating in other southern regions of Mexico, including the municipalities of Tenosique and Balancan in the State of Tabasco, near the Guatemalan border. In the north, we also found seropositive horses in several towns in the State of Tamaulipas, in close proximity to the Texas border. However, it was unclear due to the lack of information regarding vaccination status and travel history whether these horses had been exposed to VEEV naturally in this region. It was, however, confirmed that horses in a more southern location in the State of Tamaulipas (Aldama municipality) were probably exposed to naturally circulating VEEV, since these horses were confirmed unvaccinated and did not have a history of traveling from this site since birth.</p>
