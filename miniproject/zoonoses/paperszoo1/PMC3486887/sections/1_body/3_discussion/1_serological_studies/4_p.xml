<p>Human sera were obtained from a study of suspected dengue infected patients during an outbreak in 2008–2009 in the State of Veracruz, in which the seroprevalence for VEEV was estimated to be 19.2% (45/234). Since these results only confirm prior exposure to VEEV, more work would be needed to verify that the febrile illnesses were due to VEE. Using diagnoses based on virus isolation and serology, Watts et al. 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001875-Watts1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> reported that VEEV was responsible for at least 3% of febrile illnesses occurring in the Amazon basin of Peru, an area that is also endemic for both dengue and VEE. This trend has also been observed in the Pacific Coast region of Chiapas, Mexico [JGEF and SCW, unpublished data]. According to data from the Mexican Health Ministry (

Therefore, if it is assumed that 3% of these febrile cases were due to VEEV, at least 376 people in this region may have been infected with VEEV.
