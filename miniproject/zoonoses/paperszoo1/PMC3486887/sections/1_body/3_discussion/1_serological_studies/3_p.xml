<p>More than 13.1 million people live in the Gulf Coast region of Mexico, and a large proportion of this population lives in the coastal lowlands of the three states that we studied 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001875-Instituto1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. However, one missing element in our studies was the lack of a true understanding of the impact of VEEV as a human disease burden in populations living in coastal ecosystems along the Mexican Gulf Coast. The same problem holds true for regions on the Pacific Coast of Mexico, which primarily involve mangrove habitats. Endemic infections due to VEEV are rarely confirmed, because there are other more common etiologies of febrile illness in these regions, such as dengue. Clinically, a mild case of VEE is easily confused with dengue fever and other arboviral diseases, and a confirmatory laboratory diagnosis is rarely pursued due to the cost. The disease burden due to VEEV in the Gulf Coast of Mexico is therefore probably greatly underestimated
