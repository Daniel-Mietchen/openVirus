<p>Overall, our results indicate that the epidemiological pattern of VEEV in Mexico may be changing. According to the 2010 census, more than 75% of Mexican people reside in urban centers 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001875-Instituto1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Our study showed that at least one major urban region (Minatitlan in the State of Veracruz) has active enzootic VEEV transmission. Thus, an epidemic strain of VEEV has the potential to arise from circulating endemic strains, which may be easily misdiagnosed for another febrile-causing disease if appropriate diagnostic assays are not routinely performed. The movement of epidemics by viremic individuals is another concern, particularly in the Gulf Coast region of Mexico, which could threaten previously unaffected areas of Mexico and even the U.S. These scenarios underscore an urgent need for public health policy makers of Mexico and the U.S. as well as the scientific community to continue to develop strategies for the prevention and control of VEE.
