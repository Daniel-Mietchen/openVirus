<p>Our rodent data potentially support the observations from the State of Chiapas on the Pacific Coast that multiple rodent species have the capacity to contribute to the maintenance of VEEV in nature 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001875-Deardorff2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Based on previous work, sylvatic rodents from the family 
 <italic>Cricetidae</italic>, especially in the genera 
 <italic>Oryzomys</italic> and 
 <italic>Sigmodon</italic>, appear to be involved as reservoir hosts of enzootic VEEV because they are abundant, develop viremia, and exhibit high rates of immunity

 <xref rid="pntd.0001875-Walton1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001875-Deardorff2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001875-Salas1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. However, more extensive studies are clearly indicated to definitely identify which reservoir hosts have the ability to transmit VEEV to mosquito vectors in the Gulf Coast region. Our data also does not rule out the possibility that other rodent species within communities along the Gulf Coast region play a role in the maintenance of VEEV. Future surveillance studies should include larger geographic regions and more rodent (and other mammalian) species.
