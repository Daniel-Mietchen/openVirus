<p>Our data shows that sylvatic rodents of the genera 
 <italic>Sigmodon</italic> and 
 <italic>Oryzomys</italic> were exposed to VEEV, probably during the enzootic circulation of the virus in the regions of Minatitlan that were considered “hotspots” of VEEV activity. The rodent trappings, which were conducted in swampy areas of Minatitlan, reinforce the view that enzootic VEEV circulates in humid tropical habitats. In our study, the seroprevalence in 
 <italic>Oryzomys chapmani</italic> was 83%, and in 
 <italic>Sigmodon toltecus</italic>, the seroprevalence was 33%; this is the first report describing the seroprevalence for VEEV in rodent species that are native to the Gulf Coast region of Mexico. 
 <italic>Sigmodon toltecus</italic> was previously classified by mitochondrial DNA typing as a subspecies of the 
 <italic>Sigmodon hispidus</italic> species group 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001875-Peppers1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, and primarily located in the lowlands of eastern Mexico. 
 <italic>Oryzomys chapmani</italic> (Chapman's rice rat) was recently reassigned to the genus 
 <italic>Handleyomis</italic> in the family 
 <italic>Cricetidae</italic>. This rat, also known as 
 <italic>Handleyomis chapmani</italic>, is found mainly in the highlands of the States of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, and Oaxaca. However, this is the first report of this species in the lowlands of the State of Veracruz
