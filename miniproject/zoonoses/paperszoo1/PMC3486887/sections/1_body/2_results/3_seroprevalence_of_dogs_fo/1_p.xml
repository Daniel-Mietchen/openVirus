<p>In 2008–2009, companion dogs were serosurveyed in areas surrounding Ejido Coachapa in the municipality of Minatitlan in the State of Veracruz. Sera were tested in all cases by both PRNT and HI assays, and there were no differences in the results. All 6 of the dogs tested were seropositive for VEEV with titers ranging from 1∶80–1∶640 by HI and 1∶40–1∶320 by PRNT. The dogs were 6–8 months old, suggesting recent VEEV exposure.</p>
