Cabada, and Las Choapas, the seroprevalence for VEEV was 100%. In the State of Tabasco, the seroprevalence for VEEV in equids was 52% (265/506). The southernmost areas, where VEEV-positive sera were detected, included the municipalities of Balancan and Tenosique in the State of Tabasco, which border Guatemala. In these municipalities, equine seroprevalence for VEEV was â‰¥58%. For the municipalities of Macuspana and Paraiso, the seroprevalence for VEEV was 100%.
