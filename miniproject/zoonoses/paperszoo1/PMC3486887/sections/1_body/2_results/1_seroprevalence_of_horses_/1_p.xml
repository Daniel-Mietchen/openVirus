<p>A total of 714 equine sera collected in 2003–2004 from the Gulf Coast States of Tamaulipas (n = 129), Veracruz (n = 79), and Tabasco (n = 506), as part of a large West Nile virus epidemiology study conducted by the Mexican Ministry of Agriculture, was analyzed for VEEV antibodies 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001875-EstradaFranco1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Sera were tested in most cases by both PRNT and HI assays, and the results of these assays were consistently either positive or negative for VEEV. Horse sera collected in the State of Tamaulipas in 2003–2004 were also tested by ELISA, and the results of this assay were consistent with those of the PRNT and HI assays. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001875-g001">Fig. 1</xref> shows the geographic distribution and equine seropositivity in the municipalities of these states. None of the seropositive horses from this study were previously vaccinated against VEE. Further, compulsory VEE vaccination of horses with the live attenuated vaccine, TC-83, can only be carried out by the Agricultural Committees in the Pacific region of the State of Chiapas, and vaccination in other states is not permitted in the absence of an outbreak. Of 129 equids tested from the State of Tamaulipas, 22 (17% seroprevalence) had VEEV antibodies (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001875-t002">Table 2</xref>). Four of the 22 seropositive horses (4–8 years old) were from 3 towns in the State of Tamaulipas (Camargo, Diaz Ordaz, and Matamoros) located near the U.S. border. Two horses from Matamoros were seropositive for VEEV by PRNT [1∶40] and IgG ELISA, while the other horses from Camargo (n = 1) and Diaz Ordaz (n = 1) were seropositive by both IgG and HI tests. Unfortunately, information regarding the travel histories of all 4 horses was lacking.
