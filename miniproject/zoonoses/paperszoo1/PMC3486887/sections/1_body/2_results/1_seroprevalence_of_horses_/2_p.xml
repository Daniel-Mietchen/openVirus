<p>For the 91 horses that were tested in the municipality of Aldama, 15 were seropositive, 7 of which were located in a research station and had never been transported from this area since birth. It was also confirmed in medical records that these horses were never immunized against VEEV, supporting the possibility of local enzootic exposure. Based on these results, more direct studies would need to be conducted to confirm active transmission of VEEV in this region.</p>
