<p>In 2008–2009 in the municipality of Minatitlan, 3 species of rodents were trapped in Ejidos Coachapa, in a grassland area near the center of the town (N17°53′25.50″; W94°33′33.30″) and in Ejidos Tacoteno (N18°00′24.62″; W94°30′56.72″). Traps were placed next to swampy pastures and streams of farms where sentinel hamster mortalities and/or positive equine and bovine serology for VEEV had been previously reported. The following rodents were trapped in these locations: 
 <italic>Sigmodon toltecus</italic> (n = 12), 
 <italic>Oryzomys chapmani</italic> (n = 6), and 
 <italic>Rattus rattus</italic> (n = 1). Sera collected from the wild-caught rodents were tested in all cases by both PRNT and HI assays, and the results were consistently either positive or negative for VEEV. The 
 <italic>Rattus rattus</italic> (n = 1) was seronegative for VEEV; however, 4 of the 12 
 <italic>Sigmodon toltecus</italic> were seropositive for VEEV, 3 of which were from Ejido Tacoteno and 1 from Ejido Coachapa. Five of the 6 
 <italic>Oryzomys chapmani</italic> collected from Ejido Tacoteno were also seropositive for VEEV, suggesting the possible involvement of these rodents in VEEV circulation in this region as in the Pacific Coast
