<p>In 2010, equine and bovine serosurveys were also performed in the northern region of the State of Veracruz, involving 6 municipalities (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001875-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). As before, sera were tested in almost all cases by both PRNT and HI assays, and the results of these assays were consistently either positive or negative for VEEV. The overall seroprevalence for VEEV was 30% (38/126) in bovids and 59% (23/39) in equids. However, for the municipalities of Tuxpan and Tamiahua, the equine seroprevalences for VEEV were as high as 69% and 75%, respectively. Although the sample sizes were small for individual farms (n = 4 or 10) in the municipality of Tamiahua, VEEV antibodies were detected in at least 75% of the sampled bovids and/or equids on the Barra and Tamiahua farms.
