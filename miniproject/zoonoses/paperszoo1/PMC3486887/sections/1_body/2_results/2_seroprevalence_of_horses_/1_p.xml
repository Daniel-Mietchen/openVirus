<p>Based on the work conducted in 2003–2004, the State of Veracruz was the most active region for VEEV circulation with an overall equine seroprevalence of 72% (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001875-t002">Table 2</xref>). Putative “hotspots” were identified in the southern part of this state, which guided more intensive serosurveys in 2008–2009. For this study, both equine and bovine serosurveys were conducted in and around the city of Minatitlan, in which the sera were tested in almost all cases by both PRNT and HI assays; the results of these assays were consistently either positive or negative for VEEV. Located northeast of the city, Ejido Tacoteno showed 100% seroprevalence in both equids (n = 7) and bovids (n = 10), and similar seroprevalence (n = 14 equids; n = 59 bovids) was found in Ejido Coachapa, which is located south of Minatitlan in the Coatzacoalcos river basin. These data also corroborated evidence from our earlier study suggesting that VEEV is enzootic in the Minatitlan region in the southern region of the State of Veracruz.
