<p>The deduced amino acid sequences of the E3 and E2 proteins were also compared across all subtype IE VEEV strains (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001875-t005">Table 5</xref>). When compared to the Panama and Pacific genotypes, several amino acid differences were distinct for the Gulf/Caribbean IE genotype. Within the Gulf/Caribbean IE genotype, there were no consistent amino acid differences between the 2 temporally distinct isolates from Mexico (1963–69 vs. 2008–10). The amino sequences from 1 sentinel hamster (H60) and 5 mosquito pools (M48, M49, M50, M51, M64), which had been collected from nearby regions in the State of Veracruz in 2009, had a serine→threonine change at position 208 in the E2 protein.
