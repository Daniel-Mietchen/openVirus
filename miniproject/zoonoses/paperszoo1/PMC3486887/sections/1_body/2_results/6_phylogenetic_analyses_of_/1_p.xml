<p>Seventeen VEEV isolates were made from sentinel hamsters and mosquitoes collected from the municipality of Minatitlan in 2008â€“2010. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001875-t001">Table 1</xref> provides a listing of the locations, dates of collection, and sources of each isolate, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001875-g004">Fig. 4</xref> shows the geographical distribution of these and previously sequenced isolates of subtype IE VEEV that were used for the phylogenetic analysis. Of the 3 major lineages of subtype IE VEEV, all isolates from the hamsters and mosquitoes clustered within the Gulf/Caribbean genotype but were in a distinct clade from isolates collected in the same regions of Mexico in 1960s (
