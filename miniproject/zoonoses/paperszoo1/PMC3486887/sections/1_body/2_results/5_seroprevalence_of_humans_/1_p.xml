<p>Between October 2008 and April 2009, sera from a total of 234 febrile persons of all ages were obtained from 44 municipalities broadly representing the State of Veracruz, including Minatitlan. Sera were tested in all cases by PRNT, and in most cases, IgG ELISAs. The results were consistently either positive or negative for VEEV. Serum samples from 2 municipalities (Minatitlan, Villa Acula) were also tested by HI assay, and the results were consistent with the PRNT and IgG ELISA results. PRNT- and IgG-negative serum was also tested for IgM antibodies to VEEV. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001875-g003">Fig. 3</xref> only shows the seropositive results based on 24 of the 44 municipalities, where all other municipalities had no seropositive results. Based on the results of the ELISA for IgM or IgG, PRNT, and/or HI, 19.2% (45/234) of the total individuals tested were positive for VEEV antibodies. Among these, 5 were IgM-positive, suggesting recent VEEV infection (

Interestingly, 4 of the 5 IgM positive individuals also showed IgM antibodies to dengue virus (DENV), suggesting the possibility of co-infection. In the Minatitlan region, 13 of the 24 (54%) tested individuals were seropositive for VEEV. This region was also the area where 17 isolates of VEEV were made from sentinel hamsters and mosquitoes during this same time period (2008â€“2010) (
