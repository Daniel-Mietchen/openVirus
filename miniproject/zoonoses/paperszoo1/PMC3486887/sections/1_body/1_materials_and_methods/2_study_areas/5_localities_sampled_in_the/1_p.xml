<p>For the studies carried out in the summers of 2008 to 2010, our focus was initially in the southeastern areas of the State of Veracruz in the Coatzacoalcos River basin and the nearby city of Minatitlan, a metropolitan area with at least 300,000 residents that is part of an industrial corridor closely linked to the oil industry. Later, two “ejidos” or communal lands were studied northeast [“Ejido Coachapa” (N17°53′25.50″; W94°33′33.30″)] or south [“Ejido Tacoteno” (N18°00′27.02″; W94°31′00.99″)] of Minatitlan, each a few hundred meters from urban areas. These two areas included wetlands with swamps and patches of grasslands devoted to raising cattle. These habitats included canopies of fruit trees (mango, coconut, and papaya), surrounded by flooded swamps with emergent aquatic vegetation, and were irrigated by the Coatzacoalcos River and its tributaries.</p>
