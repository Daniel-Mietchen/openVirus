<p>In the State of Tabasco, 9 municipalities were sampled for equine serological surveillance, some near the Guatemala border in the south, including Tenosique and Balancan (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001875-t002">Table 2</xref> for grid coordinates). Other municipalities included those in the state's central plains, including Jonuta, Centla, Jalpa, Centro, and Macuspana as well as the coastal and mangrove areas of Comalcalco and Paraiso. This region is largely composed of lowland humid tropical grasslands and forests as well as wetlands along the coastal habitats, which are irrigated by the Usumacinta and Grijalva River systems and their tributaries.
