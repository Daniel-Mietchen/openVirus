<p>The majority of horse sera collected in the State of Tamaulipas came from an experimental livestock station associated with the Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Forestales, Agr√≠colas y Pecuarias (INIFAP), a Mexican agricultural research institute, in the Aldama region (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001875-t002">Table 2</xref> for grid coordinates). This is a low, humid, semiarid coastal municipality devoted mainly to fishing and livestock production. Vegetation in this area includes marsh grasses, brushes, and weeds. Three rivers flood the coastal plains year-round, including the Carrizal, Barbarena, and Tigre. At the Mexico-Texas border, within the framework of the West Nile virus surveillance activities of the Mexican Agriculture Ministry, we also sampled horses in ranches in three border towns adjacent to the Texas counties of Cameron and Hidalgo, including Camargo, Diaz Ordaz, and Matamoros. Vegetation in these regions is typical for subtropical Gulf prairies with bluestems and grama grasses predominating during mild winters and hot summers. The border towns are located within the Rio Bravo basin. Finally, equine samples were also obtained from the municipality of Jaumave, located near the capital city of Victoria in the mountainous region of the State of Tamaulipas.
