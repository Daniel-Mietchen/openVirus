<p>Mosquito collections occurred in June–July of 2008–2010, October of 2009, and February of 2010, and were primarily concentrated in the Tacoteno region and in other areas surrounding Minatitlan in the State of Veracruz. At least 12 mosquito traps were set out daily in a 10-day interval in an area of approximately 15 square meters. The traps were checked for mosquitoes early each morning, and mosquitoes were removed from the traps with mechanical aspirators and placed in cardboard containers. The mosquitoes were provided with a 10% sucrose solution until they were processed. The mosquitoes were sorted by species and placed into cryovials as pools with a maximum of 30 individuals/vial, and then mosquito pools were stored in liquid nitrogen for transportation to UTMB for viral isolation.</p>
