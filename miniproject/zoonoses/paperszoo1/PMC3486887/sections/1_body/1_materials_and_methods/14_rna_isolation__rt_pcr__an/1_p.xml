<p>Viral RNA was isolated from hamster tissues and mosquito homogenates using the QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification were performed in a one-step reaction using a Titan One-Tube RT-PCR kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A 2,500 nt amplicon was generated covering genomic nucleotide positions 7894–10395, which extended from the 3′ end of the capsid gene to the 5′ end of the E1 gene within the structural protein open reading frame. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001875.s001">Table S1</xref> lists the primers used for RT-PCR and sequencing. PCR amplicons were purified from agarose gels using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced directly using internal primers and an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) Prism automated DNA sequencing. Nucleotide sequences derived in this study, including those from previous isolates from either our collection or the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses at UTMB, were submitted to GenBank under accession numbers JQ859933–JQ859958.
