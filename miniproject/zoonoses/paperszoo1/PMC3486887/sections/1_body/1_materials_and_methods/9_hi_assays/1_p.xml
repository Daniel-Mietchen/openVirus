<p>For the HI assays, VEEV subtype IE-specific antibodies were detected using an antigen derived from subtype IE VEEV strain 68U201 (isolated in 1968 from the brain of a sentinel hamster near La Avellana, in the Pacific lowlands of southeastern Guatemala). The sera were also screened by HI for 3 other arboviruses known to circulate in Mexico: eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV; strain TenBroeck), West Nile virus (WNV; strain 385-99), and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLV; strain TBH28). Briefly, 4–8 units of hemagglutinin antigen from each virus were reacted with heat-inactivated serially diluted serum, starting at a dilution of 1∶20, and failure to hemagglutinate goose erythrocytes was considered a positive result.</p>
