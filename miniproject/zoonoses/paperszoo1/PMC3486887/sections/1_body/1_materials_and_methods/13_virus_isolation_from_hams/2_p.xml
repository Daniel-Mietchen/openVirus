<p>Mosquito pools from the traps in which a hamster became infected were assayed for infectious virus. Pools containing 1–30 mosquito specimens were triturated and processed using the same method as the hamster tissues. The triturated pool was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm and 4°C for 5 min. One hundred microliters of the supernatant was added to a 12.5 cm
 <sup>2</sup> flask containing a monolayer of Vero cells, incubated at 37°C for 1 h, and then, 5 ml of DMEM with 5% FBS was added to the flask. The cultures were monitored for CPE for the next 3–5 days.
