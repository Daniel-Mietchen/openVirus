<p>VEEV was isolated from 10% hamster heart tissue suspensions in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin. Tissues were homogenized in Safe-Lock tubes (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY) with 5 mm stainless steel balls 450 grade A and homogenized in a Qiagen TissueLyser (Retsch, Newton, PA) for 4 min at 26,000 oscillations per minute. After centrifugation, the supernatant was inoculated onto confluent monolayers of Vero cells and incubated at 37°C for 3–5 days or until cytopathic effects (CPE) were evident.</p>
