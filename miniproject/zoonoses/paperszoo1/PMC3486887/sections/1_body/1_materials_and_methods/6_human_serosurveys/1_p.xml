<p>Between October 2008 and April 2009, sera from 234 individuals of all ages were obtained by the Veracruz Health Services as part of an ongoing dengue surveillance program. These sera were collected from acute febrile patients from 44 municipalities broadly representing the State of Veracruz. This included Minatitlan, a municipality where we had detected VEEV circulation based on animal serology and virus isolation. Sera were tested in all cases by PRNT, and in most cases, by IgG ELISAs. PRNT- and IgG-negative serum was tested for IgM antibodies to VEEV. Serum samples from two municipalities (Minatitlan, Villa Acula) were also tested by HI assay.</p>
