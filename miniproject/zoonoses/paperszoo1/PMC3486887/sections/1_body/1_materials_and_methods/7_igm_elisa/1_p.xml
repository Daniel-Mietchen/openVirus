<p>The IgM capture ELISA was performed essentially as previously described 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001875-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Briefly, 96-well Immulon II HB plates (Dynatech Industries, Chantilly, VA) were coated with 75 µl of either goat anti-horse or goat anti-human IgM (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer. Fifty microliters per well of 1∶400 wash buffer-diluted sample or control sera were added to the wells and allowed to incubate for 1 h at 37°C in a humidified chamber. Either viral or uninfected control antigen that was produced from cell lysates was diluted in wash buffer and 50 µl/well was added in triplicate to the appropriate wells where they were allowed to incubate overnight at 4°C. A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody (MAb) (Jackson Immunological Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was then used as a detector antibody. Calculations of P/N values were performed by following the guidelines of previous studies 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001875-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. For a specimen to be considered IgM positive to the test virus, the P/N ratio (OD reading of sample on viral antigen/OD reading of normal control sera on viral antigen) must be ≥3 and the value of P for the test specimen must be greater than or equal to twice the mean OD of the test specimen reacted on normal antigen.
