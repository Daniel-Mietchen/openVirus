<p>In 2008–2009, wild-caught rodents were collected with Sherman live traps (H.B. Sherman Traps, Inc., Tallahassee, FL) in the ejidos of Coachapa and Tacoteno in the municipality of Minatitlan. Traps were placed next to swampy pastures and streams of farms where we had also observed sentinel hamster mortalities and/or positive equine and bovine serology for VEEV. Trapped rodents were anesthetized and bled by cardiac puncture; approximately 1 ml of blood was transferred to vacutainer tubes (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lake, NJ) for serum separation and stored at −20°C until further processing. Smaller rodents were bled from the retro-orbital sinus with heparinized capillary tubes, from which plasma was collected after centrifugation of the blood and stored at −20°C until processed. Sera were tested by both PRNT and HI assays.</p>
