<p>Golden Syrian hamsters were used as bait in modified Trinidad mosquito traps to isolate VEEV from infected hamsters and transmitting mosquitoes 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001875-Ferro1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Our approach needed to overcome the simultaneous circulation of Group C (including Nepuyo virus) and Patois viruses circulating in our field study areas in Minatitlan [JGEF and SCW, unpublished data]. Therefore, to reduce deaths associated with infections of both viruses, hamsters were first treated with antisera obtained from the ascitic fluid of mice previously infected with Nepuyo and Patois viruses. Fifteen hamsters received a subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of ascitic fluid diluted to 1% in PBS prior to field exposure in the Trinidad mosquito traps. The baited traps were placed on farms under the canopy of fruit trees and suspended about 1.5 meters above the ground. Hamsters were provided carrots, orange slices, sunflower seeds, and water. Hamsters that became moribund or died in the traps were dissected, and tissues (primarily brain, heart, and spleen) were placed immediately in cryovials and liquid nitrogen containers in the field.
