<p>To detect the presence of VEEV IgG in serum samples, a previously described monoclonal antibody-based capture ELISA protocol was followed 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001875-Johnson2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Briefly, a 96-well Immulon II HB plate was coated with 75 µl/well of the broadly cross-reactive alphavirus MAb, which was diluted in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer. Blocking buffer [phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 0.5% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk] was added and allowed to incubate as described previously. Either viral or uninfected control antigen that was produced from cell lysates was diluted in wash buffer and added to the appropriate wells and allowed to bind the MAb. Either sample sera or control sera (positive and negative) diluted 1∶400 in wash buffer were added to triplicate wells and allowed to incubate for 1 h at 37°C. Either goat anti-horse or goat anti-human IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugated antibody was then added, and samples were read on a plate reader as directed.
