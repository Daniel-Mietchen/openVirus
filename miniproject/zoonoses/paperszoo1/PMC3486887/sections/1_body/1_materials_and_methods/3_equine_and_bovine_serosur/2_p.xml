<p>We conducted 3 separate equine and/or bovine serosurveys between 2003 and 2010. The first one occurred in 2003–2004 in the States of Tabasco, Veracruz and Tamaulipas. Of the total number of equids sampled (n = 714), 18% (129/714) originated from 5 municipalities in the State of Tamaulipas, 11% (79/714) originated from 9 municipalities in the State of Veracruz, and 71% (506/714) originated from 9 municipalities in the State of Tabasco. The second serosurvey was conducted in 2008–2009 in Minatitlan in the State of Veracruz in previously identified areas of VEEV circulation. Here, we tested the sera of 81 bovids and 27 equids. The third serosurvey was carried out during the summer of 2010 in 6 municipalities of the northern region of the State of Veracruz, including municipalities near the State of Tamaulipas. For this serosurvey, 126 cattle and 53 horses were tested to estimate the northern geographical extension of VEEV within the State of Veracruz.</p>
