<p>PRNTs were performed as previously described 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001875-Beaty1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Briefly, starting at a dilution of 1∶10, heat-inactivated serum samples were serially diluted in Dulbecco's modified eagles medium (DMEM) with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated with ∼100 plaque forming units (PFU) of VEEV subtype IE strain 68U201 at 37°C for 1 h. Confluent monolayers of African Green Monkey kidney (Vero) cells in 12-well plates were inoculated with 100 µl of the virus/serum mixture and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. A 0.4% agarose overlay was then applied to each well and incubated at 37°C for 48 h before being fixed in 10% formalin and stained with 20% methanol/0.25% crystal violet. Serum dilutions resulting in ≥80% reduction in virus plaque titers were considered positive, with titers reported as the reciprocal of the endpoint dilution. Sera collected from horses, cattle, and dogs in areas outside of known endemic regions (Toluca Valley near Mexico City, 2,650 meters altitude) were used as negative controls.
