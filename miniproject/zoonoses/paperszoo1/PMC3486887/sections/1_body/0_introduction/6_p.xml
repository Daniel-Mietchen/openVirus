<p>Despite recent efforts to understand the ecology of VEEV in the Pacific Coast of Mexico, little has been done on the Gulf Coast since the 1960s. Here, we present that the results of field studies that focus on confirming the continued existence of enzootic VEEV in the Gulf Coast region of Mexico. This research was designed to expand our knowledge of the ecology and epidemiology of VEEV, primarily focused on the State of Veracruz, and to estimate the potential of VEEV to spread northward into regions near the Mexico-U.S. border, as occurred in 1971. Between 2003 and 2010, we performed serological surveillance studies of humans, cattle, horses, and dogs in various regions along the Gulf Coast of Mexico. These data were complemented by wild-caught rodent serosurveys to identify putative reservoir hosts. Additionally, phylogenetic analyses were performed on VEEV isolates from this region to determine whether there have been substantial genetic changes in these viruses since the 1960s, including the potential introduction of the epizootic Pacific Coast lineage of subtype IE VEEV into this area.</p>
