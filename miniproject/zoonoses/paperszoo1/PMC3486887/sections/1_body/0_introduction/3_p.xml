<p>The first VEEV subtype IE isolates from Mexico were obtained by Scherer et al. from sentinel hamsters and mosquito pools in 1963 in the Sontecomapan region of the State of Veracruz 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001875-Scherer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. These studies noted the constant enzootic circulation of the subtype IE VEEVs in several lowland coastal habitats in the Gulf Coast region and suggested the potential threat of VEEV expansion mediated by the north-south movement of people and domestic animals in these areas. In 1965, a human fatality associated with subtype IE VEEV was reported in the village of Jaltipan, Veracruz

Later, in 1966, an equine epizootic attributed to subtype IE VEEV took place in the Tampico region of the northeastern State of Tamaulipas, which borders Texas. During this epizootic, approximately 1,000 equids developed encephalitis and 300 deaths were recorded
