<p>In Mexico, the earliest recorded evidence of VEEV circulation in the Gulf Coast region came from human sera collected in Tlacotalpan in the State of Veracruz in 1961, where 7 individuals tested seropositive for VEEV by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays

Further studies carried out between 1962–1964 in the southeastern areas of the Gulf Coast, including the States of Quintana Roo, Yucatan, Tabasco and Veracruz, identified VEEV-seropositive individuals (3% seroprevalence) among the 770 individuals tested
