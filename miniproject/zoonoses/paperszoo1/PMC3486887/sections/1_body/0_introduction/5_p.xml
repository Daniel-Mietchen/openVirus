<p>Immediately following the 1969â€“72 outbreak, there were no reported attempts to study VEEV circulation in Mexico. The last documented activity of VEEV in the Gulf Coast region of Mexico occurred in 1991 in the village of Paraiso in the State of Tabasco 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001875-ZarateAquino1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Two children (5- and 7-years old) seroconverted, implying recent VEEV exposures. Further surveillance in this village revealed an overall seroprevalence of 19.3% in the 394 individuals sampled (all ages). Additionally, subtype IE VEEV was isolated from mosquito pools collected from this area; however, the mosquito species were not reported
