  <title>Populations of infected livestock and mosquitoes.</title>
  <p>(a), (b) and (c) represent the populations of infectious livestock (solid line) and vectors (dashed line) in patches 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Same values of parameters are adopted in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003388-g003">Fig. 3</xref>. Populations of both infected livestock and mosquitoes alter their patterns during the festival time. Due to the effect of increased movement rates during the festival, the peak of infected livestock population is not necessary to be the same as that of the infected mosquito population, i.e. patch 2.
