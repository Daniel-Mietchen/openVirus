  <title>How daily increment in movement speeds impacts patterns of disease outbreaks.</title>
  <p>(a)-(c) show the populations of infectious livestock and (d)-(f) simulate the populations of infectious vectors in patches 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The daily increment of movement speeds are 10, 54 and 98 km/per day, represented by solid, dashed and dotted lines, respectively. Values of other parameters are identical with those used in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003388-g003">Fig. 3</xref>. During the festival season, infectious livestock are transported from patch 1 to patch 3, via patch 2, therefore we can observe that the population of infectious livestock has a sudden drop in patches 1 and 2 while an increase in patch 3 in the case that movement speed is relative fast (the increment
