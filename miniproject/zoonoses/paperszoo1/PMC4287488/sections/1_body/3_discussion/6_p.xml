<p>The force of infection in our paper is in term of pseudo-mass action transmission 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003388-McCallum1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, as we assumed that the effective biting rate is linearly-density dependent

 </inline-formula>. But for the vector-borne disease models, it is more common to adopt the true-mass action transmission mechanism, where the effective biting rate is a constant and the force of infection is proportional to the density of the infectious host population when the disease pathogen transmitted from livestock to mosquito (the susceptible host population when the disease pathogen transmitted from mosquito to livestock). The mathematical analysis on our model will not be affected by taking the new force of infection, but the results of numerical simulations may change. We would extent our model considering this type of force of infection in our future work.
