<p>Though our simulations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003388-g006">Fig. 6 (a)-(f))</xref> show that the timeline of disease outbreaks on a larger scale still follows a certain pattern, which does not completely match the real scenario; i.e., sporadic outbreaks of RVF in Egypt. This may be explained by the following factors. Since we assumed well-mixed populations of livestock in each patch and identical movement rates regardless the clinical stage of livestock during transportation, the model may overestimate the real situation. In practice, infected livestock may be removed once they are identified, and therefore are not be a source of infection any longer. Implementations of various kinds of vaccination strategies and interventions of other stochastic events, such as unpredicted religious festival preparations, will also change the pattern of disease outbreaks. Further, we may extend our model to consider the disease latencies in both hosts and vectors, and the importation of livestock carrying RVFV during disease latency, as these factors also impact the pattern of disease outbreaks.
