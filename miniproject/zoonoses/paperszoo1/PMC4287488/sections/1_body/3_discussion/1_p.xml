<p>We investigated the festival-driven and seasonal impacts on the patterns of RVF outbreaks among livestock in Africa and Middle East. Although we did not consider the compartments for humans directly in our model, human activities were reflecting by those periodic parameters, such as the importation and transportation (i.e., movement speed) of livestock in these regions, and have various impacts on the patterns of disease outbreaks at different locations along the transportation route. From the analysis and simulations of the model, we found that importation of livestock results in more livestock and increases the local reproduction number in patch 1, the transportation of animals from patch 1 to the other patches reduces the chance of disease outbreaks. Also, the disease spreads to other patches due to the movement of livestock. Not surprisingly, when the time for festival preparation starts earlier (an expectation of Islam on a large scale), the risk of massive disease outbreaks rises, particularly in patch 3 (the Nile Delta).</p>
