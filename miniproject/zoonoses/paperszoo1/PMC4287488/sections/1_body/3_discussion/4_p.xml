<p>In this work, the interaction between effects of seasonality and the social economy is mathematically confirmed to be a major factor of the local disease outbreaks and transmissions of the disease pathogen, which is different from the disease transmission mechanisms in other regions of Africa. For years, the vertical transmission of the disease pathogen through infected Aedes mosquito eggs have been believed to be the major cause of the long-term persistence of the disease in West Africa

Investigators performed risk assessment statistically or mathematically, trying to identify reasons for disease outbreaks in Egypt, as the Aedes mosquito is not a commonly reported species locally. Researchers have considered seasonality and socioeconomic impacts individually

The patch model we proposed in the paper incorporates both effects related to different calendars and reveals the sporadic epidemic/epizootic that occurred in Egypt since 1977. Abundances of hosts and vectors increase the probability of large disease outbreaks. For example, an unexpected RVF outbreak during September to October, 2010, was attributed to a large number of camels, which played the role of hosts in northern Mauritania, along with exceptionally heavy rainfall

With these findings, we are in principle able to provide some information to local governments on how to correctly predict the disease outbreaks and how to effectively control the transmission of the disease pathogen. Reducing the abundance of vectors is a possible approach. Preventive measures may be taken during the importation and transportation of livestock. Actions considering both impacts from seasonality and social economy will achieve a better result in disease control.
