<p>In order to understand the critical parameters in the spread of the disease and transmission of the disease pathogen, we also varied the daily increments in the number of imported animals and the movement speed of livestock during the festival. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003388-g010">Fig. 10 (a)-(c)</xref>, we observed that the yearly cumulative number of infected livestock in patch 1 was influenced by both critical parameters, while the impact from daily increment in the daily imported number dominates in the other two patches, particularly patch 2. Since patch 2 is a transitional patch, in which livestock move in and out, the impact of movement is not significant. A model with more than three patches, i.e. a four-patch model, was examined as well, and we do not find a qualitatively different pattern from that of the three-patch model by adding more transitional patches. Therefore, we did not present the numerical results for the four-patch model. In addition, the periodic movement has significantly changed the daily numbers of the infected population, but will not impact the cumulative infected population size too much. Even if those infected livestock will move in or out quickly, they are still counted in the yearly cumulative infected numbers in each patch.
