<p>In the last a few years, various mathematical models have been developed to study the transmission dynamics of RVFV 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003388-Gaff1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003388-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003388-Chitnis1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003388-Mpeshe1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Gaff et al. 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003388-Gaff1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> investigated a model to capture the two mechanisms of RVFV pathogen transmission by both 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes; vertical transmission via infected eggs among species 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and indirect transmission via mosquito biting by both species. In Gao et al. 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003388-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, a three-patch model was employed to model the directional livestock movement. In both of these papers, the basic reproduction number for stability analysis of equilibria with constant coefficients was derived. In this work, we follow the idea in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003388-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and construct a three-patch model with some periodic coefficients replacing the previously constant parameters to investigate the effects of seasonality and socioeconomics on the transmission of RVFV in African and the Middle East.
