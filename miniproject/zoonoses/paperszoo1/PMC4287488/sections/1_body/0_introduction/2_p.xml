<p>RVFV is a type of viral zoonosis that is primarily transmitted among animals, including cattle, sheep, goats, and camels, via bites from female mosquitoes. Humans are also hosts for this virus and severe human infections are caused by direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. However, humans are dead-end of the transmission of RVFV, as they will not cause new infections via bites among mosquitoes. This disease has drawn substantial attention, as it can cause significant economic losses due to huge incidences of death and abortion among infected livestock. In the 1930s, RVFV was recognized in the literature

Interestingly, the invasion path in Egypt follows the same route that some Egyptians use to travel to the Nile Delta, where the important Islamic festival Greater Bairam is held. This path that we are modeling is also partially coincident with the path by which Egyptians travel to Mecca, the capital city of Saudi Arabia.
