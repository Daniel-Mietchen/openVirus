<p>The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the seasonal and festival-driven impacts on RVF outbreaks and spatial dispersal. In the section 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref>, we derive an ordinary differential equation system with periodic drivers to mathematically model the transmission and dispersal of RVFV, and followed by numerical simulations in section Results. We provide some fundamental mathematical analysis on the model in
