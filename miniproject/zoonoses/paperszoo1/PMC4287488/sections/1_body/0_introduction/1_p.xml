<p>Epidemics are often a result of two or more risk factors that occur simultaneously. Commonly, in the case of vector-borne diseases, this could be the co-occurrence of high densities of arthropod vectors and large numbers of susceptible individuals in a population. This co-occurrence could happen for a number of reasons. For example, some combinations of climatic factors such as rainfall level that may favor the growth of a vector population, and human activities, such as events involving large congregations of hosts in one place, could occur together around the same time, perhaps periodically. This enhances the risk that a single case of a disease will rapidly spread to an epidemic. Often, it is not possible to predict such co-occurrences. However, in some cases, such temporal superposition of risk factors can be predicted well in advance. We discuss such a case here using a simple model for Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a vector-borne pathogen endemic in Africa and the Middle East. In particular, the case investigated here involves the periodic coincidences of a natural phenomenon, annual flood stages of a river, which promotes high densities of disease vector mosquitoes, and a religious festival, the Eid al Adha feast, at which time large numbers of livestock are driven towards the site of the feast. It creates the particular periodicity of times of high potential for disease outbreaks, RVFV in this case, because the river flood stage follows the solar (365.25 days) calendar, whereas the religious feast follows the lunar calendar (354.37 days). This means that these two events will coincide perfectly only every 33.57 years, although partial overlap occurs in other year surrounding those of perfect coincidence, depending on the durations of both the high flood stage of the river and the festival. Drake et al. 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003388-Drake1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> conducted a statistical model to investigate the influence of these two events on the disease outbreaks. This is analogous to what is known in acoustics as a “beat frequency”; e.g., when a piano is out of tune and two strings belonging to the same note are not vibrating at exactly the same rate, a quavering will occur with a frequency of the difference of the frequencies of the two strings.
