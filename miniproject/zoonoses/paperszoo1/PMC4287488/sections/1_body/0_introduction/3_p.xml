<p>Between 1950 and 1976, at least sixteen major outbreaks of RVFV occurred among livestock at various locations in sub-Saharan Africa (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003388-t001">Table 1</xref>). In Egypt, there have been five major outbreaks among humans in the past four decades 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003388-Drake1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The first two major RVFV outbreaks occurred during the period of July to December in 1977 and 1978. Fifteen years later, there was another RVFV outbreak among humans from May to July in 1993

 <xref rid="pntd.0003388-Okda1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> that “During an epidemic, the disease usually occurs first in animals, then in humans”. Between April and August in 1997, a fourth RVFV outbreak caused an extensive epizootic of RVFV in Egypt. The high morbidity and mortality rates in domestic ruminants led to an official report concerning an outbreak of RVFV among livestock in Egypt

 <xref rid="pntd.0003388-Imam1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The most recent outbreak of the disease in Egypt occurred between June and October, 2003, causing around 375 human cases. The five major outbreaks coincided with either the peak season of mosquitoes in Egypt (July-September, 1977 and 1978, 2003) or the timing of Greater Bairam, Eid al Adha feast (October-December, 1977 and 1978, 1993, 1997). Many researchers have noticed this interesting phenomenon and have attempted to use mathematical and statistical models to identify the underlying relevance

 <xref rid="pntd.0003388-Chamchod1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. A mathematical model considering two species of mosquitoes as vectors was analyzed in

 <xref rid="pntd.0003388-Niu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> presented a patch model to investigate the effect of livestock movement on the spread of RVFV. In

 <xref rid="pntd.0003388-Xue2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, a network based model was used to evaluate the spatial dispersal of RVFV, while Drake et al. 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003388-Drake1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> examined a statistical model to identify the potential risks for disease outbreaks, which is the motivation of our work to further explore the how these risks will impact disease dynamics.
