<p>The reasons for the disease outbreaks among livestock have been explored for quite a long time. One of hypotheses is that in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, outbreaks may occur when the disease is introduced by the importation and transportation of infected animals

When the largest Islamic festival, Eid al Adha, approaches, the ceremonial sacrifices drastically increase the demand of livestock. For example, most live cattle imported mainly from Brazil, Sudan, Ethiopia, Croatia, and Australia are earmarked for immediate slaughter

One of the domestic newspapers, Egypt Independent, published a news report on Tuesday, September 17th, 2013, that lobbied the government to increase meat imports ahead the Eid al Adha feast. Many researchers have been questioning the hidden side-effects of the flourishing border trade

 <xref rid="pntd.0003388-Davies2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> believed that the spread of RVFV among ruminants was accelerated by imports of livestock from Sudan to Egypt, and further increased by the religious festival, Eid al Adha. In order to arrive at the rendezvous, i.e. the Nile Delta, where millions of Muslims celebrate the Feast by the ritual sacrifice of a ram by ‘halal’ after long-distance travel, people travel by foot or train. One of the ground routes starts from Sudan, then follows the Nile in Egypt from south to north, and further traverses from northwest to southeast in Saudi Arabia along the coastline of Red Sea
