<p>On the other hand, ceremonial sacrifices will lead to a much higher death rate for livestock (mainly cattle and sheep) in the Nile Delta compared with the other locations during the festival. This may also affect pathogen transmission, as the high rate of slaughter will increase the demand for the importation. According to some literature noted in the preceding paragraph

 <xref rid="pntd.0003388-AbdoSalem2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, it is believed that importation of livestock in Egypt from Sudan and other countries, transportation of livestock following the pilgrimage, and the death rate of livestock in the Nile Delta will be impacted by the annual festival according to the lunar calendar. In this paper, we use the movement speed of livestock and length of journey for animals within a patch to measure the level of transportation; i.e., the increase of the volume of livestock transportation will be exhibited by the increase of animal movement, with fixed length of journey within each of the patches modeled. During the festival season, the values of these parameters will keep rising until the day of Eid al Adha, and then decrease to their baseline levels at other times. To mathematically evaluate the hidden danger of the Feast and the trade driven impacts of livestock, we use the fact that the number of livestock imported in Egypt, the movement speed of livestock, and the death rate in Mecca follow a periodic pattern, where the period is the length of a lunar year (
