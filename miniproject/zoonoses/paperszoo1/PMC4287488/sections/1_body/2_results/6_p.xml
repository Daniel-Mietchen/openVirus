<p>Next, we explore how the three periodic parameters, the number of livestock daily imported to patch 1, the speed of movement from patch to patch, and the removal rate in patch 3 (particularly the first two), affect the dynamics of infectious populations. The faster the movement speed of livestock is, the more infected animals will be transported from patch 1, via patch 2, to patch 3. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003388-g007">Fig. 7 (a)-(f)</xref>, one can observe that when the daily increment in the movement speed (livestock) increases, the size of daily infectious host or vector populations decreases during the festival time in the first two patches, particularly in patch 1; meanwhile, sizes of daily infectious populations increase in patch 3. Except for the festival period, the sizes of infectious populations remain the same in patches 2 and 3 respectively, regardless of the variation in

 </inline-formula>. When the increase of the movement rate during the festival time is mild (i.e. 
 <inline-formula>
  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pntd.0003388.e133.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>

 </inline-formula>km/day), then infected ruminants will accumulate in patch 1, and the number of daily infected individuals will temporarily increase, shown by the solid curve in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003388-g007">Fig. 7(b)</xref>. With a higher daily movement (transportation) rate during the festival period, more livestock from each group will move from patch 1 to patch 2 and patch 2 to patch 3 in a short time, which leads to the temporal drop of the daily counts of infected individuals in patches 1 and 2. These infected individuals concentrate at their travel destination, patch 3; therefore, the daily count of infections in patch 3 increases quickly during this period. As a further consequence, the total number of infected mosquitoes in each patch follows the same pattern of the infected livestock within the same patch (shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003388-g007">Fig. 7 (d)-(f))</xref>. A relationship can also be observed between the local reproduction number and

 </inline-formula>. The advances year-by-year in the dates of the within year peaks are also due to the discrepancy between the solar and lunar periods. The oscillation of the local reproduction number has a higher amplitude with a larger

 </inline-formula> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003388-g008">Fig. 8 (a)-(d))</xref>. The local basic reproduction number relies on the size of the susceptible population. The directional movement of livestock will also lead to a shrinking pool of the susceptible population, so the local basic reproduction numbers fluctuate widely. One can observe decreasing curves of local reproduction numbers when the day of Eid al Adha is approaching, and sharply rising curves after the day of the feast. The significant change of the susceptible pool leads to an even higher level of the local reproduction number compared to that brought by a moderate change (slow movement), but this effect diminishes from patch 1 to patch 3 due to the movement of infectious population, shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003388-g008">Fig. 8 (e)</xref>.
