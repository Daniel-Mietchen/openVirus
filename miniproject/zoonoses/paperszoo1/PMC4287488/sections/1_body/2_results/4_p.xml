<p>We further compare the infected population sizes of both livestock and mosquitoes. We find that the peaks of the infectious populations for both livestock and mosquitoes are coincident in patch 1 in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003388-g004">Fig. 4(b)</xref>, the peak of infectious livestock population emerges when the size of the infectious mosquito population approaches its minimum. This phenomenon may be the consequence of the oscillating inflows of infected livestock from the other patches. The outbreaks of RVF in patch 1 lead to the occurrence of disease outbreaks in patches 2 and 3. Even if the local basic reproduction number in patch 3 is less than
