 <xref rid="pntd.0003388-Drake1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> pointed out that the festival activities may even begin two months ahead of Eid al-Adha. We also vary the starting time for festival preparation to estimate its impacts on disease dynamics. It is observed that when the activities start earlier, the size of infectious livestock population decreases in patch 1, but the population increases in patch 3. The early preparation for the festival leads to high concentration of livestock at the location where the festival will be held, and results in huge disease outbreaks locally. We find that more individuals becomes infected in each patch during the festival (see
