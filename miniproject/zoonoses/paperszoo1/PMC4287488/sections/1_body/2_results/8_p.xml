<p>Further, we use the yearly cumulative infected population size of livestock to evaluate the annual scale of the disease outbreak. Although the effects brought by variations of the daily imported number and the livestock movement rate during the festival period on yearly cumulative infected population size are much milder compared with that on the daily infected population size, we can still observe that when the increment in the daily imported number of livestock

The coincidence of two events, 1) a larger size of livestock population flow into patches due to festival demands, 2) appearance of abundant female mosquitoes when the level of the Nile raises, leads to a larger size of the cumulative infected population (
