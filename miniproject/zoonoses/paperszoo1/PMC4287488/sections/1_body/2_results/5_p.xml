<p>Long term patterns of infectious population size simulations are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003388-g006">Fig. 6 (a)-(f)</xref>. One can observe that the scale of disease outbreaks peaks every three to four decades. This is due to the coincidence of abundance of mosquitoes related to solar calendar and high number of livestock during religious lunar festival. The large population sizes of both hosts and vectors provide a suitable environment for transmission and spread of the disease pathogen. Since the difference between solar and lunar calendars is roughly 11 days, the coincidence occurs approximately every 33 years (by the solar calendar).
