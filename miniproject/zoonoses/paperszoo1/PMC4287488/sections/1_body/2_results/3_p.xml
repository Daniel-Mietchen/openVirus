<p>The seasonal and festival-driven parameters lead to periodic patterns for both infectious host and vector populations. One can easily observe that when all parameters are constant and the carrying capacity of mosquitoes is fixed at its background level, the size of infectious livestock population in each patch converges to a steady state, as in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003388-g003">Fig. 3 (a)-(c)</xref>. When the seasonal pattern of mosquito carrying capacity is included, we observe that a mild periodicity occurs. When the festival-driven impacts are added, we find that the populations of infectious livestock in each patch have a lunar periodicity with much greater amplitudes. During the festival period, with a faster movement speed, more livestock from each group will be transported from patch 1 to 2 (2 to 3); therefore, there are sudden drops of infections in patches 2 and 3. Meanwhile, infected livestock concentrate in patch 3, leading to an increase of infected population size first, but then mass slaughter for the feast (festival-driven death rate of livestock in patch 3) reduces the number of infected individuals quickly, shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003388-g003">Fig. 3(c)</xref>. Although we assume no livestock stay in patches 2 and 3 initially (

 </inline-formula>), the directional connections between patches bring livestock to these two patches. In particular, the overall population size of livestock in patch 2 is the biggest, as patch 2 is hypothesized to be the longest among the three patches (
