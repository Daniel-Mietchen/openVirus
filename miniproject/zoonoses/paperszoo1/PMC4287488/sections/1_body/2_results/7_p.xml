<p>When we fix the movement speed of livestock during the festival period, and vary the number of animals daily imported to patch 1, we find that a bigger number of daily imported livestock during the festival season brings a larger size of infectious livestock population (

However, if the number of daily imported livestock during the festival time is increased slowly, then the effect brought on by the increased transportation of livestock dominates, and there will be sudden drops of daily infected population in patches 1 and 2, shown by the solid curves in
