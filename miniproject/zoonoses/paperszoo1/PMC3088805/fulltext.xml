For influenzas, antivirals enable treatment of infected individuals and chemoprophylaxis of exposed individuals throughout the first wave until vaccines are developed. Non-pharmaceutical interventions may also delay local transmission and mitigate the impact of local epidemics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although A/H5N1 is predominantly a disease of domestic fowl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and rarely occurs among humans, its very high mortality rate and high potential for mutation to readily transmit between humans remain of great concern. In contrast, A/H1N1 is highly contagious among humans but has in most cases a relatively benign clinical profile and low mortality rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Personal hygiene practices (PHPs) including respiratory etiquette (covering mouth when sneezing or coughing, appropriate disposal of tissues), hand cleansing with soap/alcohol/biocides (&#x0201c;hand-washing&#x0201d;) and other hygiene practices, such as using serving utensils are widely recommended for reducing influenza virus transmission as simple, inexpensive and effective interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Hand-washing in particular reduces influenza viral load on hands, thereby reducing chances of self-inoculation and onward transmission via fomites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Understanding the determinants of PHPs in RIDs is an important public health question.</p><p>Hand-washing, wearing face masks and social distancing (health protective behaviours) increase during epidemics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and adherence varies with perceived health threats and efficacy beliefs and demographics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Most relevant studies are cross-sectional and of the 26 studies recently reviewed 23 lacked robust theoretical frameworks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Several theoretical models for understanding health protective behaviours are available, including the cognitively based Theories of Planned Behaviour (TPB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]/Reasoned Action (TRA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], Health Belief Model (HBM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and Protection Motivation Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Although HBM and TPB among others have been applied in some studies of cognitive interactions with health protective behaviours during RIDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], these models do not adequately accommodate affect in health behavioural change during RID epidemics/pandemics. Moreover, existing theories have poorly accommodated the spectrum of social influence, exceptions being the TPB/TRA, which include coercive influences from family and friends under &#x0201c;norms&#x0201d;, and Social Learning Theory (SLT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], which describes observational learning. Neither theoretical position includes both. Some studies have explored combinations of different theories. For example, attempts to predict hand-washing on an intensive care unit by combining SLT and TPB elements found only self-efficacy predicted hand-washing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], suggesting established theoretical models may be inadequate. Because outbreaks of RIDs are dynamic, embodying significant uncertainty and often, invisible personal threat they differ from non-communicable disease. That the source of threat is not one&#x02019;s own behaviour but other people argues for social factors to be more influential than existing models of behaviour change allow.</p><p>The very limited literature on behavioural adherence to prevention during infectious respiratory epidemics suggests perceived effectiveness of recommended action and perceived risk consistently associate with health protective actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To enable individual determination of risk, information on threat characteristics relative to self is needed. Trust is a core element in risk perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and influences perceived veracity of information from different sources. During epidemics, trust in information becomes important when people consider making informed decisions to change behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The public is usually passively exposed to epidemic-related information from government agencies via the media but more active searching may occur if perceived threat levels are high and imminent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Trust in information is associated with health protective behaviour adherence during epidemics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], but observing the actions of others also provides information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In particular, during conditions of high uncertainty, for example during the early stages of an epidemic, people may seek information from a much broader array of sources, including observations of the actions of peers and affiliates (social learning) and from cautionary tales (cultural learning) if government/media information is lacking, inadequate, incomplete or unreliable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Existing theoretical models poorly integrate such broader social influences with affective and cognitive elements.</p><p>Communication theories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] suggest that risk communications influence cognitive processes to produce protective behaviours. Awareness of RID epidemic (and other) situations arise from perceptions, comprehension and prediction of the prevailing (threat) environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], being informed by both formal information (government/media news) and informal information (conversations or observation of the behaviour of friends, colleagues and others) sources. Such situation awareness subsumes several cognitive elements: Information is sought on the nature of the threat and protective actions because threat-related primary and secondary appraisal requires cognizance of threat characteristics and response options (causal knowledge, perceived susceptibility and utility of and effectiveness of protective response options) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and control of negative affect, which influences judgments of threat and action effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. These elements of situational awareness offer potentially useful insights for predicting lay protective health behaviours during emerging RID epidemics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. We developed and tested a theoretical model (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) derived from the above literature incorporating three domains: trust in both formal and informal information sources, situation awareness (causal knowledge; perceived effectiveness of PHP (effectiveness); perceived susceptibility to and worry about influenza) and reported recent PHPs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The model proposes that information trust influences situation awareness variables, which in turn influence PHPs. We used structural equation modelling to test a saturated (all paths between all variables are assumed) model as the null hypothesis. We hypothesized that greater trust in formal information would reflect elements of situational awareness embodying greater knowledge of disease, greater perceived PHP effectiveness, lower perceived susceptibility and less worry. This would be associated with enhanced PHP. In contrast, trust in informal information would reflect elements of situational awareness embodying less knowledge of disease, lower perceived PHP effectiveness, greater perceived susceptibility and worry, and uncertain PHP.

Relevant data from each survey operationalizing domains specified in the conceptual model (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) were entered into the Structural Equation Model (SEM).

SEM requires continuous data with multivariate normal distribution. This was estimated using Mardia&#x02019;s coefficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Missing data were handled with multiple imputation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] to generate ten datasets which were summarized into one for subsequent analysis, to maintain sample size and maximize available data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].

The null hypothesis of a fully saturated model was rejected in favour of a parsed final model partially approximating to that hypothesized. PHP variance was consistently explained by perceived PHP effectiveness, which in turn was associated with trust in formal information. However, counter intuitively, causal knowledge, while consistently associated with reported PHPs only associated with trust in formal information for A/H1N1 data. Counter to what was hypothesized, perceived susceptibility was unrelated to trust in information and reported PHP, being only associated with influenza worry, which itself contributed to PHP variance only for A/H5N1 data. Trust in formal/informal information explained significant variance in influenza worry only for A/H5N1. Otherwise, the hypothesized model showed good fit to different data sets, from different times and influenza types. Variability in influenza characteristics probably contributed to differences in the model path weights. Despite A/H5N1, having a high case-fatality-rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], no deaths were attributed A/H5N1 in Hong Kong since 2002. Primarily a poultry disease, urban dwellers fear A/H5N1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], liking it to SARS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Rural dwellers, being familiar with zoonoses are less concerned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In contrast, A/H1N1 is perceived as a mild non-threatening event in Hong Kong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p><bold>Demographic Differences</bold> These featured as determinants in many studies of PHP for RID prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. We found similar differences but remain unsure why such differences exist, or what they mean, examining these in more detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. We incorporated elements from TPB (perceived effectiveness) and from HBM (knowledge, perceived susceptibility), and incorporated negative affectivity (worry), which many theoretical models exclude. Trust in informal information was strongly correlated with age in both datasets, but level of disease worry was higher for A/H5N1 than for A/H1N1 while levels of perceived susceptibility were comparable for both influenzas and showed age trends probably reflecting differential influenza experience. In both cases, trust was marginally higher in A/H1N1 than A/H5N1 data, probably reflecting historical factors. Following SARS trust in government was low and this took time to recover. Age-related differences were also found, with older people reporting more trust, consistent with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Given that perceived risk varies by demographic factors for crime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], roads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] and infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], with more complex gender interactions seen on closer scrutiny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] our findings are unsurprising.</p><p><bold>Trust in Formal Information</bold> This consistently associated with both perceived PHP effectiveness, which consistent with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] associated strongly with PHPs. As hypothesized, perceptions of hygiene effectiveness were associated with greater personal hygiene practices, consistent with previous empirical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], suggesting that adequate public understanding of RID cause and efficacy of prevention measures is paramount. While most studies on perceived PHP effectiveness report a link with practice, some studies have not found this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Additionally, we found perceived PHP effectiveness strongly mediated trust in formal information associated with reported PHP in A/H5N1 data, but only weakly mediated this association in A/H1N1 data. This suggests differences in influenza characteristics and/or historical changes in perceptions of PHP effectiveness since A/H5N1. Established patterns of PHPs may have been unaffected by additional formal messages for PHP for A/H1N1. Various PHP elements may be differentially influenced by message characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Reported knowledge of influenza cause did not mediate perceived PHP effectiveness, suggesting that additional influences need to be incorporated in future studies.</p><p><bold>Trust in Informal Information</bold> Greater trust in informal information was associated only with older age and greater worry. How others act or what they say provide important environmental cues to action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Chinese culture considers social conformity to be important, so monitoring the behaviour and attitudes of others may provide important threat-related information to inform decision-making. Perhaps epidemic disease-related worry remains low until peoples&#x02019; observations of others&#x02019; statements and behaviours indicate action is warranted, arousing a motivating affect and hence behavioural response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, a strong disease worry link to better personal hygiene was seen only for A/H5N1, consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Possibly, behavioural change may occur only when disease worry exceeds a certain threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This suggests that risk communications generating moderate worry might be most effective for prompting appropriate hygiene behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Informal social influences deserve closer scrutiny in RID research.</p><p><bold>Limitation</bold> This study&#x02019;s limitations include being a secondary analysis of data collected for other purposes. Methodological heterogenity affected sampling and measurement. A greater proportion of women in the A/H5N1 sample inflating known demographic differences in risk perception and PHPs may account for some of the reported associations in the A/H5N1 dataset. However, variable means of the two samples were not markedly dissimilar (Appendix Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Being cross-sectional, causal direction is ambiguous. Some variables measured with single items are sub-optimally defined, possibly raising validity and reliability concerns, the alpha values are low for some constructs and the variance accounted for is relatively modest for both models. Reporting of PHPs may have been inflated, subject to social desirability and retrospective recall biases. This needs to be borne in mind when interpreting the findings.</p><p><bold>Public Health Implication</bold> Our findings reporting actual PHP behaviour, though cross-sectional, are consistent with the literature on risk communications, which strongly indicates that trustworthiness is a key variable in persuasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. However, improvement in knowledge may be the most important consequence of trust in formal/informal information. During uncertainty, trust in formal information may modulate disease-related worry less than might the activities and beliefs expressed by trusted peers, family and perhaps even strangers. An example is face-mask use, which being highly visible takes on a semiotic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. To generate a critical mass of appropriate behaviour in the community, prompt, clear and evidence-based public health information should help to maximize formal information trust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].News reports about H5N1 and H1N1 from the Hong Kong government website and two popular free newspapers during the respective survey periods emphasized new human A/H5N1 cases in mainland China, (no local cases) during the A/H5N1 survey. During the A/H1N1 survey, when A/H1N1 was still confined to North America, these sources addressed Hong Kong governmental containment responses to the outbreak. In contrast to the then somewhat familiar A/H5N1, A/H1N1 was an unknown, apparently aggressive human strain. Different media coverage, the hangover from SARS, and public health education on PHP since 2003 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] likely influenced trust in formal information and improved influenza knowledge. Perceived susceptibility was apparently insignificant in this process, contrary to earlier findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Difference between datasets suggests that real or perceived epidemic/pandemic characteristics might significantly modulate PHPs. The geographic proximity and imminence of epidemic threat should therefore be considered as an influence in future studies of RIDs. New preventive knowledge is more likely to be from formal than informal sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Implications for Theory</title><p>The associations between the cognitive factors and PHPs found in our study are largely consistent with previous RID studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], most of which lack a robust theoretical basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In extending core cognitive-affective components by incorporating the role of information trust, in particular social information our model more closely approximates an active RID epidemic/pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Differences between the two influenzas might reflect sample difference or indicate that influenza characteristics are themselves an important component driving situation awareness and response and should be factored into models to improve predictive power. Moreover, unlike most cognitive-behavioural models, our model accommodates cognitive and affective elements constituting mental representation of the threat posed by a RID epidemic/pandemic, consistent with the common sense model of illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Future studies should target theory development to reconcile divergent models and accommodate different findings. Overall, our study provides a stronger foundation from which to develop better behavioural models of responses to future RID epidemics.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper comprised data from two projects.
