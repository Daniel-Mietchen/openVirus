<p>This study utilized data collected in 2006 during high levels of A/H5N1 activity in southern China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] to test the hypothesized model. Comparing the model in these two different epidemic situations helps to validate the modelâ€™s robustness under different, but not unrelated circumstances.
