<p>The very limited literature on behavioural adherence to prevention during infectious respiratory epidemics suggests perceived effectiveness of recommended action and perceived risk consistently associate with health protective actions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To enable individual determination of risk, information on threat characteristics relative to self is needed. Trust is a core element in risk perception [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and influences perceived veracity of information from different sources. During epidemics, trust in information becomes important when people consider making informed decisions to change behaviour [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The public is usually passively exposed to epidemic-related information from government agencies via the media but more active searching may occur if perceived threat levels are high and imminent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Trust in information is associated with health protective behaviour adherence during epidemics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], but observing the actions of others also provides information [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In particular, during conditions of high uncertainty, for example during the early stages of an epidemic, people may seek information from a much broader array of sources, including observations of the actions of peers and affiliates (social learning) and from cautionary tales (cultural learning) if government/media information is lacking, inadequate, incomplete or unreliable [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Existing theoretical models poorly integrate such broader social influences with affective and cognitive elements.
