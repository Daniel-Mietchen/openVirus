<p>We are proposing that the situational awareness variables in the model (centre column, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) are intervening variables between information trust and hygiene behaviours. Our null hypothesis specified a model wherein all paths between social information trust and situational awareness, and between situational awareness and PHPs were assumed to be significant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This null model, tested first against A/H5N1 and then A/H1N1 data, proved an unsatisfactorily poor fit. We next re-specified the hypothesized model on the A/H5N1 data and then applied this re-specified model to the A/H1N1 data, which required further optimization. The optimized models are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> for the A/H5N1 data and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> for the A/H1N1 data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
