<p>In the A/H5N1 data, three cases were identified and deleted as outliers based on disproportionate contribution to normalized multivariate kurtosis, leaving 1,757 cases for model testing. Similarly, four cases were identified and deleted as outliers in the A/H1N1 data, leaving 1,012 cases for model testing. Mardia coefficients (63.68 and 41.68 for A/H5N1 and A/H1N1 survey data, respectively) indicated some degree of persisting non-normality for both survey datasets, thus robust maximum likelihood estimation and SB
