<p>The optimized model showed that greater trust in formal information was positively associated with perceptions of greater hygiene effectiveness (β = 0.25) and more influenza worry (β = 0.24) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Greater trust in informal information was associated only with greater influenza worry (β = 0.31). Self-reported knowledge (β = 0.24), perceived hygiene effectiveness (β = 0.23) and disease worry (β = 0.28) were positively associated with personal hygiene practices. Better self-reported knowledge was associated with greater perceived hygiene effectiveness (β = 0.15) while greater perceived susceptibility was associated with more influenza worry (β = 0.18). Other retained (dashed, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) paths were statistically significant but all had β &lt; 0.1 indicating their respective variables were only weakly associated. The model explained 21.8% of the variance in PHPs against A/H5N1.
