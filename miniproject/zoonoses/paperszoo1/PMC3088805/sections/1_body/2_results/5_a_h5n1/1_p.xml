<p>The hypothesized SEM algorithm was initially run using LMtests to assess missing paths. Two significant LMtest values suggested that including two additional parameters, a path-linking self-reported knowledge to perceived hygiene effectiveness and a path linking perceived susceptibility to disease worry, would significantly improve model fit. These two paths were theoretically plausible. The first path being consistent with Bandura’s view that knowledge guides judgments and action [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Both paths enhance the interaction of situational awareness variables in the model. Both paths were added and the SEM reiterated using Wtests to optimally parse the model by removing any unnecessary paths. Non-significant Wtests indicated that three parameters contributed little explanatory power and could be removed for parsimony: paths linking trust in informal information to self-reported causal knowledge, trust in informal information to perceived hygiene effectiveness, and trust in informal information to perceived susceptibility were deleted. The final A/H5N1 SEM is shown in Fig.

Solid lines with standardized parameters (β) indicate significant paths with βs &gt;0.1; statistically significant paths with βs &lt;0.1 were retained and are shown with dotted lines; non-significant paths are removed from the model.
