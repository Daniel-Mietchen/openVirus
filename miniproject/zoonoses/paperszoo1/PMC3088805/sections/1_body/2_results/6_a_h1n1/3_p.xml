<p>Mediation analysis of these paths using the method of Barron and Kenny [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] found trust in formal information association with perceived prevention effectiveness was partially mediated by causal knowledge only for A/H1N1 data (without knowledge mediation β = 0.42; with mediation β = 0.35, where a decline in the value of β on inclusion of the putative mediating variable (“with mediation”) indicates degree of mediation (~17%)). Association between trust in formal information and PHPs was strongly mediated by perceive prevention effectiveness (without perceived prevention effectiveness mediation β = 0.13; with mediation β = 0.05 (n.s.), ~61% mediation) for A/H5N1, but far less so in the case of A/H1N1 (without mediation β = 0.24; with mediation β = 0.20, ~17% mediation). Perceived susceptibility mediation between trust in informal information and worry was absent in A/H5N1 data and marginal (without mediation β = 0.46; with mediation β = 0.41, ~11% mediation) in A/H1N1data.
