<p>Greater trust in formal information was strongly associated with better self-reported knowledge (β = 0.64) but, in contrast to the A/H5N1 model, weakly (dashed β &lt; 0.1) associated with disease worry. Also, unlike the A/H5N1 model, disease worry weakly (dashed β &lt; 0.1) associated with PHPs, leaving only self-reported causal knowledge (β = 0.35) and perceived hygiene effectiveness (β = 0.14) associated with PHP. As in the A/H5N1 model trust in formal information was positively associated with perceived hygiene effectiveness (β = 0.19), greater self-reported causal knowledge was associated with greater perceived hygiene effectiveness (β = 0.25) and greater perceived susceptibility was associated with more influenza worry (β = 0.34). Other paths were either weak (dashed, β &lt; 0.1) or nonsignificant (absent). The model explained 17.7% of variance of PHP against A/H1N1.</p>
