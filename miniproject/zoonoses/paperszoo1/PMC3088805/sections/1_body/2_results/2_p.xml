<p>There were some demographic differences in the constructs specified in the model (Appendix TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). PHPs were generally greater in females across the two surveys but were unassociated with age. Perceived effectiveness of hygiene and disease worry were higher in females in the A/H5N1 survey only but positively associated with age in both surveys. Perceived susceptibility was negative associated with age in the A/H5N1 data but positively associated with age in the A/H1N1 data. Trust in formal information was higher in females and positively associated with age in the A/H5N1 data only while trust in informal information was positively associated with age but did not differ by gender in either dataset.
