 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], we used personal hygiene (respiratory etiquette, hand washing and serving utensil use) as PHP only. Three of four items in the A/H5N1 survey were common to the A/H1N1 survey (Appendix Table 
 <xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">1</xref>). Four and three items comprised assessment of personal hygiene practices for A/H5N1 and A/H1N1, respectively. Each item was scored on a 4-point categorical scale (“Always”, “Usually” “Sometimes” and “Never”). Scores for all three items were combined and the total score was used as a latent variable of PHP for the purposes of structural equation modelling. Using CFA factor loadings ranged between 0.55 and 0.75 for A/H5N1 items and 0.62–0.74 for A/H1N1 items.
