<p>Excepting perceived susceptibility, measured on a single ordinal item, other constructs were specified as latent variables and measured with two or more items. Sample characteristics for the two surveys were compared with the general population using Cohen’s effect sizes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Relevant data from each survey operationalizing domains specified in the conceptual model (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) were entered into the Structural Equation Model (SEM). Multivariate outliers were identified and deleted based on relative contribution to normalized multivariate kurtosis (non-normality). SEM requires continuous data with multivariate normal distribution. This was estimated using Mardia’s coefficient [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Missing data were handled with multiple imputation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] to generate ten datasets which were summarized into one for subsequent analysis, to maintain sample size and maximize available data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Standardized parameters (β) were estimated based on the summarized datasets. Standardized parameters &gt;0.10 accompanied by 
 <italic>p</italic> values ≤0.05 were considered as meaningful; Standardized parameters &lt;0.10 but accompanied by 
 <italic>p</italic> values ≤0.05 were considered weak and not meaningful. Those with associated 
 <italic>p</italic> values ≥0.05 were non-significant. Misfitting or poorly fitting models were re-specified guided by theoretical soundness and the Lagrange Multiplier test (LMtest) which tests if the addition of (specified) parameters (paths) improves model fit and the Wald Test (Wtest) which identifies parameters that can be removed without reducing the model fit [
