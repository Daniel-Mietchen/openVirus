<p>To evaluate model fit, multiple fit indices were examined; as each has some shortcomings when used alone we used a combination for robustness. Because

 <sup>2</sup> goodness of fit is sensitive to sample size, we required a

 <sup>2</sup>/
 <italic>df</italic> value of &lt;3 as favourable for large sample sizes such as those in the present study and used the Satorra–Bentler (SB)

Comparative Fit indices (CFI) produce the same value ranges as NNFI, where values exceeding 0.90 and 0.95 indicate acceptable and good fit respectively. Finally, RMSEA indicates model misfitting, where values exceeding 0.05 indicate an inadequate model fit. All fit indices were calculated and used to evaluate model fit [
