 <bold>Limitation</bold> This study’s limitations include being a secondary analysis of data collected for other purposes. Methodological heterogenity affected sampling and measurement. A greater proportion of women in the A/H5N1 sample inflating known demographic differences in risk perception and PHPs may account for some of the reported associations in the A/H5N1 dataset. However, variable means of the two samples were not markedly dissimilar (Appendix Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Being cross-sectional, causal direction is ambiguous. Some variables measured with single items are sub-optimally defined, possibly raising validity and reliability concerns, the alpha values are low for some constructs and the variance accounted for is relatively modest for both models. Reporting of PHPs may have been inflated, subject to social desirability and retrospective recall biases. This needs to be borne in mind when interpreting the findings.
