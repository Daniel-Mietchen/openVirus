 <bold>Demographic Differences</bold> These featured as determinants in many studies of PHP for RID prevention [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. We found similar differences but remain unsure why such differences exist, or what they mean, examining these in more detail elsewhere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. We incorporated elements from TPB (perceived effectiveness) and from HBM (knowledge, perceived susceptibility), and incorporated negative affectivity (worry), which many theoretical models exclude. Trust in informal information was strongly correlated with age in both datasets, but level of disease worry was higher for A/H5N1 than for A/H1N1 while levels of perceived susceptibility were comparable for both influenzas and showed age trends probably reflecting differential influenza experience. In both cases, trust was marginally higher in A/H1N1 than A/H5N1 data, probably reflecting historical factors. Following SARS trust in government was low and this took time to recover. Age-related differences were also found, with older people reporting more trust, consistent with other studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Given that perceived risk varies by demographic factors for crime [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] and infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], with more complex gender interactions seen on closer scrutiny [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] our findings are unsurprising.
