<p>The associations between the cognitive factors and PHPs found in our study are largely consistent with previous RID studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], most of which lack a robust theoretical basis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In extending core cognitive-affective components by incorporating the role of information trust, in particular social information our model more closely approximates an active RID epidemic/pandemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Differences between the two influenzas might reflect sample difference or indicate that influenza characteristics are themselves an important component driving situation awareness and response and should be factored into models to improve predictive power. Moreover, unlike most cognitive-behavioural models, our model accommodates cognitive and affective elements constituting mental representation of the threat posed by a RID epidemic/pandemic, consistent with the common sense model of illness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Future studies should target theory development to reconcile divergent models and accommodate different findings. Overall, our study provides a stronger foundation from which to develop better behavioural models of responses to future RID epidemics.
