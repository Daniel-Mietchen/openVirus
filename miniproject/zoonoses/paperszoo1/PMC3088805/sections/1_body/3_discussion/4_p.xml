 <bold>Trust in Informal Information</bold> Greater trust in informal information was associated only with older age and greater worry. How others act or what they say provide important environmental cues to action [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Chinese culture considers social conformity to be important, so monitoring the behaviour and attitudes of others may provide important threat-related information to inform decision-making. Perhaps epidemic disease-related worry remains low until peoples’ observations of others’ statements and behaviours indicate action is warranted, arousing a motivating affect and hence behavioural response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, a strong disease worry link to better personal hygiene was seen only for A/H5N1, consistent with previous studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Possibly, behavioural change may occur only when disease worry exceeds a certain threshold [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This suggests that risk communications generating moderate worry might be most effective for prompting appropriate hygiene behaviour [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Informal social influences deserve closer scrutiny in RID research.
