<p>Tissue samples were disrupted and homogenized with plastic pistons using specific buffers including in the Allprep DNA RNA Mini kit (Qiagen) or in TriReagent (Euromedex) for liver and lungs or for brain, respectively. Total RNA was then extracted according to the manufacturer’s protocols. In addition, a final step of purification was performed for RNA extracted from brain using RNeasy kit (Qiagen). All RNA were eluted in 30 µl of RNase-free water and stored at −80°C until use. They were then subjected to reverse transcription followed by amplification with the whole-transcriptome amplification (WTA) protocol (QuantiTect Whole Transcriptome kit, Qiagen), as previously described
