<p>Selected contig sequences or sequenced PCR products were used for phylogenetic analysis. Reference nucleotide or protein sequences from the various viral families studied were downloaded from the GenBank and UniProt databases, respectively. Multiple alignments were generated with ClustalX version 2.0 
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Larkin1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and used in BioEdit 
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Amino-acid sequence alignments were checked by eye, manually refined if necessary and trimmed to match the genome regions corresponding to the contig sequences or the sequenced PCR products generated in this study. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out by the neighbor-joining method, with MEGA 4.0.2 
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Tamura1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and a Poisson correction model for amino-acid sequences or a Kimura two-parameter model (transition-to-transversion ratio of 2.0) for nucleotide sequences, both with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Trees were visualized with FigTree version 1.3.1 (available from
