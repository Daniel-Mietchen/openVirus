<p>We report here the detection of sequences related to a new bat gammaretrovirus in lung tissue from the European bat species 
 <italic>Eptesicus serotinus</italic> (specimen b7). Gammaretroviruses have previously been detected in only 10 other bat species, in China, Australia and, more recently, in Ghana

 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Cui2" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. Phylogenetic analysis on the partial amino-acid sequence of the pol protein indicated that this new gammaretrovirus was different from those previously described in bats, thus confirming that bats can harbor a number of genetically diverse gammaretrovirus species. It has recently been suggested that these animals may have played a major role as reservoir hosts during the diversification of mammalian gammaretroviruses

 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Cui2" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. The contig sequences probably originated from viral transcripts, because total RNA was the starting biological material for our viral metagenomic analysis. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that we also detected the viral RNA genome of virions. Also and since DNA (viruses) were also detected, this novel gammaretrovirus could also be a endogeneous retrovirus. The detection of gammaretroviral sequences, by specific PCR amplification, in only one of the three tissue samples collected from specimen b7 is intriguing, but this may reflect higher levels of transcription in this tissue that in the other two tissues. However, the presence of retroviral sequences in lung samples is not surprising and confirms recent findings for African frugivorous bats (
