<p>As in other bat virome studies, a large number of sequences remained unclassified after taxonomic analysis on the basis of BLAST analysis, resulting in an underestimation of the total diversity of the viruses found in these animals 
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Donaldson1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-He1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. However, we provide some comprehensive clues to the nature of the viral communities present in the most common French bat species. In particular, we show that viral diversity is high within a given bat species, as in 
 <italic>Pipistrellus pipistrellus</italic> specimens b1–b4 and b9, but also between different species, thus confirming previous results 
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Donaldson1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, also we can not exclude that the observed differences in viral composition might also be related to differences in storage time and temperature between bats before necropsy was performed. We demonstrated that a single bat specimen could harbor multiple potentially zoonotic viruses, such as Ahun nairovirus and Maule rotavirus in specimen b8 (
 <italic>Myotis mystacinus</italic>). Further studies are required in a larger number of specimens from the same bat species and from additional, as yet unanalyzed species. In addition, a comparison of the viromes of bat specimens from other sites in Europe should extend the description of the diversity of viruses circulating in European bat populations.
