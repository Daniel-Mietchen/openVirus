<p>Short sequences related to the L gene of bornavirus were identified in various tissue samples (brain, liver or lungs) collected from most of the bat specimens analyzed (b1â€“b6, b9). Surprisingly, all were identical or highly similar, and displayed high levels of amino-acid similarity to a bornavirus-related sequence recently discovered in the genome of 
 <italic>Myotis lucifugus</italic>
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Belyi1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. This suggests that these sequences may also be endogenous. It has been shown that similar endogenous bornavirus-related sequences can be expressed as mRNAs in other vertebrate models 
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Horie1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Belyi2" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. Their presence and expression may confer some biological advantage on their hosts, such as natural resistance to the disease caused by the pathogen concerned 
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Belyi1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. This may account for the presence of these bornaviral sequences in all common pipistrelle specimens (
 <italic>Pipistrellus pipistrellus</italic>) tested and in two other bat species (
 <italic>Hypsugo savii</italic> and 
 <italic>Myotis nattereri</italic>) of the five analyzed. However, screening for bornavirus-related sequences should be extended to other bat species.
