<p>Despite the limitations imposed by the small number and short length of some of the viral sequences, we detected human-related picobirnaviruses in three different bat species, 
 <italic>Pipistrellus pipistrellus</italic> (specimens b1, b4 and b9), 
 <italic>Hypsugo savii</italic> (specimen b5), and 
 <italic>Myotis mystacinus</italic> (specimen b8). These results provide the evidence that picobirnarviruses are present in bats, confirming a previous report 
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-He1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The members of the recently identified family 
 <italic>Picobirnarividae</italic> are vertebrate viruses infecting a large spectrum of host species, including humans and diverse animals, such as other mammals, birds and reptiles 
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Ganesh1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. These viruses have been found mostly in fecal samples and are, therefore, considered to be potential opportunistic enteric pathogens

 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Victoria1" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>. However, they have also been found in the respiratory tracts of humans and pigs

 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Smits2" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>. It is therefore not surprising that picobirnaviral sequences were detected in our pooled bat tissues (including lungs and liver). The prevalence of this viral family in the bat specimens analyzed appeared high (5/9 or 55%) and requires further confirmation in a larger panel of individuals and species. The high degree of sequence similarity between the bat picobirnaviruses found in our study and human picobirnaviruses raises questions about the transmission of these viruses and their capacity to spread to humans, confirming the zoonotic potential of this family of viruses
