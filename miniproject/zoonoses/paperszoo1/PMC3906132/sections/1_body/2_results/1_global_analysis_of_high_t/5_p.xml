<p>Virus infecting invertebrates (mostly insects; 10% of contigs and 27% of reads, respectively, mean values), plants/fungi (8% and &lt;2%, respectively) and protozoa (3% and &lt;2%, respectively) or bacteriophages (8% and 10%, respectively), were also present, albeit at a lower frequency. Invertebrate virus-related contig sequences mostly related to the 
 <italic>Nodaviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Baculoviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Dicistroviridae</italic> families, whereas the sequences related to viruses infecting plants were mostly associated with 
 <italic>Phycodnaviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Tombusviridae</italic> or 
 <italic>Luteoviridae</italic>, and those related to viruses infected protozoa were mostly associated with the family 
 <italic>Mimiviridae</italic> (
