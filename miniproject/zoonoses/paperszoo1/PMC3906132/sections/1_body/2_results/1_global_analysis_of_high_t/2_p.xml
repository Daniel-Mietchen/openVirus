<p>Contig sequences were then generated by 
 <italic>de novo</italic> assembly, using the Velvet and CLC Genomics Workbench programs, generating almost 3,400 contigs (mean length = 309 nt) and 16,100 contigs (mean length = 438 nt) per pool sample, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0087194-t002">Table 2</xref>). A first taxonomic assignment of these contig datasets was performed, on the basis of BLASTn (E value ≤10e-03) or BLASTx (E value ≤1000) analysis, after Velvet and CLC 
 <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies, respectively. At this stage, the proportion of viral contigs was low, accounting for less than 2% of the total number of contigs (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0087194-t002">Table 2</xref>). These two types of contigs were pooled for each sample and analyzed for taxonomic classification (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087194-g001">Fig. 1A and 1B</xref>). The limited number of contigs obtained with Velvet was offset by classifying unassembled reads in a similar manner after BLASTn analysis. Virus-related reads accounted for less than 0.2% of all raw read sequences, consistent with the findings of previous metagenomic studies in bats based on Illumina sequencing (
