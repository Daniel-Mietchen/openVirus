 <italic>Borna disease virus</italic> (BDV) is the prototype species of the family 
 <italic>Bornaviridae</italic>, from the order Mononegavirales 
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Lipkin1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Rott1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. A second phylogroup was recently identified in this family, with the discovery of avian bornavius (ABV) 
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Kistler1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Honkavuori1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Both phylogroups consist of enveloped viruses with a non segmented negative-stranded RNA (almost 8,900 nt long) encompassing the five canonical genes, encoding, in the following order, the nucleoprotein (N), the phosphoprotein (P), the matrix protein (M), the glycoprotein (G) and the polymerase (L) 
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Briese1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-delaTorre1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Interestingly, endogenous sequences distantly related to some BDV genes (N, M and L) have been identified in the genomes of various mammals, including American microbats (

 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Belyi1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Horie1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. We identified HSPs derived from contig sequences closely related to bornavirus sequences in specimens b1 and b6 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0087194-t003">Table 3</xref>). BLASTx analysis showed that all these sequences matched the same region of the viral polymerase, but that there was genetic variability between the two specimens (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087194-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). PCR on the brains of these specimens confirmed the presence of these sequences, but also showed them to be present in the brain or lungs samples of other bats (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0087194-t003">Table 3</xref>). With the exception of the bornavirus-related sequence from b6, all these sequences had premature stop codons at the beginning of the 5â€² terminus, associated in one case with a 2 nt deletion with respect to the sequence from b6 (data not shown). Larger PCR products (&gt;400 nt) were also obtained for the brains of specimens b3 and b5, the lungs of b6 and the liver of b9 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0087194-t003">Table 3</xref> and data not shown). After sequencing and BLASTx analysis, only the first 100 nt of these sequences were found to display identity to the L gene of bornavirus (no overlap with the previous 300 nt of sequence), the remaining nucleotide sequences matching eukaryotic sequences. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that these bat bornavirus sequences were closely related and did not cluster with the two main viral phylogroups previously identified (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087194-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Moreover, pairwise comparison (by BLASTp) of the translated b6 sequence (216 nt, 71 aa) and the sequence of the polymerase of an endogenous bornavirus found in the genome of 
 <italic>Myotis lucifugus</italic>
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Belyi1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> showed these sequences to display 73% aa identity (data not shown). Overall, these observations are strongly suggestive of bat endogenous sequences.
