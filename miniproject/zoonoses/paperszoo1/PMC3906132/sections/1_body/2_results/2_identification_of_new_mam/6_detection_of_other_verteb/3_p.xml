<p>Numerous read and contig sequences related to the family 
 <italic>Picobirnaviridae</italic> (small double-stranded RNA viruses) were identified in five (specimens b1, b4, b5, b8 and b9) of the nine bat tissue sample pools (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0087194-t003">Table 3</xref>). These sequences displayed almost perfect nucleotide sequence identity to the gene encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the human picobirnavirus, with high E values (ranging from 7e-5 to 1e-74).
