<p>We focused on the identification of a selected panel of new mammalian viruses, from the 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae, Reoviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Retroviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Bornaviridae</italic>. This selection was based on the abundance of read and contig sequences corresponding to a given viral family, the length of the contig sequences obtained and the interest of the viral family identified in terms of the potential emergence of zoonoses and an absence or low frequency in bats.
