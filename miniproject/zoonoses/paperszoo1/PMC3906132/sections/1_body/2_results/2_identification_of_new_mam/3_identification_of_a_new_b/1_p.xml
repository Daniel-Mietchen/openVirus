<p>Rotaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with a segmented genome consisting of 11 double-stranded RNA segments encoding six structural (VP1 to VP4, VP6 and VP7) and five to six nonstructural proteins (NSP1 to NSP6)

 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Estes1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Rotavirus A is one of the three main species (the others being B and C) of the genus 
 <italic>Rotavirus,</italic> from the family 
 <italic>Reoviridae</italic>. There are several types of virus in this group, associated with a large number of diverse animal hosts

 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Martella1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. We identified sequences from pooled samples originating from specimen b8 (
 <italic>Myotis mystacinus</italic>) that gave significant hits matching sequences from this group of viruses. In BLASTx and BLASTn analyses, most of these sequences matched four of the 11 viral genome segments (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087194-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> and data not shown). Phylogenetic analysis based on the partial VP1 gene sequence demonstrated that this virus was more closely related to group A than other groups of rotaviruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087194-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). However, this sequence was found at a basal position in the phylogenetic tree, very distantly related to those clustering in this group, even the viral isolate recently identified in a single lesser horseshoe bat (
 <italic>Rhinolophus hipposideros</italic>) originated from China
