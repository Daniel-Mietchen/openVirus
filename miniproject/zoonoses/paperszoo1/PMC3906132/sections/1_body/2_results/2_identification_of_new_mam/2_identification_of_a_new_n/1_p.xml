<p>The genus 
 <italic>Nairovirus,</italic> from the family 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>, has seven species groups (or serogroups), including at least 34 predominantly tick-borne viruses 
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Elliott1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Nichol1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Like other members of this family, the viruses of this genus have a genome consisting of three segments of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA: the small (S), medium (M) and large (L) segments, encoding the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the glycoprotein precursor (GPC) generating the mature glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) on cleavage, and the viral polymerase (L), respectively 
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Walter1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0087194-Schmaljohn1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Multiple reads and several large contigs (up to almost 4,900 nt in length) from specimens b8 and b9 (liver and lung pools from 
 <italic>Myotis mystacinus</italic> and 
 <italic>Pipistrellus pipistrellus</italic>, respectively) strongly matched sequences from nairoviruses (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0087194-t003">Table 3</xref>). All three genome segments were covered (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087194-g003">Fig. 3A</xref> and data not shown). For each segment, a comparison of overlapping nucleotide regions (up to 3,456 nt long) between b8 and b9 contig sequences showed complete nucleotide identity, indicating that the same nairovirus-related agent was present in those two bat species (data not shown). All individual bat tissue samples were screened by PCR for the presence of this virus, with a specific set of primers targeting a conserved domain of the polymerase sequence. Lung tissue samples from specimens b8 and b9 tested positive on the amplification and sequencing of the amplicons (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0087194-t003">Table 3</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that this bat-related nairovirus diverged considerably from all other nairoviruses identified to date (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087194-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Thus, this virus, which we have named Ahun nairovirus, represents a putative new species of the genus 
 <italic>Nairovirus</italic>, and the first bat nairovirus identified to date.
