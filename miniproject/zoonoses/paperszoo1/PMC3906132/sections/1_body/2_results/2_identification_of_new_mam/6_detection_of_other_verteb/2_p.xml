<p>For example, the pool of samples from the bat species 
 <italic>Myotis nattereri</italic> (b6) contained several short read sequences (70 nt on average) related to the genus 
 <italic>Mastadenovirus</italic> within the 
 <italic>Adenoviridae</italic> family of double-stranded DNA viruses, with human adenovirus C identified as the closest relative (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0087194-t003">Table 3</xref>). High levels of amino-acid sequence similarity were observed for various adenoviral proteins, including the penton (E value = 0.0002, identity = 100%), penton base (E value = 0.0007, identity = 100%) and pIV (E value = 7e-09, identity = 94%) proteins. Two other sequences were found to be similar to sequences from recently described bat adenovirus isolates, with one contig sequence (114 nt, 84 aa) identified as related to bat adenovirus 2 in BLASTx analysis (E value = 4.7, identity = 47%), and a read sequence (76 nt) matching the bat adenovirus TJM in a BLASTn search (E value = 3e-17, identity = 92%)
