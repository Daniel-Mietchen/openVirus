  <title>Phylogenetic analysis of the bat nairovirus-related sequences.</title>
  <p>(A) Schematic representation of the large (L) segment (almost 12,260 nt encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of almost 4,040 aa) from the genome of Dugbe virus (GenBank number U15018), with black and gray bars corresponding to the longest contig sequences (&gt;300 nt) of the bat nairovirus (named Ahun nairovirus) identified in specimens b8 and b9, respectively. The genomic region amplified by PCR is represented by a dashed bar, and the sequence used for phylogenetic analysis is indicated with an asterisk. (B) Phylogenetic tree produced from the amino-acid alignment of the partial polymerase fragment (396-nt sequence, translated into a 132-aa sequence, aa positions 2317 to 2448 of the L protein of Dugbe virus, and aligned in accordance with previous studies 
   <xref rid="pone.0087194-Marriott1" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>, 
   <xref rid="pone.0087194-Muller1" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>). The name of the bat nairovirus is indicated in bold. The various serogroups of nairoviruses and prototype species of the other genera belonging to the family 
   <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> are indicated on the right of the tree. The scale bar indicates branch length, and bootstrap values â‰¥70% are shown next to the relevant nodes. The tree is midpoint-rooted for purposes of clarity only.
