  <title>Phylogenetic analysis of the bat bornavirus-related sequences.</title>
  <p>(A) Schematic representation of the L gene (almost 5,140 nt encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of almost 1,710 aa) of the genome of Borna disease virus isolate bil (GenBank number ACG59353), with black and dark gray bars corresponding to the three bat bornavirus HSPs identified in samples b1 and b6, respectively. The position of the genome region amplified by PCR is represented by a dashed bar, and the sequence used for phylogenetic analysis is indicated with an asterisk. (B) Phylogenetic tree produced from the nucleotide alignment based on a selected region (214–216 nt, approximate position 3233–3446 of the L gene sequence of Borna disease virus isolate bil) of the sequence obtained from the PCR product. Bat bornavirus-related sequences are indicated in bold. The scale bar indicates branch length, and bootstrap values ≥70% are shown next to the relevant nodes. The tree is midpoint-rooted for purposes of clarity only.</p>
