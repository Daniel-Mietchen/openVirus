  <title>Distribution of contig sequences after BLASTx analysis.</title>
  <p>(A) Percentage of sequences related to the main categories of existing viruses: vertebrate (blue), plant/fungal (green), invertebrate (brown), protozoan (yellow) viruses and bacteriophages (gray), and unassigned viral sequences (no data available concerning the taxonomic family, indicated in red). The total number of viral contigs is indicated below each pie chart. (B) Percentage of sequences related to the most abundant viral families, indicated by the same color range for each of the main viral categories as in (A) : blue = vertebrate, green = plant/fungal, brown = invertebrate, yellow = protozoan, gray = phage. Viral families accounting for less than 2% of all sequences are pooled in the “other” category (in purple), and read sequences with no available data regarding the taxonomic family are considered to be unassigned (in red).</p>
