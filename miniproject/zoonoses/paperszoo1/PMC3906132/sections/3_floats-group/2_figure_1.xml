  <title>Distribution of unassembled read sequences after BLASTn analysis.</title>
  <p>(A) Percentage of sequences related to the main categories of existing viruses: vertebrate (blue), plant/fungal (green), invertebrate (brown), protozoan (yellow) viruses and bacteriophages (gray), and unassigned viral sequences (no taxonomic data concerning the family available, indicated in red). The total number of viral read sequences is indicated below each pie chart. (B) The percentage of sequences related to the most abundant viral families, indicated in the same colors for each main viral category as in (A): blue = vertebrate, brown = invertebrate, gray = phage. Viral families accounting for less than 2% of total sequences were pooled and represented as the “other” category (in purple), and read sequences with no available data concerning the taxonomic family were considered to be unassigned (in red).</p>
