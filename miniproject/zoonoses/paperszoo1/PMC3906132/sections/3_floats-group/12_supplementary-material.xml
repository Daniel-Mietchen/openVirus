   <bold>Phylogenetic analysis of the bat sobemovirus-related sequence.</bold> (A) Schematic representation of the ORF4 gene (almost 710 nt encoding the coat protein of almost 235 aa) of the Sowbane mosaic virus, (GenBank number NC_011187), with black bars corresponding to the longest contig sequence (&gt;670 nt) from bat sobemovirus (named Bordeaux sobemovirus) identified in samples from b3 (Pipistrellus pipistrellus). (B) Phylogenetic analysis based on the partial coat protein amino-acid sequence (226 aa, approximate aa positions 1 to 237 of the capsid protein of Sowbane mosaic virus) translated from the contig of sample b3. (B) Phylogenetic tree produced from the amino-acid alignment based on the partial ORF4 sequence (206 aa) translated from the longest contig. The bat sobemovirus-related sequence is indicated in bold, within the various viral genera. The scale bar indicates branch length, and bootstrap values â‰¥70% are shown next to the relevant nodes. The tree is midpoint-rooted for purposes of clarity only.
