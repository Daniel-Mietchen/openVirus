  <title>Neuraminidase (sialidase)-treated NHBE cells are robustly infected by AIVs.</title>
  <p>NHBE cells were mock-treated (top panels) or treated with 25 mU/mL neuraminidase (bottom panels) for 1 hour at 37Â°C, washed with PBS, and infected with the indicated viruses at a MOI of 0.5. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde at 24 h pi and immunostained for influenza NP expression. Results shown are representative of two experiments.</p>
