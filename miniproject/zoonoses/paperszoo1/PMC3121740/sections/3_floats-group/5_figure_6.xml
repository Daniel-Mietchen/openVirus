  <title>Avian influenza viruses preferentially bind α2,3 glycan moieties.</title>
  <p>Purified viral stocks (≥10
   <sup>5</sup> pfu/ml) labeled with AlexaFluor 488 dye were analyzed via glycan array. The PA/33 and MI/06 were evaluated against 511 glycans, while the TX/02 and NY/04 were evaluated against 611 glycans. The graph represents the N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) α2,3, α2,6, and α2,8 glycans. RFU, relative fluorescent units.
