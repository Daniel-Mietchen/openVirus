  <title>Avian influenza viruses replicate and are shed apically from NHBE cells.</title>
  <p>NHBE cells were infected with PA/93 (H5N2), TX/02 (H5N3), or A/NY/55/04 at MOI = 0.001. At the times indicated post-infection, BEBM-0.05% BSA was added to the apical surface of the cells and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C. EID
   <sub>50</sub> titers were determined according the method of Reed and Meunch 
   <xref rid="pone.0021183-Reed1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Data are shown as means ± SD from two independent experiments. The dashed line represents the limit of detection.
