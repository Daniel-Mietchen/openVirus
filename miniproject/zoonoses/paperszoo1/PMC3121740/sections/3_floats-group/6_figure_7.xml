  <title>Avian influenza viruses elicit differential chemokine secretion patterns from NHBE cells.</title>
  <p>NHBE cells were infected in triplicate with the indicated viruses at MOI = 0.5. Apical washes (A, C, E, G, I) and basolateral media (B, D, F, H, J) were collected at the indicated times post-infection and analyzed for the presence of IL-1α (A and B), IL-8 (C and D), MCP-1 (E and F), IP-10 (G and H), and RANTES (I and J). Differences in chemokine expression were evaluated by Student 
   <italic>t</italic> test and considered significant when 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05. The highest detectable concentration was 10,000 pg/mL. Data are shown as means ± standard deviation (SD). ND, not determined.
