<p>Influenza A viruses are important pathogens that present a significant threat to public health, causing an extensive economic burden particularly for avian influenza virus (AIV) infection of poultry. Influenza viruses are segmented, enveloped, negative-strand RNA viruses belonging to the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family. They comprise a diverse array of subtypes due to their propensity to change antigenic profiles and are subtyped based on the antigenic properties of two surface glycoproteins, i.e. hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Seasonal epidemics cause more than 200,000 hospitalizations and more than 41,000 deaths each year in the United States alone

It remains unclear the precise features that contributed to the high rate of mortality due to infection with the 1918 influenza virus, but it has been shown that a single mutation in the PB1-F2 genome of 1918 influenza A viruses (also recognized for highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza) contributed to increased virulence

Moreover, since 2003, there has been an increased incidence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus outbreaks in poultry, and HPAI H5N1 has crossed species barriers to infect &gt;500 humans resulting in nearly a 60% fatality rate (&gt;300 deaths) as of April 2011
