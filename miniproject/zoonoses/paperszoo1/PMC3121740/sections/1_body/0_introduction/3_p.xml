<p>In these studies, we determined if low pathogenic H5N1, H5N2 and H5N3 AIV isolates of chicken or wild bird origin could infect and replicate in fully differentiated, normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells. We show that these viruses infect, replicate, and are released from NHBE cells independent of detectable sia α2,3 or α2,6 moieties present on the cell surface, and show that LPAI H5N1, H5N2 and H5N3 viruses induce higher IP-10 and RANTES responses early during infection compared to human H3N2 infection indicating differential chemokine expression patterns that may contribute to the unique aspects of disease pathogenesis between avian and human influenza virus infection.</p>
