<p>NHBE cells staining for sias α2,3 or α2,6 was determined by flow cytometry. Briefly, NHBE cells were washed with PBS and trypsinized for 10 min at 37°C. To determine lectin staining, cells were collected and centrifuged at 220× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min and resuspended in 2% formaldehyde for 30 min on ice and washed with flow buffer (1% BSA, 0.1% NaN
 <sub>3</sub> in PBS). To determine the level of sialic acid residues detectable following neuraminidase treatment, trypsinized cells were treated with increasing concentrations of neuraminidase from 
 <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in PBS for 1 hour at 37°C and then fixed in 2% formaldehyde for 30 min on ice and washed with flow buffer. Surface sias expression was determined by primary staining with 20 µg/mL biotinylated 
 <italic>Maackia amurensis</italic> lectin-II (MAA-II) (B-1265, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for sias α2,3, or 20 µg/mL biotinylated 
 <italic>Sambucus nigra</italic> lectin (SNA) (B-1305, Vector Laboratories) for sias α2,6 for 1 hour on ice. Secondary staining was performed with APC-conjugated streptavidin (BD, Mountain View, CA) diluted in flow buffer for 1 hour on ice. Cells were washed with flow buffer and analyzed on a LSRII flow cytometer using FACSDiva software (BD). Additional analysis was also performed using FlowJo software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR).
