<p>Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and stored at −80°C until used. Reverse transcription was performed using random hexamers and MuLV reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Influenza M gene expression were measured using a TaqMan real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) assay using previously described primers and probe 
 <xref rid="pone.0021183-Spackman1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Transcript levels were determined following a 10-minute hot start at 95°C in a three-step protocol with 15 s of denaturation (95°C), 30 s of annealing (60°C) and extension at 72°C for 15 s and analyzed using MXPro software by Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Copy numbers were determined by generation of a standard curve using plasmid DNA encoding influenza M gene. Plasmid DNA concentrations were measured by optical density using a spectrophotometer.
