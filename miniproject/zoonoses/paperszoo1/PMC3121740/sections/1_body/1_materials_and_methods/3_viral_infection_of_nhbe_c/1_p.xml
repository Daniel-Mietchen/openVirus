<p>Human and LPAI viruses were diluted in BEBM (Lonza) to equal titers as determined by MDCK plaque assay. NHBE cells were washed three times with PBS to remove excess mucus secretion on the apical surface prior to infection. Viruses were allowed to adsorb for 1 h at 37°C, the virus dilutions were removed by aspiration and washed again with PBS 3 times. NHBE cells were incubated for the indicated times pi at 37°C. Viruses released apically were harvested by the apical addition and collection of 300 µl of 0.05% BSA-BEBM allowed to equilibrate at 37°C for 30 min. Samples were stored at −80°C until assayed.</p>
