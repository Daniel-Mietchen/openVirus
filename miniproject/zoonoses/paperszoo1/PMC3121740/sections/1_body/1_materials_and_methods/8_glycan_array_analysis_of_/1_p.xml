<p>Glycan arrays were used to examine the receptor specificity of the A/Mute Swan/MI/06/451072-2/2006 (H5N1), A/chicken/Pennsylvania/13609/1993 (H5N2), A/chicken/TX/167280-4/02 (H5N3), and A/NY/04/55/2004 (H3N2) strains. Briefly, the strains were purified from allantoic fluid on a 25/60 percent sucrose gradient by ultracentrifugation and resuspended in 1 mM EDTA/PBS. All purified viral stocks were stored at −80°C. Viral titers were determined by standard plaque assay of Madin-Darby kidney cells. The minimum viral titer for glycan analysis was 1×10
 <sup>5</sup> pfu/ml, where all viral strains were labeled with 25 µg of AlexaFluor 488 dye (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in 1 M NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub> (pH 9) for 1 hour at 4°C. To remove residual dye, each sample was dialyzed in a 7000 MWCO Slide-A-Lyzer MINI dialysis cassette (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) against 1 mM EDTA/PBS overnight at4°C. The labeled viruses were analyzed via mammalian printed array, version 4.2 (contains 511 glycans) or 5.0 (contains 611 glycans), by the Core H of the Consortium of Functional Glycomics (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.functionalglycomics.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.functionalglycomics.org</ext-link>). The PA/93 and MI/06 were evaluated against 511 glycans, while the TX/02 and A/NY were evaluated against 611 glycans. Background fluorescence was determined by averaging the relative fluorescent units (RFU) of all glycans on the array and multiplied by 2. Glycan binding peaks that were above background with a %CV greater than 50% were not considered significant.
