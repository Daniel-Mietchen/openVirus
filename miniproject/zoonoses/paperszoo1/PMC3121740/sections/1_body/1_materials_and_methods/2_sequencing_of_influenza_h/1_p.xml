<p>To determine if mutations in the HA or neuraminidase gene occurred after single egg passage, these genes were sequenced. Briefly, the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) to extract RNA, and the One-step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) was employed to amplify the HA and NA gene segments for direct sequencing of PCR products using gene segment-specific amplification primers (

Cycle sequencing reactions were carried out using an ABI 9700 thermocycler and optimized to produce the maximal length of read while economizing the use of BigDye reagent (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). The resulting 10 µl cycle sequencing reaction was comprised of: 2 µl template, 1 µl ABI BigDye v3.1, 1 µl (1 pmole) sequencing primer, 2 µl ABI 5× sequencing buffer, 4 µl distilled water. Each amplicon was subjected to cycle sequencing reactions using both the forward and reverse amplifying primers. Internal primers were employed to fill in gaps and generate sequence at the 5′ and 3′ termini of each amplicon (

Cycle sequencing reactions were purified using Cleanseq reagent (Agencourt, Beverly, MA) and eluted in 40 µl of 0.1 mM EDTA. Purified cycle sequencing products were loaded onto an ABI 3130XL genetic analyzer and separated by capillary electrophoresis through an 80 cm capillary array. The resulting sequence traces were trimmed and assembled using Sequencher software (Genecodes, Ann Arbor, MI). No mutations in either gene were identified.
