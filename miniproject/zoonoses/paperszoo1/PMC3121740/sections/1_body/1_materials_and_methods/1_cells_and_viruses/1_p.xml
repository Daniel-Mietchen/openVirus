<p>Normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) from a single 17 year old healthy male donor were expanded, cryopreserved, and cultured in an air-liquid interface system as previously described 
 <xref rid="pone.0021183-Krunkosky1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The cells from the same donor were used in all assays for assay consistency. The apical surface of the cells was exposed to a humidified 95% air/5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> environment, and the basolateral medium was changed every two days.
