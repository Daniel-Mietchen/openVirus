<p>The low pathogenic AIV (LPAI) strains A/Mute Swan/MI/06/451072-2/2006 (H5N1), A/chicken/Pennsylvania/13609/1993 (H5N2), and A/chicken/TX/167280-4/02 (H5N3) were kindly provided by Dr. David Suarez, USDA-Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, Athens, GA. These viruses were previously passaged once in embryonated chicken eggs. A/New York/55/2004 (H3N2) was kindly provided by Dr. Richard Webby, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN. A single stock of these viruses was prepared for use in all assays by inoculating 9-day old specific pathogen-free (SPF) eggs and harvesting the allantoic fluid 48 h post-inoculation. Viral titers were obtained by serial dilution on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in the presence of 1 Âµg/ml trypsin (Sigma), and 50% egg infectious doses (EID
 <sub>50</sub>) were performed in 9-day old SPF chicken embryos and calculated according to the method of Reed and Muench
