<p>NHBE cells were fixed for 30 minutes in 3.7% formaldehyde at the times indicated post-infection. Sialic acid staining was performed as previously described 
 <xref rid="pone.0021183-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Briefly, to stain for sias, cells were incubated with 20 µg/mL biotinylated MAA-II (Vector Laboratories) to detect α2,3, or 20 µg/mL biotinylated SNA (Vector Laboratories) to detect sias α2,6 for 1 hour at room temperature, washed with PBS, and incubated with 15 µg/mL Texas Red streptavidin (Vector Laboratories). MAA-II was specifically chosen because it preferentially binds to sias α2-3Galβ1-3(Siaα2-6)GalNAc and not to non-sialic acid residues as do other isoforms of MAA

Following washing, cells were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.5% TX-100, washed in PBS-0.05%TWEEN (PBS-T) and incubated with mouse anti-NP IgG2a diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS-T. The cells were then washed with PBS-T, incubated for one hour with anti-mouse IgG AlexaFluor488 (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, California) and anti-β-tubulin directly conjugated to FITC (cilia stain). Cells were rapid stained with DAPI (1 µg/mL). After washing with PBS-T, membranes were excised from their culture inserts and mounted on glass slides.
