<p>To remove sia moieties from the cell surface, and to confirm the specificity of lectin binding, NHBE cells were apically treated with the indicated concentration of neuraminidase from 
 <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in PBS for 1 hour at 37Â°C as previously described 
 <xref rid="pone.0021183-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Following sialidase incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS. NHBE cells were apically mock infected or infected with A/Mute Swan/MI/06/451072-2/2006 (H5N1), A/chicken/Pennsylvania/13609/1993 (H5N2), A/chicken/TX/167280-4/02 (H5N3), or NY/04/55/2004 (H3N2) at the indicated multiplicities of infection (MOI). Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 30 min or harvested in triplicate at the times indicated post-infection.
