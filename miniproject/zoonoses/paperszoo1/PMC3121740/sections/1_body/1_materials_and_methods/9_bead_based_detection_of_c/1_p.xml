<p>The Luminex® xMAP™ system, a high-throughput microsphere-based suspension array was used with a MILLIPLEX MAP human cytokine/chemokine immunoassay (Millipore, St. Charles, MO) for the rapid immunological detection of secreted cytokines and chemokines from NHBE cell supernatants according to the manufacturer protocol. Briefly, beads coupled with biotinylated anti-IL-1α, anti-IL-1β, anti-IL-8, anti-MCP-1, anti-MIP-1α, anti-MIP1β, anti-IP-10, anti-RANTES monoclonal antibodies were sonicated, mixed, and diluted in bead diluent. For the assay, beads were diluted 1∶4 in bead diluent and incubated overnight at 4°C with NHBE apical wash or basolateral supernatant. After washing, beads were incubated with streptavidin-phycoerythrin for 1 hour at room temperature, washed, and resuspended in wash buffer. The assay was analyzed on a Luminex 200 instrument (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX) using Luminex xPONENT 3.1 software. Additional analysis was performed using MILLIPLEX Analyst (Millipore).</p>
