<p>Apical IP-10 expression was differentially induced by AIV infection. Infection of NHBE cells with PA/93 or TX/02 induced apical IP-10 expression that was low at 6 h pi but significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher than mock treated cells, and between 6 h and 24 h pi, IP-10 levels substantially increased to levels beyond the upper limits of detection of the assay system (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g007">Fig. 7E</xref>). In contrast, insignificant levels of apical IP-10 expression were detected 2 h post-MI/06 virus infection compared to mock controls, but between 6 h–24 h, apical IP-10 levels steadily increased peaking at 24 h pi. Of note, PA/93 and TX/02 strains were isolated from chickens, while MI/06 is a wild bird (mute swan) isolate. These results suggest that differential levels of IP-10 expression may characterize a unique host response to avian isolates. This feature may also be relevant for unique host responses between AIV and human viruses. NHBE cells infected with A/NY expressed low levels of apical IP-10 relative to AIV infection, although a significant (p&lt;0.05) level of IP-10 expression was evident throughout the time course compared to mock-treated cells. Basolateral expression of IP-10 was similar among AIV. For example, AIVs induced significant (p&lt;0.05) and high IP-10 between 6–24 h pi, while NY/04 infection did not stimulate significant (p&lt;0.05) basolateral IP-10 expression until 24 h pi (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g007">Fig. 7C and D</xref>), avian and human influenza infection of NHBE cells did not induce an appreciable or significant level of apical MCP-1 expression relative to mock-infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g007">Fig. 7G</xref>), however, NY/04 infection was associated with an approximate 2-fold significant (p&lt;0.05) increase of basolateral MCP-1 above mock-infected cells at 12 h and 24 h pi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g007">Fig. 7H</xref>). Interestingly, infection with AIVs significantly (p&lt;0.05) inhibits basolateral MCP-1 secretion relative to mock-infected NHBE cells. This is in contrast to findings

 <xref rid="pone.0021183-deJong1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. It is likely that differences in severity of disease pathogenesis linked to low pathogenic and high pathogenic AIV infections affect MCP-1 expression via differences in levels of inflammation linked to recruitment of different cell types to sites of infection.
