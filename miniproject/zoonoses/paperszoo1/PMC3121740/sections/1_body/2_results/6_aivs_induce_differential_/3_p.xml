<p>Apically-expressed IL-8 levels detected following AIV or human influenza virus infection were similar, and expressed to slightly higher but insignificant (p&lt;0.05) levels compared to mock-treated cells between 6â€“18 h pi (

Interestingly, basolateral expression of IL-8 was beyond the upper limits of detection for the assay system between 6 h and 24 h pi following infection by any virus and in mock-treated cells; however, lower levels of basolateral IL-8 were detected for MI/06 and TX/02 infected cells at 2 h pi (
