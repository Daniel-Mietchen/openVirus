<p>Previous studies have shown that pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including interferon (IFN) α/β, interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, MIP-1β, and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 are detected at elevated levels in the respiratory tracts of individuals during the acute phase of influenza infection

Both the apical and basolateral secretion patterns of IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-8, IP-10, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, MCP-1, and RANTES expression were determined (

No appreciable levels of IL-1β, MIP-1α or MIP-1β were detected from the basolateral or apical compartments of AIV or human influenza infected NHBE cells (data not shown); however, AIVs induced differential apical and basolateral expression patterns of IL-1a, IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1, and RANTES over time (
