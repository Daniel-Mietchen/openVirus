<p>Similar to levels of apical IP-10 expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g007">Fig. 7E</xref>), AIV isolated from chickens, i.e. PA/93 (H5N2) and TX/02 (H5N3), induced higher levels of apical and basolateral RANTES expression compared to infection by the wild bird isolate, MI/06 (H5N1) 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g007">Fig. 7I and J</xref>). In addition, AIV also induced higher levels of RANTES expression from both the apical and basolateral surfaces of NHBE cells compared to human A/NY infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g007">Fig. 7I and J</xref>). These results are analogous to 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> findings in which individuals infected with highly pathogenic H5N1 had higher systemic levels of RANTES compared to individuals infected with influenza A and B 
 <xref rid="pone.0021183-Peiris1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. These results suggest that differential expression of IP-10 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g007">Fig. 7E and F</xref>) and RANTES (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g007">Fig. 7I and J</xref>) during the early response to infection may be a biomarker differentiating AIV from human influenza virus infection, and may highlight host adaptation within avian influenza virus species, i.e. between chicken and wild bird AIV infections.
