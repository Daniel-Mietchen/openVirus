<p>To determine if α2,3 sias expression is required for AIV infection of NHBE cells, the cells were infected (MOI = 0.5) with MI/06, PA/93, TX/02, or human A/NY, and lectin-stained for α2,6 sias (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), or α2,3 sias (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), and immunostained for viral NP to detect replicating virus at the time-points indicated. Both human and AIVs infected and replicated in NHBE cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). The results showing co-staining of α2,6 sias and viral NP at 72 h post-MI/06 infection indicate that this H5N1 wild bird isolate is not restricted to cells expressing α2,3 sias. In addition, the other AIVs infected and replicated in NHBE cells independent of significant α2,3 sias expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). For the AIV, replication determined by NP expression, occurred by 24 h and was robust up to 72 h pi where MI/06 (H5N1) and PA/93 (H5N2) replication induced severe cytopathic effects, changes in cell morphology, and loss of the confluent cell monolayer. Similarly, human A/NY (H3N2) quickly spread throughout the NHBE cell culture and induced substantial cytopathic effects and cell loss. Over the time-period of replication by AIVs or human virus, there was a progressive decline of cell surface expression of α2,6 sias, albeit to a lesser extent for TX/02 (H5N3) infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). These effects may be linked to influenza neuraminidase expression during replication.
