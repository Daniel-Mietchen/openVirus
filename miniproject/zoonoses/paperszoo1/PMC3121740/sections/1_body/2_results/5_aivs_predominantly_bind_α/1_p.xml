<p>Glycan arrays were utilized to further characterize the sialic acid moieties involved in receptor specificity of each virus. The array results show that MI/06, PA/93, and TX/02 avian strains preferentially bind α2,3 glycans with reduced binding observed for α2,6 oligosaccharides (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g006">Fig. 6A–C</xref>). After closer examination of the α2,6 glycans that appeared to bind MI/06, PA/93, and TX/02 avian strains, several of the glycans were classified as Neu5Aca2-6 glycans because of their terminal position but actually contain α2,3 oligosaccharide branches (e.g. Neu5Aca2-6(Neu5Aca2-3Galb1-3)GalNAca-Sp8) that are presumably utilized in avian specific receptor recognition. Conversely, the human A/NY/55/04 predictably binds the α2,6 sias glycans with less recognition of α2,3 glycans (
