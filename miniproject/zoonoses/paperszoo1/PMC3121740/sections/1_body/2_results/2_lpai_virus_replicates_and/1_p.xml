<p>To determine if LPAI viruses can infect NHBE cells, the cells were apically infected with A/chicken/Pennsylvania/13609/1993 (H5N2; PA/93), A/chicken/TX/167280-4/02 (H5N3; TX/02), or NY/04/55/04 (H3N2) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 (equivalent to 10
 <sup>4.38</sup> EID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL for PA/93, 10
 <sup>3.86</sup> EID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL for TX/02, or 10
 <sup>4.99</sup> EID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL for NY/04/55/04). This low MOI was chosen to allow for better detection of virus replication in subsequent apical cell washings at the time-points indicated. Within 24 h pi, NHBE cells infected with PA/93 had apical wash virus titers of 10
 <sup>5</sup> EID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL which peaked by 48 h pi to 10
 <sup>5.8</sup> EID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). NHBE cells infected with TX/02 had apical wash titers that increased slightly at 24 h pi to 10
 <sup>4.3</sup> EID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL, subsequently increased to 10
 <sup>5.8</sup> EID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL at 48 h pi, and peaked at 10
 <sup>6.1</sup> EID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL at 72 h pi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). As the EID
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined from apical washes, the results suggest that both PA/93 and TX/02 replicate and are shed apically from NHBE cells, however we cannot exclude the possibility that virus shed from the basolateral side of the culture did not leak upward toward the apical side. As expected, NHBE cells infected with human influenza NY/04/55/04 (H3N2) supported a productive infection in the first 24 h pi (10
 <sup>5.9</sup> EID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL), but due to considerable cell death related to virus replication, the apical wash titers were decreased by 48 h pi (10
 <sup>4.8</sup> EID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL), and few cells remained at 72 h pi.
