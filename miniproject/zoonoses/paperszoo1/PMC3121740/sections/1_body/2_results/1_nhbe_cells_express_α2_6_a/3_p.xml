<p>To determine sias expression on ciliated cells and goblet cells, fully differentiated NHBE cells were immunostained for MUC5AC to indicate goblet cells, and β-tubulin to indicate ciliated cells, and lectin-stained for determining the corresponding surface levels of α2,3 or α2,6 sias. The results show that the NHBE cells have both ciliated and goblet cells (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g002">Fig. 2A and 2B</xref>; co-expression indicated in yellow), none of the ciliated or goblet cells expressed detectable α2,3 sias (
