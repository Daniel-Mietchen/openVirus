<p>To determine if the propensity of AIVs to infect NHBE cells was related to sia α2,3 tropism, the cells were stained with sia-specific lectins. MAA-II lectin preferentially binds to α2,3 sialic acids 
 <xref rid="pone.0021183-Knibbs1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, and SNA lectin preferentially binds to α2,6 sialic acids. NHBE cells abundantly express α2,6 sialic acids on the cell surface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), while α2,3 sias are expressed at a lower level (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Previous studies suggest that AIV infect ciliated cells which primarily express sias α2,3, while human viruses preferentially infect non-ciliated cells expressing sias α2,6 
 <xref rid="pone.0021183-Matrosovich2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The specificity of staining using MAA-II or SNA lectins was confirmed by pre-treating the apical surface of NHBE cells with neuraminidase (image inserts in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>) which shows that treatment removed detectable sias from the cell surface.
