<p>To determine the relative distribution of α2,3 or α2,6 sias moieties on the NHBE cell surface, the cells were lectin-stained and analyzed by flow cytometry. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g001">Figure 1C</xref> shows that α2,6 sias are abundantly expressed on most NHBE cells. However, staining for α2,3 sias showed that while many cells express α2,3 sias there are two levels expressed, i.e. dimly positive and brightly positive as determined by flow cytometry. To determine the extent of cell surface sia residues removed by neuraminidase, NHBE cells were treated with increasing levels of neuraminidase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). NHBE cells treated with the highest neuraminidase concentration (1000 mU/mL) removed &gt;60% all detectable α2,6 sias (data not shown), while similar treatment removed &gt;95% of detectable α2,3 sias.
