<p>Since AIV infection and replication in NHBE cells did not appear to be constrained by a HA-Î±2,3 sias barrier (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021183-g005">Fig. 5</xref>), the NHBE cells were treated with neuraminidase to remove detectable sias and determine if infection could be inhibited. Recent findings suggest that neuraminidase treatment can reduce influenza virus infection, but total inhibition does not occur 
 <xref rid="pone.0021183-Stray1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Similar to previous findings, neuraminidase treatment of NHBE cells had little effect on AIV or human influenza virus infection, as determined by NP (
