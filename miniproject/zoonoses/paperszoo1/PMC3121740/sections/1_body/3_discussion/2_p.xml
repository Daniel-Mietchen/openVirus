 <xref rid="pone.0021183-Schnitzler1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> have shed light on molecular changes in influenza A viruses that are involved with their adaptation to new species 
 <xref rid="pone.0021183-Webby1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. One recent study suggests that a HA with truncated glycans can recognize Î±2,3 sias with increased affinity and decreased specificity 
 <xref rid="pone.0021183-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, and single amino acid changes within the HA can lead to complete loss of binding to sias residues and subsequent replication within the lungs 
 <xref rid="pone.0021183-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Understanding these features is critical for disease intervention, as these steps are central in emergence of pandemic viruses.
