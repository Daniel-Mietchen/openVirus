<p>The requirement of HA-sialic acid receptor binding for influenza virus infection has been recognized as a target for disease intervention. Recent studies suggest that an inhaled neuraminidase fusion protein can be used to removal of sias from the airway epithelium as a possible prophylactic and treatment for influenza infection 
 <xref rid="pone.0021183-Malakhov1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. The rationale for this approach centers on the hypothesis that α2,3- and α2,6 sias on human airway epithelium are in large part barriers for avian and human viruses, and that reducing sias levels on the airway surface would have significant impact on influenza virus infectivity. In this study, we confirmed using NHBE cells that human bronchial epithelial cells express both forms of sialic acid, and that α2,6 sias are more abundant than α2,3 sias. While we show higher levels of sias staining by flow cytometry than by immunofluorescence, this is likely due to the increased sensitivity of flow cytometry as compared to confocal microscopy. We further show that despite neuraminidase treatment, NHBE cells are readily infected by AIV and human influenza strains. These findings are consistent with similar studies demonstrating that H5N1 influenza can replicate within

 <xref rid="pone.0021183-Stray1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, and neuraminidase-treated human airway epithelial cells can be infected with a H3N2 virus 
 <xref rid="pone.0021183-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. ST6Gal I sialyltransferase knockout mice, which lack the enzyme necessary for the attachment of α2,6 sialic acid to N-linked glycoproteins on the cell surface, can be infected with human influenza and produce similar lung virus titers compared to wild-type mice 
 <xref rid="pone.0021183-Glaser2" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Therefore, it is likely sias provide a relatively low-affinity interaction for influenza viruses while other potential influenza virus receptors remain to be identified. Furthermore, one study using recombinant HAs showed that several avian HAs exhibited human-like binding profiles to α2,3 sias 
 <xref rid="pone.0021183-Shelton1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. The results from our studies show that in the absence of detectable sias moieties on neuraminidase-treated NHBE cells, both human and AIV can readily infect, and that there is evidence that the wild bird isolate (MI/06; H5N1) also infects and replicates in NHBE cells that co-stain for α2,6 sias. It is important to emphasize that neuraminidase treatment reduced &gt;95% of the α2,3 sias expression on the cell surface, and despite this, AIV had the same level of infection in these cells as compared to mock-treated cells. The AIV strains predictably exhibit α2,3 receptor specificity as illustrated in the glycan array with minimal recognition of α2,6 sias glycans, showing that glycan arrays are not a conclusive means for identifying viral receptor binding. The array contains approximately 100 influenza-specific sialic acid targets with only 32 glycans representing the α2,6 sias repertoire, which is a minor representation of all possible α2,6 sias that may be present in nature. The α2,3 moieties included in the array contained complex modifications (i.e. fucosylation, sulfation) that were excluded from the α2,6 glycans, so with the limited number of α2,6 sias on the glycan array it would be difficult to exclude that these avian strains do not bind α2,6 linked sialic acid receptors. A more comprehensive array would need to be employed to fully characterize the receptor specificity of these AIV strains.
