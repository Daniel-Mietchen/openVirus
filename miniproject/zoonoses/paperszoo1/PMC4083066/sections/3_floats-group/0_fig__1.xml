  <p>Transmission and spread of avian influenza viruses from wild to domestic birds and potential spill to humans. Wild aquatic birds could carry avian influenza viruses (AIVs) over long distances. Ducks play important role in the transmission of AIVs from migratory waterfowls to domestic poultry. Newly introduced AIVs cause occasional poultry outbreaks, as in the case of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5 and H7 viruses, resulting to mass culling that leads to huge economic losses. Some AIVs become established in domestic poultry where they co-circulate and reassort with locally endemic strains producing novel virus progenies. Similarly, these newly formed virus variants find their way back to migratory birds through ducks. Direct human infections with AIVs typically occur during outbreak settings due to extensive exposure to infected poultry usually. These cases, although sporadic, could provide an opportunity for the virus to evolve into one that could sustain efficient human-to-human transmission. Meanwhile, introduction of AIVs into pig herds could further hasten up the genetic evolution of AIVs through adaptation and/or reassortment which could generate strains with potential threat to animal and human health.</p>
