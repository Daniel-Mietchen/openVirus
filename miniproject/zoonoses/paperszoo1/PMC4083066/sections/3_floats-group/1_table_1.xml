   <p>Most of these cases, obtained from the World Health Organization, US Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and in PubMed, have been associated with close contact or prolonged exposure to infected birds. To date, HPAI A/H5N1 infections remain the highest in occurrence with about 60% of the cases lethal. However, A/H7N9 human infections have been constantly growing since its first detection in March 2013. From about 350 cases recorded, over 70 (roughly 20%) reportedly succumbed to virus infection. Amid the H7N9 infections still being reported, another novel avian H10N8 strain also killed two of its three victims since December 2013.</p>
