<p>Through natural and experimental conditions, some of the notable AIVs mentioned above have the capacity to infect and become established in swine populations. Although domestic pigs appear to have low susceptibility [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], HPAI A/H5N1 viruses have been isolated from pig herds in China [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and Indonesia [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Serologic exposure to HPAI A/H5N1 viruses was also detected in asymptomatic pigs in Vietnam [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Since 1998, several A/H9N2 viruses have been also isolated from pigs in Hong Kong and other provinces of China [

 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Somehow, a more recent study predicted that A/H9N2 viruses may have become endemic among domestic pigs [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Variants of the A/H7N9 virus have been also shown to productively infect pigs in experimental settings but were unable to transmit to other animals [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. It is also noteworthy that the internal gene constellations of the newly emergent A/H7N9 and A/H10N8 viruses contain corresponding segments from A/H9N2 virus subtypes prevailing in Chinese poultry [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Given the general reputation of pigs with regards to virus ecology and evolution, their role in the genesis in either or both of these AIVs that are making ripples for pandemic concerns cannot be ruled out. Regardless, introduction of these AIVs in swine populations could provide alternative means to hasten genetic evolution (
