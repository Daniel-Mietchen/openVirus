<p>With the inherent capacity of flu A viruses to evolve and adapt, it is only a matter of time before novel AIV variants capable of sustaining person-to-person transmission arise. The role of pigs as a focal point in the generation of novel flu A viruses with pandemic potential has been constantly highlighted. The presence of mixed populations of sialic acid viral receptors that line the pig respiratory tract epithelia make pigs susceptible to avian and human flu strains, apart from their own viruses [

 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Hence, infection of pigs with AIVs could facilitate adaptation to mammalian hosts particularly humans via accumulation of adaptive mutations (
