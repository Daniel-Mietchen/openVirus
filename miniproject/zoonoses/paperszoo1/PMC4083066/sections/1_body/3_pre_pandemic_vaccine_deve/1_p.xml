<p>Vaccination remains the most effective countermeasure against the spread of novel and potentially pandemic flu A viruses [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. For the past decade, several vaccine strategies and preparations for humans have been developed and are being tested ranging from inactivated, live-attenuated, recombinant protein-based, virus-like particles to DNA-based and adenovirus-vectored vaccines [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Since the world's population is expected to have no pre-existing immunity against A/H5N1 strains, the use of efficacious and safe adjuvants to maximize vaccine coverage is also being considered and evaluated. There are also increasing efforts in developing universal vaccines that target conserved domains of various viral proteins [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Acknowledging the probability of a future A/H5N1 pandemic, the World Health Organization Global Influenza Programme for its part has recommended the development of representative pre-pandemic H5N1 vaccine candidate viruses that represent antigenically and genetically distinct H5 strains, particularly those that have infected humans through contact with ill or dead infected birds, for stockpiling [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Such pre-pandemic vaccines have been prepared by reverse genetics, and safety tested prior to distribution for pilot vaccine production that may be used for experimental studies and for stockpiling [
