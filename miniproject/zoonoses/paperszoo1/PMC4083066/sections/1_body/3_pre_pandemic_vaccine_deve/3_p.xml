<p>Antiviral drugs provide an important alternative public health intervention for preventing and treating influenza when a vaccine is not available. Currently, two major classes of anti-flu drugs are available which inhibit the release of infectious viruses (NA inhibitors) and block the matrix protein 2 ion-channel (adamantane derivatives), respectively [

 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. However, given the plasticity of the flu A viral genome, the emergence of drug-resistant strains against these classes of prophylactic agents could arise. Apart from that, the timing of treatment is also significant on their efficacy. Notably, emerging variants of the human-infecting A/H7N9 virus already gained NA inhibitor resistance without losing their viability and pathogenicity [
