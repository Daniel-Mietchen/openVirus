<p>Because A/H7N9 infection of humans is very rare, it is not surprising to find that no pre-existing immunity was detected against the A/H7N9 virus in any of the age groups tested in serologic assays [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Apparently, receipt of current seasonal human flu vaccines did not also induce detectable cross-reactive antibodies suggesting that even current seasonal vaccination will not afford protection. In a more promising note though, few groups have shown that some H7-specific vaccine preparations, developed by applying strategies learned from the H5 and 2009 pandemic vaccine development efforts, could offer protection from A/H7N9 virus challenge in animal models [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. However, their efficacy in human subjects remains to be evaluated. Although pre-pandemic H5 and H7 vaccines are in the pipeline for development, there is also a dire need for other subtype-specific candidate vaccines (e.g., H6, H9, and H10). Furthermore, strategies that can augment vaccine coverage will be invaluable in the event of a pandemic to meet global demands.
