<p>Among the vast pool of AIVs in nature, HPAI A/H5N1 viruses have been considered to present the greatest concern to cause the next flu pandemic (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Since its first appearance in Guangdong, China in 1996, it has already spawned various clusters of antigenically divergent HPAI H5 lineages that spread widely in Asia towards Europe and Africa [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], causing devastating poultry outbreaks along its path. In humans, more than 640 HPAI A/H5N1 infections worldwide have been recorded since 1997 by the World Health Organization wherein about 60% were fatal [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Aberrant innate immune responses have been shown to be a hallmark of the atypical virulence of the HPAI A/H5N1 virus that results in the high incidence of mortality [

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The first imported case in North America was also recently confirmed in a resident of Alberta, Canada who returned from Beijing, China in December 27, 2013, was hospitalized, and died after few days due to viral infection [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. At present, there are no imminent indications that contemporary HPAI A/H5N1 viruses have the capacity to support efficient viral transmission in humans. However, two independent studies have simultaneously demonstrated how few changes in the HPAI A/H5N1 viral genome could confer airborne transmission between mammals [
