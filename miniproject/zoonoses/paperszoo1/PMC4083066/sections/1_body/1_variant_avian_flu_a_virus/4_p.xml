<p>Human infection with A/H9N2 AIVs was first documented in Hong Kong in 1999 [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Retrospectively, it was postulated that the HPAI A/H5N1 virus, which caused the 1997 human outbreaks also in Hong Kong, acquired most of its gene segments from avian A/H9N2 subtypes that were circulating in 1997 [
