<p>Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) recognize specific sialic acid receptors of susceptible cells lining the intestinal gut of avian hosts [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, specific modifications in HA through adaptation shifts receptor recognition, which in turn effectively switches binding preferences to specific receptors expressed by mammalian hosts, including humans. Further genetic alterations at the HA cleavage motif of some subtypes (e.g., H5 and H7) could make HA readily cleaved by ubiquitous cellular proteases [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Accumulation of polybasic residues on this site, typically seen among highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 and H7 viruses, promotes efficient biological activation facilitating growth in various organs outside the respiratory tract [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Other viral factors are also found in the remaining gene segments which altogether promote propagation at different temperatures, efficient replication of the viral genome, attenuation of host immune responses, and resistance to antiviral drugs [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Collectively, these features account for the virulence, expansion of host range, and interspecies transmission of AIVs.
