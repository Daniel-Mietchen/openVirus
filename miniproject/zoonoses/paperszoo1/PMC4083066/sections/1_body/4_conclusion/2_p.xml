<p>Overall, these zoonotic transmissions validate the potential of AIVs to cause the next human pandemic. With the continued circulation of these viruses, the generation of more virulent and human-transmissible variants, however remote at the moment, remains a possibility given the right conditions and appropriate hosts. Hence, these concerns collectively call for continued virus monitoring and surveillance in humans and animal populations alike, worldwide. Coupled with virus characterization and pathobiologic assessment, these will help identify which strains we should be particularly worried about and set focus on in the future. Finally, the recent incursions of variant flu strains in humans, apart from H5 and H7 viruses, also require the need for appropriate virus-specific or efficacious universal vaccines that can induce broad cross-protective responses which can be made available and administered in the event of or even before a pandemic happens.</p>
