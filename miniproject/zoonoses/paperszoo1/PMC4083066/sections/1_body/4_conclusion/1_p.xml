<p>At present, none of the zoonotic AIVs above indicated efficient human-to-human dissemination beyond index cases. However, the growing number of cases sparks continuing worries that they could eventually evolve into variants that will cause global concern. Recent evidence suggest that after the initial outbreaks, the human-infecting flu A (H7N9) and local avian A/H9N2 strains had undergone further reassortment which may be responsible for the sudden increase in human cases in early 2014 [
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. It should be noted that HPAI A/H5N1 took about five years to attain the number of cases A/H7N9 is currently racking up. Such impressive disease burden catapults A/H7N9 alongside HPAI A/H5N1, if not ahead, as the next potential human pandemic contender. Unlike HPAI A/H5N1 viruses which cause massive die-offs in affected poultries, A/H7N9 and A/H10N8 do not induce noticeable clinical disease indicators. Such feature would make virus tracking and surveillance more difficult and challenging. In another light, the constant inclusion of A/H9N2 viral components into the zoonotic A/H5N1, A/H7N9, and A/H10N8 strains raises the question whether A/H9N2 viruses predominantly circulating in Chinese poultry could have adapted to support human infections when mixed with the right combination of segments (e.g., HA and NA).
