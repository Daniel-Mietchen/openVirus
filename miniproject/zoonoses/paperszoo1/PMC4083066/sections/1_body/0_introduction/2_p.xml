<p>Generally, flu A viruses are found in migratory waterfowls, the principal natural reservoirs [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Part of their genetic variability is due to the absence of a proof-reading mechanism of the flu A viral RNA polymerase leading to faulty replication cycles. Similarly, the segmented nature of the RNA genome is also fundamental to the genetic evolution of flu A viruses. Co-infection of a single host with two or more viruses facilitates genetic reassortment, the rearrangement of genetic material by the exchanging of gene segments, creating progeny viruses with novel gene constellation one of which may have the ability to infect new hosts [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Thus, even if they are generally host-specific and not readily transmissible to other species, a wide array of flu A viruses have been found in other animals which include sea mammals, domestic poultry, horses, dogs, pigs, and people [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, flu A viruses are responsible for the annual global influenza epidemics and occasional pandemics in human populations. In recent years, number of flu A viruses crossing the animal-human host species barrier have been increasing. This article provides a general overview of these zoonotic infections and the constant threat of a looming pandemic.
