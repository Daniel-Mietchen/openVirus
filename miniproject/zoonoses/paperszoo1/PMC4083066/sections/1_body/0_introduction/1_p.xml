<p>Influenza A (flu A) viruses belong to the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family of RNA viruses and are the causative agent of influenza, a contagious respiratory viral disease of birds and humans [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. They possess a negative-sense viral RNA genome packed into 8 individual gene segments which code for at least 11 functional proteins needed for infection, replication, and evasion of antiviral responses. However, recent studies suggest that there could be more viral protein products depending on the virus strain [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Flu A viruses can be further subdivided into distinct subtypes based on the genetic and antigenic properties of their hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), the envelope glycoproteins express on the surface of virus particles responsible for virus binding to relevant hosts and releasing of newly formed infectious virions, respectively [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Sixteen HA and 9 NA subtypes have been detected in wild aquatic birds and poultry throughout the world [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] while new strains (H17-18 and N10-11) have been additionally identified in bat species [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
