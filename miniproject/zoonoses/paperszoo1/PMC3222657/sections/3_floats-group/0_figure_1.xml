  <title>Changes in red knots' pre-inoculation body mass between February and August.</title>
  <p>Plain line: pre-inoculation body mass of knots inoculated in 2007; dashed line: pre-inoculation body mass of knots inoculated in 2009; grey shade: standard deviation. The number of knots inoculated in 2007 decreases with time as birds are used in experiments (N = 17 from 1 February to 16 March; N = 11 from 17 March to 30 May; N = 6 from 31 May to 22 August). The number of knots inoculated in 2009 includes 9 knots and 3 negative control knots from 7 April to 28 May.</p>
