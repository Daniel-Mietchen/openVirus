  <title>Clinical disease and viral shedding of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 from the pharynx of infected knots.</title>
  <p>Mean viral titers of productively infected knots (N = 17) are shown (A); days of onset of clinical disease are marked by arrows. Bars represent the upper standard deviation. Red knots presenting clinical disease (N = 4) shed higher titers of HPAIV H5N1 than productively infected knots that remained asymptomatic (B; N = 13; p = 0.005). Box lower and higher limits are first and third quartiles, middle line is the median, and lower and upper whiskers are minimum and maximum values. AUC: area under the curve.</p>
