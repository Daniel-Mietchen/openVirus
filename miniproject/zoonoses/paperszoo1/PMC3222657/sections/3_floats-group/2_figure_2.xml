  <title>Migratory state, constitutive immunity and viral shedding of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1.</title>
  <p>Knots were inoculated during the pre-migration period (I; N = 6), the fueling period (II; N = 5), the migration period (III; N≤12), and the post-migration period (IV; N = 6). Results are shown for pre-inoculation body mass (A), activity levels (B), pre-inoculation plasma concentration of corticosterone (C), viral shedding of HPAIV H5N1 from the pharynx (AUC: area under the curve; D), relative mass of the gizzard (E), liver (F), and intestinal tract (G), relative length of the intestinal tract (H), pre-inoculation white blood cell count (dark grey) and lymphocyte count (light grey; I), pre-inoculation proportion of lymphocytes (J), pre-inoculation 
   <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> killing (K) and pre-inoculation hemolysis (L). rel. = relative. Box lower and higher limits are first and third quartiles, middle line is the median, and lower and upper whiskers are minimum and maximum values. Negative control knots are included in the analyses of pre-inoculation measures of body mass, constitutive immunity and plasma concentration of corticosterone, and of the measures of activity levels (N = 12), and the necropsied negative control knot is included in the analyses of the length and mass of organs (N = 10). For viral shedding, non-productively infected knots are not included (I: N = 5; II: N = 4; III: N = 5; IV: N = 4). Significant differences and p values are given in
