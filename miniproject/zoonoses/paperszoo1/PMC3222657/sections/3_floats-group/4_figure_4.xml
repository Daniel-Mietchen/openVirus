  <title>Viral shedding of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 and plasma concentration of corticosterone.</title>
  <p>The level of viral shedding from the pharynx and plasma concentration of corticosterone in red knots are positively correlated only in knots inoculated during the migration period (black diamonds; rho = 0.80, p = 0.004). No correlation was detected in knots infected outside the migration period (grey diamonds), or overall for all birds taken together. AUC: area under the curve.</p>
