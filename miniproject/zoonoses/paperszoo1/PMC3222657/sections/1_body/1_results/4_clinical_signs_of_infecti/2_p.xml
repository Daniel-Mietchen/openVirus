<p>Body mass loss was observed in red knots inoculated with HPAIV H5N1 and negative control birds. Overall, there was no correlation between body mass loss and the level of viral shedding. Likewise, body mass loss did not differ between knots with clinical disease and sub-clinically infected knots; or between knots productively infected and knots that remained uninfected or negative control knots. Body mass loss was positively correlated with body mass at the time of inoculation or sham-inoculation (rho = 0.68, p&lt;0.0001), irrespective of the infection status of the birds.</p>
