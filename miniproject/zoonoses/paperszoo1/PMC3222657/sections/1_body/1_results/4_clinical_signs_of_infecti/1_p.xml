<p>Five knots developed clinical disease or died during the experiment. Two knots inoculated during the pre-migration period exhibited severe disease, including apathy and neurological signs, such as loss of balance and tremors, and were euthanized at 5 and 6 days post inoculation (dpi). One knot inoculated during the fueling period presented torticollis and was euthanized at 6 dpi. One knot inoculated during the migration period was found dead at 11 dpi without showing clinical signs beforehand. One knot inoculated during the post-migration period exhibited neurological signs and died at 2 dpi. It had a co-infection with HPAIV H5N1 and coccal bacteria and was further excluded from the analysis because the bacterial infection contributed to severe disease and rapid death of the bird. The appearance of clinical signs in these knots was sudden and the affected birds did not behave significantly differently on the preceding days than birds that remained sub-clinically infected.</p>
