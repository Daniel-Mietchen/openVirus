<p>In order to demonstrate any effect of corticosterone on infection with HPAIV H5N1 under the migratory state, several prerequisites must be met by the chosen model. First, the bird species must undergo physiological changes associated with migration in captivity, including an increase in plasma concentration of corticosterone. This prerequisite was met by the knot model and results are further detailed below. Second, the bird species must be susceptible to infection with HPAIV H5N1 under non-migratory state. However, it must demonstrate an intermediate susceptibility to the development of clinical disease upon infection, with some birds developing clinical disease and others remaining sub-clinically infected. Such outcome not only depends on the bird species, but also on the infection dose and route of inoculation. This prerequisite is important to maximize our ability to detect any effect of corticosterone on HPAIV H5N1 infection under the migratory state. If all birds develop clinical disease under non-migratory state, an increase in the probability of development of disease may be difficult to detect under the migratory state, since all birds will also likely develop clinical disease. On the other hand, if no bird develops clinical disease under non-migratory state, an increase in the probability of development of disease may not be detected under the migratory state. For example, the infection dose may not be sufficient to result in clinical disease under non-migratory or migratory state alike. This prerequisite was met by the knot model when inoculated intra-esophageally and intra-tracheally with 10
 <sup>6</sup> median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) of HPAIV H5N1. Six knots inoculated in this way during the pre-migration period demonstrated that the bird species, the infection dose and the route of inoculation were appropriate for the aim of the present study. All but one bird in this group became productively infected, and two birds developed clinical disease. Results are further detailed below.
