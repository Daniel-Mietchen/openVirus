<p>Overall, when all birds were considered together, the level of viral shedding from the pharynx did not correlate with pre-inoculation plasma concentration of corticosterone. However, at within-group level, the level of viral shedding from the pharynx was positively correlated with pre-inoculation plasma concentration of corticosterone in knots infected during the migration period (rho = 0.80, p = 0.004;
