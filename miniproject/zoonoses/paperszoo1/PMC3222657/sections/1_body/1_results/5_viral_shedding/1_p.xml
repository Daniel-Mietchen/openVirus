<p>Red knots infected with HPAIV H5N1 shed virus from the pharynx during 1 to 5 dpi, with peak viral titers of up to 10

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027814-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). HPAIV H5N1 RNA was detected in pharyngeal swabs up to 6 dpi as measured by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The virus was not isolated from any cloacal swabs, although HPAIV H5N1 RNA was occasionally detected in cloacal swabs up to 6 dpi. No virus was isolated from any swabs of the negative control knots. The level of viral shedding was determined for each bird by calculating the area under the viral shedding curve. There was no statistical difference in the level or duration of viral shedding between the four groups of knots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027814-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). The knots that presented severe neurological disease or sudden death following inoculation shed higher pharyngeal viral titers than the birds that remained sub-clinically infected (p = 0.005;
