<p>One knot inoculated during the pre-migration period, one knot inoculated during the fueling period, four knots inoculated during the migration period, and one knot inoculated during the post-migration period did not shed HPAIV H5N1. The proportion of non-productively infected knots did not differ between groups (Freeman-Halton extension of the Fisher's exact test, p = 0.8, 
 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Freeman1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>).During the migration period, the four knots that did not shed virus had lower plasma concentrations of corticosterone than the birds that did shed virus in this group (p = 0.05).
