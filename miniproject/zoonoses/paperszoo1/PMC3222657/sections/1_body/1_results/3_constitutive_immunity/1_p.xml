<p>Measures of constitutive immunity included pre-inoculation white blood cell counts, bacteria killing capacity of whole blood against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and hemolysis-hemagglutination properties of knot plasma. The pre-inoculation white blood cell counts, proportion and concentration of lymphocytes, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> killing, and hemolysis differed between the four groups of knots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027814-g002">Fig. 2I–L</xref>). The variations in pre-inoculation white blood cell counts reflected variations in the number of lymphocytes, as these made on average between 70% and 82% of the white blood cell counts. The pre-inoculation proportion and concentration of lymphocytes were lower in knots inoculated during the fueling period and during the migration period than in knots inoculated during the pre- and post-migration periods (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0027814-t001">Table 1</xref>). Pre-inoculation 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> killing was weakest in knots inoculated during the post-migration period, while pre-inoculation hemolysis mediated by the complement and other soluble proteins was strongest in these birds. Hemolysis positively correlated with the relative mass of the liver (rho = 0.41, p = 0.01). None of the constitutive immunity parameters correlated with pre-inoculation plasma concentration of corticosterone.
