<p>The lesions in the brain of the knots that presented clinical disease or died during the experiment were associated with the presence of influenza virus antigen in neurons, glial cells, ependymal cells, or a combination of these, as determined by red diffuse staining in the nucleus and to a lesser extent the cytoplasm of these cells by immunohistochemistry (

In one bird with clinical disease, influenza virus antigen was detected in the nuclei of a few pancreatic exocrine cells in the periphery of necrotic lesions in the pancreas. In another bird with clinical disease, influenza virus antigen was detected in mononuclear cells—identified as macrophages—in the liver and spleen. Influenza virus antigen was not detected in any organ of the knots that did not show clinical signs or die, or in any organ of the negative control knot.
