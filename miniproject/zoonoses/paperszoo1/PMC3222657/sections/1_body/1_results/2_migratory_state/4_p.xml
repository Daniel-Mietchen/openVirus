<p>Behaviour was recorded during the inoculation experiments every 3 min during 15 min every day, and categorized into active or inactive behaviors. Daily ratios of active behaviors were calculated and averaged for each knot over the duration of the experiments. There was no significant difference in the activity levels of the knots inoculated with HPAIV H5N1 during the migration period and those of the three negative control knots, thus the negative control knots were included in the migration period group. Red knots displayed active behaviors more often during the fueling period and during the migration period than during the pre- and post-migration periods (
