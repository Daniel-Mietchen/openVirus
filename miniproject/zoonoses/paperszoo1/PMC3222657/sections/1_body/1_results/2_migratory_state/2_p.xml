<p>Overall, the birds underwent the physiological changes associated with migration. They maintained their natural (pre-inoculation) body mass cycle between February and August (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027814-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). However, the peak in body mass associated with the migratory state occurred approximately one month later than expected in 2007. Therefore, the group of 5 knots inoculated in late May 2007 had not reached the peak in body mass, and was in the early stage of body mass gain associated with early migratory state (fueling period). At the time of infection, the pre-inoculation body mass of these knots was higher than that of the knots inoculated during the pre- and post-migration periods (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0027814-t001">Table 1</xref>). An extra group of 12 knots in migratory state was added in May 2009. The pre-inoculation body mass of these 12 knots inoculated or sham-inoculated at the time of migration was reaching a plateau in late May 2009, as expected (migration period;
