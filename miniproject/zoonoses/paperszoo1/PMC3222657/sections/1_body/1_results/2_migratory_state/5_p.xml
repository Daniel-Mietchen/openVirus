<p>Pre-inoculation plasma concentration of corticosterone did not differ between the three groups of knots inoculated in 2007, with an overall mean of 14.6 ng/ml (SD = 7.7). It was significantly higher in knots inoculated during the migration period in 2009, reaching a mean of 34.5 ng/ml (SD = 15, p = 0.001,

 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Meier1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. There was a positive correlation between pre-inoculation body mass and plasma concentration of corticosterone (rho = 0.28, p = 0.02), and a negative correlation between the relative mass of the knots' liver and pre-inoculation plasma concentration of corticosterone (rho = −0.41, p = 0.02).
