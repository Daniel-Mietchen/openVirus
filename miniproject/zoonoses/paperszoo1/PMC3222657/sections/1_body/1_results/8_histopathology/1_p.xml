<p>The four knots that presented clinical disease or died during the experiment had multiple foci of severe acute encephalitis, characterized by neuronal chromatolysis, perivascular cuffing, neuronophagia, neuropil vacuolisation and foci of gliosis in the brainstem, cerebellum and cerebrum (

Similar lesions of necrosis and inflammation were seen in the cervical spinal cord of the bird with torticollis. One bird with clinical signs had multiple foci of acute necrotizing pancreatitis, associated with heterophilic infiltrates (
