<p>The results of this study show that, at the between-group level, red knots inoculated during the pre-migration period, fueling period, migration period and post-migration period appeared equally susceptible to infection with HPAIV H5N1. The levels of viral shedding, the proportion of birds that acquired infection and the proportion that developed clinical disease were similar in each group. Taking all birds together, pre-inoculation plasma concentration of corticosterone did not correlate with probability of acquisition of infection, probability of development of clinical disease, level of viral shedding, or parameters of constitutive immunity. In particular, knots with high levels of corticosterone during the migration period did not shed higher viral titers than knots inoculated during pre-migration, fueling or post-migration periods. These results are similar to those reported by Kalthoff and colleagues where stonechats exhibiting different migratory behavior were shown equally susceptible to experimental infection with HPAIV H5N1 at the time of migration 
 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Kalthoff2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Therefore, the risk of HPAIV H5N1 infection in wild birds and of potential transmission between wild birds and poultry may be similar at different times of the year, irrespective of wild birds' migratory status.
