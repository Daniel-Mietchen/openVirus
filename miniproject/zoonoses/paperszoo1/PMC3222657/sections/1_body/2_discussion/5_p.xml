<p>A number of productively infected, non-productively infected, and negative control knots showed body mass loss during the experiment, while others, including productively infected knots that shed high viral titers, maintained or gained body mass. There was no association between body mass loss and infection in the present study. Thus, body mass loss was likely associated and triggered by the experimental procedures (e.g., transport and change in environment) and not by infection with HPAIV H5N1. However, body mass loss associated with HPAIV H5N1 infection may not have been detected due to the small sample size and individual variations in knots' response to infection.</p>
