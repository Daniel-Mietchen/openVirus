<p>In conclusion, the risk of HPAIV H5N1 infection in wild birds and of potential transmission between wild birds and poultry may be similar at different times of the year, irrespective of wild birds' migratory status. However, during the migration period, migratory birds may be more susceptible to acquisition of infection with HPAIV H5N1 and shed higher viral titers when ready to undertake migration (i.e., when displaying elevated plasma concentration of corticosterone), but not be more susceptible to the development of clinical disease, which starts at the end or after the period of viral shedding. Assuming that sub-clinical infection does not affect the likelihood of migratory take-off, this may favor the geographical spread of the virus by migratory birds during the migration period, and increase the chance of virus incursion into wild or domestic bird populations along migratory pathways, resulting in epidemics. This possibly occurred during the HPAIV H5N1 outbreaks in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in winter 2005–2006

The implications of these results are that prevention of contact between poultry and wild birds is essential all-year round to prevent cross-species transmission of HPAIV H5N1 between wild birds and poultry, and is especially important at the time of migration in order to reduce long-distance spread of the virus to novel geographic areas.
