<p>Elevated pre-inoculation plasma concentration of corticosterone did not result in an increase in the probability of development of clinical disease. One to two birds developed neurological disease and died of the infection in each group, including during the migration period. Based on the proportion of birds that presented clinical signs under non-migratory state, our experimental design would have allowed to detect a three- to four-fold increase in probability of development of clinical disease during the migration period, with a statistical power of 80% or more, using the statistical power test for 2 proportions. Therefore, birds in migratory state, with elevated plasma concentration of corticosterone, may not be more prone to develop clinical disease following HPAIV H5N1 infection than birds under non-migratory state.</p>
