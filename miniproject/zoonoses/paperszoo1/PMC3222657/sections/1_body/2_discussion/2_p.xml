<p>However, at the within-group level, there was a significant positive correlation between pre-inoculation plasma concentration of corticosterone and the level of viral shedding from the pharynx in knots inoculated during the migration period. Furthermore, the birds within this group that were productively infected (5 out of 9) had significantly higher pre-inoculation plasma concentration of corticosterone than those that were not productively infected. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an association between plasma concentration of corticosterone and severity of viral infection in birds. This finding indicates that high levels of corticosterone during the migration period may be associated with increased probability of acquisition of infection with HPAIV H5N1 and higher levels of viral shedding. Because birds with high levels of corticosterone during the migration period are physiologically ready for take-off and long-distance flight 
 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Piersma1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, increased probability of acquisition of infection and higher viral shedding in these birds may favor long-distance spread of the virus over large geographical areas.
