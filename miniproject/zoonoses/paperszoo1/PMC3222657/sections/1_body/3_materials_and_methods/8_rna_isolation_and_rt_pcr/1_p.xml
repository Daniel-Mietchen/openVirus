<p>RNA isolation and RT-PCR were performed on the swab suspensions stored in lysis buffer as described 
 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Munster1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Briefly, RNA was isolated by using a MagnaPure LC system with the MagnaPure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Almere, the Netherlands). Real-time RT-PCR assays were performed on an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) by using the TaqMan EZ RT-PCR Core Reagents Kit (Applied Biosystems, Nieuwerkerk a/d IJssel, the Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The test used a hybridization probe (
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′-6-FAM-TTT-GTG-TTC-ACG-CTC-ACC-GTG-CC-TAMRA-3′</named-content>) and specific primers (forward: 
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′-AAG-ACC-AAT-CCT-GTC-ACC-TCT-GA-3′</named-content> and reverse: 
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′-CAA-AGC-GTC-TAC-GCT-GCA-GTC-C-3′</named-content>) to detect the matrix gene of HPAIV H5N1. For each run, the samples were prepared and processed in parallel with two negative and positive control samples. A Ct value of 40 or more was considered negative.
