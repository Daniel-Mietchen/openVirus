<p>White blood cell counts were performed on the knots' blood smears examined by light microscope at 1000Ã— magnification with oil immersion.

In addition, the number of thrombocytes seen during the white blood cell counts was recorded as an estimate of the relative number of thrombocytes per white blood cell. In combination with the blood smears, white blood cell concentrations were obtained using the indirect eosinophil Unopette method
