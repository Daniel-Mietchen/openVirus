<p>Constitutive immunity was measured as described by Buehler and colleagues 
 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Buehler2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Briefly, the bacteria killing capacity of whole blood against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was assessed by incubating diluted blood samples with 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> suspension for 10 min, or with 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> suspension for 120 min at 41°C, and inoculating the mixtures onto agar plates in duplicate. Control plates were inoculated with 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> or 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> suspension. The plates were incubated at 36°C overnight and the colonies were counted the next day. The proportion of killed microorganisms was calculated as the number of colonies on the test plates relative to the number of colonies on the control plates.
