<p>The hemolysis-hemagglutination assay was performed as described by Matson and colleagues 
 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Matson1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Briefly, the hemolytic and hemagglutinating abilities of the knots' plasma were assessed by incubating serial dilutions of the plasma samples with 1% suspension of rabbit red blood cells in 96-well plates, at 41Â°C for 90 min. The plates were scanned for hemagglutination (mediated by pre-existing antibodies) after 20 min, and for hemolysis (mediated by the complement and other lytic plasma proteins) after 90 min.
