<p>Total plasma concentration of corticosterone was determined using an enzyme-immunoassay 
 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Munro1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Munro2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> following Müller and colleagues 
 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Mller1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Corticosterone in 10 µl plasma and 190 µl water was extracted with 4 ml dichlormethane, re-dissolved in PBS and given in triplicates in the enzyme-immunoassay. The dilution of the corticosterone antibody (Chemicon; cross-reactivity: 11-dehydrocorticosterone 0.35%, progesterone 0.004%, 18-OH-DOC 0.01%, cortisol 0.12%, 18-OH-B 0.02% and aldosterone 0.06%) was 1∶8000. We used horseradish peroxidase (1∶400000) linked to the corticosterone antibody as enzyme label and 2,2′-Azino-
 <italic>bis</italic>(3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonicacid)diammonium salt as substrate. The analyses were done in one assay on three plates. The concentration of corticosterone in plasma samples was calculated by using the standard curve run in duplicate on each plate. Plasma from chickens with two different corticosterone concentrations was included as internal control on each plate in duplicate. The coefficient of variation was 13.4% for the lower control, and 5.0% for the upper control.
