<p>One day before infection, the knots were shipped to the Erasmus Medical Centre. There, serum samples were collected and analyzed by using a competitive enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA) to determine whether the birds had been previously infected with influenza A virus. Serum was analyzed by use of a commercially available influenza A antibody ELISA kit for the detection of antibodies against the nucleoprotein of influenza A virus (European Veterinary Laboratory, Woerden, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sensitivity and specificity of this test are unknown for red knots. One red knot inoculated during the pre-migration period and two knots inoculated during the migration period had prior antibodies against influenza A virus. The knot inoculated during the pre-migration period that had prior antibodies against influenza virus did not become productively infected. In contrast, the two knots inoculated during the migration period that had prior antibodies against influenza virus became productively infected and shed virus titers similar to those of the birds of that group without prior antibodies (p = 0.7). Because the presence of prior antibodies against influenza virus was not associated with detectable protection against HPAIV H5N1 infection and did not impact on the levels of viral shedding, we included these birds in the study.</p>
