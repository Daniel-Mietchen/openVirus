<p>Between 3 and 5 days before infection, the knots were bled from the brachial vein into heparinized capillary tubes, to collect 200 to 300 µl of blood. Blood was sampled and centrifuged, and plasma was stored at −80°C until the samples were further processed for the measurement of plasma concentration of corticosterone (see below). Plasma concentration of corticosterone rises in samples collected 3 min or more after entry of people into the aviary, due to capture and handling stress, thus only samples taken within 3 min of entry into the aviary were used to obtain baseline values of plasma concentration of corticosterone
