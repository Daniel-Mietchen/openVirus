<p>Experimental infections of red knots with HPAIV H5N1 were performed during i) the pre-migration period, in March 2007 (N = 6), ii) the fueling period, in late May 2007 (N = 5), iii) the migration period in late May 2009 (N = 9), and iv) the post-migration period, in August 2007, at the time of body and wing molt (N = 6). An additional group of 3 knots were used as negative controls and sham-inoculated during the migration period in 2009. The group inoculated in late May 2007 was retrospectively shown to have not reached the peak in pre-inoculation body mass and plasma concentration of corticosterone (hence qualified as fueling period); the group inoculated in late May 2009 did reach the plateau in pre-inoculation body mass and plasma concentration of corticosterone (hence qualified as migration period; see
