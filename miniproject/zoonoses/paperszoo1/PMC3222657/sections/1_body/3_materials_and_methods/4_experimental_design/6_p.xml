<p>On day 0, the knots were inoculated intra-esophageally and intra-tracheally by use of a catheter with 10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of HPAIV H5N1 in a volume of 0.3 ml via each route. The 3 negative control birds were sham-inoculated in the same manner with PBS, and housed in a separate isolator. All birds were observed daily for clinical signs, such as apathy, respiratory, intestinal and neurological signs. In addition, the behavior of each knot was recorded every 3 min during 15 min every day, when the birds were undisturbed and unaware of the presence of the investigator. The body mass was measured and pharyngeal and cloacal swabs were collected daily from day 0 to day 8 and every 2 days thereafter. Pharyngeal and cloacal swabs were placed in 3 ml of virus transport medium (Hank's balanced salt solution containing 10% glycerol, 200 U/ml penicillin, 200 µg/ml streptomycin, 100 U/ml polymyxin B sulphate, 250 µg/ml gentamycin), and kept on ice. After vigorously shaking the tubes containing the swabs with a test tube shaker, 200 µl of the suspension were sampled and added to 300 µl of lysis buffer for RNA isolation and RT-PCR. The remainder was frozen at −80°C until viral titration. Knots inoculated with HPAIV H5N1 were euthanized by exsanguination under anesthesia with isoflurane, when pharyngeal and cloacal swabs were determined negative by RT-PCR on two consecutive sampling days, or when severe clinical signs were observed. One of the three negative control birds was euthanized by exsanguination under anesthesia with isoflurane on the same day as the birds inoculated during the migration period, while the remaining two were shipped back to NIOZ at the end of the experiment.
