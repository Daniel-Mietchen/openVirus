<p>The present sample design would allow to detect a three- to four-fold increase in probability of acquisition of infection or of development of clinical disease during the migration period compared to birds under non-migratory state, with a statistical power of 80% or more, using the statistical power test for 2 proportions. It is possible that subtler differences were not detected due to small group sizes.</p>
