<p>Statistical differences in the sizes of internal organs, viral shedding titers, constitutive immunity data or plasma concentration of corticosterone between the four groups of inoculated knots were assessed with the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. In case of significant differences as detected by the Kruskal-Wallis test, statistical differences between two groups were assessed with the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. Correlations between the sizes of internal organs, viral shedding titers, constitutive immune data and plasma concentration of corticosterone were assessed with the non-parametric Spearman rank correlation test. Bonferonni correction was used when multiple statistical comparisons were done on one set of data. Differences were considered significant when pâ‰¤0.05 before Bonferonni correction.</p>
