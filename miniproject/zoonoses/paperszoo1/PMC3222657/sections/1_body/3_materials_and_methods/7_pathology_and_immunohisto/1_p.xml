<p>Necropsies and tissue sampling were performed on all inoculated knots, one negative control knot, and three inoculated chickens according to a standard protocol. Internal organs were examined for lesions and sampled. The mass and length of the knots' emptied intestinal tract (from duodenum to cloaca), and the mass of the knots' pectoral muscle, emptied gizzard, liver, heart, and brain were measured. The mass of the organs was corrected for body mass by dividing the mass values of each organ by the bird body mass. After fixation in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and embedding in paraffin, tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological evaluation or with an immunohistological method using a monoclonal antibody against the nucleoprotein of influenza A virus as a primary antibody for detection of influenza viral antigen

Lung tissue of a chicken experimentally infected with influenza virus A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 (H5N1) was included as a positive control. Isotype-matched and omission controls were included as negative controls. The following tissues were examined by these two methods: trachea (3 sections), lungs (3 sections), air sac, duodenum and pancreas (3 sections), jejunum (3 sections), ileum and cecum (3 sections), colon (3 sections), spleen, heart, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, and brain (2 sections).
