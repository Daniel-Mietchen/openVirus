<p>The life cycle and associated physiological changes of the red knot (
 <italic>Calidris canutus islandica</italic>, a migratory shorebird), including variations in plasma concentration of corticosterone, have been extensively studied both in the wild and in captivity 
 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Piersma3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Buehler1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Vezina1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Knots kept in captivity maintain natural body mass cycles

 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Reneerkens2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, even if they are unable to fly beyond the boundaries of the aviary, and show elevated plasma concentration of corticosterone at the time of peak body mass during the spring migration period 
 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Piersma1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Their plasma concentration of corticosterone reaches as high as three times the concentration at the beginning of the body mass increase. They also display migratory restlessness, exhibiting the urge to migrate. These changes reverse at the onset of voluntary fasting, resulting in body mass loss and preceding body and wing molts 
 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Weber2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Red knots infected with HPAIV H5N1 have not been reported in the wild 
 <xref rid="pone.0027814-USGS1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, and these shorebirds are unlikely to be actual spreaders of HPAIV H5N1. However, because of the predictability of the physiological changes associated with the migratory state in captivity in these shorebirds, we used the red knot as a model to assess the effect of elevated plasma concentration of corticosterone associated with the migratory state on infection with HPAIV H5N1.
