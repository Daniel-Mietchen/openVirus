 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Jenni1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Prior to departure, some migratory bird species increase their body mass by up to 50% of their lean mass 
 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Piersma2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. They put on fat stores that will serve as fuel during migratory flights 
 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Jenni1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The relative size of internal organs shift from those accommodating high food consumption rates prior to take–off to those accommodating the actual energy-demanding endurance flights

 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Piersma4" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Behavioral changes are often observed, including migratory restlessness, during which migratory birds display high activity levels

 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Schwabl1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The glucocorticoid stress hormone corticosterone stimulates appetite and locomotion and contributes to regulating these physiological changes in migratory birds

 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Meier1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Elevated plasma concentration of corticosterone has been reported in wild songbirds and shorebirds caught just prior to or during migration
