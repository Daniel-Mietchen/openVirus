 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Garvin1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Similarly, latent infection with the spirochete 
 <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>, causative agent of Lyme disease, was reactivated upon experimental inducement of the migratory state in redwing thrushes (

 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Gylfe1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. A higher risk of acquisition or reactivation of infection may have important consequences for the spread of infectious pathogens over long distances. On the one hand, increased probability of acquisition or reactivation of infection may favor the spread of pathogens by migratory birds. On the other hand, increased probability of development of clinical disease may hamper such spread, as infected birds may become unable to undertake migration, or fly long distances 
 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Altizer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Although stonechats (
 <italic>Saxicola torquata</italic>) exhibiting variable migratory behavior (from highly migratory to resident) were found equally susceptible to experimental HPAIV H5N1 infection at the time of migration 
 <xref rid="pone.0027814-Kalthoff2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, little is known on the impact of corticosterone on influenza virus infection in wild birds.
