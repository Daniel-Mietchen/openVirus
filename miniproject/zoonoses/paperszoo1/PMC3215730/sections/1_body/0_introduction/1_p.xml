<p>Avian influenza (AI) viruses pose significant threats to both animal and human health. Approximately 200 million birds have died or have been culled worldwide as a result of AI. In addition, since 1997, AI viruses of the H5 or H7 subtype have crossed the species barrier and caused fatal disease in humans

Thus, understanding the pathogenic determinants of AI viruses and their modifications in the course of natural epidemics is important for the identification of natural reservoirs of potential pandemic viruses. The NS1 protein of AI viruses is an important pathogenicity determinant

 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Soubies1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. One of the most severe AI outbreaks in European poultry was caused by an H7N1 subtype virus between 1999 and 2001. Longitudinal analysis of low pathogenic (LP) and high pathogenic (HP) AI H7N1 isolates circulating during the outbreak 
 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Dundon1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, revealed that the H7N1 LP viruses at the beginning of the epidemic had a full length NS1 protein (F3 protein, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g001">Fig. 
  <bold>1 a</bold>
 </xref>), while the HP isolates circulating during the peak weeks showed a truncation of the last C-ter six amino acids (aa) of NS1 (F4
 <sub>Δ225–230</sub> protein, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g001">Fig. 
  <bold>1 a</bold>
 </xref>). At the end of the epidemic, the majority of circulating AI viruses were LP isolates, with a C-ter deletion of 10- aa in the NS1 protein (F6
 <sub>Δ221–230</sub> protein, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g001">Fig. 
  <bold>1 a</bold>
 </xref>). H5 and H7 AI viruses are the only subtypes causing high pathogenic infections in poultry and to possess the potential to be transmitted to humans. Thus, changes in the pathogenic potential of these AI viruses during extensive epidemics might represent a potential threat to human health. Since the observed truncations in H7N1 NS1 protein spanned the PDZ-ligand (PL) domain, which has been documented to influence pathogenicity through the interaction with host cell proteins, we investigated whether these truncations might alter the ability of the AI NS1 protein to interact with human host factors.
