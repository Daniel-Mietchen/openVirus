<p>A therapeutic strategy that can reduce the emergence of viral resistance towards antiviral drugs is the selective targeting of host factors required for viral replication. We have recently provided a successful example of such an approach towards HIV-1 infection 
 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Maga1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In this study, by analyzing the occurrence of AI-like PL domains in human PDZ-binding proteins, a restricted number of proteins potentially mediating host-pathogen relationships in AI virus replication have been identified. These findings might be further expanded to identify novel anti-influenza targets and drugs.
