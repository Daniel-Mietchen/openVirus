<p>Interaction of AI NS1 with the PDZ domains of cellular proteins has been shown to influence viral pathogenicity. H5N1 NS1 interacts with the cellular PDZ proteins Scribble and Dlg, altering the JAK/STAT signalling pathway and protecting infected cells from apoptosis

 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Golebiewski1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, the avian PL sequence (-ESEV-) seems to affect viral pathogenesis in a strain- and host-dependent manner

 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Soubies1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. For example, while reintroduction of the fully functional 1918 H1N1 PL domain in the NS1 protein of the human H3N2 A/WSN/33 virus, caused enhanced pathogenicity in mice 
 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, the same modification of the 2009 H1N1v pandemic virus did not result in enhanced replication or transmissibility, suggesting that other factors also contribute to viral pathogenicity 
 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Hale2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Comparison of the NS1 sequences of human circulating H1N1 and H3N2 with the new H1N1v pandemic strain, showed that the last 50–60 aa at the C-ter of NS1 were the less conserved, with aa identity ranging from 41.7 to 67.2%, with respect to the 78–84% aa identity showed at the level of the entire protein 
 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Campanini1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. This suggests that the extreme C-ter domain (including the PL domain), is subjected to selective pressure during circulation in novel hosts. Significant host-specific evolution of the PL domain of swine influenza viruses have also been suggested by detailed sequence comparison among strains circulating in different geographical areas in the last &gt;30 years, indicating host-specific positive selection at the level of the PL domain, as a result of cross-species transmission 
 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Vijaykrishna1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Indeed, human, equine and swine influenza strains, including the 2009 H1N1v pandemic virus, do not harbour a PL domain, suggesting that loss of PDZ-binding capability may be one of the steps involved in adaptation of avian viruses to new hosts
