<p>Our phylogenetic analysis of the Italian H7N1 isolates (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0027789.s004">Fig. 
  <bold>S4</bold>
 </xref>), further corroborates this view. We showed that HPAI viruses circulating in the mid-phase of the epidemic with the F4
 <sub>Δ225–230</sub> protein, possessing a PL domain II only, arose from LPAI viruses with full length NS1 F3, harbouring an intact TPL domain. On the contrary, the LPAI viruses circulating at the end of the epidemics with the NS1 mutant F6
 <sub>Δ221–230</sub>, bearing a complete loss of PL domains, originated from a separate viral pool, suggesting that the 10-aa deletion of F6
 <sub>Δ221–230</sub> NS1, conferred a selective advantage over the circulating viruses with the 6-aa deleted F4
 <sub>Δ225–230</sub> NS1.
