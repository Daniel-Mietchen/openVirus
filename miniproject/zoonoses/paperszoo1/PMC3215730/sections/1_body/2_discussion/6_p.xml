<p>If loss or inactivation by mutation of the PL domain is a step involved in adaptation of AI viruses to new hosts, those strains bearing two PL domains in tandem (TPL), as those reported here, would present an higher genetic barrier to adaptation. The comparison of the PDZ-binding specificity of the F3 and F4 H7N1 NS1 proteins, indicated that the set of PDZ domains bound by the NS1 protein bearing both TPL I and II (F3), was significantly different from the one recognized by the NS1 protein bearing TPL II only (F4). This suggests that these two domains are not identical and that deletion of the TPL I can alter the network of interactions between AI NS1 and cellular PDZ proteins, possibly affecting pathogenesis. Thus, AI viruses bearing a TPL may represent a potential threat in case of cross-species infections

Interestingly, by sequence alignment, we have found the novel TPL domain arrangement also in a group of H5N1 isolates circulating in China (A/Env/HK/437/99, acc. no. Q9EA66, Q9EA72, Q77NF2, Q9DGY0), antigenically and genetically related to the H5N1 virus responsible for the human AI outbreak of 1997
