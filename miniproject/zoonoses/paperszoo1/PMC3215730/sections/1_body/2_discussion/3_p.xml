<p>Due to its potential binding to multiple partners, NS1 can interfere with different cellular pathways on a competition basis, with some interactions being more stable or more probable than others. In particular, the AI virus NS1 protein activates the cellular PI3K kinase by disrupting the interaction between the catalytic p110 subunit and its negative regulatory subunit p85, through physical binding to the p110 kinase domain
