<p>Here, we showed that AI virus NS1 can interfere with the Src-RIL regulatory axis in a manner which is influenced by the PL arrangement. RIL was shown to bind to the phosphatase PTPL1, allowing its association with the active form of Src 
 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. PTPL1 then catalyzes the dephosphorylation of the regulatory residue Y418 of Src, resulting in kinase inactivation. Our array analysis showed that full length H7N1 and H5N1 NS1 proteins can interact through their PL domains with both RIL and PTPL1, potentially being able to disrupt their interaction. The H7N1 NS1 proteins were also found in this study to bind and stimulate human Src kinase through their SHB domain 2, while the H5N1 NS1 protein was not. We showed that loss of PL domain I (as in the F4
 <sub>Δ225–230</sub> protein) abolishes interaction with PTPL1 but not with RIL and Src. Deletion of the entire TPL (as in the F6
 <sub>Δ221–230</sub> mutant) from the H7N1 NS1, abolishes the interaction with RIL, but still allows interaction of the viral protein with Src. Thus, the H7N1 NS1 protein seems to carry the potential for a wider range of interactions than its H5N1 counterpart, thanks to its TPL and SHB domain 2.
