<p>PDZ domain arrays representative of 58 human PDZ domains (Array I and III, Panomics) were used. Each membrane was incubated with the manufacturer's Wash Buffer for 30 min and then blocked with the manufacturer's Blocking Buffer 1×, and shaken at room temperature for 2 h. After two washes with Wash Buffer 1×, the membranes were placed on a shaker and incubated with 15 µg/ml of each NS1 proteins, diluted in Blocking Buffer 1×, for 2 h at room temperature. After incubation, the membranes were washed three times with Wash Buffer 1×, and incubated with Anti-Histidine-HRP-conjugated for 2 h at room temperature. For identification of the spots detection solution was prepared according to the manufacturer's specifications.</p>
