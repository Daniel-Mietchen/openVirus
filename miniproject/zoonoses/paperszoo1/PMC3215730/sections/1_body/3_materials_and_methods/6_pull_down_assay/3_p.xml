<p>Alternatively, recombinant His-tagged F3 (20 µg) coupled to NiNTA-agarose beads in PBS 1× were mixed with HeLa cell lysate for 1 h at 4°C. Pulled down proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE 10% gels. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting using either primary rabbit anti-Src [pY
 <sup>418</sup>] (to detect the active form of Src kinase) or anti-Src [pY
 <sup>529</sup>] (to detect the inactive form of Src kinase) antibodies (Biosource). For detailed protocol see Supplementary Information.
