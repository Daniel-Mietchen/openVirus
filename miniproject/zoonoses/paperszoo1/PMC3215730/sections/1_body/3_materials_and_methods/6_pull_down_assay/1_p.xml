<p>Recombinant GST-tagged RIL (10 µg) was bound to GSH-sepharose beads. His-tagged recombinant F3 or F4 proteins (10 µg) were added in PBS1× and incubated at 4°C O/N. Bound proteins were recovered by centrifugation, eluted with 10 mM glutathione and resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with anti-His
 <sub>6</sub> and anti-GST IgG antibodies.
