<p>Recombinant His-tagged F3 (20 µg) coupled to NiNTA-agarose beads in PBS 1× were mixed with 10 µg of recombinant GST-tagged human Src kinase and incubated at 4°C O/N. Bound proteins were recovered by centrifugation and resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with anti-His
 <sub>6</sub> and anti-Src rabbit IgG antibody (for detailed protocol see Supplementary Information).
