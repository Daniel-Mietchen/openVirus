<p>The expression of His
 <sub>6</sub>-NS1 proteins was induced in BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with the expression vector pQE30-NS1 as described in Supplementary Information. Soluble His
 <sub>6</sub>-tagged NS1 proteins were purified by chromatography through an FPLC-Ni-NTA column as described (see Supplementary Information). Recombinant GST-RIL was purified from the pGEX-5x-1-RIL expressing vector (15) by gluthathione-conjugated GSH-sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) as described in Supplementary Information.
