<p>A549 cells were harvested following infection and incubated on ice for 30 min in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 0.35 M NaCl, 0.25% Triton in the presence of protease inhibitor cocktail. Cells were then centrifuged 10 min at 4°C (20000×g). The supernatant was kept as the soluble fraction. The pellet was extracted by sonication (3×5 s) in 0.5 M NaCl, supplemented with 1×Laemli Buffer, heated 5 min at 100°C, centrifuged (30 min 20000×g) and the supernatant kept as the insoluble fraction.</p>
