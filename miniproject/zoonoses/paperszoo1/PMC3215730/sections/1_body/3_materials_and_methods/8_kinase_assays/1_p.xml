<p>Src activity was measured in a filter-binding assay using a commercial kit (Src Assay Kit, Upstate), according to the manufacturer's protocol, using the specific Src peptide substrate [
 <named-content content-type="gene">KVEKIGEGTYGVVYK</named-content>] and in the presence of 0.012 µM of Src and 0.160 pmol of [γ-
 <sup>32</sup>P]ATP. Unlabelled ATP was added to reach the final concentrations as indicated in the figure legends. Abl activity was measured in a filter-binding assay using an Abl specific peptide substrate (Abtide, Upstate), 0.012 µM [γ-
 <sup>32</sup>P]ATP, 0.022 µM c-Abl. Reaction conditions were (in a final volume of 10 µl): 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT. Unlabelled ATP/Mg
 <sup>++</sup> (1∶1 M/M) mix was added to reach the final ATP concentration of 100 µM. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 30°C. Samples (9 µl) were spotted on paper cellulose filters which were washed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Filter-bound radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation with a Microbeta-Trilux apparatus (Perkin-Elmer).
