<p>The genes of NS1 proteins used in this study were: NS1 wild type (225 aa) from avian influenza virus A/HK/213/03 H5N1, NS1 wild type (230 aa) from A/Turkey/Italy/977/99 H7N1 (F3), NS1 containing the deletion of 225–230 aa from A/Turkey/Italy/4580/99 H7N1 (F4
 <sub>Δ225–230</sub>), NS1 containing the deletion of 220–230 aa from A/Turkey/Italy/4426/00 H7N1 (F6
 <sub>Δ221–230</sub>). The 
 <italic>ns1</italic> genes were amplified using a standard RT-PCR protocol and cloned into the pQE30 expression vector. For detailed cloning procedures see the Supplementary Information.
