<p>RIL has been shown to interact with the active form of the tyrosine kinase Src, playing a major role in its downregulation 
 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Its interaction with NS1 might suggest an involvement of the viral protein in the RIL-Src axis. Notably, avian NS1 proteins possess two Src-homology type 3 binding (SHB) domains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g001">Fig. 
  <bold>1 a</bold>
 </xref>): SHB domain 1 which mediates the interaction of AI NS1 with the p85 beta subunit of the PI3K kinase 
 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Ehrhardt1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, and SHB domain 2 which mediates the interaction with the proteins Crk/CrkL 
 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Heikkinen1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Interestingly, the SHB domain 2 (-PPLPPK-) of H7N1 NS1 is immediately upstream to the TPL (

  <bold>1 a</bold>
 </xref>). Thus, the ability of AI NS1 to bind Src was tested in pull down assays with recombinant human Src kinase. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g003">Fig. 
  <bold>3 e</bold>
 </xref>, Src was retained on the Ni-NTA beads only in the presence of his-tagged F3 NS1 (compare lane 3 with lane 5). A molar excess of RIL did not disrupt the complex between NS1 and Src, so that a ternary complex was isolated in the absence of the peptide substrate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g003">Fig. 
  <bold>3 f</bold>
 </xref>, lane 3). Finally, his-tagged F3 NS1 protein was able to pull down endogenous Src from HeLa cells extracts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g003">Fig. 
  <bold>3 g</bold>
 </xref>, compare lane 3 with lane 6). Probing the pulled down Src (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g003">Fig. 
  <bold>3 g</bold>
 </xref>, lane 3) and the input protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g003">Fig. 
  <bold>3 g</bold>
 </xref>, lane 1), with antibodies specific for the active (pY418) or inactive (pY529) forms of Src, suggested that F3 preferentially associated with the active form of Src.
