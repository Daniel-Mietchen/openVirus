<p>The previously unrecognized interaction between NS1 and Src, prompted us to investigate its functional significance. H7N1 NS1 proteins were not efficient substrates for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> Src kinase reactions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g004">Fig. 
  <bold>4 a</bold>
 </xref>), but were able to increase the peptide substrate utilization efficiency (V
 <sub>max</sub>/K
 <sub>m</sub>
 <sup>pep</sup> ratios) of Src (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0027789-t001">Table 1</xref>). The F4
 <sub>Δ225–230</sub> and ΔCF3
 <sub>Δ225–230</sub> proteins, bearing PL domain II only, or the F6
 <sub>Δ221–230</sub>, bearing no PL domains, were more efficient in stimulating Src (5.5-, 3.1- and 4.8- fold increase of V
 <sub>max</sub>/K
 <sub>m</sub>
 <sup>pep</sup>, respectively, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0027789-t001">Table 1</xref>) than the full length F3 protein with the intact TPL (2- fold increase, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0027789-t001">Table 1</xref>). Accordingly, the apparent affinities of the viral NS1 proteins for Src were higher (lower absolute K
 <sub>d</sub>
 <sup>NS1</sup> values) for the F4
 <sub>Δ225–230</sub>, the ΔCF3
 <sub>Δ225–230</sub> and the F6
 <sub>Δ221–230</sub> proteins (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0027789-t001">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g004">Fig. 
  <bold>4 b</bold>
 </xref>). Collectively, these data show, for the first time, that NS1 can stimulate human Src and that this ability can be influenced by the PL domain arrangement.
