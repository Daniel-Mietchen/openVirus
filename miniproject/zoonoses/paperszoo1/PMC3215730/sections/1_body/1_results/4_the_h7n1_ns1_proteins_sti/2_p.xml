<p>RIL alone was not a substrate for Src (

 </xref>) nor did it significantly stimulate Src activity (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0027789-t001">Table 1</xref>). When increasing amounts of RIL were titrated in the kinase reaction, in the absence or presence of increasing fixed doses of either F4
 <sub>Δ225–230</sub>, or F6
 <sub>Δ221–230</sub> proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g004">Fig. 
  <bold>4 c</bold>
 </xref>), the apparent affinity of Src for RIL was decreased (increase in the absolute K
 <sub>d</sub>
 <sup>RIL</sup> values, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0027789-t001">Table 1</xref>) by the presence of the NS1 proteins, suggesting that, in the presence of the peptide and ATP substrates, the binding of NS1 and RIL to Src was mutually competitive.
