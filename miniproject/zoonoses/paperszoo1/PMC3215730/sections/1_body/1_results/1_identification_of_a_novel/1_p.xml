<p>PL domains are specific sequences, usually located in the last 5 to 6- C-ter aa of cellular proteins, that recognize the structural protein-protein interaction module PDZ

 <xref rid="pone.0027789-teVelthuis1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. A map of the amino acid specificity for PL domains has been derived starting from the physico-chemical characteristics of the aa present with higher frequency in the PL sequences recognized by different PDZ domains 
 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Tonikian1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Based on this specificity map, we identified in the last 12- aa of the H7N1 NS1 proteins two partially overlapping PL motifs (indicated as PL domain I and II, respectively, in

 </xref>, only five versions of this domain, each differing from the others by single aminoacidic substitutions, appear to be present in this restricted subset of globally circulating AI viruses belonging to different H and N subtypes. The KRYMARRVESEV domain has been found in isolates throughout the world, while the KRYMERRVESEI is reported so far only for a cluster of closely related H7N2 viruses isolated in North America. The KRYMARRIESEV domain has been found in isolates from three geographical locations corresponding to three separate genetic clusters: Canada, comprising different H and N combinations; Chile, all belonging to the H7N3 genotype and Germany, with three isolates of the H10N7 genotype. These German isolates are also the oldest, dating back to 1949. The Chile isolates cluster genetically close to the H7N1 viruses of the italian epidemics analysed in this study, bearing the KRYMARRIESEV domain. The KRYMARRVESEI domain is present in 8 isolates falling in three separate genetic clusters. Five from China, of the H6N2, H1N1 and H9N2 genotypes, one from Canada, of the H3N8 genotype and two from US, of the H6N1 genotype. Interestingly, the five Chinese isolates appear to be genetically close to the oldest H10N7 German isolates with the KRYMARRIESEV domain. Finally, the KRFMARRVESEV domain is found only in two isolates from Japan. Overall, these data indicate that AI viruses carrying different versions of the TPL domain are circulating worldwide both in wild birds and domestic poultry.
