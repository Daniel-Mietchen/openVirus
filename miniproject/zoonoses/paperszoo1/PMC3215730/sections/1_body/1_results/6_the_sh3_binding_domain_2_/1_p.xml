<p>Since the SHB domain is a general protein module for interaction with SH3-containing tyrosine kinases, we tested whether AI NS1 could also bind other Src-unrelated tyrosine kinases, as an indication of SHB domain functionality. Indeed, H7N1 NS1 was able to stimulate the

 </xref>). When similar experiments were carried out with the full length H5N1 NS, or the two H3N2 human influenza NS1 proteins, no stimulation of the activity of Abl (

 </xref>), was observed, further confirming the importance of an intact -PPØPxK/R- consensus SHB domain 2 for this interaction. The SHB domain 2 sequence -PPLPPK- was present in 326/427 (76.3%) of the AI viral isolates identified in this study bearing the TPL domain. Alignment of the different SHB domain 2 sequences found in all the 427 AI isolates, to the consensus -PPØPxK- sequence (

  <bold>S1</bold>
 </xref>), indicated a degree of conservation between 93% and 100% for all the essential positions, with the exception of the Pro in fourth position, which showed a non-conservative substitutions with a Ser in 16% of the isolates (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0027789.s005">Table 
  <bold>S1</bold>
 </xref>). This residue has been previously recognized as a host marker in pandemic viruses 
 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Finkelstein1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. It is possible that the different degree of conservation in the SHB domain 2 among mammalian and AI viruses, reflects different selective pressures.
