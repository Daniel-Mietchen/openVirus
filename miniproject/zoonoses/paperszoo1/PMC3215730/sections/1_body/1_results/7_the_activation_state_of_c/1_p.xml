<p>Endogenous Src is present as an active or inactive protein in the cell, depending on its phosphorylation status 
 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Engen1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. A precise balance of the different phosphorylated forms is essential for cellular homeostasis. The cellular protein RIL has been shown to be important for the maintenance of the active vs. inactive Src equilbrium 
 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The physical and functional interaction of the H7N1 NS1 proteins with both RIL and Src, may suggest that the activation state of Src within the cell during the infection might be influenced by the ability of H7N1 NS1 proteins to interact with RIL. To start addressing this question, the phosphorylation status of endogenous Src was then assessed, through western blotting analysis with antibodies specific for the active (pY418) or inactive (pY529) forms of Src, in A549 (human alveolar basal epithelial cancer) cells infected with the r977 or the r4426 recombinant viral strains (

  <bold>a</bold>, 
  <bold>b</bold>
 </xref>). These viruses contain the full length F3 (r977) and the truncated F6
 <sub>Δ221–230</sub> (r4226) proteins, respectively, with an A/turkey/Italy/977/99 H7N1 backbone (see also 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g001">Fig. 
  <bold>1 a</bold>
 </xref>). Intensities of each band were normalized to the intensity of actin revealed on the same membrane. The resulting relative intensity units (RIU) were used to calculate the Src active/Src inactive ratios, which are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g005">Fig. 
  <bold>5 c</bold>
 </xref>). The virus expressing full length F3 NS1 protein, caused a statistically significant increase (p&lt;0.05) of the active form of Src in the soluble fraction, while the virus expressing the truncated F6
 <sub>Δ221–230</sub> protein did not significantly change the balance between active and inactive Src. In addition, while the full length F3 NS1 was detected in both the soluble and insoluble fractions, the F6
 <sub>Δ221–230</sub> protein was selectively retained in the insoluble fraction only (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g005">Fig. 
  <bold>5 d</bold>
 </xref>), suggesting that the 10- aa deletion of F6
 <sub>Δ221–230</sub> NS1 changed the intracellular distribution of the protein in the infected cells. This is consistent with the observation that C-ter truncations in H7N1 NS1 protein cause its recruitment to the nucleolar compartment 
 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Keiner1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. No changes in the intracellular distribution of RIL were observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g005">Fig. 
  <bold>5 d</bold>
 </xref>). Overall, these result indicate that the truncation occurring in the F6
 <sub>Δ221–230</sub> NS1 protein, while not affecting its ability to interact and activate Src kinase in vitro, prevents Src activation in the infected cells, suggesting an important role of the PL domain in mediating NS1 association with Src, in vivo, presumably through interaction with the Src regulator RIL.
