<p>Sequences homologous to the PL domain I of NS1 were present in several PDZ-binding cellular proteins. A search of the human protein database with the consensus for the novel PL domain II of H7N1 NS1, returned 43 proteins bearing matching sequences at their extreme C-ter. Five of these proteins are reported in the database to interact with cellular PDZ proteins (

  <bold>S3</bold>
 </xref>). Among these cellular PDZ proteins, LIMK1 has been identified in a genome-wide RNA interference screening, as a host factor important for influenza virus replication

 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The database query also reported the protein ZO1, which was identified by our array. Interestingly, a recent study showed that ZO1 was mislocalized during infection with AI viruses carrying the consensus -ESEV- PL motif (analogous to PLI), as a consequence of the interaction between NS1 and Dlg1 
 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Golebiewski1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Thus, our data seem to suggest that AI NS1 can also directly interact with ZO1. Analysis of these five proteins and their respective ligands listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0027789.s007">Table 
  <bold>S3</bold>
 </xref>, using the STRING interaction database 
 <xref rid="pone.0027789-vonMering1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, revealed that six out of ten proteins were linked through experimentally confirmed physical interactions (

 </xref>). Interestingly, sequence alignment of the PDZ domains of the cellular interactors of the five proteins listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0027789.s007">Table 
  <bold>S3</bold>
 </xref>, revealed significant homology with the PDZ domain of RIL (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0027789.s008">Table 
  <bold>S4</bold>
 </xref>), which emerged as the strongest interactor of avian H7N1 NS1 proteins in our arrays. Collectively, the data of the arrays together with this bioinformatic analysis, suggest that the PL domain II, analogous to the one exposed by the 6- aa truncated H7N1 NS1, is also present in human proteins.
