<p>Our array analysis identified the known NS1 interactors MAGI3 and Dlg1 
 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Golebiewski1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> as binding to at least two of the three NS1 proteins analyzed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g002">Fig. 2 
  <bold>h</bold> and 
  <bold>r</bold>
 </xref>). Seven cellular PDZ domains, belonging to six different proteins, were also identified, which were able to bind both the H7N1 NS1 proteins and the H5N1 NS1, including the known NS1 interactor MAGI1

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0027789.s006">Table 
  <bold>S2</bold>
 </xref>), Analysis of their PDZ domains allowed the identification of three blocks of high homology (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0027789.s003">Fig. 
  <bold>S3 a</bold>
 </xref>), defining a PDZ-consensus for the interaction with AI NS1 proteins. The strongest signal from the arrays for the F3, F4
 <sub>Δ225–230</sub>, ΔCF3
 <sub>Δ225–230</sub> and H5N1 NS1 proteins, was observed with the human Reversion-Induced LIM protein (RIL). To independently confirm that the interaction observed with the isolated PDZ domain of RIL on the arrays, reflected true protein-protein interactions, recombinant F4
 <sub>Δ225–230</sub> and F6
 <sub>Δ221–230</sub> proteins were used in pull-down assays with recombinant GST-RIL expressed in 
 <italic>E.coli</italic> bound to GSH-sepharose beads. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g003">Fig. 
  <bold>3</bold>
 </xref>, RIL interacted only with F4
 <sub>Δ225–230</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g003">Fig. 
  <bold>3 a</bold>
 </xref>) but not with F6
 <sub>Δ221–230</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g003">Fig. 
  <bold>3 b</bold>
 </xref>). In addition, one protein (ZO1) was identified in our array analysis as a specific interactor of the F4
 <sub>Δ225–230</sub>, ΔCF3
 <sub>Δ225–230</sub> and H5N1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g002">Fig. 
  <bold>2</bold>
 </xref>) NS1 proteins. Cell extracts containing the overexpressed recombinant full length ZO1 were then incubated with NiNTA-agarose beads in the absence or in the presence of recombinant his-tagged F4
 <sub>Δ225–230</sub> NS1. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g003">Fig. 
  <bold>3 c</bold>
 </xref>, ZO1 was eluted from the beads only in the presence of NS1 (lane 3), but not in its absence (lane 6). These results confirmed that the interactions with the isolated PDZ domains, detected by the arrays, could also be reproduced with intact full length proteins.
