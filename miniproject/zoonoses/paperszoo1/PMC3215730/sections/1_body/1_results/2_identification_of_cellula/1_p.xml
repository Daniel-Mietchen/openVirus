<p>The PDZ binding properties of the novel TPL domain were tested on protein arrays (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g002">Figure 2</xref>), representing 58 different types of human PDZ domains (schematically drawn in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g002">Fig. 
  <bold>2 a</bold> and 
  <bold>2 i</bold>
 </xref>). As summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g002">Fig. 
  <bold>2 h</bold> and 
  <bold>2 r</bold>
 </xref>, the full length NS1 protein F3 was able to bind 28 human cellular PDZ domains. The 6- aa naturally truncated NS1 F4
 <sub>Δ225–230</sub>, of the HPAI H7N1 viral strain, bearing only the PL domain II (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g001">Fig. 
  <bold>1 a</bold>
 </xref>), interacted with 22 PDZ domains, but only 18 were in common with F3, suggesting that deletion of the first PL domain also changed the PDZ-domain binding specificity the protein. When an identical truncation was engineered into the full length F3 protein to obtain the mutant ΔCF3
 <sub>Δ225–230</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g001">Fig. 
  <bold>1 a</bold>
 </xref>) a pattern of interaction similar to F4
 <sub>Δ225–230</sub>, was observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g002">Fig. 
  <bold>2 e</bold> and 
  <bold>2 o</bold>
 </xref>), demonstrating that the differences between F3 and F4
 <sub>Δ225–230</sub> NS1 proteins were not strain specific but dependent on the different PL domain arrangement. Finally, the naturally occurring 10-aa truncated NS1 protein F6
 <sub>Δ221–230</sub>, of the LPAI H7N1 with no PL domains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g001">Fig. 
  <bold>1 a</bold>
 </xref>), showed no interaction with the PDZ domains in both arrays (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g002">Fig. 
  <bold>2 d</bold> and 
  <bold>2 n</bold>
 </xref>), as expected. The F3, F4
 <sub>Δ225–230</sub> and F6
 <sub>Δ221–230</sub> NS1 proteins, although originating from different isolates, showed &gt;99% identity at the aa level (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g001">Fig. 
  <bold>1 a</bold>
 </xref>). In order to compare the PDZ binding characteristics of more distantly related AI strains, the NS1 protein of the HPAI H5N1 A/HK/213/03 isolate was tested. The H5N1 NS1 possesses a consensus PL domain I, but its PL domain II deviates from the consensus due to a single aa change from a hydrophobic to a positively charged residue (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g001">Fig. 
  <bold>1 a</bold>
 </xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g002">Fig. 
  <bold>2 h</bold> and 
  <bold>2 r</bold>
 </xref>, the H5N1 protein recognized a set of 20 PDZ domains, of which only 8 overlapped with the PDZ domains recognized by the F3 protein. Interestingly, the H5N1 and F4
 <sub>Δ225–230</sub> NS1 proteins recognized 11 PDZ domains in common, four of which were specifically bound by these two proteins and not by F3. Deletion of the PL domain I of the H5N1 NS1 (protein ΔCH5N1
 <sub>Δ220–225</sub>), resulted in the complete loss of interaction with the PDZ domains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g002">Fig. 
  <bold>2 f</bold> and 
  <bold>2 q</bold>
 </xref>), indicating that its PL domain II was not functional, as predicted by the sequence. Thus, PDZ-domain binding by AI NS1 proteins requires the presence of at least one functional C-ter PL domain.
