<p>RIL has been shown to interact with both the kinase and SH2 domains of Src 
 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. We hypothesized that NS1 might bind, instead, to the SH3 domain of Src through one of its SHB domains. The general consensus sequences for the AI SHB domains 1 and 2 are -PØPxxP- and –PPØPxK/R-, respectively, where Ø indicates hydrophobic aminoacids. Sequence analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g004">Fig.

 </xref>) showed that the SHB domain 1 is generally conserved among influenza viruses, while the SHB domain 2 is more variable. The -PPLPPK- sequence is present in the 1918 H1N1 “Spanish flu” virus (A/Brevig_Mission/1918), while the most recent H1N1v 2009 pandemic virus, as well as the human H1N1 and H3N2 seasonal strains, show different aa substitutions, leading to the loss of conserved residues. The H5N1 NS1 protein carries aminoacid substitutions in its SHB domain 2 leading to the loss of two conserved residues (-
 <underline>L</underline>PLPP
 <underline>N</underline>-) with respect to the consensus, while all the H7N1 NS1 proteins retain a perfect match (-PPLPPK-). We cloned the NS1 protein from two seasonal H3N2 human influenza isolates of the 2007 epidemic (VR9220 and VR9240), bearing an intact SHB domain 1, but with one aminoacid substitution in a conserved Pro of SHB domain 2 (-PPØ
 <underline>T</underline>PK-), an compared them to the F3 and H5N1 NS1 protein for their ability to stimulate Src. No stimulation of Src was observed by the full length H5N1 NS1, or by the two H3N2 NS1 proteins (
