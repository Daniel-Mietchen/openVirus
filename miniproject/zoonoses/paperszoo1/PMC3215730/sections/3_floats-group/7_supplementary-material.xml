   <bold>Phylogenetic tree of the AI viral isolates bearing the novel TPL domain.</bold> The tree was generated starting from the aminoacidic sequences of 195/427 isolates present in the database, including all the sequences of the KRYMERRVESEI, KRYMARRIESEV and KRYMARRVESEI groups and 97/325 sequences of the most common KRYMARRVESEV group. Isolates with the same TPL domain version are grouped by coloured frames. The tree was generated by the platform Phylogeny.fr (
   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phylogeny.fr/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.phylogeny.fr/</ext-link>) with the program sMUSCLE, Gblocks and PhyML (Dereeper A., et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 2008, 36, Web server issue W45-9). Tree was drawn by the program TreeDyn.
