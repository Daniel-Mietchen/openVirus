  <title>The activation state of cellular Src during infection is differently modulated by H7N1 viruses expressing the full length or the truncated NS1 protein.</title>
  <p>a. A representative Western blot analysis of the active (Y418 phosphorylated) or inactive (Y529 phosphorylated) forms of Src in cells infected with the with natural 977 H7N1 strain expressing full length NS1. Intensities normalized to the actin controls are indicated below each corresponding lane. Mean values for the intensities normalized to actin are indicated below each set as relative intensity units (RIU). b. as in panel a, but for cells infected with the 4426 virus expressing the F6?221-230 NS1 protein. c. Normalized RIU values for each form, were used to derive the relative ratios for active vs. inactive Src. Values are the means derived from the western blots of two independent infection experiments, as exemplified in panels a and b. Each western blot has been loaded with two (mocked) or three (infected) different amounts of crude extract, in order to obtain replicated measurements for each infection experiment. Error bars are Â±S.D. d. Western blot analysis of NS1 and RIL proteins in the cell extracts used for the experiments shown in panels a and b.</p>
