   <bold>Geographical distribution of th AI isolates bearing the novel TPL domain.</bold> The map is based on the locations of the reported identification of the different isolates present in the database. The different versions of the TPL domain are indicated with different colours. Due to sampling bias, the frequency of each variant in the database does not necessarily correlate with the actual natural distribution of the different viruses.
