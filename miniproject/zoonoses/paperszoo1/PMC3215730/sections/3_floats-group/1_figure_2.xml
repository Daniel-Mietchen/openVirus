   <bold>a</bold>. Schematic representation of the different PDZ domains present on commercial PDZ Array I (Panomics). Each PDZ domain is present on the membrane in duplicate. Plus signs indicate positive controls for the anti-histidine antibody used for detection. 
   <bold>b</bold>. Visualization of the interactions between the H7N1 full length NS1 protein (F3) with the PDZ domains on Array I.
