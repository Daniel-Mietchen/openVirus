   <bold>Analysis of cellular PL type II domains.</bold> Sequence alignment of the human cellular PDZ-domains interacting with H7N1 and H5N1 NS1 proteins, identified by protein arrays analysis. Blocks of identical residues (in red) are highlighted in yellow. Similar aminoacids are highlighted in green. The derived consensus is shown (in red) at the bottom of the panel. Ø, hydrophobic residues; ¥, aliphatic residues. 
   <bold>b</bold>. STRING interaction network of the cellular proteins bearing a PL domain type-II (KIF13B, CADM1, CNTAP-2) and their respective PDZ-ligands (DLG1, MPP3, CASK). Colour coded connecting lines as per STRING nomenclature are as follows: purple, experimentally proven physical interactions; green, co-cited in the same article (PubMed); cyan, linked through functional homology. 
   <bold>c</bold> Expanded STRING interaction network built from the cellular proteins (circled in red) with PL domain II (KIF13B, CNTAP-2, CADM1) and their respective PDZ ligands (DLG1, CASK, MPP3). The thickness of the connecting lines is proportional to the STRING score (likelihood of interaction).
