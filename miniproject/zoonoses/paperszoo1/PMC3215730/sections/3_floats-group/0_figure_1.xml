  <title>The NS1 protein of H7N1 avian influenza viruses has a new tandem PDZ-ligand domain.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold>. Sequence alignment of the NS1 proteins from Italian H7N1 AI isolates and the H5N1 NS1 protein. Equivalent aminoacids are shaded in green; non-equivalent aminoacid are in red. SHBD, Src-homology type 3 binding domains. PL, PDZ-ligand domain. Alignments were generated with the program ClustalW. 
   <bold>b</bold>. Comparison of the amino acid specificities of PL domains I and II of the H7N1 NS1 protein with the consensus specificity map for cellular PL domains. Matching aminoacids are shown in red. 
   <bold>c</bold>. Comparison of the amino acid specificities of PL domains I and II of the different AI virus NS1 protein with the consensus specificity map for cellular PL domains. Matching aminoacids are shown in red. Equivalent aminoacidic substitions with respect to the H7N1 NS1 protein are shaded in green. Non-equivalent substitutions are shaded in yellow.
