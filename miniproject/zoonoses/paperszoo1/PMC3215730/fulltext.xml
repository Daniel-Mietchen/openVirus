Here, we identify a previously unrecognized tandem PDZ-ligand (TPL) domain in the extreme carboxy terminus of NS1 proteins from a subset of globally circulating AI viruses. By using protein arrays we have identified several human PDZ-cellular ligands of this novel domain, one of which is the RIL protein, a known regulator of the cellular tyrosine kinase Src. We found that the AI NS1 proteins bind and stimulate human Src tyrosine kinase, through their carboxy terminal Src homology type 3-binding (SHB) domain. The physical interaction between NS1 and Src and the ability of AI viruses to modulate the phosphorylation status of Src during the infection, were found to be influenced by the TPL arrangement. These results indicate the potential for novel host-pathogen interactions mediated by the TPL and SHB domains of AI NS1 protein.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Avian influenza (AI) viruses pose significant threats to both animal and human health. Approximately 200 million birds have died or have been culled worldwide as a result of AI. In addition, since 1997, AI viruses of the H5 or H7 subtype have crossed the species barrier and caused fatal disease in humans <xref rid="pone.0027789-Aamir1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027789-Belser1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027789-Krauss1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027789-Neumann1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. These events, in addition to the emergence of the triple-reassortant of avian and swine genes H1N1v as a pandemic virus in 2009 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, warn us of the potential generation of another human pandemic virus. Thus, understanding the pathogenic determinants of AI viruses and their modifications in the course of natural epidemics is important for the identification of natural reservoirs of potential pandemic viruses. The NS1 protein of AI viruses is an important pathogenicity determinant <xref rid="pone.0027789-FernandezSesma1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027789-Hale1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and was shown to possess a PDZ-ligand (PL) motif, enabling it to interact with a wide range of cellular proteins <xref rid="pone.0027789-Obenauer1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0027789-Golebiewski1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and influencing pathogenicity <xref rid="pone.0027789-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0027789-Soubies1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. One of the most severe AI outbreaks in European poultry was caused by an H7N1 subtype virus between 1999 and 2001. Longitudinal analysis of low pathogenic (LP) and high pathogenic (HP) AI H7N1 isolates circulating during the outbreak <xref rid="pone.0027789-Dundon1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, revealed that the H7N1 LP viruses at the beginning of the epidemic had a full length NS1 protein (F3 protein, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g001">Fig. <bold>1 a</bold>
</xref>), while the HP isolates circulating during the peak weeks showed a truncation of the last C-ter six amino acids (aa) of NS1 (F4<sub>&#x00394;225&#x02013;230</sub> protein, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g001">Fig. <bold>1 a</bold>
</xref>). At the end of the epidemic, the majority of circulating AI viruses were LP isolates, with a C-ter deletion of 10- aa in the NS1 protein (F6<sub>&#x00394;221&#x02013;230</sub> protein, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g001">Fig. <bold>1 a</bold>
</xref>). H5 and H7 AI viruses are the only subtypes causing high pathogenic infections in poultry and to possess the potential to be transmitted to humans. Thus, changes in the pathogenic potential of these AI viruses during extensive epidemics might represent a potential threat to human health. Since the observed truncations in H7N1 NS1 protein spanned the PDZ-ligand (PL) domain, which has been documented to influence pathogenicity through the interaction with host cell proteins, we investigated whether these truncations might alter the ability of the AI NS1 protein to interact with human host factors.</p><fig id="pone-0027789-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0027789.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The NS1 protein of H7N1 avian influenza viruses has a new tandem PDZ-ligand domain.</title><p>

</xref>, only five versions of this domain, each differing from the others by single aminoacidic substitutions, appear to be present in this restricted subset of globally circulating AI viruses belonging to different H and N subtypes. The KRYMARRVESEV domain has been found in isolates throughout the world, while the KRYMERRVESEI is reported so far only for a cluster of closely related H7N2 viruses isolated in North America. The KRYMARRIESEV domain has been found in isolates from three geographical locations corresponding to three separate genetic clusters: Canada, comprising different H and N combinations; Chile, all belonging to the H7N3 genotype and Germany, with three isolates of the H10N7 genotype. These German isolates are also the oldest, dating back to 1949. The Chile isolates cluster genetically close to the H7N1 viruses of the italian epidemics analysed in this study, bearing the KRYMARRIESEV domain. The KRYMARRVESEI domain is present in 8 isolates falling in three separate genetic clusters. Five from China, of the H6N2, H1N1 and H9N2 genotypes, one from Canada, of the H3N8 genotype and two from US, of the H6N1 genotype. Interestingly, the five Chinese isolates appear to be genetically close to the oldest H10N7 German isolates with the KRYMARRIESEV domain. Finally, the KRFMARRVESEV domain is found only in two isolates from Japan. Overall, these data indicate that AI viruses carrying different versions of the TPL domain are circulating worldwide both in wild birds and domestic poultry.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Identification of cellular ligands for the novel tandem PDZ-domain of avian influenza NS1</title><p>The PDZ binding properties of the novel TPL domain were tested on protein arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g002">Figure 2</xref>), representing 58 different types of human PDZ domains (schematically drawn in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g002">Fig. <bold>2 a</bold> and <bold>2 i</bold>

</xref>, the full length NS1 protein F3 was able to bind 28 human cellular PDZ domains. The 6- aa naturally truncated NS1 F4<sub>&#x00394;225&#x02013;230</sub>, of the HPAI H7N1 viral strain, bearing only the PL domain II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g001">Fig. <bold>1 a</bold>

</xref>), demonstrating that the differences between F3 and F4<sub>&#x00394;225&#x02013;230</sub> NS1 proteins were not strain specific but dependent on the different PL domain arrangement. Finally, the naturally occurring 10-aa truncated NS1 protein F6<sub>&#x00394;221&#x02013;230</sub>, of the LPAI H7N1 with no PL domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g001">Fig. <bold>1 a</bold>

</xref>). In order to compare the PDZ binding characteristics of more distantly related AI strains, the NS1 protein of the HPAI H5N1 A/HK/213/03 isolate was tested. The H5N1 NS1 possesses a consensus PL domain I, but its PL domain II deviates from the consensus due to a single aa change from a hydrophobic to a positively charged residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g001">Fig. <bold>1 a</bold>
</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g002">Fig. <bold>2 h</bold> and <bold>2 r</bold>
</xref>, the H5N1 protein recognized a set of 20 PDZ domains, of which only 8 overlapped with the PDZ domains recognized by the F3 protein. Interestingly, the H5N1 and F4<sub>&#x00394;225&#x02013;230</sub> NS1 proteins recognized 11 PDZ domains in common, four of which were specifically bound by these two proteins and not by F3. Deletion of the PL domain I of the H5N1 NS1 (protein &#x00394;CH5N1<sub>&#x00394;220&#x02013;225</sub>), resulted in the complete loss of interaction with the PDZ domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027789-g002">Fig. <bold>2 f</bold> and <bold>2 q</bold>

A search of the human protein database with the consensus for the novel PL domain II of H7N1 NS1, returned 43 proteins bearing matching sequences at their extreme C-ter.

Among these cellular PDZ proteins, LIMK1 has been identified in a genome-wide RNA interference screening, as a host factor important for influenza virus replication <xref rid="pone.0027789-Konig1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

The database query also reported the protein ZO1, which was identified by our array.

Overall, these result indicate that the truncation occurring in the F6<sub>&#x00394;221&#x02013;230</sub> NS1 protein, while not affecting its ability to interact and activate Src kinase in vitro, prevents Src activation in the infected cells, suggesting an important role of the PL domain in mediating NS1 association with Src, in vivo, presumably through interaction with the Src regulator RIL.</p><fig id="pone-0027789-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0027789.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>The activation state of cellular Src during infection is differently modulated by H7N1 viruses expressing the full length or the truncated NS1 protein.</title><p>a.

H5N1 NS1 interacts with the cellular PDZ proteins Scribble and Dlg, altering the JAK/STAT signalling pathway and protecting infected cells from apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0027789-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0027789-Golebiewski1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, the avian PL sequence (-ESEV-) seems to affect viral pathogenesis in a strain- and host-dependent manner <xref rid="pone.0027789-Zielecki1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027789-Soubies1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. For example, while reintroduction of the fully functional 1918 H1N1 PL domain in the NS1 protein of the human H3N2 A/WSN/33 virus, caused enhanced pathogenicity in mice <xref rid="pone.0027789-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, the same modification of the 2009 H1N1v pandemic virus did not result in enhanced replication or transmissibility, suggesting that other factors also contribute to viral pathogenicity <xref rid="pone.0027789-Hale2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Comparison of the NS1 sequences of human circulating H1N1 and H3N2 with the new H1N1v pandemic strain, showed that the last 50&#x02013;60 aa at the C-ter of NS1 were the less conserved, with aa identity ranging from 41.7 to 67.2&#x00025;, with respect to the 78&#x02013;84&#x00025; aa identity showed at the level of the entire protein <xref rid="pone.0027789-Campanini1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. This suggests that the extreme C-ter domain (including the PL domain), is subjected to selective pressure during circulation in novel hosts. Significant host-specific evolution of the PL domain of swine influenza viruses have also been suggested by detailed sequence comparison among strains circulating in different geographical areas in the last &#x0003e;30 years, indicating host-specific positive selection at the level of the PL domain, as a result of cross-species transmission <xref rid="pone.0027789-Vijaykrishna1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Indeed, human, equine and swine influenza strains, including the 2009 H1N1v pandemic virus, do not harbour a PL domain, suggesting that loss of PDZ-binding capability may be one of the steps involved in adaptation of avian viruses to new hosts <xref rid="pone.0027789-Dundon2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>Our phylogenetic analysis of the Italian H7N1 isolates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0027789.s004">Fig. <bold>S4</bold>
</xref>), further corroborates this view. We showed that HPAI viruses circulating in the mid-phase of the epidemic with the F4<sub>&#x00394;225&#x02013;230</sub> protein, possessing a PL domain II only, arose from LPAI viruses with full length NS1 F3, harbouring an intact TPL domain. On the contrary, the LPAI viruses circulating at the end of the epidemics with the NS1 mutant F6<sub>&#x00394;221&#x02013;230</sub>, bearing a complete loss of PL domains, originated from a separate viral pool, suggesting that the 10-aa deletion of F6<sub>&#x00394;221&#x02013;230</sub> NS1, conferred a selective advantage over the circulating viruses with the 6-aa deleted F4<sub>&#x00394;225&#x02013;230</sub> NS1.</p><p>Due to its potential binding to multiple partners, NS1 can interfere with different cellular pathways on a competition basis, with some interactions being more stable or more probable than others. In particular, the AI virus NS1 protein activates the cellular PI3K kinase by disrupting the interaction between the catalytic p110 subunit and its negative regulatory subunit p85, through physical binding to the p110 kinase domain <xref rid="pone.0027789-Ehrhardt1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>Here, we showed that AI virus NS1 can interfere with the Src-RIL regulatory axis in a manner which is influenced by the PL arrangement. RIL was shown to bind to the phosphatase PTPL1, allowing its association with the active form of Src <xref rid="pone.0027789-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. PTPL1 then catalyzes the dephosphorylation of the regulatory residue Y418 of Src, resulting in kinase inactivation. Our array analysis showed that full length H7N1 and H5N1 NS1 proteins can interact through their PL domains with both RIL and PTPL1, potentially being able to disrupt their interaction. The H7N1 NS1 proteins were also found in this study to bind and stimulate human Src kinase through their SHB domain 2, while the H5N1 NS1 protein was not. We showed that loss of PL domain I (as in the F4<sub>&#x00394;225&#x02013;230</sub> protein) abolishes interaction with PTPL1 but not with RIL and Src. Deletion of the entire TPL (as in the F6<sub>&#x00394;221&#x02013;230</sub> mutant) from the H7N1 NS1, abolishes the interaction with RIL, but still allows interaction of the viral protein with Src. Thus, the H7N1 NS1 protein seems to carry the potential for a wider range of interactions than its H5N1 counterpart, thanks to its TPL and SHB domain 2.</p><p>We propose a model, whereby AI NS1 replaces PTPL1 as the interacting partner of RIL, preventing Src inactivation. RIL binds to the SH2 and kinase domain of Src, allowing NS1 interaction with the SH3 domain. Binding of a protein substrate displaces RIL from the Src-NS1-RIL complex, whereby NS1 increases the catalytic efficiency of Src. Loss of the PL domain prevents NS1 interaction with RIL. Interestingly, the F6<sub>&#x00394;221&#x02013;230</sub> mutant lacking all PL domains, was found to be sequestered into the insoluble fraction, upon lysis of infected cells, while the full length F3 NS1 protein was also retained in the soluble part, along with RIL and Src. The soluble fraction of active Src was indeed specifically enriched in infected cells expressing full length NS1, but not the F6<sub>&#x00394;221&#x02013;230</sub> mutant. Src subcellular localization is subjected to complex regulation and Src has been found associated not only to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, but also to the endoplasmatic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and cytoskeletal components <xref rid="pone.0027789-Sandilands1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Thus, it is possible that NS1 requires interaction with RIL to be relocalized at specific cellular compartments together with Src. Src transduces signals to many cellular pathways, affecting cell proliferation, cell motility, apoptosis, immune signalling <xref rid="pone.0027789-Palacios1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027789-Ingley1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The exact role of Src activation in the AI virus replication cycle is still unknown, however, a recent report showed that IL-1 dependent inflammatory response due to influenza A viral infection, was dependent on Src activation and was completely abrogated by PP2 treatment <xref rid="pone.0027789-Lietzen1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that viruses bearing NS1 proteins able to upregulate Src activity through the RIL axis, might be expected to induce a stronger inflammatory response than viruses with NS1 proteins lacking RIL- or Src-binding capabilities. We have shown that NS1 interaction with Src required the SHB domain 2. Interestingly, human circulating H1N1 and H3N2 strains as well as the 2009 pandemic H1N1v, all have mutations in the SHB domain 2, which prevent interaction with Src, suggesting again a possible host-specific adaptation mechanism.</p><p>If loss or inactivation by mutation of the PL domain is a step involved in adaptation of AI viruses to new hosts, those strains bearing two PL domains in tandem (TPL), as those reported here, would present an higher genetic barrier to adaptation. The comparison of the PDZ-binding specificity of the F3 and F4 H7N1 NS1 proteins, indicated that the set of PDZ domains bound by the NS1 protein bearing both TPL I and II (F3), was significantly different from the one recognized by the NS1 protein bearing TPL II only (F4). This suggests that these two domains are not identical and that deletion of the TPL I can alter the network of interactions between AI NS1 and cellular PDZ proteins, possibly affecting pathogenesis. Thus, AI viruses bearing a TPL may represent a potential threat in case of cross-species infections <xref rid="pone.0027789-Rigoni1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Interestingly, by sequence alignment, we have found the novel TPL domain arrangement also in a group of H5N1 isolates circulating in China (A/Env/HK/437/99, acc. no. Q9EA66, Q9EA72, Q77NF2, Q9DGY0), antigenically and genetically related to the H5N1 virus responsible for the human AI outbreak of 1997 <xref rid="pone.0027789-Cauthen1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Thus, the potential interaction of their NS1 proteins with essential human cellular pathways warrants further investigation.</p><p>A therapeutic strategy that can reduce the emergence of viral resistance towards antiviral drugs is the selective targeting of host factors required for viral replication. We have recently provided a successful example of such an approach towards HIV-1 infection <xref rid="pone.0027789-Maga1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In this study, by analyzing the occurrence of AI-like PL domains in human PDZ-binding proteins, a restricted number of proteins potentially mediating host-pathogen relationships in AI virus replication have been identified. These findings might be further expanded to identify novel anti-influenza targets and drugs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Chemicals</title><p>Labelled [gamma-<sup>32</sup>P]- ATP was from GE Healthcare.
