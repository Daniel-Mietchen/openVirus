<p>In order to mitigate the possible impact of an influenza pandemic, we need more research and development in the generation of improved vaccines and antivirals with broad cross-reactivity against multiple influenza viruses. In addition, by investigating the factors responsible for the generation of human pandemic viruses, we can better recognize the risks that animal influenza virus strains pose to humans and build eradication campaigns to target specific viral strains circulating in animals. Critical to this issue is the question of what makes an influenza virus transmissible in humans and animals. We know very little about this question. A better understanding of influenza transmission will lead to the development of countermeasures for viral transmission that can enhance our pandemic preparedness plans.</p>
