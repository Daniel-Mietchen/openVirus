<p>Ferrets and guinea pigs are often used as animal models of influenza virus transmission. Several mutations and changes associated with increased airborne transmission of avian influenza viruses in ferrets have been identified in recent years (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). However, previous attempts to identify adaptive changes in highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses associated with transmission have failed, supporting the possibility that H5N1 viruses might be structurally unfit for mammalian transmission (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). More recently, two independent laboratories lead by Ron Fouchier and Yoshihiro Kawaoka have ruled out this hypothesis and identified specific mutations that allow the H5N1 virus to accomplish airborne transmission in ferrets (unpublished observations). While this provides important information on the adaptability of H5N1 viruses, more research needs to be conducted to understand the possibility that avian H5N1 could evolve to become transmissible in humans, to predict its pathogenesis in humans, and to find the molecular mechanisms responsible for host specificity in influenza virus transmission.
