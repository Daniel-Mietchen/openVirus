<p>Influenza A viruses continue to pose a major concern for animal and human health. These viruses infect a variety of species, including aquatic birds, poultry, pigs, horses, dogs, and humans, causing significant morbidity and mortality. In the case of human influenza viruses, in addition to the burden of yearly epidemics, there is the ever-present threat of an influenza pandemic. Pandemics occur when a novel strain of influenza virus of animal origin evolves the ability to infect and efficiently transmit among humans. While some influenza pandemics, like the 1918 H1N1 pandemic that killed more than 40 million people worldwide, have had devastating consequences, others, including the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, which resulted in an estimated 18,000 deaths, have been considerably milder. Unfortunately, the emergence of new human pandemic viruses, as well as the subtype and virulence of the causative viruses, is still unpredictable. Although there are vaccines available for certain influenza viruses, they are strain specific, and the generation and general distribution of a new influenza virus vaccine take more time than the spread of a new virus, severely limiting the impact of vaccines in the first wave of a pandemic. Influenza antiviral drugs are of broader specificity, but resistance to those drugs and problems with availability limit their use.</p>
