<p>While research on influenza virus transmission is critical for finding ways to better tackle this pathogen, it is important to conduct such research using appropriate biocontainment and biosafety conditions to minimize possible risks of virus release to the environment. Risk assessment is a crucial tool in selecting biocontainment levels for research on potentially dangerous pathogens. According to the 
 <italic>Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories</italic> (BMBL) manual (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), the definitive reference book for biosafety issues, biological risk associated with pathogen research is determined by three elements: the activities that can result in human exposure to the pathogen, the probability that such exposure would cause an infection, and the consequences of such an infection. Although ferret-adapted H5N1 viruses probably have attenuated infectivity and pathogenesis for humans, to minimize all possible risks one should use biocontainment facilities and practices that prevent human exposure. Preventing the escape of viruses from the laboratory can be achieved by housing research activities in a facility equipped with interlocked rooms with negative pressure and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtered air circulation and using the appropriate decontamination and/or sterilization practices for material leaving the facility. Since human infection with influenza viruses occurs via the respiratory route, infection of laboratory personnel can be prevented by the use of powered air-purifying respirators. These practices correspond to enhanced biosafety level 3 (BSL3), as described in the BMBL manual. The effects of accidental exposure to the virus in an enhanced BSL3 facility can be minimized by vaccinating personnel with an H5N1 vaccine and through the use of antiviral drugs.
