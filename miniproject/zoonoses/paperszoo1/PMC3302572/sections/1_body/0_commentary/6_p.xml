<p>Influenza virus research is important for the development of novel intervention strategies for preventing and mitigating influenza epidemics and pandemics. As scientists, we have the responsibility to avoid the undue restrictions of the highest level of biocontainment if enhanced BSL3 facilities can provide the appropriate biosafety. The use of BSL4 containment would not decrease the risk of virus release any more than enhanced BSL3 containment, but it would result in an unnecessary burden that would restrict research on H5N1 influenza transmission to a few facilities and considerably decrease the speed of research on this important pathogen.</p>
