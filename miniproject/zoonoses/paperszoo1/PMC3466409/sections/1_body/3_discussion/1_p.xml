<p>We have presented a detailed framework for MGF and described, through case studies, different methods of implementation. Key differences between MGF and more commonly applied approaches to modelling ecological dynamics are the early-stage input from both modellers and biologists into study design, incorporation of multiple hypotheses and uncertainty about structure in the determination of the data required and the iterative approach between models and measurement. 
 <italic>Post hoc</italic> modelling studies have an important role to play to complement traditional data analysis and generate new predictions. However, such studies tend to be limited in their scope and power if the modellers were not involved in study design. A lack of mutual understanding or communication between the modellers and the scientists who collected the data can cause lengthy adjustments of the model, can result in parts of the data being unusable due to their inadequate collection or reporting and may bring into question the reliability of the predictions generated. When undertaken properly, MGF allows the assessment of multiple system-specific hypotheses that relate to unobserved mechanisms, by combining information from different organisational levels (individual hosts, populations and landscapes). This information often comes from diverse sources, such as field surveys, laboratory experiments and surveillance, that can be integrated into the modelling framework. While we put fieldwork at the core of MGF as the fundamental source of data and observations on wildlife ecology, our framework can incorporate complementary data sources, such as experiments involving captive animals. As a result of this broader integration, the data gathered will be exploited to their full potential and will thus lead to richer and more reliable conclusions and predictions.
