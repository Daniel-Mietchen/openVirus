<p>Although we have focused our attention on wildlife infections, the MGF framework would be equally useful in other areas of applied ecological research where mechanistic models could help devise quantitative predictions for intervention, as indicated by retrospective reviews, e.g. on pest management (Murdoch

Potential applications include the management of invasive species, conservation of biodiversity in the face of climate change or the sustainability of human exploitation of natural resources. Advice to policy makers in these fields all too often relies on ‘expert opinion’, a euphemism for the subjective synthesis of vast amounts of scientific evidence and personal experience. By providing a rigorous framework for the construction of such syntheses, the MGF approach has the potential to become a standard for evidence-based environmental policies. Explicit embedding of MGF approaches into policy directed programmes can be achieved using frameworks such as participatory impact pathways analysis (Alvarez 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
