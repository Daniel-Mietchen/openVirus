<p>Now is an exciting time to implement MGF approaches. There is increasing emphasis on the need for multi- or interdisciplinary studies of many systems, particularly regarding the emergence of infectious disease threats to biodiversity and public health (Wolfe

 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">2008</xref>). Many national and international funding bodies have started to support actively the integration of empirical research with modelling, or model-guided predictions, not only in their core programmes but also increasingly in direct response to emerging epizootics (e.g. white nose syndrome in North American bats) or zoonoses (e.g. pandemic swine influenza). One area where real progress can be made at low additional cost through MGF approaches is pathogen or disease surveillanceâ€”a point apparently overlooked by Kuiken 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (
