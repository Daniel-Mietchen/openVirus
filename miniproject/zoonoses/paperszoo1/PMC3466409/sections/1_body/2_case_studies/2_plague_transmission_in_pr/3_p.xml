<p>Based on the model, a series of experiments established that early-phase transmission was feasible in a laboratory setting (Eisen

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">2009</xref>). This field and laboratory work corresponds to Phase 3 in MGF (

 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">2010</xref>; Buhnerkempe 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">2011</xref>), corresponding to Steps 4 and 5 in MGF (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). The two different models that were developed need to be reconciled, but overall it appears likely that early-phase transmission drives the initial spread of epizootics with secondary roles for other transmission routes once host limitation occurs (Buhnerkempe 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
