<p>Plague has a rich and long scientific literature including many older studies with valuable information from detailed laboratory and field observations for different species of rodent hosts and flea vectors. Under closer scrutiny by empirical researchers and modellers, the literature revealed an array of proposed transmission mechanisms that could broadly be classified into three types: blocked flea transmission, pneumonic transmission and transmission from a short-term reservoir. This led to the development of a mechanistic model that incorporated those three alternative transmission pathways (Webb 
 <italic>et al</italic>.

Most model parameters were taken from literature on prairie dogs or closely related species, although field data were used to estimate three remaining parameters using multiple methods including fitting procedures to the proposed model and estimation separate from the model. A stochastic version of the model was used to predict the probability of extinction of prairie dogs and fleas and the time to extinction. These predictions were validated using an independent 20-year data set of observed outbreaks. The model achieved a reasonable match to the observed data, and sensitivity analysis revealed that transmission from a short-term reservoir was the only route consistent with the observed data. This led to specific recommendations for data collection, initiating a new cycle of MGF (

In particular, multiple hypotheses were consistent with the short-term reservoir scenario and constraints on the infectious period of the short-term reservoir predicted by the model, including early-phase transmission before blockage occurred, transmission from carcasses and transmission from alternative infected hosts.
