<p>Black-tailed prairie dogs (
 <italic>Cynomys ludovicianus</italic>) are extremely susceptible to plague and exhibit epizootic die-offs resulting in the apparent extinction of prairie dog towns. Researchers wished to determine the mechanisms underlying these spectacular die-offs to better understand how they occur and might be managed. According to the dominant paradigm in the literature, 
 <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>, the aetiological agent of plague, forms a biofilm that blocks the proventriculus of fleas feeding on mammals; transmission occurs when infectious bacteria from the blockage are regurgitated. Models that assumed blocked flea transmission as the only process predicted flea loads that were inconsistent with those observed in the field (Lorange 
 <italic>et al</italic>.

 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">2006</xref>). From these results and other observations, field researchers questioned the relevance of the dominant assumption to the prairie dog system, especially because the paradigm was based on transmission in a peridomestic system that differs in several important features from plague outbreaks in wildlife populations (Gage &amp; Kosoy
