<p>We have been conducting in parallel field-based studies of wild populations, surveys of captive bats maintained in semi-natural conditions and laboratory-based development of immunological and virological assays (Hayman 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">2011</xref>), all guided by and feeding back into the modelling framework. The large colony sizes of 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> roosts largely exceed the number of bats that can be studied using a traditional capture-recapture marking survey. Simulations based on expected survival rates suggested that radio-telemetry as a method of redetection of around 100 tagged bats in the colony over a whole season would give reliable estimates of survival (Hayman 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">2012b</xref>). Other approaches, such as the estimation of ages using tooth-cementum ring analyses, have enabled us to estimate age-specific seroprevalence, and hence infection rates (Hayman 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">2012a</xref>). To address the unresolved issue of protective acquired immunity in bats, a captive, wild-caught colony is now being studied. By sampling these bats regularly, we are seeking to determine whether serological parameters vary over time, whether all individuals are born susceptible and whether seropositive bats may be persistently infected. Alongside this ongoing empirical work, we are now adapting the seasonal model developed by George 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">2011</xref>) for rabies virus in big brown bats, to LBV in 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic>. Once data collection from captive bats is complete, we will be ready to move to Step 4 and fit our updated transmission model to empirical data.
