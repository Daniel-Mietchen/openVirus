<p>The mathematical model consisted of three submodels that described the hibernation period (when no transmission occurs), pre-transmission period in early spring and the main transmission period (when transmission was assumed to follow a classical SEIR framework). Other structures representing alternative hypotheses were considered for the pre-transmission period where less was known. Combined results of demographic and serological sampling in the field, results of experimental exposure studies and information from the literature allowed modellers to estimate or bound model parameters. The model was validated with independent data from the study population, including population size (O'Shea
