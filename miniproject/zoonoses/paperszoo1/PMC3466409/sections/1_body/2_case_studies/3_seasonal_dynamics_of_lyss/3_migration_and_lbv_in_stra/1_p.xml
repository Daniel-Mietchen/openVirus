<p>The second part of our case study on bat-lyssavirus systems concerns Lagos bat virus (LBV), a lyssavirus that has been isolated from the African frugivorous bat 
 <italic>Eidolon helvum</italic> (Boulger &amp; Porterfield 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">1958</xref>). This project exemplifies how emerging infectious disease research can be undertaken when little prior knowledge exists. A high prevalence of antibodies against LBV had been detected in this migratory species (Hayman 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">2008</xref>; Kuzmin 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">2008</xref>), which led us to formulate three overarching questions. Given that most lyssaviruses were thought to have high lethality rates in any mammalian host they infect, could LBV remain endemic in 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic>? How would the spatiotemporal structure of bat populations at the continental scale affect viral persistence? Could 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> act as a reservoir for zoonotic spillover into human and livestock populations? 
 <italic>Eidolon helvum</italic> often roosts in enormous colonies reaching several million bats (SÃ¸rensen &amp; Halberg 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">2001</xref>), which have been documented to form and disperse seasonally across sub-Saharan Africa, in both urban and rural environments. Based on this prior knowledge, we set out to address our three questions, with an initial focus on the capital of Ghana, Accra, home to a large colony of 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> in close contact with city-dwellers. We have concentrated our attention on two main factors: heterogeneity in host populations (e.g. variations in prevalence with location or age) and potential seasonal forcing of transmission caused by the seasonal migratory and reproductive behaviours of 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic>. We have been addressing these issues following the MGF framework (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>) and using to our advantage the knowledge acquired through the big brown bat study.
