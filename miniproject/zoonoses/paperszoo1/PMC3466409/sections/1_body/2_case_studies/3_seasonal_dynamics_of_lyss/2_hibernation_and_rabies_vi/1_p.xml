<p>The first part of our case study focused on rabies virus persistence in a big brown bat (
 <italic>Eptesicus fuscus</italic>) population roosting in buildings in Fort Collins, Colorado. In this study, modellers relied on a 
 <italic>post hoc</italic> synthesis of field and laboratory data to develop a population-level model for the seasonal dynamics of rabies virus, which was then validated with independent data (George 
 <italic>et al</italic>.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). The project was initiated by field and laboratory scientists aiming to estimate host demographic parameters that were previously unavailable. From the onset of the 5-year field phase of the project, empirical estimates of bat demographic and infection-related parameters were obtained (Step 3). Field work included radio-tracking of bats and permanently tagging (Wimsatt 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">2005</xref>) several thousand individual bats at multiple colonies, which provided estimates of survival rates (O'Shea 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">2011b</xref>). Reproductive rates were quantified by assessing the breeding status of captured females (O'Shea 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">2010</xref>). The project also considered epidemiological parameters of the bat population, including determination of rabies seroprevalence and assessment of infection prevalence. Interpretation of serology data was helped by exposure experiments on captive big brown bats (Shankar 
 <italic>et al</italic>.

 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">2010</xref>) and a statistical model for estimating the rate of exposure based on seroprevalence and seroconversion data from marked bats (George 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
