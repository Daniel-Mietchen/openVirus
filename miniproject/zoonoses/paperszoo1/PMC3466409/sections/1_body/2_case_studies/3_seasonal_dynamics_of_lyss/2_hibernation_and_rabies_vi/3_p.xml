<p>The model suggests that rabies virus is maintained in the population because the system is essentially in stasis during the hibernation period, which allows persistence of infection until the spring birth pulse (George

Although this project did not begin with the design of a mathematical model, the field and experimental biologists had an unusually clear conceptual model initially and worked closely with modellers as data collection was ending. Although, in hindsight, this project could have benefitted from an earlier involvement of the modellers, it has demonstrated how empirical researchers and modellers effectively iterated several steps of MGF

The resultant model would not have been possible or compelling without the field and laboratory data generated at different stages of the project; the modelling allowed integration of empirical information to ensure that new insights were made with regards to rabies maintenance in the host population and tested alternative hypotheses regarding the pre-transmission season. In addition, this provided us with a starting point to develop a model for our next study.
