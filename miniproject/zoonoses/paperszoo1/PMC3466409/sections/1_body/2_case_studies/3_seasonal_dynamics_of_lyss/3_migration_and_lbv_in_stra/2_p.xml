<p>Using the limited knowledge available on the life cycle of 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> (Mutere 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">1967</xref>) and the dynamics of other bat lyssaviruses (Mondul 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">2003</xref>; Harris 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">2006</xref>), we initiated the project with a simple ecological model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>, Step 1), based on the hypotheses that LBV infection in 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> can be transmitted horizontally within bat populations and results in protective immunity, given the high seroprevalence detected. Given the lack of empirical information on those two hypotheses, the model-design process generated a large number of more specific questions concerning, in particular, the existence of protective maternal antibodies, the duration of immunity and the lethality of infection. The absence of quantitative information on the ecology and demography of the bats meant that demographic studies were also necessary. Thus, over a few years, we iteratively accrued data and parameter estimates through diverse field studies of the host, the pathogen and their environment, combined with a series of demographic and epidemiological mathematical models (
