<p>The role of bats as reservoirs of zoonotic viral infections is increasingly recognised (Calisher 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">2006</xref>). Rabies virus and related lyssaviruses are important pathogens of bat origin (Badrane &amp; Tordo 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2001</xref>); however, mechanisms of persistence of lyssaviruses in populations of bats and the drivers thereof have not been well described. We have recently led two projects investigating the effects of two different seasonal behaviours on bat lyssavirus infection dynamics: hibernation in a temperate bat species and migration in a tropical bat species. In contrast to the previous case study which was a direct illustration of the MGF guidelines, this one shows the synergy that can be gained by combining several threads of research into the MGF framework.
