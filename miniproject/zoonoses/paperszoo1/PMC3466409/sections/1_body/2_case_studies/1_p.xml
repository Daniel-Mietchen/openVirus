<p>The MGF framework represents a flexible and modular set of guidelines for ambitious, long-term research programmes in ecology. In most cases, such programmes will progress through a series of specific research objectives corresponding to subsets of the whole framework. Appreciating from the onset how mathematical models can contribute to those different steps is not an obvious task, but one that requires patience and commitment from all parties involved. As mentioned in the introduction, the MGF framework is not meant as a rigid, one-size-fits-all set of rules, but as a guideline for multidisciplinary integration. To demonstrate how MGF research can be implemented from different premises, we present detailed accounts of this process using two case studies from our own research. Whereas the first case study (plague transmission in prairie dogs, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>) followed steps 1â€“5 quite naturally, the second one (lyssaviruses in bats, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figs 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>) combines two initially independent projects which started at different points along the cycle until it was realised they could complement each other within an MGF approach.
