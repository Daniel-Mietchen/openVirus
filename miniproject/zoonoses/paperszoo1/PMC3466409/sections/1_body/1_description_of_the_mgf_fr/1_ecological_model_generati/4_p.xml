<p>In some cases, the choice of model structure may not be straightforward. For example, most models for the population dynamics of infectious diseases assume that individuals will go through a small number of discrete states during the process of infection, typically: susceptible (uninfected), latent (infected but not infectious), infectious and recovered (often with lifelong protective immunity). Even if the studied infection follows this general progression, individuals may not be unambiguously assigned to a single status (McClintock 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">2010</xref>); for example, it is often impossible to know from a measured antibody titre whether the animal is currently infected or whether it is immune against future infection. Complementary experimental data are often needed to provide this kind of information, and further model refinement may be required to incorporate this biological richness (Charleston 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">2011</xref>). The most relevant level of aggregation of individuals into discrete categories must be discussed carefully, taking into account the accuracy of the measurements available, the complexity of the model and the corresponding statistical methods. If not considered properly, these issues can lead to an ill-posed question, i.e. a situation where the results are of no practical use, as reviewed by Loehle (
