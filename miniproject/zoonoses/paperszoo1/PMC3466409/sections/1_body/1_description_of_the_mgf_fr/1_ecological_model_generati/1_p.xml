<p>Mechanistic models are a formalisation of the hypothesised processes that drive the observed dynamics of a biological system. Some of these processes may be measured in real time in the field (e.g. births), others may be measured in controlled conditions (e.g. duration of infectious period), while others may not be observable (e.g. transmission of infection from individual to individual). The first step of MGF is to integrate the evidence-based, qualitative and quantitative descriptions of these processes into a formal mathematical model that attempts to describe the dynamics of observed variablesâ€”in disease ecology, typically numbers of individuals in different categories (e.g. age, sex, infectious or immunological status). Particularly when limited information is available about the nature of a process, one should consider multiple hypotheses in a strong inference approach (Platt 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">1964</xref>): instead of trying to falsify a single hypothesis, it is often more informative to formulate a comprehensive set of biologically plausible, alternative hypotheses and assess their relative merits to explain available data. For example, the relative importance of multiple routes of transmission (Webb

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">2006</xref>) can be assessed using mechanistic modelling approaches once data have been collected. Although more heuristic methods for hypothesis generation can be used, MGF forces researchers to be extremely specific in detailing their questions of interest and underlying assumptions. This specificity helps to ensure that the data collected will be appropriate for the analyses planned later (
