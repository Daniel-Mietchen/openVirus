<p>Modellers must ensure that the parameters are correctly interpreted. For quantities that can be measured in the field, it is important to check that the mathematical parameters have the same dimension as the measurements. Conversely, when the model includes parameters that cannot be measured directly, the team should try to find practical ways in which the estimates of those parameters, once fitted, can be validated indirectly. For example, in a model for epidemics, the transmission rate in itself is typically of little practical use, but it can be combined with other parameters to form the basic reproductive rate of the epidemic, which has an intuitive interpretation and practical implications. Because the correct interpretation of a parameter depends on the way it is included mathematically in the equations, it is also important to discuss the choice of alternative functions describing key processes in the ecological system considered. Partially specified models (Wood
