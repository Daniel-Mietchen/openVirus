<p>Once a conceptual mechanistic model of the system has been proposed and formalised in diagrams and verbal description, theoreticians translate it into a mechanistic mathematical model, checking the appropriateness of every assumption with the interdisciplinary team. Where existing modelling frameworks do not appear suitable, novel, tailor-made model structures can be designed, or a combination of models may be used for different parts of the system. Designing model structures (i.e. equations describing the temporal or spatiotemporal changes in biological variables) will highlight essential parameters and appropriate methods of estimation: either direct measurement or indirect inference by fitting models to the data. Identification of the parameters in itself guides the experimental and field study design (
