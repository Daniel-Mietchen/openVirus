<p>Once a draft model is constructed, its dynamics must be explored over a wide range of parameter values and alternative assumptions using mathematical analysis and numerical simulations (e.g. Plowright 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">2011</xref>). Patterns that the model can generate, and qualitative features expected in the data (Duke-Sylvester 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2010</xref>) can be identified, such as the existence and stability of equilibrium states, steady or waning oscillations (Hampson 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">2007</xref>) or extinction of either the host or the infectious agent (Lloyd-Smith 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">2005</xref>). As described in the next section, this initial analysis will inform the design of the field study (e.g. how many observations or samples are required to detect hypothesised changes in disease dynamics?), and can highlight flaws in the model (e.g. if it fails to replicate known dynamics, such as oscillations, or predicts an unrealistic prevalence of infection). This ‘feasibility assessment’ stage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>) helps the scientific team identify aspects of the system that are poorly understood and need further empirical study or updates to the model structure.
