<p>Sensitivity analysis is another essential process that helps focus data collection effort on the most important parameters, by determining how changes in parameters affect model output (Blower &amp; Dowlatabadi

From a mathematical viewpoint, sensitivity analysis should explore most of the parameter space. The biological range of some parameters can be quite wide, especially when considering a variety of environmental conditions. In many cases, however, the most relevant biological information results from a more local sensitivity analysis in the parameter space, which can be loosely determined from previous knowledge. Local sensitivity analysis is useful because there is often interdependence in parameter values and sensitivities, and this informed process can help to reduce data collection effort by focusing on the most relevant region of the parameter space. Determining interactions between parameters can also help pre-empt issues with identifiability that may appear at a later stage, by suggesting simplifications in the model. A typical example would be a pair of parameters governing reproduction and mortality in perfectly symmetric ways, which could result in population dynamics affected by the ratio (or the difference) of the two parameters rather than their absolute values: the pair of parameters can then be replaced with a single aggregate parameter.
