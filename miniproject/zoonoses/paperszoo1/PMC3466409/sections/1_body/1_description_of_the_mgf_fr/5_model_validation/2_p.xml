<p>The second step of validation confronts predictions of the model with an independent set of data, i.e. data not used in the fitting procedure. For example, if the same variables have been measured in two different locations that differ in known characteristics, once the model has been fitted to the data from one site, it can be used to predict the observations in the other location by modifying certain parameter values accordingly. Alternatively, where several variables have been measured in a single study, it is possible to fit the model to a subset of variables and then use the model to predict the dynamics of the remaining variables. If successful, this step is strong evidence that some fundamentally important aspects of the system have been captured by the mechanistic model. This allows the researchers to draw conclusions about the causes of observed patterns. Thus, once a valid model is produced, it will help assess the original set of hypotheses. If the model fails this step of validation, it is worth reconsidering alternative models that may have been proposed in the early stages and discarded on the basis of the original fitting procedure. However, as in the previous step of validation, some discrepancies should be expected when confronting model predictions to independent data: again, this should not trigger an automatic rejection of the model, but rather encourage a critical assessment of its assumptions through discussion between modellers and empirical biologists. In particular, the magnitude of the discrepancies that can be accepted should be informed by the biology of the system, by potential uncertainties introduced by data collection procedures, and by the type of model-generated predictions sought. This step of validation can result in modifications of the model as well as additional experiments; these iterative improvements are at the core of the MGF philosophy.</p>
