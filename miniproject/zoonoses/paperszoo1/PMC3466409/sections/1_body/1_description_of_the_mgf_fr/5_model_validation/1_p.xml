<p>The first step of validation is the assessment of the ‘goodness of fit’ of the model(s). Even though model fitting procedures aim to minimise the difference between observations and model prediction and to select the best-supported model, substantial discrepancies may remain. Statistical tests can be used to assess whether the remaining differences (or residuals) between the fitted model and the actual data may be attributed to random noise. However, such tests must be interpreted with caution: statistical support does not guarantee that the model assumptions are correct; conversely, a statistically significant discrepancy should not necessarily lead to a rejection of the mechanistic model as a whole. The value of any model lies in its ability to improve our understanding of specific processes, which does not necessarily require a perfect match to all the mechanisms of the real system. Therefore, a subjective assessment of model dynamics, informed by biological knowledge, remains important—this is another ‘reality check’ at the core of the MGF process (
