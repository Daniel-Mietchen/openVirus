<p>By submitting fitted models to detailed scrutiny, the scientific team should aim to identify any remaining discrepancies and issues, leading to further iterations of model improvement and data collection. Components of the models that failed the validation tests can be more informative than those that passed, which echoes the 1911 quote cited in the opening of this study. Indeed, a key aspect of MGF is that the model is not an end point. As in a strong inference perspective (Platt
