<p>Lastly, a third component of model validation is an assessment of the relative importance of the model parameters. There are two relatively common approaches for this. The first one uses an information criterion framework that penalises the explanatory power of models by their complexity (number of parameters), as described in step 4 above for model selection. Once the best model has been identified, it may still be possible to simplify it further, e.g. by setting the values of some parameters to zero and assessing the effect on the information criterion. The second approach is to use sensitivity analysis on a single validated model to determine the relative importance of different processes incorporated in that single model. In this approach, parameters are associated with particular processes of interest (e.g. transmission pathways). Parameters that strongly affect the behaviour of models (i.e. which have high sensitivity) are associated with relatively important processes.</p>
