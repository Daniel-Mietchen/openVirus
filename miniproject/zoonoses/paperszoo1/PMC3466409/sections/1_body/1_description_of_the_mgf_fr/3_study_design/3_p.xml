<p>Furthermore, modelling exercises can suggest additional measurements that had been overlooked. Rohani

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">2009</xref>) demonstrated theoretically that environmental transmission could play a more significant role than previously acknowledged during outbreaks of avian influenza, which should encourage measurements for the presence of influenza viruses in the environment. In another example, Plowright 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">2011</xref>) developed a metapopulation model to simulate the dynamics of Hendra virus within fruit bat populations, thus providing a mechanistic explanation of increasing spillover from fruit bats into domestic horses in Australia. The inclusion of waning maternal immunity in the model improved the temporal match of simulated outbreaks to the observed ones. Although the presence of maternally derived antibody (MDA) has been reported, measurement of waning immunity itself in wild animals may not be feasible; instead experimental studies on captive bats could be carried out to test the hypothesis that MDA is protective and to derive empirical estimates of the rate of MDA decline.
