<p>Whether using Bayesian or frequentist statistical models, a constant dialogue must be maintained between all parties involved. Indeed, the fitting process must be informed by the biologists to ensure the data are correctly interpreted and meaningfully analysed. It is not uncommon that data collection differs in various degrees from the initial plans because of logistical issues or unexpected field conditions. This may require a reassessment of the fitting procedures to account for missing data. It also is essential to submit every output from data analysis to a reality check by the field biologists: for example, unrealistic parameter estimates might reveal flaws in models, guiding the selection of alternative models or the revision of unsuitable assumptions. As a result, it is not unusual for the process of fitting models to data to take several months to complete. The numerical algorithms involved are often very complex, with risk of human error, and can take several days to run, even on modern computers.</p>
