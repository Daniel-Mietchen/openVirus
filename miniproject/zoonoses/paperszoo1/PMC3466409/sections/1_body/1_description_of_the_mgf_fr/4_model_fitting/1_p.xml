<p>A crucial step of MGF comes when the model has been designed and the data have been collected: matching the two together with the help of statistical modelling. The first objective is usually to estimate the value of model parameters that were not known at the time of model construction. In the case where alternative hypotheses have been incorporated into different models, an additional objective is to assess which hypothesis provides the ‘best fit’ of the model to the data. What is meant by ‘best fit’ is an essential question that needs to be addressed by all the parties involved, biologists, modellers and statisticians, even before the data have been collected. Although a number of methods for curve fitting, such as smoothing, least squares or non-linear forecasting, have been traditionally employed for ecological time series (Kendall

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">1999</xref>), they tend to consider the sources of error and variability as black boxes. In contrast, likelihood-based models can incorporate specific error-generating mechanisms (e.g. demographic stochasticity, sampling methods, imperfect assays), and therefore generate more reliable predictions (Clark &amp; Bjørnstad 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2004</xref>). Combined with information criteria (such as Akaike's Information Criterion), they also allow multiple model comparison and weighting (Burnham &amp; Anderson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">2001</xref>). Likelihood-based methods allow the computation of confidence intervals on parameter estimates, providing evidence to compare the relative importance of the mechanisms considered.
