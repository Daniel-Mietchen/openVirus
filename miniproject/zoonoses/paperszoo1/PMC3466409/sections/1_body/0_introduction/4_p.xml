<p>In this study, we emphasise the benefits of integrating mathematical and statistical models with empirical and experimental approaches at all stages of a research project, with the first iteration preceding data collection. This not only improves hypothesis generation and study design but also increases the quantity and quality of information gained from empirical studies. To this aim, we present a practical framework called model-guided fieldwork (MGF), which demands a rational dialogue between researchers from multiple disciplines through a series of iterative steps, ultimately leading to improved causal inference and predictive power. While the vast majority of ecologists are aware of the usefulness of mathematical models, a lack of interdisciplinary expertise within research teams all too often prevents models from being used to their full potential. We aim to provide guidelines for ‘good practice’ in multidisciplinary ecological research, largely inspired by our own experience in wildlife disease ecology.</p>
