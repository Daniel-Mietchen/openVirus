<p>In the MGF framework, biologists and modellers collaborate at all stages of the study, from initial model formulation and field study design, to data collection and analysis. The MGF approach recognises that there is often uncertainty in system structure and drivers, and utilises 
 <italic>a priori</italic> mechanistic models to ensure field efforts can address this uncertainty. A key strength of the MGF approach is the planned iterative refinement of fieldwork, laboratory experiments and modelling throughout the project, ensuring empirical studies are more focused and models are data driven and appropriate to the specific system. Compared to after-the-fact modelling approaches, MGF helps to focus field studies on the most important structures and drivers of dynamics. Furthermore, the necessary continuous dialogue between collaborators throughout the project lifespan fosters a multidisciplinary, multidirectional flow of information (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref> as a strategic master plan that may unfold over several years, and which would be broken down into a number of smaller studies. However, it would be misleading to consider the large multidirectional framework as the mere juxtaposition of separate unidirectional studies. In the MGF programme, modellers and biologists are involved in all steps, creating feedback loops that are missing from too many studies.
