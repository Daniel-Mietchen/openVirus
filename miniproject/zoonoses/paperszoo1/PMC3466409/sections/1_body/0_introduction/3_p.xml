<p>What can we learn from retrospective studies to improve the flow of exchange between empirical and theoretical methods at the onset of a new programme of field-based research? This question is particularly topical in infectious disease ecology. Indeed, beyond the academic motivation of integrating pathogens into ecological frameworks (Lafferty 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">2008</xref>), wildlife infections have recently received a surge of attention in broader scientific and political communities because of the various threats they pose at the global level (Daszak 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">2000</xref>): to the conservation of the species affected (Blaustein &amp; Kiesecker 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">2002</xref>; Haydon 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">2006</xref>; Frick 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">2010</xref>); to ecosystem stability (Rizzo &amp; Garbelotto 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">2003</xref>); to the viability and trade of livestock infected from wildlife reservoirs (Siembieda 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">2011</xref>) and to public health in human populations affected by zoonotic diseases (Kuiken 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">2005</xref>). From a scientific point of view, infectious diseases in wildlife are particularly challenging ecological systems because their dynamics are determined by processes operating at multiple scales (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), and because of practical difficulties with data collection in populations that are often difficult to observe or sample. Understanding these key processes requires input from many disciplines, using multiple methodologies and analysing diverse datasets to triangulate the causal drivers of disease dynamics (Plowright 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
