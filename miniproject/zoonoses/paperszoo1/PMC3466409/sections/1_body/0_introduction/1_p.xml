<p>Concluding a report on the controversy surrounding Ross and Waite's pioneering mathematical models for malaria transmission, the British Medical Journal pointed out, in 1911, ‘the paradox that quantitative work based on false postulates may, by stimulating biologists and field workers to a closer scrutiny of the facts, sometimes lead more certainly to the discovery of the truth, than non-quantitative investigations resting on impeccable foundations’. A hundred years later, and despite the ubiquity of mathematical models in all fields of life sciences, the statement retains remarkable pertinence. By describing mathematically the unobserved mechanisms hypothesised to be causing biological phenomena (e.g. the boom-and-bust nature of epidemics or the cyclical fluctuations of animal populations) in a Newtonian fashion, Ross and other early modellers finally brought life sciences on a par with physical sciences. Mechanistic models have come to form the backbone of modern teaching and research in ecology. The mainstream use of mathematical models in ecology, sometimes referred to as strategic modelling (Gurney &amp; Nisbet 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">1998</xref>), aims to formulate simple descriptions of universal drivers of population dynamics. Over the last century, this approach has provided useful insight into general principles of ecology and has helped ecologists generate testable hypotheses. However, it is not always clear to scientists working on a particular system what added value such generic models can bring. This stems from the conceptual, technical and, at times, cultural difficulties faced when trying to match models with empirical information, as experienced by anyone working at the interface of theoretical and empirical research.
