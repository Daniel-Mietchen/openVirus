<p>Below we describe the MGF framework in detail, emphasising the practical contributions that modellers can make to the conception, design, implementation and analysis of field studies. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>, the five key stages presented here should not be seen as a linear process, but as steps on a cycle of interactions that can be initiated from any point and reiterated multiple times. We then present two case studies illustrating different components of the MGF framework. Finally, the discussion summarises the scientific benefits of the approach and casts light on the inner workings and the challenges faced when breaking barriers between traditional disciplines. The level of involvement required from all parties goes against the high level of specialisation prevalent in science; we provide some suggestions about planning and organisation in a multidisciplinary context, with insight from social sciences.
