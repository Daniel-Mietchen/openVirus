 <caption>
  <p>Schematic diagram of our model-guided fieldwork framework, emphasising feedback loops between empiricists and modellers. Numbers refer to the five key steps described in the text; however, it is possible to initiate the collaborative cycle at any stage. Dark grey boxes represent tasks led by modellers, light grey rounded boxes tasks led by biologists and a gradient indicates shared responsibility (online version in colour: blue for modellers’ tasks, green for biologists’ tasks).</p>
