<p>The zoonotic West Nile virus (WNV), which belongs to the 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus (family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>), circulates in natural transmission cycles involving avian hosts and ornithophilic mosquito 
 <italic>Culex</italic> ssp, whereas horses and humans are regarded as dead-end hosts

 <xref rid="pone.0047666-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Arthropod-borne WNV can infect the central nervous system (CNS) of various host species and neurological disease is a grave, albeit infrequent, complication of WNV infection 
 <xref rid="pone.0047666-Samuel1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Once inside the CNS, WNV infects neurons and gives rise to severe immunopathology. Although asymptomatic in the majority of cases, WNV infection has been associated with severe meningo-encephalitis and acute flaccid paralysis in humans.
