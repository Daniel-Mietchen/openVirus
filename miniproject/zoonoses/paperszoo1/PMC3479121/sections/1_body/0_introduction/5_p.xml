We report here that WNV strain IS-98-ST1 recovered from an infectious cDNA clone reproduces the pathobiological properties of the parental strain, and is thus well-suited for studying the virulence of WNV isolates from Europe/West Asia. Also, the pathobiology of the novel WNV infectious clone and other WNV strains was examined in embryonated chicken eggs. The capacity of different WNV strains to replicate in eggs closely paralleled their growth properties in mice, suggesting that inoculation of embryonated chicken eggs could provide a practical
