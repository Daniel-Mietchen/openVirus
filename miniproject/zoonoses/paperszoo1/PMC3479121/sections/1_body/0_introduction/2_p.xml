<p>WNV contains a positive single-stranded RNA genome of about 11,000 nucleotides comprising a single open reading frame flanked by two untranslated regions (UTRs) at the 5′ and 3′ ends. Genomic RNA codes for a single and long polyprotein which is co- and post-translationally cleaved by cellular and viral proteases. There are three structural proteins (C, prM/M and E) followed by seven nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5)

 <xref rid="pone.0047666-Melian1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Structural proteins provide the structural elements of viral particles, while nonstructural proteins play a role in viral replication, virion assembly, and evasion of host antiviral immune responses
