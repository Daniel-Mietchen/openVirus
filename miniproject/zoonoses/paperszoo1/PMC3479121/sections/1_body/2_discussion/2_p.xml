<p>A G3401A mutation was identified in the NS1 coding region in the WNV-IC plasmid, as well as plasmid B, that changed a UGG (Trp) codon into a UAG stop codon. When it appeared during cloning, the fragment encoding the 3′ end of the NS1 open reading frame (ORF) could be stably inserted in frame of the fragment coding the 5′ end, thus reconstituting the complete NS1 ORF. Moreover, repeated efforts to correct the stop mutation by site-directed mutagenesis failed, even though parallel mutagenesis of other areas of the IC plasmid succeeded. This suggests that this change might stabilize the recombinant plasmid by neutralizing the leaky expression of NS1 in

Nevertheless, we observed that the stop codon is spontaneously corrected at an early time point after RNA transfection and that viral genomes recovered from newly formed viral particles carried the fully corrected gene. Thus, the molecular clone described in the present study supports efficient generation of viral particles bearing the fully intact genome of the parental virus. It is interesting to note that a nonsense mutation was observed in the NS1 ORF at a nearby position (C3342A) in a plasmid bearing an IC derived from the NY99 isolate

 <xref rid="pone.0047666-Kinney1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> hypothesized that a T7 polymerase transcription error had substituted the correct nucleotide. As such a reversion was observed twice in our hands and four times by others, we suggest that a more complex molecular mechanism may account for this event, such as translational stop codon readthroughs that have been described for viral genomes, for RNA viruses in particular
