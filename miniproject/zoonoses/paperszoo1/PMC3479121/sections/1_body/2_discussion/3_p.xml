<p>Crucially, the replicative and pathogenic properties of parental and recombinant viruses were indistinguishable in murine and avian 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> models. Thus, the recombinant virus may be used to identify molecular determinants of virulence. Embryonated chicken eggs constitute a convenient

 <xref rid="pone.0047666-Crespo1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In the present study, we show for the first time that chicken embryos can be used as an avian model to compare the virulence of WNV strains. The differences in the replication rate between Kunjin (attenuated strain) and IS-98-ST1 (highly virulent) parental or WNV-IC virus were observed here in the context of the embryonic avian immune system
