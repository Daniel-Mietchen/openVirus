<p>To exclude the possibility that recovery of virus from transfected cells resulted from contamination by the parental virus, we tested the presence of the 
 <italic>SnaB</italic>I restriction site in RT-PCR products amplified from the virus produced in the transfected Vero cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047666-g002">Fig. 2</xref> (b)). The parental virus genomic cDNA was not digested by 
 <italic>SnaBI</italic>. In contrast, the IC virus PCR product generated fragments of 812 bp and 386 bp following 
 <italic>SnaB</italic>I digestion, indicating that the virus recovered from the transfected cells was derived from infectious full-length RNA from the WNV-IC plasmid.
