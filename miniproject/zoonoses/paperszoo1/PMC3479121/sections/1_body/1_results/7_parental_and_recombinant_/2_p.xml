<p>We chose to focus our analysis on the brain and the heart. Mortality and viral load in these tissues were monitored in groups of 6 eggs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047666-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). The WNV strain Kunjin served as a low pathogenic control 
 <xref rid="pone.0047666-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. A delay in mortality was observed in eggs infected with the Kunjin strain, with death occurring between days 4 and 7. When eggs were infected with either the parental strain or the IC virus, death was massive at day 4. The mortality rate was not significantly different in eggs inoculated with the WNV parental or the IC virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047666-g009">Fig. 9</xref> (a)). We measured the viral load in the brain and heart at day 4 p.i. The viral load in these tissues was not significantly different in the eggs infected with the parental strain or its cognate IC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047666-g009">Fig. 9</xref> (b)). By contrast, the viral load was significantly lower in the eggs infected with Kunjin strain. Interestingly, similar macroscopic lesions appeared on the skin (petechia) and hemorrhages were observed in the brain, heart, kidneys and liver at the time of death for all viruses tested. Altogether these data show that the virulence of WNV parental and IC virus was indistinguishable in this avian model.
