<p>Birds are the principal amplifying hosts for WNV. Previous studies have shown that American crows and chicken embryos are susceptible to WNV infection

 <xref rid="pone.0047666-Crespo1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, WNV was recovered from embryonated chicken eggs after inoculation with organ extracts from wild birds. Here, we evaluated the embryonated chicken model as a practical avian-based system to compare the virulence of WNV strains. To test the susceptibility of chicken embryos to infection, eggs (N = 6) were inoculated intravascularly with 0.1, 1, 10 or 100 PFU of the WNV IS-98-ST1 parental strain. The mortality was monitored for 7 days. Similar curves were obtained for the infectious doses of 1, 10 and 100 PFU, with 100% of embryos dying between day 4 and 5 p.i (

The 1 PFU dose (ten-fold the fifty percent lethal dose [LD50]) was chosen for the following experiments. The brain, heart, lung, liver, intestine and kidney are targets for WNV in birds
