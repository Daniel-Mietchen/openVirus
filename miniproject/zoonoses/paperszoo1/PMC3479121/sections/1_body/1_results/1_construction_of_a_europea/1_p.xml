<p>WNV strain IS-98-ST1 is a highly pathogenic isolate originating from a sick stork during the 1998 epidemic in Israel 
 <xref rid="pone.0047666-Malkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Its ssRNA+ genome was amplified into four pieces for generating the infectious clone construct. After RT-PCR amplification of viral RNA genome, each of the four amplicons was subcloned in pCR2.1, a high-copy vector used for the cloning of RT-PCR products. Propagation of bacteria at room temperature allowed maintenance of intact inserts in pCR2.1. Difficulties in the sequential insertion of each fragment in pBR322 led us to devise an alternative two plasmid strategy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047666-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Fragment 1 (nt 120–2559) was inserted in pBR322 and transferred along with the SP6 promoter upstream of fragment 2 (nt 2560–5781) to pCR2.1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047666-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). This construction will be referred to as plasmid A. Fragment 4 (nt 8023–10473) and then fragment 3 (nt 5782–8022) were inserted into pBR322. A 1740 bp sequence at the 3′ end of fragment 2 was inserted upstream of fragments 3 and 4 within pBR322. This construction will be referred to as plasmid B. The sequence encompassing fragment 2 to fragment 4 was excised from plasmid B, and inserted downstream of fragments 1 and 2 in plasmid A. A 
 <italic>SnaB</italic>I restriction endonuclease site was introduced into the NS4A gene within fragment 3 and further used as a genetic marker. The resulting plasmid was introduced in 
 <italic>E.coli</italic> DH5α strain. It carries the full-length cDNA from WNV IS-98-ST1 in a single plasmid and was designated WNV-infectious clone (IC) cDNA. The stability of the clone was evaluated by propagating the DH5α 
 <italic>E.coli</italic> hosting the full-length IC cDNA plasmid for six continuous passages as described in the paper published by Shi 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="pone.0047666-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Resulting plasmids were digested with 
 <italic>AvaI</italic>, and displayed the same digestion pattern (data not shown).
