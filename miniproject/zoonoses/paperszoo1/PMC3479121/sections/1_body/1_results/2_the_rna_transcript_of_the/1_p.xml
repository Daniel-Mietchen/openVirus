 <italic>In vitro</italic> transcription of WNV-IC cDNA generated a transcript of ∼ 11,000 nt. Transcripts were used to electroporate Vero cells. Vero supernatants were harvested at day 2 post-infection (p.i) in order to minimize emergence of quasi-species and used to infect new Vero cells (P1). Viral titers in supernatant obtained for P1 reached 7×10
 <sup>7</sup> Plaque Forming Unit (PFU)/ml. The parental virus was used as a positive control in the titration experiments. A similar plaque morphology was observed for parental and IC viruses (
