<p>To test the viral replication rate, Vero cells were infected with WNV parental or IC virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047666-g002">Fig. 2</xref> (c)). At 48 h post-infection (p.i.), CPE was observed in Vero cells infected with either virus. Viral RNA amounts were higher during the first 24 hours. However, at later stages, 48 h and 72 h p.i., viral RNA amounts decreased due to increasing cell death (data not shown). Infectious virus recovered from cell supernatants noticeably increased in the first 24 h p.i. and peaked at 48 h p.i (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047666-g002">Fig. 2(c)</xref>). Growth curves exhibited no significant difference between the WNV parental and IC viruses. Therefore, the two viruses were indistinguishable with regard to replication in mammalian cells.
