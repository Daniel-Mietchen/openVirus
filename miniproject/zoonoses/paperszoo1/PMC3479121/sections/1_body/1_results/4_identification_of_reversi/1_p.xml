<p>Every intermediary construct and the final IC plasmid were entirely sequenced. A G3401A mutation was identified in the WNV-IC plasmid that changed a UGG (Trp) codon into a UAG stop codon within the NS1 coding region. This mutation must have been positively selected during plasmid amplification in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. Nevertheless, and surprisingly, the mutation was absent from the recovered WNV genome. That is, the sequence of packaged RNA genomes was identical to the expected IS-98-ST1 genomic sequence. To test whether the recovery of infectious RNAs was due to recombination with wild-type virus, a truncated transcript was designed that did not encompass the region bearing the restriction endonuclease site 
 <italic>SnaB</italic>I in the corresponding cDNA. This truncated transcript was used to transfect Vero cells. A cytopathic effect (CPE) was seen 3 days after transfection in cells transfected with the full-length WNV-IC RNA transcript. In contrast, no CPE was observed up to 7 days post-transfection with the truncated transcript. In addition, quantitative RT-PCR on total RNA extracted 7 days post-transfection with primers specific for the 3â€²NC region detected no truncated viral RNA (data not shown). Therefore, infectious particles recovered from the transfection of Vero cells with WNV-IC transcripts were not the product of a recombination event.
