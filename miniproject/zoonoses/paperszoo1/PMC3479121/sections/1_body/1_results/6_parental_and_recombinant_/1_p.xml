<p>Conventional laboratory mice develop encephalitis and die after inoculation by the peripheral route 
 <xref rid="pone.0047666-Mashimo1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. To compare the virulence of the WNV parental and IC viruses, adult BALB/cJ mice were inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 1, 10, 100 or 1000 PFU. No control mice died consecutive to PBS injection. The survival curves did not differ significantly at each dose of infection for parental and IC viruses with death occurring between days 7 and 13â€“15 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047666-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). These data agree with previous reports

 <xref rid="pone.0047666-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. We measured the viremia at day 3 p.i. and the viral load in the brain at time of death. There was no significant difference in the viremia at day 3 p.i and in the viral load in the brain (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047666-g005">5</xref>). The 
 <italic>SnaB</italic>I endonuclease restriction site was present in the cDNA of the WNV-IC virus recovered from infected mice, thus confirming that the mice were indeed infected with the recombinant virus (data not shown). In addition, inflammatory lesions were observed in the brain, within the meninges. They were characterized by diffuse lymphocytic or lymphoplasmocytic infiltrates, typical of lymphocytic meningitis, while some lymphocytic perivascular cuffs were also visible in the brain parenchyma, revealing encephalitis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047666-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). No lesions were observed in PBS-treated mice. Thus, the virulence of WNV parental and IC viruses was indistinguishable in susceptible BALB/cJ mice.
