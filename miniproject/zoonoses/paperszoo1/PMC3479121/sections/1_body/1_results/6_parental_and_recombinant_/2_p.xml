<p>To exclude the possibility that the susceptibility of BALB/c mice may have concealed differences in the virulence of the parental and cloned virus, we examined whether the WNV parental and IC viruses were equally avirulent in resistant inbred strains of mice. Indeed, Mashimo 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="pone.0047666-Mashimo1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> established that susceptibility of BALB/c mice to infection with WNV strain IS-98-ST1 correlates with a premature stop codon within exon 4 of the oligoadenylate synthetase 1b (
 <italic>Oas1b</italic>) gene. Mice expressing a full-length OAS1B protein are resistant to infection with WNV strain IS-98-ST1

 <xref rid="pone.0047666-SimonChazotte1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. To test the virulence of WNV parental and IC viruses in resistant hosts, we took advantage of MBT/Pas and C.MBT-
 <italic>Oas1b</italic> mice. MBT/Pas mice derive from 
 <italic>Mus m. musculus</italic> progenitors; they carry a wild-type allele at the 
 <italic>Oas1b</italic> locus. C.MBT-
 <italic>Oas1b</italic> mice carry the 
 <italic>Oas</italic> gene cluster of the MBT/Pas mice within a BALB/c genetic background. MBT/Pas and C.MBT-
 <italic>Oas1b</italic> express a full-length OAS1B protein and are resistant to infection with WNV 
 <xref rid="pone.0047666-SimonChazotte1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. MBT/Pas, C.MBT-
 <italic>Oas1b</italic> and BALB/c mice were inoculated with 1000 PFU of WNV parental or IC virus. All BALB/c mice died within 9 days p.i. In contrast, all MBT and C.MBT-
 <italic>Oas1b</italic> mice survived the infection (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047666-g007">Fig. 7</xref> (b) shows that viral RNA was detected in the blood of all infected mice. Viral RNA levels were not significantly different in mice infected with either the WNV parental or IC virus. However, viral RNA levels were significantly higher in susceptible BALB/c mice than in resistant MBT/Pas and C.MBT-
 <italic>Oas1b</italic> mice. Interestingly, viral RNA levels were significantly lower in MBT/Pas mice than in C.MBT-
 <italic>Oas1b</italic> mice, indicating that viral replication is lower in MBT/Pas mice than in C.MBT-
 <italic>Oas1b</italic> mice during the first days p.i. This suggests that MBT/Pas mice might carry resistance alleles that are not present in the C.MBT-
 <italic>Oas1b</italic> congenic mice.
