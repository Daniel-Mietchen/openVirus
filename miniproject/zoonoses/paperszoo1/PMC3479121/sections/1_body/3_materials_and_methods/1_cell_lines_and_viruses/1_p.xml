<p>Vero cells, ATCC® CCL-81, were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (D-MEM, Gibco) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Lonza), and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. 1 U/ml of penicillin and 1 µg/ml of streptomycin were added to all media (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained in CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubators (5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>) at 37°C. The Israeli isolate IS-98-ST1 of WNV has been described elsewhere 
 <xref rid="pone.0047666-Malkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Briefly, IS-98-ST1 was isolated from the cerebellum of a stork in Israel in 1998 on Vero cells and the recovered virus was used to infect mosquito AP61 cells. A third-passage stock of IS-98-ST1 on AP61 cells was used in the following experiments. WNV Kunjin virus (KUN) was provided by the National Reference Center for Arboviruses at the Pasteur Institute, Paris.
