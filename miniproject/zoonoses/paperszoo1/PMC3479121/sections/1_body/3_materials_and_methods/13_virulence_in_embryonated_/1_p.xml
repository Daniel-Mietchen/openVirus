<p>10-day-old pathogen-free chicken eggs (INRA, Jouy-en-Josas, France) were inoculated by the intravascular route. Eggs were inoculated with diluent alone (PBS, endotoxin free, pH 7.4 supplemented with 1 U/ml of penicillin and 1 µg/ml of streptomycin) or with either Kunjin, IS-98-ST1 parental or IC viruses. The eggs were incubated at 37°C and were observed regularly for up to 8 days. Viral RNA was analysed in the brain, heart, lungs, liver, intestines and kidneys after extraction using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen), and amplified by quantitative RT-PCR as described above.</p>
