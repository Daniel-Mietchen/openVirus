<p>An 
 <italic>SnaBI</italic> restriction site was inserted into the cDNA using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) as a silent genetic marker in order to distinguish recombinant progeny virus from the corresponding parental virus, by substitution of an A for a T at position 6555 in the viral cDNA. RNA was extracted from recombinant virus harvested from supernatant on day 3 post-transfection and parental virus by using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). A 1198 bp fragment including the genetic marker was amplified by RT-PCR from RNA extracted from either recombinant or parental virus with primers 5743F 
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′- CGT GCT GGA AAG AAA GTA GTC-3′</named-content> and 6941R 5′- CTG CTT ATG TCA CTC TTG GTC TTA TC-3′. The RT-PCR products were purified using the QIAQuick PCR purification protocol (Qiagen), and then digested with 
 <italic>SnaBI</italic> and analyzed by electrophoretic migration on a 1% agarose gel. When the 
 <italic>SnaBI</italic> restriction site is present, digestion of the PCR product generates fragments of 812 and 386 bp.
