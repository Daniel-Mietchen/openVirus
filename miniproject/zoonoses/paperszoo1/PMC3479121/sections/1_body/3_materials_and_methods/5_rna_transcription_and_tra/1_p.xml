<p>Plasmid WNV-IC, containing the full-length cDNA of WNV flanked by the Sp6 promoter and Hepatitis δ virus (HDV) ribozyme, was amplified in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α and purified with the Miniprep kit (Qiagen). For 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription, 1 µg of WNV-IC plasmid was linearized with 
 <italic>BamHI</italic>. The digestion reaction mix was purified with the QIAQuick purification Kit and the linearized plasmid was quantified by spectrophotometry. The Sp6 MEGAscript High yield transcription kit (Ambion) was used to 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribe 1 µg of DNA in a 20 µl reaction mixture in the presence of 4 mM Cap Analog (New England Biolabs). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 4 h, followed by the addition of DNase I for 45 min at 37°C to remove the DNA template. RNA was stored at –80°C.
