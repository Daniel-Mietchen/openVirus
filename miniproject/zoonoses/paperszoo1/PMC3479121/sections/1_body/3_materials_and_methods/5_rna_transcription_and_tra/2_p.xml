<p>For transfection, the 20 µl (∼ 20 µg) RNA transcript mix was used to electroporate 6×10
 <sup>6</sup> Vero cells resuspended in 0.4 ml cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, in 0.4 cm cuvettes with the GenePulser apparatus (Bio-Rad); the following settings were applied: 4 pulses of 0.29 kV and 25 µF at 4s intervals. After a 10 min recovery, cells were mixed with D-MEM supplemented with 2% FBS and incubated in a T-25 flask (5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37°C) until a cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed (referred to as passage 0, P0). A 1 ml aliquot of P0 tissue culture supernatant at day 2 was used to infect a new flask of Vero cells (referred to as passage 1, P1) and incubated until a CPE was observed. Virus was harvested as tissue culture supernatant, clarified by centrifugation at 600 g for 5 min, stored in aliquots at −80°C, and designated as infectious clone derived virus (IC virus).
