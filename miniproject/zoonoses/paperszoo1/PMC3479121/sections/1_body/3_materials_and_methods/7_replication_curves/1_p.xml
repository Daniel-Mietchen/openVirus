<p>Subconfluent Vero cells seeded in 12-well plates were inoculated with either parental or WNV-IC derived virus diluted in D-MEM at an MOI of 1 in quintuplet wells. Following incubation for 1 h 30 min in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37°C, viral inoculum was removed. Monolayers were washed twice with fresh D-MEM, and 1 ml of complete D-MEM was added to each well. The plates were incubated for up to 3 days in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37°C. At 10, 24, 48, and 72 h time points, medium was removed. At the indicated time post-infection, culture supernatants were collected and viral titers were determined by plaque assay on Vero cells.
