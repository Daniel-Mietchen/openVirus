<p>Vero cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 to 10 with parental IS-98-ST1 WNV, and virus was harvested from cell culture media at 72 h postinfection. Genomic RNA was extracted with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). cDNA fragments covering the complete viral coding genome were reverse transcribed from genomic RNA by using Superscript III (Invitrogen) followed by PCR with Phusion Taq polymerase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. In particular, four genomic fragments were amplified using primers 95F 5′-CGA TGT CTA AGA AAC CAG GAG- 3′, 2585R 5′-GTG GCG TTT CAG GGT AAT AC- 3′ for fragment 1, 2539F 5′-GAT GTG GAG GCT TGG ATG GAC- 3′, 5804R 
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′-CAT TTT GGG TAC TCC GTC TCG-3′</named-content> for fragment 2, 5743F 
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′-CGT GCT GGA AAG AAA GTA GTC-3′</named-content>, 8082R 
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′-GTA GAA CAC ATC CAC TCC ACTC-3′</named-content> for fragment 3, 7975F 5′-GAA GTC AGA GGG TAC ACA AAG G-3′, 10552R 
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′-CAG CAC CGT CTA CTC AAC TTC-3′</named-content> for fragment 4. They were first subcloned into the pCR2.1 plasmid and then cloned into pBR322 following enzymatic digestions using standard procedures
