 <sup>5</sup> Vero cells were seeded into each well of a 6-well plate and infected with parental virus or infectious clone for 1 h 30 min at 37°C. The cells were overlaid with 2% seaplaque agarose (Lonza) in MEM (Gibco) containing 5% FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum), 1% sodium pyruvate, 1 U/ml of penicillin and 1 µg/ml of streptomycin. 72 h post-infection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.4% crystal violet for 24 h in a humid chamber at 37°C.
