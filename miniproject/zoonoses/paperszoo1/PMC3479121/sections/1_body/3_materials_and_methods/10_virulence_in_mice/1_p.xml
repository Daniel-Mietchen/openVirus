<p>Mice were housed in an environmentally controlled room under biosafety level 3 conditions and were given food and water 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Female outbred BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories, Lâ€™Arbresle, France) and MBT/Pas and C.MBT-
 <italic>Oas1b</italic> mice provided by Jean-Jacques Panthier (Pasteur Institute, Paris) were obtained at 5 weeks of age and were acclimatized for 1 week. All mice were 6 weeks of age at the start of the experiment. 5 mice per group were inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with diluent alone (PBS, endotoxin free, pH 7.4) or with 1, 10, 100 or 1000 PFU of parental virus or infectious clones thereof. Mice were evaluated clinically for 2 weeks. Observed clinical signs included ruffled fur, paresis, hind leg paralysis and tremors. Blood was collected in EDTA at day 3 post-infection (p.i), and the presence of viral RNA was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR 
 <xref rid="pone.0047666-Wicker1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> after RNA extraction with the QIAamp viral kit (Qiagen). Brains were recovered from mice shortly after their death, and the presence of virus was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR after RNA extraction with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Control mice were euthanized at day 15 and checked for absence of virus in their brains.
