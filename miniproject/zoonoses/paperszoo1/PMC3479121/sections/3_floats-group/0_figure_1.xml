  <title>Schematic representation of the cloning strategy.</title>
  <p>The flavivirus genome is represented approximately to scale. Unique or rare restriction sites used for cloning and their location (numbering based on the sequence from Genbank no. AF481864) are shown at the top. Four cDNA fragments represented by thick lines were synthesized from IS-98-ST1 viral genomic RNA by RT-PCR to cover the complete coding WNV genome. The cDNA fragments were first cloned into the pCR2.1 plasmid, and then digested using unique restrictions sites and subcloned into the destination plasmid. The full length infectious clone was obtained by the extraction of fragment 2+3+4 from plasmid B after an enzymatic digestion with 
   <italic>XmaI</italic> and 
   <italic>BamHI</italic> followed by its insertion into plasmid A downstream of fragment 1+2. One silent mutation (shown in lower case) was engineered in the pCR2.1+ fragment 3 plasmid to create a 
   <italic>SnaBI</italic> site.
