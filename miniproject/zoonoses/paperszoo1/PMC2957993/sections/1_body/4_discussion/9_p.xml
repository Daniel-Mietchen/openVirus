<p>The exact duration and extent of the epidemic(s) will never be known, but our suggestion offers an alternative explanation. Persistent leptospiral exposures resulted in more severe cases of Weil syndrome and jaundice, a sign that would have been reported by observers; the cause of death from other (anicteric) leptospiral infection would not have been recognized. Our proposal is consistent with the historical clinical descriptions, estimated death rates, importation and distribution of its reservoir host, inoculation of the agent in multiple suitable nidalities, spread to other mammalian reservoirs, hyperendemicity, ecologic factors favoring repeated exposure and transmission, and known high-risk activities of the indigenous population.</p>
