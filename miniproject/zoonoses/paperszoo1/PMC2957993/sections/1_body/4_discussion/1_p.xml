<p>The causes of most historical epidemics may never be proven. The new science of paleomicrobiology may provide some answers, but the question will remain about whether a person died of a specific disease or with the disease. However, even when proper evidence is limited, this limitation should not dissuade speculation about the causes of ancient afflictions. Our hypothesis is not meant to be a definite answer but a heuristic for others to criticize and explore. Alfred Crosby, one of America’s foremost medical historians, coined the term “virgin soil epidemics” to describe immunologically unexposed populations exposed to Old World diseases and cited the 1616–1619 epidemic as an example (
