<p>The name Squanto has entered American history and folklore as the one of the last of the Patuxets who assisted the Pilgrims in 1620. He was one of the few survivors of an epidemic that was crucial to the success of the Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies because remaining Indians had little capacity to resist the new settlers. Two years later, after having fever and a nosebleed, Squanto died of what was then referred to as “the Indean disease.”</p>
