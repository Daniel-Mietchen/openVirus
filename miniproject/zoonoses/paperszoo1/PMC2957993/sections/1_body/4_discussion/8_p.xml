<p>Endemicity and subsequent high case-fatality rates, similar to those reported from Japan, are consistent with a leptospiral etiology for the 1616–1619 epidemic. The Patuxets may not have associated sickness with their environment or traditional ways of living and may have attributed their affliction to many causes, but not to countless exposures and reexposures to the agent. Sporadic, focal mini-epidemics may have played out and coalesced into what was construed as a single “plague” by outside observers. Except for more severe cases of liver failure, the most common cause of death for leptospirosis (renal or respiratory insufficiency) would have not been recognized. The Indian lifestyle, which included constant exposure to rodents and their excreta on land and in water, exposed them to the leptospiral life cycle (

 </xref>). Bare feet were common in and around houses. Although a rare portal of entry, mucosal exposure may have occurred from ingestion of corn buried in the ground in rodent-accessible baskets and from rodent-contaminated foods in wigwams (weetas). Dermal abrasions offered cutaneous portals of entry. Attendance of the ill and burial of the dead (including those who died from Weil syndrome) would have attracted others who shared local food, water, and camp grounds. It was common practice for entire families to enter sweat lodges followed by immediate immersion in cooling streams and ponds; sweat lodges were considered vivifiers and cure-alls for illnesses, a practice that may have reexposed the already ill to contaminated water. Once the spirochete established its presence in numerous foci, it survived for months in water, mud, and moist soil and caused infection in additional mammalian reservoirs. A reduction in the populace may have been incremental, episodic, and continuous; daily needs and customs may have exposed the Indians to leptospirosis over many months or years, with only a small fraction of the population eventually surviving. Suggestions that the disease persisted among the Indians after 1619 (perhaps through 1630) support the premise of endemic nidality and selective Indian vulnerability. The fate of nearby European cod fishermen is unknown, but they did not share most of the Indians’ risk factors. Boots would have limited transmission from fresh water exposures, bathing was not a common practice, and work in a saline environment may have curtailed transmission. An occasional case of febrile illness on board ship would have been attributed to many other causes. Disease and death may have occurred among the fishermen but are not recorded.
