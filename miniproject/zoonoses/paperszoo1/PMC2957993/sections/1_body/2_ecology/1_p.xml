<p>Indigenous ecology was cataloged in 1604 when hundreds of coastal plants, trees, and animals (but not “vermine”) were described (

 </xref>). Before 1620, there were no peridomiciliary animals except for small dogs and mice (

 </xref>), although other rodents (e.g., squirrels) were common. Precolonization and postcolonization English written accounts do not mention rats, the numbers of which may have been influenced by the presence of cats, but aboard ships rats must have been common. An earlier explorer noted “Tant qu’on eut des cuirs on ne s’avisa point de faire la guerre aux rats…” (“As long as there is a cargo of skins, it makes no sense to kill the rats.”) (

 </xref>). The black rat (
 <italic>Rattus rattus</italic>) was common in coastal England at the time (yet to be displaced by the brown rat [
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>norvegicus</italic>] nearly 100 years later) (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">

 </xref>); the black rat and mice were universal companions on ships and must have established themselves early on the coastal mainland, seeking harborage in and around Native American households. Once established, rats and mice would become chronic carriers of disease agents, contaminating water and soil and infecting other commensal rodents (e.g., the local mouse 
 <italic>Peromyscus leucopus</italic>) and other mammals. Fresh and stored food items such as maize, beans, squash, pumpkin, roots, nuts, berries, meat, fish, and shellfish, were also susceptible to leptospiral contamination.
