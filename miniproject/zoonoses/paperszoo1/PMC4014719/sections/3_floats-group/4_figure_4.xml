  <p>Methodology for determining potentially positive (
   <italic>i.e.</italic>, cut-off values) for bat individuals using serological data. This figure highlights some of the challenges in interpreting filovirus serology (cut-off values) in bats, and why these data should be examined carefully. Distribution of Optical Density (OD) values from ELISA assay using 1:1 mixture of recombinant nucleoproteins for 
   <italic>Reston</italic> + 
   <italic>Zaire</italic> (R+Z) 
   <italic>ebolavirus</italic> in 
   <italic>Rousettus leschenautlii</italic> fruit bats. Data from [
   <xref rid="B63-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], using methodology adapted from [
   <xref rid="B77-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>].Cut-off values were determined to be &gt;0.454 for the R+Z ELISA using a maximum likelihood estimator, gamma distribution, and 95% risk of error.Pourrut 
   <italic>et al.</italic> 2009 used an exponential distribution, but the data here are better fitted to a gamma distribution. This approach is less arbitrary than the standard approach of using a value 3× the OD value of negative control, as it uses the distribution of the data itself and a statistical framework to identify potential positive cut-off values. Grey bars = OD values from individual bats for the R+Z ELISA (without positive or negative controls); red line = gamma distribution; blue = 95% confidence of cutoff values; green = 99% confidence. After initial screening, 15 (11%) of 141 
   <italic>R. leschenaultii</italic>, 6 (8%) of 75 
   <italic>Cynopterus</italic> spp., and 4 (7%) of 56 
   <italic>Megaderma lyra</italic> bats were potentially positive at the 95% confidence level. However, only 5 (3.5%) of 141 (95% CI 1.5%–8.0%) of 
   <italic>R. leschenaultii</italic> bats were reported as seropositive after additional testing by ELISAs and Western Blot [
