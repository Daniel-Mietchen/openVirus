   <bold>A</bold>) The multiple transmission pathways are shown for Ebolavirus genera viruses. The role of vectors is unlikely, but not known (dashed line). Those pathways with epidemiological uncertainty are shown with question marks. Potential reservoir dynamics are shown in blue, spillover epidemics in small mammals (Africa), pigs (Reston ebolavirus only), duikers (Africa), primates and humans shown in red and ongoing human transmission in orange; (
   <bold>B</bold>) The multiple transmission pathways are shown for Marburgvirus genera viruses. The role of vectors is unlikely, but not known (dashed line). Those with epidemiological uncertainty are shown with question marks. Potential reservoir dynamics are shown in blue, spillover epidemics in primates and humans shown in red and ongoing human transmission in orange.
