<p>Another key aspect of ecological theory that must be investigated further is the role that meta-population dynamics may play in the ecology and evolution of filoviruses. Amman 
 <italic>et al.</italic> provided evidence of direct movement between different caves for 
 <italic>R. aegyptiacus</italic> and have found that there is genetic similarity between viruses detected in geographically distant locations [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. They suggest that 
 <italic>R. aegyptiacus</italic> exist as a large meta-population with virus circulation over broad geographic ranges. Population genetic studies using mitochondrial and microsatellite markers have confirmed that a congeneric species, 
 <italic>Rousettus leschenaultia</italic>, is highly vagile and panmictic across large areas (e.g., from India throughout China) [
 <xref rid="B117-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Further investigations to understand host movement and connectivity of potential filovirus reservoirs are warranted.
