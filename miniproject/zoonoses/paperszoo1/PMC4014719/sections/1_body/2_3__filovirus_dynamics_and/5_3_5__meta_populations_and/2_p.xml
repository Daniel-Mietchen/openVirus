<p>Several previous studies have investigated the relationship between host population structure and bat viral dynamics. Olival 
 <italic>et al.</italic> showed that 
 <italic>Pteropus vampyrus</italic>, the primary natural reservoir for NiV in mainland Southeast Asia, was highly vagile and panmictic using both host and parasite genetics, and was likely the primary player in NiV transmission and circulation [

 <xref rid="B119-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Plowright 
 <italic>et al.</italic> suggested meta-population dynamics were necessary for HeV persistence in Australian Pteropid bats and they predicted reduced connectivity leads to larger epidemics within bat colonies due to a greater loss of herd immunity in colonies with lower levels of connectivity [
 <xref rid="B99-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. More recently, Peel 
 <italic>et al.</italic> have used host panmixia to predict infection dynamics across sub-Saharan Africa and shown similar antibody prevalences against two viruses, Lagos bat virus (a lyssavirus) and an as yet undetermined henipa-like paramyxovirus [
 <xref rid="B115-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. This species has been shown to both breed freely enough that there is panmixia [
 <xref rid="B115-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>] and travel between roosts over shorter time spans [
 <xref rid="B104-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], suggesting movement between colonies within the period short enough for infection to occur and for a bat to become infectious [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These meta-population dynamics will be important to consider when designing future ecological studies and modeling bat-filovirus data.
