<p>There remain, however, uncertainties about how strong the effects of seasonal birthing are for other filoviruses, and how much coloniality (as shown by 
 <italic>R. aegyptiacus</italic>) and other factors drive infection dynamics. Further still, it has recently been demonstrated that host population structure may be a useful tool to predict infection presence [
 <xref rid="B115-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>] and this remains to be seen for the potential reservoirs of filoviruses. Interestingly, the sub-Saharan African species, 
 <italic>Eidolon helvum</italic>, has been shown to have a high seroprevalence of antibodies against several RNA viruses, but not filoviruses compared to other species in the same locations [
 <xref rid="B76-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,
 <xref rid="B82-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-01759-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Given this species is ecologically similar in some ways to 
 <italic>R. aegyptiacus</italic> (seasonal, synchronous birthing; colonial; frugivorous), it poses the question as to whether the ecological differences prevent filovirus circulation (
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> is migratory; tree roosting) or if there are underlying genetic host restrictions.
