<p>Evidence from other bat-infection systems suggests that RNA virus shedding may be linked to host ecology and seasonality. Drexler 
 <italic>et al.</italic> studied a maternal colony of 
 <italic>Myotis myotis</italic> bats for three years and showed that RNA viruses (coronaviruses and astroviruses), but not DNA viruses (adenoviruses) were increasingly detected in greater numbers (by quantitative PCR) during colony formation and after parturition [

 <italic>et al.</italic> showed that Nipah Virus (NiV) in 
 <italic>Pteropus lylei</italic> bats has seasonal dynamics, but with different dynamics for different strains, with a Bangladesh NiV strain more frequently observed April to June and a Malaysian NiV strain found from December to June [
 <xref rid="B114-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. These more complex patterns are also suggested by Plowright 
 <italic>et al.</italic> who modeled the transmission dynamics of Hendra virus (HeV) in Australian Pteropid bats and found that their models fit the available data better when population connectivity and immunity (including waning maternal immunity) interact, suggesting more complex dynamics than a simple increase in susceptible juveniles providing enough young for persistence [
