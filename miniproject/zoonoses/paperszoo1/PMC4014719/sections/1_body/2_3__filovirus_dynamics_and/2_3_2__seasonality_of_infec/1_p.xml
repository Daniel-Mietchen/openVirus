<p>The most prominent study to test hypotheses regarding bat-filovirus ecology using field approaches and longitudinal sampling is by Amman 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, who looked at breeding cycles and their relationship to Marburgvirus prevalence [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Given that many aspects of bat biology, such as mating, birthing, and migration (e.g., [

 <xref rid="B76-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,

 <xref rid="B104-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]) are seasonal, Amman 
 <italic>et al.</italic> were the first to test the hypothesis that birthing might be linked to increases in infection prevalence and ultimately spillover for Marburgvirus in bats. Prevalence of other bat derived viruses, including coronaviruses and rabies, are reported to show seasonal dynamics [
 <xref rid="B105-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>,
 <xref rid="B106-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>,
 <xref rid="B107-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>] and the increase in susceptible hosts and contact rates during the birthing period may drive infection dynamics [
 <xref rid="B108-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Their study of Marburgviruses in 
 <italic>R. aegyptiacus</italic> bats in Python Cave, Uganda discovered 2.5% of the bats were actively infected by PCR (and some yielding 
 <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> isolates) [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Their analyses suggested 
 <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> infection occurred in distinct pulses in older juvenile bats (approximately 6 months old), coinciding with twice yearly birthing seasons. The authors also reviewed previous human infections and found that most (83%, 54/65) occurred during this same high prevalence/seasonal birth period. Relatedly, Pourrut 
 <italic>et al.</italic> 2009 found that pregnant females bats were statistically more likely to be seropositive for Ebola virus [
 <xref rid="B77-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. As many bats have synchronous mating and birthing [
 <xref rid="B103-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>,
 <xref rid="B104-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>,
 <xref rid="B109-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>,
 <xref rid="B110-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>,
 <xref rid="B111-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>,
 <xref rid="B112-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>] and births increase population size and contact rates, the influx of susceptible juveniles may be a central driver of bat infection dynamics. Recent theoretical studies using stochastic epidemiological models with a seasonal birth pulse suggest increased synchrony of birthing increases the necessary critical community size necessary for infection persistence [
 <xref rid="B113-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Thus, seasonal birthing may decrease the probability of pathogens persisting in a colony, but lead to increased periods of infection prevalence following birthing. Whether this is true of all filoviruses in all locations is unknown and further field studies, integrated with modeling, are necessary to understand the role of host ecology on the persistence and emergence of filoviruses in bats [
