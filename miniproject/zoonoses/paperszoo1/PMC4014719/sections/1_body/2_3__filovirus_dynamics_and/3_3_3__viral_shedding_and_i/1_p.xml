<p>There is little understood about filovirus shedding and persistence in bats, though several key studies [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B85-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] suggest that the within-host infection dynamics are the classical “susceptible—infected—immune[recovered]” (SIR) cycle [
 <xref rid="B108-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Swanepoel 
 <italic>et al.</italic> showed that in experimental infection studies Ebola virus replicated in the three species of bats infected (
 <italic>Tadarida condylura</italic>, 
 <italic>Tadarida pumila</italic>, and 
 <italic>Epomophorus wahlbergi</italic>) with virus isolated from feces 21 days after infection [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The bats also seroconverted, suggesting recovery with an adaptive immune response. Leroy 
 <italic>et al.</italic> showed that anti-
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> IgG-positive animals were not 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> PCR-positive, and 
 <italic>vice versa</italic>, suggesting again that infection occurs and is followed by seroconversion [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In Amman 
 <italic>et al.</italic> showed that 
 <italic>R. aegyptiacus</italic> bats were discovered to have Marburg virus PCR-positive lung, kidney, colon and reproductive tissues, which may suggest transmission by oral, urine, fecal, or sexual means [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The finding of widespread antibody positive bats (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="viruses-06-01759-t001">Table 1</xref>) suggests that survival following filovirus infection is common among bat species. The most compelling evidence for the long-term survival of free-ranging bats following Ebola virus infection is a study by Hayman 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, in which a seropositive bat was known to be alive 13 months after release with a radio collar [
