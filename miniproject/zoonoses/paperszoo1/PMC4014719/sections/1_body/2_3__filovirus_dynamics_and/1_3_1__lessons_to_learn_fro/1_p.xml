<p>Overall, filovirus ecology remains a neglected area of research, which is understandable as potential reservoirs are still being discovered and for many years remained elusive. Understanding zoonotic disease emergence and cross-species pathogen transmission require multi-disciplinary, process-based approaches that integrate ecological and evolutionary dynamics [

 <xref rid="B94-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Several frameworks have been proposed to improve how ecological studies relating to bats and emerging infectious diseases can be performed [

Below we highlight some key areas with existing, but limited, information available regarding filovirus ecology and dynamics in bats, and give examples from other bat zoonoses investigations, e.g., research over the past decade into the ecology of Henipaviruses in Malaysia [
