<p>Several authors have speculated that, like that suspected proximate cause for the NiV outbreak in Malaysia [

 <xref rid="B149-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. The role of fruit tree masting in inter-species interactions and filovirus spillover, e.g., between frugivorous bats, ungulates (duikers), and primates in the forest, is suspected but not known. Similar video studies to those in Bangladesh have shown how apes in Africa share fruit resources [
 <xref rid="B61-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], but it is currently unknown if partially eaten fruits can lead to infection with filoviruses. Greater use of such surveillance technology may shed further light on transmission pathways in the filovirus-bat systems.
