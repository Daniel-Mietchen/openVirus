<p>While there is evidence to support specific instances of viral spillover, the epidemiological links between bats, Ebolaviruses, and human and primate infection are not clear. Recent epidemiological surveys following an outbreak reported increased bat activity through bat migration and hunting prior to an outbreak of Ebola virus in DRC [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. One recent study found a high prevalence (15%) of IgG antibodies to Zaire ebolavirus in human populations in Gabon, and that populations living in forest areas were at a higher risk to being seropositive as compared to human populations in the grassland, savannah, and lake area [
 <xref rid="B146-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Interestingly, no significant differences in seroprevalence were found between populations that hunted or had contact with animals
