 <xref rid="B152-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>] but not for wildlife. Multi-species SIR models [
 <xref rid="B108-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] could be developed to describe filovirus transmission within bats and between bats and other host species (e.g., gorillas) and could be parameterized using data from field and experimental investigations. These epidemiological studies could be used to answer questions regarding the transmission processes, including if the virus(es) could persist within specific populations or species alone. These models may also be used to highlight which aspects of host and virus biology may be important and require further study, through the use of sensitivity analyses [
 <xref rid="B95-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. As we have previously described, population genetic tools can be used to define geographic limits of populations and quantify connectivity between bat populations for each host species known to harbor a given filovirus species. Fine scale gene flow data can be combined with GPS or satellite telemetry and GIS modeling of landuse changeâ€”to assess if environmental features (available habitat) spatially correlate with observed breaks in gene flow and population limits. Satellite telemetry studies in the Philippines, as part of multi-disciplinary investigations of viruses have shown non-random foraging and increased roosts compared to previous knowledge [
 <xref rid="B83-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. These types of studies can highlight important aspects of host ecology, as well as the impacts and distributions of infected or previously infected individuals [
