<p>While we have a decent understanding of the progression of infection and immunity in individual humans [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], little is known about antibody persistence and viremia in bats. Experimental infections studies in captive bats and long-term monitoring of bat populations in the field using mark-recapture should help to inform this. As previously mentioned, a large number of outbreaks have been directly linked to mining activities or cave exposure [

 <xref rid="B51-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,

 <xref rid="B136-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>,
 <xref rid="B137-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. However, the route of transmission is uncertainâ€”is infection through aerosolized droplets of bat excreta and inhalation, or through some other mechanism? Experimental studies will shed light on these mechanisms and routes of exposure and can be used to guide policy to mitigate spillover.
