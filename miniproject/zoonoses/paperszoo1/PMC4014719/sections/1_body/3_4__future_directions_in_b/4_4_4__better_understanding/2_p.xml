<p>While experimental studies with BSL-4 agents such as filoviruses can be challenging, captive studies can be used to understand infection and antibody dynamics in the absence of experimental challenge. Two studies of henipavirus infected or seropositive fruit bats have been undertaken and show the temporal dynamics of antibodies. Though both studies raise many additional questions, they allow researchers to better understand the results of field studies [
