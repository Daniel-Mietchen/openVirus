<p>As part of a more unified filovirus surveillance strategy in bats, it will also be necessary to develop non-invasive sampling protocols 
 <italic>and</italic> better detection methods for viral discovery [

 <xref rid="B125-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Following an experimental inoculation, Swanepoel 
 <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that 
 <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic> could be detected in bat feces, but few studies to date have routinely screened bat excreta by PCR in the field. There are also limited data comparing viral detection from organ specimens with data from excreta collected from the same animals. Developing more sensitive assays to detect antibodies or virus from small quantities of blood [

 <xref rid="B121-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>], respectively, has two potential benefits. First, bats (of which many species are threatened) do not need to be killed to identify potential filovirus reservoirs, or study the distribution and the seasonality of viral shedding or infection. Second, for management interventions, it is most important to understand the routes of viral shedding in bats and the seasonality of this shedding, rather than the presence or absence of a virus in a given animal or tissue type. Thus, there may be more value in detecting a virus in bat feces, urine, or saliva than there would be in bat tissue 
 <italic>if</italic> transmission is occurring indirectly in bat habitat (caves or mines). However, if the risk interface is through bushmeat hunting and direct butchering of bats [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], then understanding prevalence and viral load in tissues and blood would be most relevant.
