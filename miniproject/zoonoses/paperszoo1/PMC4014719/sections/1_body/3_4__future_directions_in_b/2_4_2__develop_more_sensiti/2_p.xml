<p>There is also a need for better studies of immunological responses in bats [
 <xref rid="B127-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. Understanding bat immune responses to filovriruses will help understand the ecology of these viruses within the natural setting because it can be challenging to interpret antibody data in wild species and difficult to use these data to decide whether or not a species is a reservoir (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-01759-f004">Figure 4</xref>). More specific and sensitive assays, such as Luminex technology [
 <xref rid="B128-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>] and pseudotype assays [
 <xref rid="B129-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>] may help resolve some of these issues. Baker 
 <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated how accurate quantification of antibody responses using Luminex technology was able to demonstrate the potential effects of pregnancy on henipavirus transmission in a captive study of 
 <italic>Eidolon helvum</italic> that would not have been possible with assays that used dilution series or provide binary responses [
 <xref rid="B130-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. These assays still require positive and negative controls, but Peel 
 <italic>et al.</italic> have shown how similar data can be analyzed in the absence of validated gold standard assays from the appropriate species and population (and applied these methods to bat sera) [
 <xref rid="B131-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. These approaches, however, remain problematic without better knowledge of the immune response of the bat species to a particular virus. Depending on how cut-off values are determined, some studies can easily overestimate the seroprevalence of a given populations or species. Statistical tools that consider antibodies as noisy populations of antibodies, rather than a binary process, and seek to delineate cut-offs for epidemiological studies, are useful tools for understanding serological assays and have used by several authors including Peel, Pourrut, and Olival [
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B77-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,
 <xref rid="B131-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-01759-f004">Figure 4</xref>). However, ultimately researchers should aim to understand the dynamic antibody responses in the appropriate species infected with the appropriate virus by an optimal assay before interpreting field data, despite this being difficult in practice.
