<p>The number of vertebrate genomes available for bioinformatic studies will continue to rise in the next decade as the both the cost and effort needed for sequencing them continue to decline. Advances in HTS can also offer insights into viral evolution, by offering rapid, culture free methods that allow analyses of whole viral genomes (e.g. [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]), as well as characterizing the host genome of potential reservoir species. The recent HTS of two bat genomes offers tantalizing, but preliminary, insights into how bats may be adapted for flight and perhaps have altered innate immune systems that suggest bats may respond to viral infections in a subtly different way to other mammalian hosts studies to date [
 <xref rid="B132-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. Understanding host responses to filovirus infection and details of host-viral interactions at a genetic level may improve understanding of field data and enable researchers to develop more nuanced methods of interpreting serological assays, and modeling infection dynamics.
