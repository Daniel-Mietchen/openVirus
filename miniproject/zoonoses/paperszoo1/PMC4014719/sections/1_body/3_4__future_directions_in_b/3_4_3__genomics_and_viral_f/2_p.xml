<p>Several 
 <italic>in silica</italic> studies published in the past few years have used genomic data and identified filovirus genes (endogenous viral elements, EVEs) integrated into the genomes of several mammalian species, including bats [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B133-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>,
 <xref rid="B134-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. One particularly interesting avenue for future research is whether integration of these viral genes confer some immunological advantage to hosts [
 <xref rid="B134-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Evidence for this is supported by the fact that in some cases long open reading frames for these endogenous viruses have been preserved in host genomes for over thousands of years and that their presence correlates with the absence of disease in host species [
 <xref rid="B134-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. With the availability of more data, additional comparative genomic studies that seek to understand the phylogenetic distribution of these endogenous viruses in mammalian hosts may help to inform why some bat species appear to be resistant to infection; but also could be used to identify potential filovirus reservoir hosts that are not yet known [
 <xref rid="B133-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. For example, Katzourakis 
 <italic>et al.</italic> found a strong association of endogenous filoviruses elements in both rodents and marsupialsâ€”pointing to these groups as potentially important reservoirs, although currently not known to harbor exogenous filoviruses [
 <xref rid="B133-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. These 
 <italic>in silica</italic> analyses may be of use to help target which of the ~5000 mammals species to focus efforts for exogenous filovirus discovery and can be part of a more unified strategy for global filovirus surveillance.
