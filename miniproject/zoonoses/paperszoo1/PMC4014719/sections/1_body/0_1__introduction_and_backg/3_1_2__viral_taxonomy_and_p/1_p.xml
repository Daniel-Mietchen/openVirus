<p>In this article, we defer to the revised filovirus taxonomy of the 9th report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) including proposals by Kuhn

 <xref rid="B15-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus are the two currently recognized genera of the family Filoviridae. Lloviu virus [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] may be classified as a distinct genus, Cuevavirus, and species Lloviu cuevavirus [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The two classified genera are divided into increasing numbers of species, as more viruses are discovered. Within the genus Ebolavirus, Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Reston ebolavirus, Taï Forest ebolavirus (formerly Côte d’Ivoire ebolavirus), and Bundibugyo ebolavirus are recognized species. Within the genus Marburgvirus there is a single species, Marburgvirus marburgvirus (formerly Lake Victoria marburgvirus), which consists of two very divergent “viruses”: Marburg virus and Ravn virus, approximately 20% divergent at a genetic level [

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This is in contrast to the known diversity for Ebolavirus species, with Zaire ebolavirus having only a 2.7% nucleotide difference between sequences, Sudan ebolavirus 5.2%, and Reston ebolavirus 4.5% [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Despite increasing numbers of viruses being detected, some species are represented by single viral lineage (e.g., Taï Forest ebolavirus by Tai Forest Virus and Lloviu cuevavirus by Lloviu virus). These taxonomic classifications will continue to change as increased surveillance in wildlife hosts and humans and genome sequencing will uncover more divergent lineages within Filoviridae, from new localities and new hosts. While viral taxonomy ultimately relies on formal proposals and expert review by the ICTV [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], it will also be important to have flexible and more rapid classification schemes in place to assess the taxonomy of new lineages as our knowledge of filovirus diversity grows [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].
