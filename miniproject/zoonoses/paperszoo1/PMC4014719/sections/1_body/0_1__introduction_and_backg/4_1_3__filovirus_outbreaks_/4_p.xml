<p>As noted by others, one interesting feature of filovirus epidemics is that genetic analyses show epidemics can happen as a result of single introduction events into human populations with subsequent human-to-human transmission, or as a result of multiple introductions with less human-to-human transmission (

 <xref rid="B40-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Thus, rapid genetic characterization of human and non-human primate outbreaks will continue to be critical in order to better understand the zoonotic and epidemiological origins of filovirus outbreaks [

 <xref rid="B34-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Given that molecular tools and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) continue to get cheaper and more efficient, the time from outbreak to full viral genome sequence ready for analysis will continue to decrease and mostly likely be limited by infrastructure for cold-chain and transport of specimens.
