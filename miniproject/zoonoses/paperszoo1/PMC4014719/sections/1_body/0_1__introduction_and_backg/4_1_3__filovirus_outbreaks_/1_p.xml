 <italic>Lake Victoria marburgvirus</italic> was the first filovirus discovered in 1967, when laboratory workers in Marburg, Germany and Belgrade, Yugoslavia (now Republic of Serbia) were exposed to the virus after contact with infected, imported green monkeys (Chlorocebus spp.). Subsequently, a number of small human outbreaks of Marburgvirus (both Marburg virus and Ravn virus) occurred sporadically between 1975–1997, some of which had some link to bat caves [

Three small outbreaks occurred in Uganda between 2007–2008, one associated with gold mining from Kitaka cave, and two single human cases were Western tourists visiting Python Cave in Uganda while on vacation [
