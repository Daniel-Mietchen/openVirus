<p>The history of Ebolavirus outbreaks in Africa have also been previously reviewed including an excellent summary of outbreaks up until 2005 [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Briefly, as described in that review, in 1976 two outbreaks occurred around the same period—one in Eastern Sudan and one in Eastern Zaire—resulting in 53% and 89% mortality and the first discoveries of Sudan and Zaire ebolaviruses, respectively. Subsequently there was one human Ebolavirus case in 1977 in DRC, and a cluster of 34 cases in E. Sudan in 1979. No Ebolavirus outbreaks occurred again until 1994, when there were a series of outbreaks between 1994–1997 and more again between 2000–2004 [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. There has only been a single, non-fatal case of Taï Forest ebolavirus in humans, a veterinarian who was infected after performing a necropsy on a chimpanzee in 1994 [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Bundibugyo ebolavirus was discovered after human cases of hemorrhagic fever in late 2007 in Western Uganda, but the links to an animal reservoir are not clear [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A large Ebolavirus outbreak occurred in DRC in 2007 (186 deaths out of 260 cases, 71.5% mortality), and the initial human “index case” was later speculated to have been linked to purchasing freshly killed fruit bats for consumption [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Most recently in 2012, there were four distinct outbreaks in Uganda and DRC, one caused by Marburgvirus that was discovered to be nearly genetically identical to sequences collected from bats a few years prior [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Currently, in March 2014, there is an ongoing outbreak of 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> in Guinea. At the time of writing, the WHO reported 103 cases or suspected cases with 66 deaths. Polymerase (L) gene sequence analysis suggests that this outbreak is caused by 
 <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic>, which is the first time that this virus has been detected in W. Africa [
