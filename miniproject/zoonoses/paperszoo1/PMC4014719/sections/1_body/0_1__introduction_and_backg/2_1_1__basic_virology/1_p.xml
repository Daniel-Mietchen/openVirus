<p>The 
 <italic>Filoviridae</italic> family in the order Mononegavirales is separated from other Mononegavirales on the basis of morphological, physiochemical, and biological features [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and more latterly genomic analyses [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Filoviruses are non-segmented, negative-strand RNA viruses. The viruses are filamentous (Filo- derived from the Latin 
 <italic>filum</italic> or thread) enveloped particles of variable length. The filovirus genomes are typically approximately 19 kb in length [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The proteins expressed by the filoviruses are: nucleoprotein (NP), glycoprotein (GP), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L), and four structural proteins: VP24, VP30, VP35, and VP40 [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> is able to express a truncated soluble glycoprotein (sGP) through RNA editing. The ribonucleoprotein is derived from the RNA genome, NP, VP30, VP35, and L protein, though 
 <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> is reported to be able replicate in the absence of VP30. The VP35 protein is known to block interferon induction in both Marburg and Ebola viruses [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and the discovery of the open reading frame for this protein integrated into bat genomes is an area for future research exploration to better understand host-virus interactions and immunity [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The two proteins VP40 and VP24 form the internal viral membranes and the surface of the viral membranes are spiked with GP trimers. The trimers are formed from GP1 and GP2, which are cleaved from the GP precursor. The GP trimers mediate receptor binding and are the target for neutralizing antibodies [
