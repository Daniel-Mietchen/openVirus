<p>Filoviruses, including Ebola and Marburg viruses, are recognized as a significant threat to public health and conservation as they cause periodic human and non-human primate outbreaks with high mortality rates. Since 1967 when 
 <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> first emerged in humans, their importance as lethal pathogens causing hemorrhagic fever has been appreciated, but their origins, natural history, and ecology remained elusive for decades. In 2005, the first direct evidence from field studies that bats were reservoir hosts for 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> was reported [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and research has since been growing to understand the role that bats play in the maintenance, transmission, and evolution of filoviruses. There are a number of excellent reviews on the history of filoviruses, their virology, molecular biology, and vaccine development [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], including a special volume published in this journal “Advances in Filovirus Research 2012” [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We do not wish to replicate those previous reviews here and those subjects are not the focus of our paper. Thus, we only briefly review key aspects of filovirus biology before focusing our review on the issue of filoviruses in bats, with a focus on understanding the ecology, epidemiology, and natural history of this system. Through extensive review of the published literature and by drawing examples from research on other bat-borne zoonoses, we will specifically examine the current state of knowledge regarding Marburgviruses and Ebolaviruses in bats and highlight key areas for future research to better understand these associations.
