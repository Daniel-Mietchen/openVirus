<p>In 2002, widespread die-offs of Schreiberâ€™s Bent-winged bats (
 <italic>Miniopterus schreibersii</italic>, Family Vespertilionidae) in the Iberian Peninsula (France, Spain, and Portugal) prompted a wildlife disease investigation. Tissue microscopy from bats collected from a cave in Northern Spain (Cueva del Lloviu) suggested that the bats died from viral pneumonia, and subsequent pathogen screening found that individuals were infected with a novel filovirus, named Lloviu virus [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This is the only described filovirus not known to infect humans. This finding was also highly significant as it was the first discovery of an 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> outside of Africa or Asia, and although causation was never proved, it has been speculated that mortality was from Lloviu virus infection.
