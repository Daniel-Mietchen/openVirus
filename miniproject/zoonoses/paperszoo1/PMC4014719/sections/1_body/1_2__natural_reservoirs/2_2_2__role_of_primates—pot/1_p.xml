<p>Primates are known to have a role in filovirus, ion, as the first known human cases were linked to exposure to lab primates in Europe in 1967. Viruses in the genera 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> have been isolated from infected primates [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], however the role of primates in the natural ecology of filoviruses is still poorly understood and their role as part of a reservoir complex is unknown (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-01759-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Human disease is frequently linked to contact with infected primate carcasses, though direct contact with other infected hosts is reported [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-01759-f001">Figure 1</xref>). It is uncertain whether there is primate-to-primate transmission, or if primates are “dead-end” hosts and R
 <sub>0</sub> (the number of infections one infected individual causes on average over the duration of the infectious period in a naïve population) is always close to 0. However, it is noticeable that primates, especially great apes, appear to have been severely affected by Ebola (
 <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic>) and populations of western lowland gorillas (
 <italic>Gorilla gorilla gorilla</italic>) and common chimpanzees (
 <italic>Pan troglodytes</italic>) have declined by approximately 80% in parts Central Africa and these declines are linked (chronologically and through a small number of molecular studies) to 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Following a human 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> outbreak in Gabon and Congo over a five month period 130/143 gorillas disappeared, with 10/12 gorillas and 3/3 common chimpanzees testing positive to 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> by PCR, antigen capture or immunohistochemical staining post-mortem [
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. These observations suggest that even if R
 <sub>0</sub> is less than 1, ape-to-ape transmission may be prolonged enough to cause significant epidemics. Given the many years these ape populations will take to recover after these mass mortality events [
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] it suggests that African apes are unlikely to be able act as sole reservoirs for infection.
