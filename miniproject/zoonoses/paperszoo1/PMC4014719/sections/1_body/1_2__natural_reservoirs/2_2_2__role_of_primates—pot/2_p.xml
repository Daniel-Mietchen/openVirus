<p>In Asia, 
 <italic>Reston ebolavirus</italic> has been isolated from captive primates (
 <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>) in the Philippines (131/1051 were antigen positive) [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Nidom 
 <italic>et al.</italic> reported anti-
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> antibodies in orangutans (
 <italic>Pongo pygmaeus</italic>), however, there was substantial variation in titers in orangutans and the study lacked both positive and negative controls [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] that are essential standards required to interpret serological findings [
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. These antibody findings in otherwise healthy orangutans could mean that the filovirus circulating in Asia is less virulent in apes or that orangutans are more resistant to disease (but not infection). Either of which might lead to them being able to act as hosts for filoviruses. Although, like 
 <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic>, Reston virus has caused disease and killed primates [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], so if there is an intermediate or novel filovirus circulating in Asian apes it would likely need to be much less pathogenic and cause less disease in apes to persist within these populations. Moreover, a key issue is having a susceptible pool of hosts large enough for pathogens to persist within, which would likely make low density solitary apes, such as orangutans, unlikely reservoirs for acute immunizing infections [
 <xref rid="B61-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], though they could form part of a complex of multiple species forming a reservoir [
 <xref rid="B62-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Recent evidence for 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> infection in Asian fruit bats species could potentially support the idea that multiple hosts may be involved [
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. What is clear is that in Africa apes are susceptible to 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> and may suffer severe disease [
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The susceptibility of African apes is both a problem for human health when humanâ€“ape contact occurs, as well as a major conservation concern for already threatened species.
