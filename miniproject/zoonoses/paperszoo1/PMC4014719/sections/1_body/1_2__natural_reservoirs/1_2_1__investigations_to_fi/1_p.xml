<p>While there is no consensus on how to unambiguously define an infection “reservoir”, a number of criteria can be applied to identify potential animal reservoirs during epidemiological investigations, and to generally classify when a host species may act as a “reservoir” 
 <italic>vs.</italic> an “accidental host”, see Box 14.1 “What Is a Natural Reservoir for a Pathogen?” in [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The natural reservoir for 
 <italic>Marburg-</italic> and 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> remained elusive for decades. Very diverse taxa have been suggested as potential reservoirs for filoviruses over the years, including bats, rodents, arthropods, and plants [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In a massive field investigation to find the natural reservoir following the 1995 Kikwit, DRC outbreak over 3000 animals were collected primarily from forest areas near the home of the index case, but no evidence of 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> was found [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The sampling included 78 mammal species, 51 bird species, and 22 reptiles and amphibians species were collected, and 18 species and approximately 1/5 of all the animals collected were bats. However sample sizes per species were low, with only 4 bat species having greater than 20 individuals collected [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Swanepoel 
 <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that plants, reptiles, invertebrates and some vertebrates were unlikely reservoirs, because experimentally they were refractory to infections [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However the bats they tested (see below) were able to survive infection, support replication, and mount an adaptive immune response. Despite years of investigations, it took nearly forty years from the discovery of 
 <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> in the late 1960s to identify fruit bats as (at least one of) the primary natural reservoir for this virus.
