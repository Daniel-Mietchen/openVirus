<p>The recent establishment of bat cell lines [
 <xref rid="B88-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], including those of the most likely primary reservoir host for Marburgviruses, 
 <italic>Rousettus aegyptiacus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B89-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], has been invaluable to further unravel the molecular mechanisms of filovirus cell entry and host range in bats. A recent study expressing filovirus envelope GPs on the surface of vesicular stomatitis virus suggest that 
 <italic>Lloviu virus</italic> GP allows viral entry into bat cells more easily than other filoviruses, and thus may be an exceptionally bat-adapted virus [
 <xref rid="B90-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. This finding of evidence for adaptation suggests that the bat mortality that prompted the discovery of Lloviu virus may be less likely due to this highly adapted virus, although lyssaviruses are a prime example of host-adapted viruses that remain highly virulent to bat hosts [
 <xref rid="B91-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Additional investigations of host range 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> also using vesicular stomatitis virus expressing GP surface protein, found that 
 <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> was able to infect 6 different bat cell lines from 4 divergent bat genera (
 <italic>Eidolon</italic>, 
 <italic>Rhinolophus</italic>, 
 <italic>Carollia</italic>, 
 <italic>Tadarida</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B92-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>].
