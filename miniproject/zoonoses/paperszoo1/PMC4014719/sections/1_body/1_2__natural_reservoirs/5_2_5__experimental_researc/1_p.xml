<p>Experimental studies supporting the role of bats as reservoirs are few, but two key studies have investigated the capacity for bats to become infected with filoviruses and to survive infection. As mentioned above, Swanepoel 
 <italic>et al.</italic> showed that Zaire ebolavirus could replicate and lead to seroconversion without disease in three species of bats infected (
 <italic>Tadarida condylura</italic>, 
 <italic>T. pumila</italic>, and 
 <italic>Epomophorus wahlbergi</italic>) and that virus could be isolated from feces [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Using captive bred 
 <italic>R. aegyptiacus</italic> bats of known serological and infection status Paweska 
 <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that viremia could be induced and Marburg virus detected in multiple tissues 2 to 9 days post infection [
 <xref rid="B85-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Following viremia, IgG antibody could be detected 9 to 21 days post infection. Marburg virus could also be detected in numerous tissues, including lung, intestines, kidney, bladder, salivary glands, and female reproductive tract. None of the bats showed clinical symptoms, nor was gross pathology seen. However, it is worth noting that these studies in 
 <italic>R. aegyptiacus</italic> could not induce infection following oral or intra-nasal inoculation (the above results were following intra-dermal or intra-peritoneal inoculation), nor could virus be isolated from secretions. Similarly, the study by Swanepoel 
 <italic>et al.</italic> inoculated 
 <italic>Tadarida</italic> spp. bats by sub-cutaneous injection; however, fecal shedding was observed in one individual. Thus, while these results are consistent with 
 <italic>R. aegyptiacus</italic> being a reservoir host, they do not shed light on the potential mechanisms for bat-to-bat transmission [
 <xref rid="B85-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Additional experiments underway using a captive 
 <italic>Rousettus</italic> colony housed at CDC Atlanta will likely shed more light on some of these unresolved issues [
 <xref rid="B86-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Lastly, Albarino and colleagues point out that the virus used by Paweska 
 <italic>et al.</italic> was passaged almost 40 times in primate Vero cells prior to infecting bats [
 <xref rid="B87-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], and it is not known how this may affect the infectivity or virulence of this virus. Reverse genetics can now be used to reconstruct “wild type” 
 <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> strains from genome sequences obtained directly from bats, even in the absence of a viral isolate, and may be a useful tool more relevant than using human or vero-adapted viruses to understand viral dynamics in bats [
 <xref rid="B87-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>].
