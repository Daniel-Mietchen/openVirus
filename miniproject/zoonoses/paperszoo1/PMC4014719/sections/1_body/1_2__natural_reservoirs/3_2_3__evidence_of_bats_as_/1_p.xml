<p>The evidence for bats as reservoirs of ebolaviruses comes from numerous epidemiological and ecological studies. We summarize the known bat host species, methods of detection, and key references for each filovirus species with available data in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="viruses-06-01759-t001">Table 1</xref>. Prior to the detection of Ebolavirus RNA from healthy bats in the field, there were several reasons epidemiologists thought bats may be a reservoirs for ebolavirus. Index cases during Marburgvirus epidemics in Kenya [

 <xref rid="B67-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] gave researchers an epidemiological link between bats and filoviruses when multiple transmission events occurred in mines [

 <xref rid="B70-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Ecological niche models were used to provide regional perspective on the geographic and ecological distributions of Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus and suggested that various bat, mouse, rat, dormice, and shrew species may be sources of the infection as their distributions overlapped those of all four (then known) African filoviruses [
