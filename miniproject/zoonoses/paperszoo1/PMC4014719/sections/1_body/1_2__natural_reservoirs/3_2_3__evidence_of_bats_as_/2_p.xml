<p>To test some of these hypotheses, a wide range of hosts were infected with ebolavirus experimentally in 1996, and bats stood out because they got infected, replicated virus, and survived infection [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Finally, in 2005 Leroy 
 <italic>et al.</italic> managed to detect anti-
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> antibodies and 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> RNA in three fruit bat species: 
 <italic>Hypsignathus monstrosus</italic> (24%, 4/17), 
 <italic>Epomops franqueti</italic> (7%, 8/117) and 
 <italic>Myonycteris torquata</italic> (7%, 4/58) after sampling 1,030 animals, including 679 bats, 222 birds and 129 small terrestrial vertebrates [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Viral nucleotide sequences were detected in liver and spleen samples (but not other tissues) from 
 <italic>H. monstrosus</italic> (19%, 4/21), 
 <italic>E. franqueti</italic> (4%, 5/117) and 
 <italic>M. torquata</italic> (3%, 4/141). Subsequently anti-
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> antibodies have been detected in numerous other bat species in Africa (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="viruses-06-01759-t001">Table 1</xref>), including high seroprevalences in 
 <italic>E. franqueti</italic> (37%, 10/27), 
 <italic>Epomophorus gambianus</italic> (38%, 14/37, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-01759-f002">Figure 2</xref>), 
 <italic>H. monstrosus</italic> (44%, 7/16), and 
 <italic>Nanonycteris veldkampii</italic> (25%, 1/4) species [
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], but notably not in another common fruit bat species [
 <xref rid="B76-viruses-06-01759" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] in West Africa (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-01759-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Compelling evidence that 
 <italic>Rousettus aegyptiacus</italic> was a key reservoir for 
 <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> came from several studies; and is still the only filovirus to have been isolated from bats [
