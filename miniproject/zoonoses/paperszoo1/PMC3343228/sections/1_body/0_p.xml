<p>The ability to predict and prevent viral epidemics has become a major objective in the public health disciplines. Knowledge of viral hosts enables the identification of maintenance populations from which epidemics may emerge

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Unfortunately, unbiased assessment of habitat is impossible, as it requires the investigation of all host species in all possible geographical locations. Moreover, the delimitations of viral species and populations are often not well defined. However, viral phylogenies can identify whether extant viruses encountered in a given host are less or more directly linked to common ancestors, providing clues to virus origins
