<p>To achieve a statistical exclusion of alternative hypotheses regarding the host switching process, maximum likelihood analyses of ancestral state reconstruction were done under different model restrictions as summarised in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c</xref>. All of these analyses suggested that bats but not rodents, primates or birds should be preferred donors of PV along the tree. Moreover, although assumptions of fossilised bat hosts at the root points of both PV subfamilies did not significantly reduce the model likelihood, all other fossilised host assumptions did.
