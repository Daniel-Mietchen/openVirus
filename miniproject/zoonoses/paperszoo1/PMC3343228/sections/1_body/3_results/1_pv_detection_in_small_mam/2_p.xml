<p>Phylogenies were inferred using maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Detection rates of viruses in bats and rodents were similar at 3.3 and 3.1%, respectively, but bat viruses were dispersed across the phylogenetic tree with pronounced genetic divergence, whereas rodent viruses belonged to three clades with relatively low divergence that were not exclusively detected in rodents (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). PVs were detected in six of ten families of bats tested, representing all major chiropteran phylogenetic lineages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). A simplified criterion based on pairwise amino acid distance matrices was used to estimate how many novel virus species might have been detected (refer to Methods section). In total, 66 novel PV taxa at the level of putative species were discernible. This number exceeded the number of PV species currently known, as the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) currently lists 36 species, and even upon inclusion of unclassified sequences from GenBank, only an estimated 57 species can be discerned.
