<p>To assess the spectrum of PV in bats and rodents, 86 species of bats (4,954 individuals) and 33 species of rodents (4,324 individuals) were sampled in 15 locations worldwide (

 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> by various reverse transcription (RT)–PCR assays. Pooled serum samples were additionally screened by random amplification and deep sequencing of serum-derived cDNA. Although this approach identified a range of viruses whose full genomes remain to be determined, no PVs were detected (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). This was presumably due to higher concentrations of the identified viruses in blood, or because of properties that technically promote detection by random amplification, such as circularity of DNA genomes. In contrast, RT–PCR detected a large range of PV cDNA sequences as described below.
