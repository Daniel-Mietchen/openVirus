<p>To compare organ-specific compartments of PV replication, virus concentrations in internal organs were determined in 22 African 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> bats infected with henipaviruses. The spleens of 21 of 22 animals tested positive with high virus concentrations, whereas all other internal organs as well as blood yielded virus at lower rates and concentrations (

Organ distribution of morbilli-related PV in 28 rodents was strikingly different from that in bats, with broader and less organ-specific distribution of virus. Highest viral loads and most frequent virus detections in rodents were seen in the kidneys, and in bats in the spleens (
