<p>To identify signs of PV-dependent disease in bats, paramount serum chemistry parameters were compared between infected and non-infected bats. No infection-dependent alterations were seen in concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase, gamma glutamyltransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transferase, bilirubin and albumin (

In summary, bats show an overwhelming PV diversity, continuous PV shedding without evidence of efficient immune control, signs of organ-specific replication and absence of PV-related pathogenicity. It was noted that these traits taken together are typical of viral ARs.
