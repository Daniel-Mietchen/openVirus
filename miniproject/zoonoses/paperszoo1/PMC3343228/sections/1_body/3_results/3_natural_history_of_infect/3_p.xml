<p>Interestingly, the morbilli-related viruses from 
 <italic>M. myotis</italic> in Germany were also observed in genetically distant 
 <italic>Coleura afra</italic> bats in Ghana. For several other PV clades, evidence of their association with bats beyond the limits of communicating social groups was obtained, as summarised in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a and b</xref>. One pneumovirus, six henipaviruses and eight rubulaviruses were detected throughout several sampling years and sites across four different Western and Central African countries. Notably, widespread and constant detection of several viruses was observed in cave-roosting 
 <italic>Rousettus aegyptiacus</italic> that do not participate in annual migrations and whose populations are isolated from each other (
