<p>We next looked for evidence of continuous virus excretion on population level in bats
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. A colony of 
 <italic>Myotis myotis</italic> in Germany known to carry members of the 
 <italic>Morbillivirus</italic>-related clade was monitored over 3 years for shedding of virus. Shedding rates and concentrations were constant over three observation periods throughout 2008 to 2010 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). This colony was a maternity colony, and parturition times fell in the middle of observation periods but did not influence excretion, suggesting natural infection with little differences in shedding between young and adult animals. It was noted that this pattern was very different from that of measles virus in humans
