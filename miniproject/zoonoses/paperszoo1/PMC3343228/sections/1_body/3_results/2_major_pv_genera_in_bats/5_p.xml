<p>In two different widely distributed species of New World bats, one frugivorous (
 <italic>Carollia perspicillata</italic>, rate 0.5%) and one insectivorous (
 <italic>Pteronotus parnellii</italic>, rate 7.5%), we identified virus sequences that were phylogenetically closely related to the genus 
 <italic>Henipavirus</italic> (area of distribution shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). These viruses formed a sister clade to the genus 
 <italic>Henipavirus</italic>, including its novel African representatives (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2c</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5a</xref>). It was impossible for ethical and logistical reasons to euthanise Neotropical bats and sample internal organs that might have enabled the completion of full genome sequences. Nevertheless, the 
 <italic>N</italic> protein gene at the far opposite end of the genome of one of these viruses was successfully sequenced from a faecal sample. 
 <italic>RdRp</italic>- and 
 <italic>N</italic>-gene fragments were phylogenetically congruent and no signs of genomic recombination were seen (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>).
