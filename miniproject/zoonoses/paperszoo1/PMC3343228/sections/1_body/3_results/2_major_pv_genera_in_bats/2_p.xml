<p>Measles is one of the most important childhood diseases. Measles virus defines the genus 
 <italic>Morbillivirus</italic> that also contains the canine and phocine distemper virus, a dolphin morbillivirus, as well as Rinderpest and Peste Des Petits Ruminants viruses. Novel members of the genus 
 <italic>Morbillivirus</italic> as currently defined by the ICTV were detected for the first time in bats (neotropical vampire bats) but not in rodents (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). A clade of morbillivirus-related rodent- and tupaia viruses, forming an unclassified sister clade to the genus 
 <italic>Morbillivirus</italic>, was extended by an estimated 25 novel bat and rodent viruses, confirming the unclassified genus and the 
 <italic>Morbillivirus</italic> genus to form a major stem lineage of PV.
