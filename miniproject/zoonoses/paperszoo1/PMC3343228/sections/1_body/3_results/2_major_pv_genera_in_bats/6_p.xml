<p>RSV and the related human metapneumovirus, belonging to the 
 <italic>Pneumovirinae</italic> subfamily, are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. We identified a clade of novel bat viruses also in this subfamily, which formed a sister clade to the human and bovine RSV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). No bat viruses were detected in direct relationship to the genus 
 <italic>Metapneumovirus</italic>, whose only human member, the human metapneumovirus, is most closely related to avian metapneumovirus C. These data support the notion that the metapneumoviruses are of direct avian, rather than direct mammalian descent
