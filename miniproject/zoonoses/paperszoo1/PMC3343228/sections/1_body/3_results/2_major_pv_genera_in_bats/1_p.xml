<p>The genus 
 <italic>Rubulavirus</italic> contains three human pathogens, the mumps virus, as well as the respiratory viruses, 
 <italic>Parainfluenzavirus 2</italic> and 
 <italic>4</italic>. A large range of novel rubulaviruses in fruit- and insect-eating African bats were identified in addition to those six bat rubulaviruses previously known (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The viruses could be classified into 21 discernible taxonomic entities on the level of putative species. No rubulaviruses were detected in rodents. A bat virus of high similarity to mumps virus was fully sequenced from a bat spleen (15,378 nucleotides, (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>)). Amino acid similarity was well above 90% in all genes except P (89.5%), suggesting this virus and human mumps to be conspecific. To determine antigenic relatedness to human mumps virus, sera from 52 flying foxes and 78 insect-eating bats were tested by immunofluorescence (

 <italic>Parainfluenzavirus 2</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). These data in total suggest that mumps and related bat viruses may belong to one same serogroup.
