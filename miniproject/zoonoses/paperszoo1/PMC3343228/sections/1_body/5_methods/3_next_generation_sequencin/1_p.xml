<p>Products of random cDNA amplification were loaded on 1.2% agarose gels. Primer dimers and large fragments (&gt;700 bp) were removed, and amplicons were extracted from agarose gels. Fragments were end-repaired and a 454 sequencing library was constructed according to the GS Junior Rapid Library Preparation protocol (Roche, Penzberg, Germany). Emulsion PCR and sequencing reaction were performed as recommended by the manufacturer. Primer sequences were trimmed from each read, and all reads were aligned against the NCBI virus database using the tblastx local alignment algorithm in Geneious. All hits were scored and alignments with lengths less than 50 amino acids and a bit-score less than 40 were excluded.</p>
