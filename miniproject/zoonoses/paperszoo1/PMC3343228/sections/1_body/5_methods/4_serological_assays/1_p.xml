<p>Reactivity of human mumps virus with sera from different insectivorous and frugivorous bats was tested using mumps virus (strain Jones)-infected cells (Euroimmun EU38, Lubeck, Germany). Prototype PVs used for comparison included measles virus (strain Edmonston), RSV (RSV B Wash/18537/'62 (CH 18537)), parainfluenza virus 1 (PIV1, strain Sendai CPJ-3 13) and PIV2 (EU 18/9, strain Greer). Bat sera were diluted 1/40 and detection was done using first a goat anti-bat immunoglobulin (Ig) (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA) followed by a donkey anti-goat Ig conjugated to cyanine 3 (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Nuclei were stained with 4â€²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Pictures were taken with a Motic fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). NiV indirect immunofluorescence was performed with NiV-infected Vero cells and a strain isolated from human brain tissue (kindly provided to AM by Jane Cardosa, Malaysia). Bat serum was diluted 1/10 and 1/40, and detection was done with the goat anti-bat Ig (Bethyl Laboratories) used for mumps immunofluorescence, followed by an Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). A guinea pig anti-NiV serum was used as a positive control, followed by an Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-guinea pig IgG.</p>
