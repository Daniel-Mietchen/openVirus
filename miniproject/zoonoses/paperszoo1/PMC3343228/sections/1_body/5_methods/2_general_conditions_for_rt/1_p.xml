<p>About 100,000 RT–PCR reactions were done for this study, using ca. 100 different protocols. The basic formulation for 25-μl RT–PCR reactions used the Invitrogen SuperscriptIII OneStep RT–PCR kit (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), with 800 nmol l
 <sup>−1</sup> each of the respective first-round primers, 2.0 mmol l
 <sup>−1</sup> MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>, 200 μmol l
 <sup>−1</sup> deoxynucleoside triphosphates each, 1 μl enzyme mix, 1 μg bovine serum albumin, 10 U RNAseOut (Invitrogen) and 5 μl RNA extract. Amplification generally involved 30 min at 50 °C; 3 min at 95 °C; a touchdown element of 10 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 20 s starting at 64 °C with a decrease of 1 °C per cycle, and 40 s at 72 °C; and 35 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 20 s at 50 °C, and 40 s at 72 °C, with a final elongation step of 2 min at 72 °C. A volume of 50 μl second-round PCR reactions used 1 μl of first-round PCR product, with 1×Platinum Taq buffer (Invitrogen), 200 μmol l
 <sup>−1</sup> deoxynucleoside triphosphates each, 2.0 mmol l
 <sup>−1</sup> MgCl
