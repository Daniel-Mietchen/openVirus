<p>Bayesian phylogenies were calculated using new PV sequences from this study, as well as a set of reference sequences from ordinal mammalian host categories (bats, rodents, primates, carnivores, ungulates), as well as birds. Reference sequences were selected from GenBank to maximise the genetic distance per ordinal host category (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). A total of 10,294 trees were extracted from the Bayesian phylogenetic analysis and ordinal mammalian host categories were assigned as noncontinuous state characters in Mesquite. Numbers of reconstructed trait changes according to an unordered parsimony assumption were summarised and averaged for each ordinal category over all trees. Reconstructed character traits at root points were also summarised and recorded.
