<p>Hypothesis testing was done in Bayestraits
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. This analysis was based on the ML phylogenetic tree shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>, including its 1,000 bootstrapped replicas. ML-based reconstructions of trait changes were calculated for each of the 1,000 replicas in Bayestraits, and the resulting median and mean values were listed in Excel. For hypothesis testing, the whole analysis was repeated under different restrictions that either synchronised the substitution rate assumptions of two different trait change processes, or that assumed defined common ancestor nodes within the tree to be fossilised to particular hosts. For each analysis, the median and mean log likelihoods were recorded. Relative model likelihoods of alternative hypotheses were compared by subtracting the respective median log likelihoods and linearising them.
