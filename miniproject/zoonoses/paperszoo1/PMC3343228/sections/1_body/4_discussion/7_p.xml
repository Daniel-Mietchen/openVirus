<p>Although these data identify a potential reservoir of important mammalian viruses, we can only begin to understand their true significance by functional investigation. Knowledge on the genetic range of pathogens carried by speciose small mammals may enable early recognition of zoonotic epidemics and rapid decision-making in the public health sector

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. However, much more (and different) work needs to be done to actually assess and ameliorate zoonotic risks. The most relevant provision in this field is that epidemic risks emanating from wildlife virus reservoirs should trigger wildlife conservation rather than interference with wild animal populations
