  <title>Paramyxovirus (PV) faecal shedding over three reproductive seasons.</title>
  <p>PV faecal shedding over three reproductive seasons from 2008 to 2010 in a 
   <italic>Myotis myotis</italic> bat maternity colony. Samples were obtained approximately every 3 weeks during the reproductive season from a 
   <italic>Myotis myotis</italic> maternity roost located in the attic of a private house in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, throughout three sampling years (2008 to 2010). Sampling dates are shown on 
   <italic>x</italic> axes. Each sample was tested by specific real-time RTâ€“PCR for morbilli-related PV. RNA concentrations per gram of faeces are given on the 
   <italic>y</italic> axis. Numbers on the 
   <italic>x</italic> axis represent individual faecal pools tested, consisting of five single faecal pellets each. Gaps between columns represent pools testing negative.
