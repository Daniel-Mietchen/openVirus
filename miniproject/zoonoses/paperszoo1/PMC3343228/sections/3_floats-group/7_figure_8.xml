   <bold>a</bold>) Patristic distances within PV genera detected per ordinal host categories (amino acid-based). Blue and orange colours represent diversification before and after inclusion of novel viruses from this study. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Summary of average host switches over ca. 10,000 trees as modelled by parsimony ancestral state reconstruction in Mesquite. Symbols on the 
   <italic>x</italic> axis depict donor (large symbols) and recipient hosts in the level of ordinal mammalian categories (bats, rodents, primates, carnivores, cetartiodactyls) and birds. Before the analysis, the rabies virus outgroup was removed, because this lyssavirus would have to be mapped to a bat host, biasing host state reconstruction for the root of the PV tree toward bats. Four single PV were removed because they were the only available PV in their particular host species (salmon, snake, dolphin, tupaia). (
   <bold>c</bold>) Summary of results from hypothesis testing using maximum likelihood (ML) ancestral state reconstruction in Bayestraits
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. After analysis of 1,000 ML bootstrap trees, the trait change model was restricted by one of the ten criteria listed, and the resulting average likelihood of the restricted model was compared with that of the unrestricted model. The list shows the factor (n-fold) by which each restricted model was less likely than the unrestricted model (averaged over 1,000 bootstrap replicates of the underlying ML tree).
