  <title>Serology and virus concentrations for selected bat PV.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>a</bold>) Reactivity of different sera (diluted 1/40) from African bats with human mumps virus in Vero cells by indirect immunofluorescence assay, a) Rhinolophidae (R.s., 
   <italic>Rhinolophus sp</italic>.), b) Hipposideridae (H.c., 
   <italic>Hipposideros ruber/caffer</italic>), c) Vespertilionidae (M.i., 
   <italic>Miniopterus inflatus</italic>), d) Pteropodidae (M.t., 
   <italic>Myonycteris torquata</italic>), e) Emballonuridae (C.a., 
   <italic>Coleura afra</italic>), f) Pteropodidae (M.p., 
   <italic>Micropteropus pusillus</italic>), g) and h) non-reactive sera from C.a and M.i. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Prototype PVs mumps, measles, RSV, parainfluenza 1 (PIV1) and PIV2 infected in Vero cells, stained with bat sera R.s., H.c., M.p. as above. Signal intensities were rated from negative to +++. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Reactivity of 
   <italic>Eidolon helvum</italic> (E.h., sample GH64) serum from Ghana with NiV antigen using an indirect immunofluorescence assay: a) and b) represent 1/10 and 1/40 dilution of E.h. serum, c) positive control using a guinea pig anti-NiV serum, including a large NiV-induced syncytia stained in red, and d) E.h. serum GH64 diluted 1/10 applied on non-infected cells. Bars in a, b and c represent 50 Î¼m. All panels used the same microscope and camera settings to demonstrate the strength of cross-reactivity between NiV and African viruses. (
   <bold>d</bold>) Henipavirus RNA concentrations in 22 
   <italic>E. helvum</italic> solid organs and serum, of which 21 tested positive in spleens, 5 in livers, 3 in kidneys, 2 in lungs, 1 in intestine and 1 in serum. Virus concentrations (log
   <sub>10</sub> RNA copies per millilitre of serum or per gram of tissue) are given on the 
   <italic>y</italic> axis for each bat organ tested. Organ types are identified on the 
   <italic>x</italic> axis. Bars represent mean virus concentrations per organ type, whiskers show s.d.
