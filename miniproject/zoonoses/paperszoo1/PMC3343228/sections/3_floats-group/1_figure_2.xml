  <p>The genera 
   <italic>Rubulavirus</italic> (
   <bold>a</bold>), 
   <italic>Morbillivirus</italic> (
   <bold>b</bold>), 
   <italic>Henipavirus</italic> (

   <italic>Respirovirus</italic> (
   <bold>e</bold>), as well as the subfamily 
   <italic>Pneumovirinae</italic> (
   <bold>d</bold>) are shown with bat viruses coloured in red and rodent viruses in blue. Major PVs are indicated by a pictogram of typical ordinal host and designations of virus species (SV, simian virus; PorPV, porcine PV; PIV, parainfluenzavirus; CDV, canine distemper virus; PPRV, peste des petits ruminants virus; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; hMPV, human metapneumovirus). Bat and rodent viruses marked by an asterisk have been described previously. Values at node points indicate Bayesian posterior probabilities of grouping (only values above 0.6 are shown). The scale bar indicates substitutions per site. For selected henipaviruses (
   <bold>c</bold>), the four amino acid GDNE/GDNQ motif at the catalytic site of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is shown. Abbreviations used in virus designations are detailed in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>.
