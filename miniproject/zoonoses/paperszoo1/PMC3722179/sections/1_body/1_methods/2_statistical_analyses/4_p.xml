<p>To predict antibiotic consumption, the impact of the campaigns during A(H1N1) influenza media coverage had to be known (r

 <sub>8</sub>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069075-g001">figure 1</xref>). We then defined two “extreme” scenarios to describe those impacts, using a “stationary” hypothesis (we considered the impact of the campaigns in 2009–2010 would be the same as the one estimated in 2008–2009) and an “evolutionary” hypothesis (we predicted an impact of the campaigns in 2009–2010 taking into account the impact the campaigns had since 2002) (see §3 in file S1). Expected antibiotic consumption “without A(H1N1) influenza media coverage” was predicted for each scenario. Three numbers were calculated: an “expected number” corresponding to the sum of predicted weekly antibiotic consumptions for each scenario during the study period, and an “observed number” corresponding to the sum of observed weekly antibiotic consumptions. For expected numbers, 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the sum of variances of the forecasts during the study period. A “final” CI was obtained using the ranges of the two 95% CI (see §3 in file S1). Only observed numbers and final CI are presented here.
