<p>The intervention ARMAX models were built in two steps. The first concerned the 2000–2002 period, before the first public health campaign, considering antibiotic consumption during it as the baseline. Because of seasonal fluctuations, a trigonometric function had to be estimated and removed to render the residual series in a stationary mode. We then fitted an autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) model to the observed data. The second step evaluated the impact of the public health campaigns on antibiotic consumption between October 2002 and March 2009. As those campaigns were held every year at the same period of the year since 2002, we assumed that they did not modify seasonal fluctuations or change the ARMA model structure, but affected only the means. We added 13 dummy variables (seven for each annual campaign (c
 <sub>1</sub> to c
 <sub>7</sub>) and six for the rest of the time (r
 <sub>1</sub> to r
 <sub>6</sub>)) to the ARMA model identified in step 1. The ILS incidence was added to that model using a simple transfer function (linear function). This allows estimating an average effect of the ILS incidence during the entire period. To select the models, we first tested the independence of the residual series (Ljung &amp; Box test) and its Gaussian distribution (Shapiro-Wilk test). When two or more models were identified, we used Schwartz information criterion and choose the one which minimize that criterion. Every step of model identification is detailed in §1 and 2 in file S1.
