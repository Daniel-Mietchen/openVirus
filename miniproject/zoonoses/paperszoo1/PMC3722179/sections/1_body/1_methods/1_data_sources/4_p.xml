<p>Two online databases were used to assess media coverage of the A(H1N1) pandemic: Factiva (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dowjones.com/factiva/index.asp" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.dowjones.com/factiva/index.asp</ext-link>) and Europresse (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.europresse.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.europresse.com</ext-link>). These online databases provide access to newspaper articles of many French and international newspapers. We conducted a search on articles published in two major national daily newspapers, 
 <italic>Le Monde</italic> and 
 <italic>Le Figaro</italic>, between January 2009 and August 2010, in order to retrieve and count the number of A(H1N1) influenza-related articles published in these two newspapers. Results are presented as the number of articles published in these two newspapers per week.
