<p>The French National Health Insurance (NHI) program covers all medical care provided by outpatient and private practice physicians and pharmacies. We obtained aggregated 2000–2010 data on all antibiotics prescribed, dispensed by outpatient and private pharmacies, and reimbursed computed from anonymous computerized individual files in the databases of the two main NHI agencies that cover salaried workers and the self-employed (&gt;85% of the French population). Each file contains drug-related information, prescription date, patient’s sex, year of birth and region of residence.

Demographic data were obtained from the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE,
