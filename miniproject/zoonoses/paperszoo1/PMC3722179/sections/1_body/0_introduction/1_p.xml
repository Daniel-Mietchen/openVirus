<p>During the last few decades, the emergence and dissemination of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains have become a major public health issue worldwide

 <xref rid="pone.0069075-European1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. For years, doctors have been prescribing (and patients have been demanding) antibiotics for viral respiratory infections, eg colds and influenza, even though antibiotics do not cure viral infections

 <xref rid="pone.0069075-Pavia1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This overuse of antibiotics has been the main driving force in the spread of multiresistant bacteria. In the community, β-lactam–resistant 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> is one of the best-known bacteria that has spread during the past 20 years, and, more recently, 
 <italic>Enterobacteria</italic> producing extended-spectrum β-lactamase has become a major worry 
 <xref rid="pone.0069075-French1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Indeed, in the 2000s, the highest European rate of 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> antibiotic resistance was observed in France, which also has one of the highest rates of community antibiotic consumption, more than three-fold higher than the Netherlands

Since 2002, a public service campaign (“Antibiotics are not automatic!” and “Antibiotics, if used wrongly, loose their potency!”) is run every winter from October to March. In 2007, an evaluation of this campaign showed that winter outpatient antibiotic use decreased by 26·5% compared to that of the 2000–2002 pre-campaign period
