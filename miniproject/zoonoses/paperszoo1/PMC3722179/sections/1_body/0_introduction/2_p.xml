<p>In April 2009, the A(H1N1) virus emerged in the USA and Mexico. It spread throughout the world very quickly, resulting in outbreaks in more than 200 countries and claimed the lives of more than 18,000 persons 
 <xref rid="pone.0069075-World1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. According to the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance (InVS), 1,334 severe cases and 312 deaths were reported in France, and, in terms of number of symptomatic cases and their severity, this pandemic influenza was not worse than annual influenza epidemics

Because of this virus's atypical features and the highly controversial management of this pandemic by the French government, media coverage was omnipresent during several months. Because antibiotics can be useful to prevent influenza bacterial complications, the indirect impact of this media coverage on antibiotic prescriptions warrants examination. Herein, we report the results of an assessment of the media coverage during the A(H1N1) pandemic influenza period in France, as well as a comparison between the observed outpatient antibiotic use with media attention and a model-based estimated outpatient antibiotic use “without media attention”.
