<p>Media attention was strong for almost 10 months (42 weeks). During that long period, no change in overall antibiotic consumption was observed, which might reflect a loss of power because prediction 95% CI, and thus the final used, widened with the time. When considering a shorter media-coverage period (18 weeks), corresponding to high A(H1N1)-virus circulation in France, underconsumption was estimated for the global antibiotic consumption, and for subjects 0–5 and &gt;60 years old. This observed underconsumption reached −14%. Considering the antibiotic-consumption profile during 2009–2010, no antibiotic-prescription peak was seen when the ILS incidence was at its maximum, which had not been observed in any previous years. Several hypotheses can be made to explain this model-estimated result. First, as previously mentioned, the ILS incidence might have been overestimated; then adjusting to it led to an overestimation of expected antibiotic use, and consequently an observed “underconsumption” as the predicted number was higher than the observed one. Second, due to the early arrival of the pandemic influenza virus in France (September 2009) compared to seasonal influenza (December–January), general practitioners’ offices might have been less saturated than usual during the A(H1N1) period of activity as classical winter viruses were not circulating yet, generating more careful antibiotic prescription
