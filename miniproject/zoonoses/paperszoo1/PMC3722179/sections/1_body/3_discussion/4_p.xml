<p>Intervention ARMAX models are well-adapted to time-series analyses. We could construct weekly time-series covering more than 10 years. For each series, models were identified independently and similar ARMA structures were found, supporting confidence in their validity. The main limitation of this study concerns the predictions of the two parameters of the intervention functions after April 2009 (ie the prediction of the impact of the campaigns in 2009â€“2010). The observed impact of the campaigns between 2002 and 2009 were very different depending on the series; however, another analysis of time series until June 2010 yielded estimated values in accordance with our predicted ones (unpublished personal data). For our predictions, we tried to adhere closely to the observed tendency, and used two scenarios to estimate forecasts and their 95% CI limits to avoid falsely significant results.</p>
