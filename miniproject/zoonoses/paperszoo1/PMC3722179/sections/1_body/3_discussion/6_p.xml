<p>Finally, over the 6-week period without A(H1N1) virus circulating in France, overconsumption which varies from 1% to 20%, was observed for individuals &gt;16 years. We here only assessed what would have been the antibiotic consumption “without media attention” and thererefore cannot draw any formal conclusion on the link between media attention and the observed overconsumption for individuals &gt;16 years during this period. However, subjects 16–60 years old might have been affected by the omnipresent media coverage, because unlike seasonal influenza, it corresponds to the age category for which deaths of people without any risk factors were seen. It has already been previously documented that media coverage can influence medical care and drug consumption

Consequently, one hypothesis to explain this observed overconsumption during this period would be the alarmist media attention related to the circulation of the A(H1N1) virus worldwide. For those &gt;60 years old, because antibiotic consumption has increased since 2007 outside campaign periods, healthcare services might have been perturbed during this period with excessive antibiotic prescriptions, even in the absence of respiratory viruses. Media attention might be one factor having influenced antibiotic consumption in this age group during this period. Additional specific studies are needed to understand the determinants of antibiotic consumption of individuals &gt;16 years during this period.
