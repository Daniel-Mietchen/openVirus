<p>The data used in this study were provided by two different sources. Antibiotic-prescription reimbursements came from NHI agencies, assuring reliable and thorough data recording during the pandemic. ILS-incidence data was provided by the Sentinelles Network. This network estimates ILS incidence relying on declaration of general practitioners, without virological confirmation. During the A(H1N1) pandemic, they declared that the epidemic threshold was crossed week 36–2009. Another surveillance network (GROG), relying on samples to estimate virologically confirmed influenza number of cases, declared the start of the influenza epidemic in France week 47–2009. This discrepancy suggests there might have been an overdeclaration of ILS by general practitioners in September and October 2009, leading to an overestimation of ILS incidence by Sentinelles Network. Some studies suggest that the increase in ILS in September and October 2009 was caused by respiratory viruses other than influenza (eg rhinovirus)
