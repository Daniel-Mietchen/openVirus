<p>A total of 530 articles on the A(H1N1) virus were released between January 2009 and August 2010. According to our criteria, media coverage was intense during the 42 weeks beginning in April 2009 (week 18) and ending in February 2010 (week 8) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069075-g002">figure 2</xref>), with 508 articles published. A study of the number of weekly articles published in the same two newspapers on seasonal influenza since 2000 showed that this number never exceeded 5 (data not shown). Between April and early June 2009 (weeks 18 to 23), when no A(H1N1) virus was circulating in France, 77 articles were released. During the period of low virus circulation in France (number of cases below the epidemic threshold), ie June–August 2009 (weeks 24–35), 166 articles were released. During the A(H1N1) epidemic in France (September 2009–January 2010 (weeks 36–2)), 240 articles were published. Considering antibiotic consumption, an intervention ARMAX model fulfilling goodness of fit criteria was obtained for each series (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069075-g003">figure 3</xref> for entire series and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069075.s001">figure S1</xref> for other considered series). All the models are detailed in file S1. Scenario estimations are described in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069075-g004">figure 4</xref> for the entire series (and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069075.s002">figure S2</xref> for the other considered series). Using scenario estimations, antibiotic consumption “without A(H1N1) influenza media coverage” was finally predicted (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069075.s001">figure S1</xref>). The observed numbers and final CI covering the whole period of A(H1N1)-influenza circulation, the period when no cases were reported in France, and the epidemic period in France are given in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0069075-t001">table 1</xref>. For the whole period, no differences between observed and predicted numbers were found for the five series examined. However, when we studied more specific periods, we did notice differences between these two numbers. During the epidemic period in France (weeks 36–2), we observed an underconsumption (ie the observed number was lower than the predicted one) for entire series, subjects 0–5 and &gt;60 years old. Underconsumption varied from 2% to 10% for entire series, from 6% to 14% for the youngers and from 2% to 14% for the olders. Additionally, during the period when there were no cases in France (weeks 18–23), we observed an overconsumption (ie the observed number was higher than the predicted one) for individuals &gt;16 years, with an increase that varies from 1% to 20%.
