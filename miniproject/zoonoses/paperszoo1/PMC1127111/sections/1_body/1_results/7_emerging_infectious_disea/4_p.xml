<p>Intriguingly, it appears that whenever a virus (or any other pathogen or pest) is eradicated another appears to fill the environmental niche. For example, in regions where the wild-type poliovirus (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) has been eliminated, non-polio enteroviruses have been associated with outbreaks of paralytic disease that clinically exhibit symptoms of poliomyelitis. The most common non-polio enteroviral causes of Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) are human coxsackieviruses A7 and A9 and human enterovirus 71 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The poliovirus epidemics that emerged in the mid 19th century are now believed to have arisen not due to a change in the properties of the virus, but due to an improvement of public sanitation and personal hygiene, which delayed the acquisition of enteric virus infection from infancy to childhood. Since maternal antibodies protected infants, they usually underwent silent immunizing infections, whereas when older children were infected they more often suffered paralytic poliomyelitis [
