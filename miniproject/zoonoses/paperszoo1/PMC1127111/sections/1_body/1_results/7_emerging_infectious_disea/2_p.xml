<p>Zoonoses are a special class of pathogens as they co-evolve with the reservoir host, not with humans. Although not always the case, when zoonotic pathogens infect humans they have a tendency to cause severe disease, much like a commensal microorganism that infects unusual areas of the body [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Zoonoses can be broken down into two basic groups: those spread by direct contact with the infected animal and those spread via an intermediate vector [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Zoonoses can infect humans through many vectors. Members of the genus 
 <italic>Hantavirus </italic>are spread by rats [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], West Nile virus by mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and 
 <italic>Campylobacter </italic>species by family pets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In 2003, there was an outbreak of monkeypox (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) in the Midwestern United States, which was attributed to the importation of pet animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Viruses, protozoa, and bacteria can all be transmitted either directly or via a vector. However, these groups are clearly differentiated on a phylogenetic level. All zoonotic members of the families 
 <italic>Flaviviridae </italic>and 
 <italic>Togaviridae </italic>(Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) are transmitted via an intermediate vector, while all zoonotic members of the families 
 <italic>Arenaviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Filoviridae </italic>(Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) are transmitted through direct contact. Almost all zoonotic proteobacteria are transmitted through direct contact as well [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Of all the agents infectious to humans, a majority are zoonotic in origin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].
