<p>Diseases that have recently appeared or that are growing in incidence are classified as emerging infectious diseases [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">Additional File 4</xref>]. Emerging infectious organisms often encounter hosts with no prior exposure and thus represent a novel challenge to the host's immune system. Morse [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] identified six general factors in emergence of infectious disease: ecological changes, human demographics and behavior, international travel, technology and industry, microbial adaptation and change, and breakdown in public health measures. A comprehensive review by Taylor, Latham, and Woolhouse [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] identified zoonotic status as one of the strongest risk factors for disease emergence. Roughly 75% of emerging pathogens are zoonotic, and zoonoses are twice as likely to be considered emerging as non-zoonoses.
