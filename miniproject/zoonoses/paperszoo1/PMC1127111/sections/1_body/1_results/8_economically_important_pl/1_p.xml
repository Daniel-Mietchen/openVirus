<p>Proteobacteria are important plant and animal pathogens, and it is interesting that proteobacterial plant pathogens are not clustered on the phylogenetic tree, but are observed in alpha, beta, and gamma subdivisions (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Some plant and animal pathogen species share the same genus classification (e.g. 
 <italic>Ralstonia </italic>and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>), and for at least one species, 
 <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic>, different subspecies are plant and human pathogens. In viruses, plant and animal pathogens are generally found in distinct families, with the notable exception of the families 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae </italic>(Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) and 
 <italic>Reoviridae </italic>(Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) that harbor both. Most plant-specific virus families are not shown in Figures

Bird flu in South East Asia affected the poultry industry severely. Influenza A is a bird virus that jumped from birds via pigs to humans and as a human pathogen has a large impact on the economy [
