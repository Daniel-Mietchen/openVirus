<p>The infectious agents considered by the NIAID to have high potential for bioterror use are listed in Additional File 5 [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">Additional File 5</xref>]. Validated and potential bioweapons agents are listed in Additional File 6 [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">Additional File 6</xref>]. Agents that have been used to commit biocrimes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] are in Additional File 7 [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">Additional File 7</xref>]. The pathogens regulated by the HHS and the USDA are shown in Additional File 9 [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">Additional File 9</xref>] and Additional file 10 [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">Additional File 10</xref>], respectively. In addition to infectious microbes, toxins derived from biological sources are contained on these lists. We identified the biological source of each toxin, and listed the source organism in the Additional File containing the toxin.
