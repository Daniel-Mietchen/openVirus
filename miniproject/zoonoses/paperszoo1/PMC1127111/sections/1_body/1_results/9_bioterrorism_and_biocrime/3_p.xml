<p>All 11 regulated toxins can be found on the HHS Select Agent list [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">Additional File 9</xref>] and five are also regulated by the USDA [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">Additional File 10</xref>]. The regulated toxins (four small molecules and seven peptides or proteins) are produced by a wide variety of organisms: five are produced by bacteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], two by fungi [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], two by plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], one by an animal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], and one by a protist [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The bacteria that produce toxins are indicated in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and the eukaryotic toxin producers are shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. The conotoxins are a collection of five families of related peptide toxins produced by the various species of snails in the genus 
 <italic>Conus </italic>[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The two fungal toxins, diacetoxyscirpenol and T-2 toxin, are produced by multiple species of the genus 
 <italic>Fusarium </italic>[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Of the five regulated bacterial toxins, four are peptides or proteins and tetrodotoxin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] is a small molecule. Tetrodotoxin is produced by a variety of gammaproteobacteria that colonize the puffer fish [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. These toxins are relevant both due to concern that they may cause outbreaks of disease through accidental food contamination and because they are potential bioweapons. According to the CDC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], an average of 110 cases of botulism, caused by a bacterial toxin (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), are reported each year. Interestingly, numbers of cases of food-borne and infant botulism have not changed significantly in recent years, but instances of wound-botulism have increased primarily due to the use of black-tar heroin, especially in California. Ricin is a toxin produced by the plant 
 <italic>Ricinus communis </italic>(Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. When prepared as a weapon, there are three methods of delivery: ingestion, injection, or inhalation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. One of the most famous documented uses of ricin was in the assassination of Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian defector who died three days after being shot with a ricin pellet [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].
