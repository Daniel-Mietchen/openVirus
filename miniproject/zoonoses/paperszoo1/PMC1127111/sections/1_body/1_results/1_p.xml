<p>The Microbial Rosetta Stone database was designed to link genomic sequence data, taxonomic classification, and epidemiological information in a way that facilitates searches and data updates. The intent is not to replace currently available tools, like those available from NCBI, but instead serve to resolve ambiguities and data conflicts. One of the main goals of building this informatics infrastructure was to support the rapid determination of the causative agent in the event of a bioterrorist action or emergence of a previously unknown infectious disease.</p>
