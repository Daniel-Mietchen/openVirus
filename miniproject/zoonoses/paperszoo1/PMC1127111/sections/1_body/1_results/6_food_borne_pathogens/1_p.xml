<p>Each year in the United States, there are approximately 76 million cases of food-borne illness, including 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In an estimated 2 to 3% of these cases, chronic sequelae develop. These sequelae include renal disease, cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, neural disorders, and autoimmune disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The estimated cost of food-borne illness in the United States is $23 billion annually [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Mishandling of food is believed to be responsible for 85% of all outbreaks of food-borne disease in developed nations, primarily due to a lack of education [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Food-borne pathogens [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">Additional File 3</xref>] are also important because they represent one of the largest sources of emerging antibiotic-resistant pathogens. This is due in part to the administration of sub-therapeutic doses of antibiotics to food-producing animals to enhance growth. For example, certain strains of 
 <italic>Salmonella </italic>show resistance to eight or more antibiotics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Studies have shown that antibiotic resistance in 
 <italic>Salmonella </italic>cannot be traced to antibiotic use in humans, suggesting that antibiotic use in animals is the primary cause of resistance [
