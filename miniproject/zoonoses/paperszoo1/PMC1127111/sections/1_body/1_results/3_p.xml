<p>The organisms listed in the Additional Files are represented according to phylogenetic hierarchy in the figures. The symbols used in the figures connect the organism names back to one or more of the Additional Files, which allows visualization of the fact that organisms are often represented in multiple Additional Files. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> is the symbols key. Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> show the phylogenetic relationships of cellular life forms including bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and the plants and animals that produce toxins, Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> shows the phylogenetic relationships of DNA viruses, and Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> show the phylogenetic relationships of RNA viruses.
