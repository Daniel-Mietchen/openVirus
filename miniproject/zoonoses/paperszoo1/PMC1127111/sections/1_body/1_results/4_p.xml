<p>For optimal utility, the genomic sequence data, taxonomic, and epidemiological information were linked in a way that facilitates searches, data updates, and data curation. The Microbial Rosetta Stone system will serve as a translator to resolve ambiguities and data conflicts between other public databases and literature and, when unable to resolve ambiguities, provide enough context for users understand the nature of the ambiguities. The database provides links to literature on experimental protocols for pathogen identification and to the genomic and biochemical information specific to a species, strain, or isolate. The data model and query tools are described in detail in Hari et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The following sections describe the information and literature sources used to populate in the database for globally important and emerging pathogens and potential bioterrorist agents.
