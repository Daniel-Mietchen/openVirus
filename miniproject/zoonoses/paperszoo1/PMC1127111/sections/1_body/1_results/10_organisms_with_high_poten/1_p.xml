<p>Pathogens that can be genetically manipulated [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">Additional File 8</xref>] represent a unique bioterrorist threat, particularly as technology to genetically alter microbes becomes more commonplace. For the purposes of this work, viruses considered as having a high potential danger for bioterrorist engineering were derived from the literature reports and from the authors' judgment balancing the considerations of terror potential with the technical difficulty of use.
