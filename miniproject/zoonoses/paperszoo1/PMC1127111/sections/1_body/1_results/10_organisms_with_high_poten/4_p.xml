<p>Negative-strand RNA viruses (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) can also be reconstituted by total chemical synthesis or from cloned genomic DNA by a reverse genetics approach [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Many negative-strand RNA viruses, including ebolaviruses, Lake Victoria marburgvirus, Hantaan virus and Lassa virus, are important human pathogens and potential bioterrorist agents. Influenza virus A is a particularly noteworthy negative-strand RNA virus due to its potential to cause pandemic disease, the availability of stock cultures of many strains, and the potential for total chemical synthesis by reverse genetics techniques [
