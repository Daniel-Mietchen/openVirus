<p>DNA viruses (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) with large genomes can be manipulated in culture, and are susceptible to engineering events such as insertion of genes not normally present in viral genomes. For example, the entire orthopoxvirus genus of the 
 <italic>poxvirus </italic>family is considered to have high potential for bioengineering because of a much-publicized paper that describes the engineering of an orthopox member, ectromelia virus, to express mouse interleukin-4, resulting in a virus with extraordinary virulence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Another member of the orthopoxvirus genus, vaccinia virus, is commonly used in molecular biology research and is extensively used in vaccines and vaccine research [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Thus, because they are highly infectious, will tolerate inserted genes, and can be manipulated easily in culture, poxviruses must be considered high-risk agents for acts of bioengineering. Mutations to create vaccine- and drug-resistant strains are also possible in other large-genome DNA viruses. Adeno-associated viruses are small DNA viruses that are members of the family 
 <italic>Parvoviridae</italic>. They are satellite viruses that depend upon the presence of their helper DNA viruses, including members of the families 
 <italic>Adenoviridae </italic>and 
 <italic>Herpesviridae</italic>, for replication. Like vaccinia virus, adeno-associated viruses have been used extensively as vectors for gene therapy, and therefore represent a risk for genetic modification and subsequent terrorist use.
