<p>For bacteria, if virulence factors have previously been modified successfully in a species, that species was considered to have a high potential for bioengineering and was included on the chart. However, numerous other methods for engineering bacterial genomes exist. Bacterial genomes consist of one or more chromosomes and additional genetic information may exist in the form of plasmids. Plasmids replicate independently of the chromosomal DNA and can be transferred between bacteria through transformation. Genes encoding virulence factors may be found in either chromosomes or plasmids. In one example of an early bioengineering event, the selective growth of an antibiotic-sensitive species with an antibiotic-resistant species in the presence of the antibiotic resulted in transference of resistance. Current techniques allow for the splicing of genes encoding virulence factors from one species followed by insertion into another. However, the complexity of the bacterial genome makes it difficult to successfully transfer a gene with a high rate of expression.</p>
