<p>RNA-genome viruses are naturally more resistant to insertion of genes, but can be made resistant to drugs and potentially even to vaccines by introduction of mutations. Most critically, RNA viruses may be created in the laboratory by total chemical synthesis to generate active virus particles or reconstituted from cloned DNA. Total chemical synthesis was demonstrated recently for poliovirus (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Since this publication in 2002, the technology to chemically synthesize viruses has advanced substantially. Chemical synthesis of RNA viruses would eliminate the need for the bioterrorist to obtain stock cultures and would allow creation of any wild-type or mutant strain of virtually any virus. Other positive-strand RNA viruses (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) that have been reconstituted from cloned DNA samples include Kunjin virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], human rhinovirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], foot-and-mouth disease virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], transmissible gastroenteritis virus, a coronavirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>], all three genera of the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae </italic>[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], and a variety of plant and insect viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Thus, the positive-stranded viruses must be considered a high-risk area for bioengineering, where the relative risk for each virus must be considered roughly equivalent to the terrorist potential inherent to the virus.
