<p>This paper focuses on pathogenic organisms from several broad categories. Those currently known to impact global human health are monitored by a number of public health organizations and United States governmental agencies including the WHO [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional File 1</xref>] and the CDC [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional File 2</xref>]. Important food and water borne pathogens are listed in Additional File 3 [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">Additional File 3</xref>]. Those agents responsible for emerging diseases are listed in Additional File 4 [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">Additional File 4</xref>]. Pathogens considered high priority by the NIAID are listed in Additional File 5 [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">Additional File 5</xref>]. Agents are listed that pose a high threat for bioterrorism [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">Additional File 6</xref>], biocrimes [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">Additional File 7</xref>], or have a high potential to be genetically manipulated [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">Additional File 8</xref>]. Human pathogens formally regulated by the HHS are listed in Additional File 9 [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">Additional File 9</xref>] and animal pathogens monitored by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are listed in Additional File 10 [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">Additional File 10</xref>].
