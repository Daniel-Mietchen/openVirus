<p>The major causes of diarrhoeal disease in the developing and developed world have significant differences due to the great disparity of availability of pure food and water and the general nutritional and health status of the populations. Important causes of diarrhoeal disease in the developing world are those that tend to be epidemic, especially 
 <italic>Vibrio cholera</italic>, 
 <italic>Shigella dysenteriae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi </italic>[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These organisms are gammaproteobacteria (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) that use many different metabolic pathways to ensure their survival in a wide range of environments. In the United States there is a much lower incidence of diarrhoeal disease overall, and a relatively greater impact of direct human-to-human infectious transmission. The most important causes of diarrhoeal disease in the United States are bacteria such as 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Campylobacter species</italic>, 
 <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>, 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella enteritidis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Shigella </italic>species (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>); viruses, such as Norwalk virus (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) and rotaviruses (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>); and parasites such as 
 <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic>, 
 <italic>Cyclospora cayetanensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic>, 
 <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic>, while microsporidia are responsible for a smaller number of cases (Figure
