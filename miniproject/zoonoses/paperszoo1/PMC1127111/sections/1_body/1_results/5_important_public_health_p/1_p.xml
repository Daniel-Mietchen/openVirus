<p>In the developing world, nearly 90% of infectious disease deaths are due to six diseases or disease processes: acute respiratory infections, diarrhea, tuberculosis, HIV, measles, and malaria [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional File 1</xref>] [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In both developing and developed nations, the leading cause of death by a wide margin is acute respiratory disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In the developing world, acute respiratory infections are attributed primarily to six bacteria: 
 <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumonia</italic>, 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumonia</italic>, 
 <italic>Chlamydophila pneumonia</italic>, and 
 <italic>Chlamydia trachomati</italic>s [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These bacteria belong to four different taxonomic classes and illustrate how similar parasitic lifestyles can evolve in parallel within unrelated bacterial species (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Major viral causes of respiratory infections include respiratory syncytial virus (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), human parainfluenza viruses 1 and 3 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), influenza viruses A and B (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), as well as some adenoviruses (Figure
