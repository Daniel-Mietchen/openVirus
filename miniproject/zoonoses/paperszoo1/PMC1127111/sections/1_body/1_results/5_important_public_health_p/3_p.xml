<p>Infectious disease agents important to the public health in the U.S. are monitored by the CDC and listed in Additional File 2 [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional File 2</xref>]. There are no set criteria for inclusion on the notifiable disease list; rather, the list is created by the CDC in cooperation with state health departments. As diseases occur less frequently and new diseases emerge, the notifiable disease list changes. The list provides links to case definitions of each disease, including the etiological agent(s) responsible. In cases where the etiological agent was not listed or was unspecific (i.e. 
 <italic>Brucella </italic>spp.), further research was done to determine an etiological agent and this information is in Additional File 2 [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional File 2</xref>].
