<p>To facilitate comprehensive access to information on disease-causing organisms and toxins, we have developed a database known as "The Microbial Rosetta Stone" that uses a new data model and novel computational tools to manage microbiological data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This article focuses on the information in the database for pathogens that impact global public health, emerging infectious organisms, and bioterrorist threat agents. It provides a compilation of lists, taken from the database, of important and/or regulated biological agents from a number of agencies including HHS, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the CDC, the World Health Organization (WHO), the NIAID, and other sources. We curated these lists to include organism names that are consistent with the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nomenclature and to provide sequence accession numbers for genomic sequencing projects (if available). Important synonyms or previously used names that identify the organisms are also shown. We have organized the lists according to phylogenetic structure. This paper provides graphic representations of the phylogenetic relatedness of important pathogenic organisms.
