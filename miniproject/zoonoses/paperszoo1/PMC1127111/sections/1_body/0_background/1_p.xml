<p>Thousands of different microorganisms affect the health and safety of the world's populations of humans, animals, and plants. Infectious microorganisms include species of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. Many different medical and governmental organizations have created lists of the pathogenic microorganisms most relevant to their missions. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains an ever-changing list of notifiable diseases, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) lists agents with potential for use in bioterrorist attacks, and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) maintains a list of critical human pathogens. Unfortunately, the nomenclature for biological agents on these lists and pathogens described in the literature is imprecise. Organisms are often referred to using common names, alternative spellings, or out-dated or alternative names. Sometimes a disease rather than a particular organism is mentioned, and often there may be multiple organisms or co-infections capable of causing a particular disease. Not surprisingly, this ambiguity poses a significant hurdle to communication among the diverse communities that must deal with epidemics or bioterrorist attacks.</p>
