<p>The properties that make organisms amenable for use as biological weapons have been discussed extensively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. For the purposes of the database, we have categorized microorganisms or toxins as 
 <italic>validated bioweapons </italic>if they have been documented as used, or prepared for use, as biological weapons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>]. 
 <italic>Potential bioweapons </italic>are defined as agents that have some properties that are considered useful as bioweapons or agents for terrorism, or that have been the subject of serious bioweapons research and development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Greenwood 
 <italic>et al. </italic>used a hierarchical ranking of 50 infectious agents and toxins of biological origin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] to classify agents as potentially useful biological weapon
 <italic>s</italic>. Greenwood 
 <italic>et al.</italic>'s 23 highest scoring agents overlapped substantially with our list of 
 <italic>validated bioweapons </italic>and these are shown in Additional File 6 [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">Additional File 6</xref>].
