<p>The CDC-notifiable-disease list represents those diseases that offer the greatest threat to public health in the United States. Additional File 2 [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional File 2</xref>] lists the agents on this list. There are no set criteria for inclusion on the notifiable disease list; rather, the list is created by the CDC in cooperation with state health departments.

 <italic>Brucella </italic>species), further research was done to determine an etiological agent and literature used is cited in legend for
