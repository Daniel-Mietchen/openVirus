<p>Agent lists were collected from various sources as described in more detail for each Additional File below. Government agency lists (Additional Files 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref>) were taken directly from the specified agencies, while additional tables were compiled using cited literature. Organism names from all lists were converted to NCBI species names. This included changes from species synonyms to NCBI-accepted nomenclature and expansion from 
 <italic>Genus </italic>to 
 <italic>Genus species </italic>(
 <italic>e.g. Shigella </italic>to 
 <italic>Shigella dysenteriae </italic>or 
 <italic>Shigella sonnei</italic>) to represent the most important species (when known). Where possible, disease names were associated with the name of the most predominant organism that causes the disease. The Additional Files contain taxonomic information, the NCBI name of the agent and any well-known synonyms, and accession numbers for the complete genome of each agent (if available).
