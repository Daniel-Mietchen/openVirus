<p>The most common causative agents of food- and water-borne illness were taken from a publication by Tauxe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>] and are listed in Additional File 3 [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">Additional File 3</xref>]. Hub√°lek [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] published a list that constitutes a representative subset of emerging infectious diseases, which was used as the basis for Additional File 4 [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">Additional File 4</xref>]. The complete list of all species classified as emerging is substantial [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. The number of pathogens listed in the emerging disease table at 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.microbialrosettastone.com/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/> is significantly larger than that found in
