<p>Names of the infectious agents listed in the Additional Files were placed in tree-structure drawings shown in the figures that display the biological relatedness of the organisms. Cellular life forms were organized according to currently accepted phylogenetic relationships. Bacterial phylogeny (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) is based on work by Hugenholtz 
 <italic>et al. </italic>[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. The eukaryotic phylogeny tree (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) is based on ribosomal and housekeeping gene sequence analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. The branching order presented in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> should be considered tentative as the on-going recognition of additional protist lineages is likely to alter the topology of the eukaryotic tree in the near future [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. The phylogeny of DNA viruses (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) was derived primarily from the work of Iyer, Aravind &amp; Koonin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. The common origin of RNA viruses and their tentative relationships (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) is based on an extensive analysis of their RNA-dependent RNA- or DNA-polymerase (manuscript in preparation). The RNA virus phylogenetic trees were created using maximum parsimony on protein sequences. The branching of double-stranded RNA viruses is for now left unresolved in light of their apparent polyphyly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. The symbol key is shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and symbols are used in the other figures to link the pathogens in the figures to Additional Files.
