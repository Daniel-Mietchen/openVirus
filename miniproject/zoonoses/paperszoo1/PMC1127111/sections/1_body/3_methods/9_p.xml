<p>The high potential for bioengineering category [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">Additional File 8</xref>] includes both organisms that have been actually modified in biological weapons research programs in the past, and organisms with properties that make them amenable to future engineering. Placement in the latter category was based upon published reports of bioengineering for peaceful purposes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] and the author's (DJE) analysis. The agents on the HHS list are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">Additional File 9</xref>. HHS regulates the possession of biological agents and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety. HHS's Select Agent Program [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>] regularly reviews and updates the list of select agents and critical human pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">98</xref>].
