   <bold>Eukaryotic pathogens</bold>. Eukaryotic pathogen life forms are clearly dominated by the fungi and protists. Within the Fungi, the phylum Ascomycota has many human, animal, and plant pathogens and is a major source of toxins. Protist species are responsible for globally important diseases such as the malaria-causing 
   <italic>Plasmodium </italic>species and the 
   <italic>Leishmania </italic>and 
   <italic>Trypanosoma </italic>species that cause significant mortality in the developing world. The eukaryotic phylogeny tree is based on ribosomal and housekeeping gene sequence analysis [70], but different taxonomy levels are simultaneously represented as the topology has not yet been reliably determined.
