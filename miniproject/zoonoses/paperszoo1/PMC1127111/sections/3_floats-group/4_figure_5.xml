   <bold>Single-stranded negative strand RNA viruses</bold>. The common origin of RNA viruses and their tentative relationships as indicated on this chart are based on an extensive analysis of their RNA-dependent RNA- or DNA-polymerases (C.M. manuscript in preparation). The branching of double-stranded RNA viruses is unresolved in light of their apparent polyphyly [73]. Virtually all known branches of ssRNA(-) viruses harbor pathogens and thus are represented in this panel. Only the rhabdoviridae family harbors both animal and plant pathogens. Particularly noteworthy are the deadly Ebola and Influenza viruses, the latter has claimed tens of millions of human lives in the past century.
