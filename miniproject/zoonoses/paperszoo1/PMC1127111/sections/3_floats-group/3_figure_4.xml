   <bold>DNA viruses</bold>. The relationships for large genome DNA viruses on this chart was derived from the work of Iyer, Aravind &amp; Koonin, who showed the common ancestry of four large DNA virus families [72]. Noteworthy in this figure are the number of viruses that may be readily bioengineered.
