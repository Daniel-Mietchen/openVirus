<p>The NIBRG-14 viruses could only form small and ambiguous plaques after 6 days post infection in Vero cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024057-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and reach peak infectious virus titers about 10
 <sup>5.5</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0024057-t001">Table 1</xref>). After three passages, several big plaques were observed so a plaque purification was conducted at the fourth passage. Another plaque purification was conducted at the sixth passage. Overall, after 11 passages including 2 times of plaque purifications in Vero cells, one high-growth virus clone (Vero-15) was selected. The Vero-15 virus can form clear and big plaques after 3 days post infection in Vero cells (

 <sup>8</sup> TCID

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0024057-t001">Table 1</xref>). The Vero-15 virus was further used to produce virus stocks in T-flasks with high virus titers (1.9×10
 <sup>8</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml and 1.4×10
 <sup>8</sup> PFU/ml) for further evaluations including genetic and antigenic characterization and pilot production in microcarrier-based cell cultures.
