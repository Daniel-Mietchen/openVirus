<p>Using the NIBRG-14 standard sheep antisera, HI antibody titers against the NIBRG-14 and Vero-15 viruses were 800 and 400, respectively. The results indicate these two viruses have similar antigenicity. Compared with the NIBRG-14 strain, the Vero-15 strain does not have any nucleotide difference in HA, NA, NP and M gene segments but has 1–4 nucleotide differences in PB2, PB1, PA and NS gene segments (
