<p>Using 5 g/L of microcarriers and serum-containing medium in 100-ml scale spinner flasks, cells grew to confluence (∼2×10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/ml) at day 4 or 5. After infected with the Vero-15 viruses under MOI of 0.0001, infectious virus titers sharply increased at day 3 and peaked at day 5 (10
 <sup>8.78</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml). The HA titers had the similar pattern (
