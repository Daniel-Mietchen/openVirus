<p>It is well known that wild-type influenza viruses and egg-adapted high-growth reasortant influenza vaccine viruses can grow efficiently in MDCK cells but not Vero cells

 <xref rid="pone.0024057-Minor1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. After 20 passages of an egg-adaptedd high-growth reassortant H1N1 vaccine virus in Vero cells, the titer of infectious virus increased 3 (7.18 to 7.70 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/ml) to 26 (6.95 to 8.37 log
 <sub>10</sub> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml) folds and their viral antigenicity and HA sequences were stable in a previous study 
 <xref rid="pone.0024057-Govorkova1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In our study, we adapted an egg-based high-growth reassortant H5N1 vaccine virus after 11 passages in Vero cells including 2 times of plaque purification. Our Vero cell-adapted H5N1 virus increased over 100 folds in infectious virus titers measured by TCID
 <sub>50</sub> and plaque assay without changing antigenicity and HA sequences.
