<p>In addition to being used as the seed virus for manufacturing H5N1 vaccines, the Vero-adapted virus has the potential to become a master virus to generate high-growth reassortants for other influenz A viruses. The current egg-based technology for vaccine production is heavily relied on the high-growth PR8 master virus for generating seed viruses
