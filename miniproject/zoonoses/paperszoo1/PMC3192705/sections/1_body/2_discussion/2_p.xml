<p>Based on statistics from the WHO in March 2008, more than 70 clinical trials of pandemic influenza vaccines have been completed or are ongoing (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.who.int</ext-link>). Since most vaccine manufacturers used the egg-based technology for production of seasonal influenza vaccines and converted the egg-based facility to manufacture influenza H5N1 vaccines for clinical trials, only 6 clinical trials used cell-based vaccines. Most of the 6 trials using cell-derived vaccines were based on MDCK cells and one trial was based on Vero cells. As the NIBRG-14 virus can not grow efficiently in Vero cells, wild-type A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) was used to manufacture vaccines in Vero cells in facility under biosafety level 3

Ideally, antigenicity of influenza vaccine strains should be tested using ferret antisera, which are not readily available. Alternatively, we used the NIBSC sheep standard antisera to perform the antigenicity test. Moreover, the Vero-adapted H5N1 virus has the same HA sequence with the NIBRG-14 virus, which further indicated the same antigenicity between the Vero-adated H5N1 and NIBRG-14 viruses. We further demonstrated commercial potential of the Vero-adapted H5N1 virus in the microcarrier-based cell culture system reaching peak virus at 10

 <sup>8â€“9</sup> TCID
