<p>The egg-adapted high-growth A/PR/8/1934 (PR8) virus strain has been widely used as a master donor virus to generate vaccine seed viruses for manufacturing egg-based inactivated influenza vaccines

 <xref rid="pone.0024057-ED1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. One recent study showed that polymerase (PA/PB1/PB2) and NS gene segments were related to high-growth property in eggs of the PR8 virus 
 <xref rid="pone.0024057-Horimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In addition, high-growth property in MDCK cells of PR8 virus was determined to be related to single mutation at position 360 (Sâ†’Y of PB2 protein 
 <xref rid="pone.0024057-Murakami1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. A previous study suggested that NS gene is related to adaptation of the PR8 virus in Vero cells but molecular determinants of high-growth influenza viruses in Vero cells have not been well defined 
 <xref rid="pone.0024057-Ozaki1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Our Vero-adapted influenza H5N1 virus has mutations on 4 gene segments including the S360Y mutation of PB2 protein, compared with the original NIBRG-14 H5N1 vaccine virus. Identifying molecular determinants of high-growth influenza viruses in Vero cells would be valuable for establishing the platform of Vero cell-based influenza vaccine production.
