<p>It has been reported that antigen yields of engineered-H5N1 viruses in eggs are 30–40% lower than the average of seasonal influenza vaccines 
 <xref rid="pone.0024057-Stephenson1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Howard et al., found that recent wild-type H5N1 viruses (A/Vietnam/1203/94 and A/Indonesia/05/2005) grew to 0.2 to 1×10

 <xref rid="pone.0024057-Kistner1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In addition, these wild-type H5N1 viruses did not change their antigenicity and HA sequences in the end of production 
 <xref rid="pone.0024057-MK1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Moreover, this H5N1 vaccine candidate was well-tolerated and highly immunogenic in humans and has been licensed as a prepandemic vaccine in Europe

 <xref rid="pone.0024057-Ehrlich1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The reasons why the wild-type H5N1 viruses grow much efficiently than wild-type H1N1 and H3N2 viruses are not clear, which need further studies to elucidate.
