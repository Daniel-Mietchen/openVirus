<p>The current global manufacturing capacity of influenza vaccines are concentrated in Australia, Europe and North America and will not meet the urgent demand during an influenza pandemic, so countries without manufacturing capacity may not be able to have pandemic influenza vaccine available

 <xref rid="pone.0024057-Collin1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Therefore, WHO has developed a global pandemic influenza action plan to increase vaccine supply. Building new production plants in both developing and industrialized countries is one of the various strategies suggested in the WHO action plan 
 <xref rid="pone.0024057-World2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Egg-based and cell-based culture systems are two matured technologies for manufacturing influenza and other viral vaccines. The egg-based technology has long history of success on supplying seasonal influenza vaccines but it can not be scaled-up in a short term and may not have egg supply during a pandemic causing by highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, such as H5N1 viruses. Therefore, cell-based technology is becoming an attractive option for new facilities. A novel influenza H1N1 virus emerged in March 2009 in Central America and spread globally by June 2009

 <xref rid="pone.0024057-Partridge1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Among the various tools to mitigate the impact of a pandemic, vaccination is considered to be the most cost-effective strategy. The urgent development of pandemic influenza H1N1 vaccines raised complex challenges, especially at a time when seasonal vaccine productions were ongoing. Therefore, pandemic influenza H1N1 vaccines were not available until September 2009 and their supplies were far below the expected productivity

 <xref rid="pone.0024057-Partridge1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Since Vero cell is the most popular continuous cell line for manufacturing human vaccines and Vero cell banks fulfilling the cGMP requirements are readily available in many vaccine production facilities, WHO and national authorities may consider preparing for the next influenza pandemic by generating Vero cell-adapted high-growth vaccine viruses with pandemic potentials such as influenza H2N2, H5N1, H7N7 and H9N2 and conducting clinicl trials of these Vero cell-derived panemic vaccine candidates. When the next influenza pandemic occurs, all Vero cell culture facilities can be conveted to manufacture pandemic influenza vaccines. Thus, global productivity of pandemic influenza vaccines will be increased promptly to meet the urgent demand during influenza pandemics.
