<p>Two cell lines, Vero and MDCK cells, have been licensed for manufacturing influenza vaccines

 <xref rid="pone.0024057-Doroshenko1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In addition to influenza vaccines, Vero cells have been widely approved for manufacturing other human vaccines but MDCK cells are only licensed for influenza vaccines. Currently, there are four clades of influenza H5N1 viruses circulating in avian hosts and causing zoonotic transmission to humans. Therefore, the WHO have collaborated with reference labs to prepare vaccine seed viruses from representative viruses of the two clades for vaccine development and production 
 <xref rid="pone.0024057-World1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The current clade-1 influenza H5N1 vaccine strain (NIBRG-14), provided from the UK NIBSC (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control), is a reassortant virus containing NA and modified HA gene segments of A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) virus and the other 6 gene segments of egg-adapted high-growth A/PR/8/1934 (H1N1) virus 
 <xref rid="pone.0024057-Nicolson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The NIBRG-14 vaccine virus could grow to high titers in chicken eggs and MDCK cells but not Vero cells which is the most popular cell line for manufacturing human vaccines

 <xref rid="pone.0024057-Barrett1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Historical studies have shown that high-growth influenza viruses can be selected through continuous passages and plaque purifications in eggs and cells

 <xref rid="pone.0024057-HF1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This study was conducted to adapt the NIBRG-14 vaccine virus to grow efficiently in Vero cells.
