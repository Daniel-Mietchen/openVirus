<p>Outbreaks of avian influenza H5N1 viruses emerged in 1997 and are still killing avian hosts and causing zoonotic transmission to humans in 2011, posing the persistent threat of influenza pandemics in humans 
 <xref rid="pone.0024057-World1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Vaccination is the most cost-effective strategy to control and prevent influenza pandemics and seasonal epidemics. Most current seasonal influenza vaccines are manufactured using chicken embryonated eggs, which is labor-intensive and hard to scale up during a pandemic. Moreover, egg supply may not be available during a pandemic causing by H5N1 viruses that are highly pathogenic to chickens. Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been encouraging the development of cell-based influenza H5N1 vaccines since 2006
