<p>Virus RNA was extracted by a commercial kit (Geneaid, Taoyuan, Taiwan). The extracted virus RNA was amplified using the one-step RT-PCR (Promega, Madison,WI) for HA and NA or two-step RT-PCR (Invitrogen, USA) for the other six gene segments. Sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used in this study are available upon request. The amplified DNA was sequenced using the ABI 3730 XL DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystem Inc., Foster City, CA). Nucelotide sequences reported in this study have been submitted to public domain (accession no. GQ454861âˆ¼GQ454868).</p>
