<p>The NIBRG-14 vaccine viruses were grown in eggs by the NIBSC and supplied to Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Taiwan CDC further amplified the NIBRG-14 viruses in eggs and supplied this to the Vaccine Research and Development Center of National Health Research Institutes (NHRI), Taiwan. Vero cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, USA) and were grown in M199 medium (GibcoBRL, USA) plus 10% FBS (Moregate, Australia) within passage 135–150. The NIBRG-14 vaccine viruses were adapted with 11 passages in Vero cells supplemented with 2 µg/ml TPCK-trypsin (Sigma, USA) including 2 rounds of plaque purification in 6-well plates. The infectious virus research was conducted under biosafety level 2+ approved by the NHRI Biosafety Office.</p>
