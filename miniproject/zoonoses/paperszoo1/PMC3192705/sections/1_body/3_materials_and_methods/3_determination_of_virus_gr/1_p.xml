<p>Influenza H5N1 viruses were grown in T75 flasks supplemented with TPCK-trypsin and supernatant was harvested at day 1–5 post infection for measuring HA and infectious virus titers. For the NIBRG-14 virus strain, multiplicity of infection (MOI) were 10
 <sup>−1</sup>, 10
 <sup>−2</sup>, and 10
 <sup>−3</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/cells since the NIBRG-14 virus strain can not cause significan CPE in a lower MOI. For the Vero-adapted virus strain, MOI were 10
 <sup>−3</sup>, and 10
 <sup>−4</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/cells.
