<p>Potential of using the Veo-adapted H5N1 viruses as a vaccine seed virus was evaluated in a microcarrier-based cell culture system using serum-containing medium. Cytodex 1 microcarriers (GE Healthcare, USA) were hydrated, autoclaved, and preconditioned according to manufacturer's instruction. Growth curves of Vero cells with different culture conditions were tested in 100-ml spinner flasks (50 ml working volume) and microcarriers were sampled to count cell density every day. When the cells grew confluent on microcarriers, the H5N1 viruses were added to infect cells cultured in M199 medium supplemented with TPCK-trypsin
