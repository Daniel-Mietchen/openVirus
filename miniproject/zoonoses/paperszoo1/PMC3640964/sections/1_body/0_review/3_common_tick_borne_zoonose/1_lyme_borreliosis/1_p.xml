<p>Lyme borreliosis (LB), also called Lyme disease in China, is a natural focal disease caused by 
 <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> sensu lato
 <italic>.</italic> LB usually manifests as an acute disease. It only becomes chronic in a small proportion of patients, if left untreated. It is named after Lyme, a town in Connecticut, US, where it was first discovered in 1975 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Lyme borreliosis is widely distributed, and has been reported in more than 70 countries on five continents. Moreover, the affected area continues to expand and the incidence of this disease is on the rise [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It was first reported in China in 1985, in a forest region in Hailin County, Heilongjiang [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The peak of incidence of Lyme borreliosis appears to occur from June to August. Its main vectors are 
 <italic>Ixodes persulcatus</italic> in Northern China,
 <italic>Ixodes granulatus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ixodes sinensis</italic> in Southern China, and 
 <italic>Haemaphysalis bispinosa</italic> ticks may act as the vector in Southern China [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Human cases of Lyme borreliosis have been confirmed in 29 provinces/municipalities. As demonstrated by its occurrence, its natural foci are present in at least 19 provinces/municipalities in China (TableÂ 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The major endemic areas in China are forests in the Northeast and Northwest and some areas in North China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, and Inner Mongolia, over 3 million people suffer tick bites annually, of those, approximately 30,000 people become infected with Lyme borreliosis; approximately 10% of the new cases may turn into chronic infections over 2 to 17 years without treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It was reported that the serological positivity of LD was 1.06~12.8% in the 30,000 people randomly sampled (from approximately 20 P/A/M), with a mean positivity rate of 5.06% overall and 5.33% in the forests; the morbidity was 1.16~4.51% in the forests of Northeastern China, with a mean morbidity of 2.84% [
