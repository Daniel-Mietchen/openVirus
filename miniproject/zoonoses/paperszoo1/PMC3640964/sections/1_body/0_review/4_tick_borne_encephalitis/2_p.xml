<p>In China, TBE mostly occurs sporadically from May to August, and reaches a peak during late May and early June [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The distribution of TBE is closely related to the distribution of the tick vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Two natural foci for TBE exist in mainland China, the Northeast focus (Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Jilin) and the Xinjiang focus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Serological evidence of TBEV in 9 provinces /municipalities of Western and Southwestern China also exists (TableÂ 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). From 1980 to 1998, 2202 cases of TBE were recorded, whereas from 1995 to 1998, only 420 infections were diagnosed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Based on the statistical analysis of TBE incidence from 1952 to 1998, it appears that a peak has occurred every 5 to 7 years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The TBE incidence has obvious occupational characteristics and the occupational distribution has changed significantly in recent decades. For example, the proportion of forestry workers has declined, while the proportions of farmers, students, and domestic workers have increased [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. With the development of tourism and the disruption of forest ecological environments in recent years, the prevalence of the disease is on the rise [
