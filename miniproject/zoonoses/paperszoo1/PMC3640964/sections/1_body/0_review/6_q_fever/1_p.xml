<p>Q-fever is an acute natural focal disease caused by the Gram-negative bacterium 
 <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic>. It was first observed in 1935 in Australia and described in 1937 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Initially reported in China in 1950, Q-fever naturally spreads among wild animals (rodents) and livestock [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Its pathogens can persist in ticks for a long period of time and can be spread through eggs. Natural infections of 
 <italic>Ixodes persulcatus, Ornithodoros papillipes, Haemaphysalis campanulata, Haemaphysalis asiaticum</italic>, 
 <italic>Hyalomma asiaticum kozlovi</italic>, and 
 <italic>Rhipicephalus microplus</italic> have been observed in endemic areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In recent years, new reports revealed that Q-fever may be caused by the transmission of 
 <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic> through other methods aside from vector ticks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Unengorged ticks of the genus 
 <italic>Dermacentor</italic> collected from endemic areas in Southern Germany were detected to be negative for 
 <italic>C. burne</italic>tii using a specific nested PCR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The same result was also reported in 887 adult 
 <italic>Ixode</italic>s 
 <italic>ricinus</italic> collected from 29 different localities in Southern and Central Sweden [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. 
 <italic>C. burnetii</italic> has been reported in less than 2% of 
 <italic>I. ricinus</italic> in Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Though 
 <italic>C. burnetii</italic> bacteria were detected in more than 40 tick species (mainly of the genera 
 <italic>Ixodes</italic>, 
 <italic>Rhipicephalus</italic>, 
 <italic>Amblyomma</italic>, and 
 <italic>Dermacentor</italic>), 
 <italic>C. burnetii</italic> is easily transmitted to healthy individuals via dust or aerosols. Thus ticks may not be a necessary vector for 
 <italic>C. burnetii</italic> transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. After all, there is no good evidence that Q-fever is regularly transmitted to humans by tick-bite.
