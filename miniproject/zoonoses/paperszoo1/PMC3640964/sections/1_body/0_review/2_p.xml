<p>Tick-borne diseases are a major contributor to vector-borne diseases, and are distributed worldwide. They are mainly natural focal diseases, and most often occur in forests, bushes, and semi-desert grasslands. Globally, the number of distinct and epidemiologically important tick-borne diseases, including tick-borne encephalitis, Kyasanur forest disease, Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever, has increased considerably over the last 30 years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The vast territory, complex geography, and climate of China contribute to the abundance and diversity of ticks, thus tick-borne diseases are prevalent in most parts of China and seriously affect human health [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In recent years, tick-borne diseases have occurred in almost all Provinces/Autonomous Regions/Municipalities (P/A/M) in China and the infection rate continues to rise (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Continuous reports of emerging tick-borne disease cases in Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Anhui, and other provinces demonstrate the rise of these diseases throughout China (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) [
