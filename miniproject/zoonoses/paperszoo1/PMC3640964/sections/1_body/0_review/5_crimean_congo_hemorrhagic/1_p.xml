<p>Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), also known as Xinjiang hemorrhagic fever in China, is caused by infection with a tick-borne virus (
 <italic>Nairovirus</italic>) in the family 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>. It is widely distributed in Asia, Africa, and Europe, with a mortality of approximately 3-30% [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. CCHF was first described in the Crimea Peninsula of the Ukraine in 1944â€“1945 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The virus was isolated from the blood and tissues of patients by intracerebral inoculation of suckling mice in 1967, and the virus was later shown to have the same antigenicity and biological characteristics as the Congo virus, which was isolated in 1956 from a febrile patient in Belgian Congo (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). This led to the virus being called Crimean hemorrhagic fever-Congovirus, and later Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus [
