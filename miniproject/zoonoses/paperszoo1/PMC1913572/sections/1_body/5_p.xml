<p>Wagstrom also raises questions about the Danish experience after the antibiotic growth promotant (AGP) ban. The facts are that consumption of antibiotics for livestock production in Denmark was &gt; 200 metric tons in 1994, 160 tons in 1997 when antibiotics were last used as growth promotants for weanling and finishing pigs, and dropped to 114 tons in 2005 when this use had ceased (

Pig mortality during the last 10 years increased from 6% to 8.2%, with some of the increase attributable to the AGP-ban but much of the increase due to a new viral infectious disease (postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome) that arose in 2000 (Dahl J, personal communication).
