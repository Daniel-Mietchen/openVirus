<p>Wagstrom states her belief that the process of developing the reports was flawed; because she was not involved in the process, she likely does not know what the process was. In 2002, I convened a group of seven professors, each with decades of experience with this issue and representing environmental health, exposure analysis, occupational medicine, veterinary medicine, environmental policy, water quality, and infectious diseases. We considered existing environmental health problems associated with the industrialization of agriculture and developed goals and plans for the conference. In 2003 we submitted a grant proposal to the National Institutes of Health and, based on extramural peer-review, received a grant to host the conference. We conferred widely with experts in the field to identify those scientists actively engaged in research relevant to the conference topics. We then invited recognized scientists with peer-reviewed publications on the subjects of the workgroups to speak at the plenary session and participate in the ensuing workgroups. In addition, three state regulators provided expertise in exposure modeling. The workgroups considered the problems and formulated a set of research and policy needs that were presented to the full workshop. Based on feedback, these presentations were further developed by the workgroups into articles that were peer-reviewed by
