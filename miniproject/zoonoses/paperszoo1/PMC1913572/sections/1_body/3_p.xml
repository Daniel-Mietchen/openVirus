<p>Wagstrom states that “a true assessment of potential risk requires an assessment of exposure” and that this “has not been addressed to any extent in these reports.” This comment is particularly perplexing because each of the articles addressed exposure assessment issues, and two of the reports dealt almost exclusively with exposure assessment, monitoring and modeling of exposures, harmonization of exposure assessment methods, mixed exposures from CAFOs, and establishment of monitoring networks for characterization of exposures. Wagstrom’s suggestion that we should ignore lagoon breaches or manure pipe ruptures with regard to water quality and focus on daily operations is misguided because these events occur with regularity and lead to significant surface water contamination, fish kills, and loss of recreational use of surface waters.</p>
