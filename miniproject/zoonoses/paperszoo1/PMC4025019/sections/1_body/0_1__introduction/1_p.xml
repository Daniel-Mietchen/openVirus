<p>Communicable disease epidemiology is closely linked to pathogen ecology, environmental and social determinants, economic factors, access to care, as well as the state of country development [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-11-03894" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This has historically been mirrored in the different epidemics and new threats that have challenged humanity over time [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-11-03894" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In todayâ€™s world the development of our societies and the changes of environmental and global systems are happening at such an unprecedented scale and rapid rate that they will pose new challenges to the surveillance of infectious disease threats and the development of adaptive measures [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-11-03894" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Climate change has been shown to have and to continue to have both direct and indirect effects on communicable diseases, often in combination with other drivers, such as increased global travel and trade [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-11-03894" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-11-03894" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-11-03894" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It will therefore become more and more important to prepare for projected climate change impacts, both internationally and in Europe [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-11-03894" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], as some novel infections have the potential to spread widely and cause substantial morbidity and mortality. Public health actions are needed to prepare for the health impacts of climate change, particularly the infectious diseases ones [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-11-03894" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-11-03894" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although the impacts are predicted to be higher in developing countries than in developed ones [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-11-03894" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], it is thought that there will still be significant impacts in Europe [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-11-03894" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Mapping is important in the investigation and measurement of these changes [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-11-03894" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and a variety of analytical approaches are possible [
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-11-03894" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The impacts of climate change on infectious diseases are particularly focused on vulnerable groups [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-11-03894" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], but intervening on these groups has proven to be difficult at best [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-11-03894" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-11-03894" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].
