<p>Pathogen specific surveillance is important for some pathogens that might be climate change related, and the pathogens that are most likely to be sensitive to climate change have been proposed [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-11-03894" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Molecular surveillance uses the laboratory typing of pathogens to focus on a subset of pathogens and take action where there is an increase. ECDC initiatives on molecular surveillance are currently focusing on 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> and 
 <italic>Listeria</italic> infections. An examination of long term trends in the impact of temperature on salmonellosis showed that this had changed over time and suggested that the impacts of climate change on different serotypes as a result of raised temperature have declined more recently [

 <xref rid="B66-ijerph-11-03894" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], but this paper has not reviewed these. There are also publications relating to climate change indicators [
