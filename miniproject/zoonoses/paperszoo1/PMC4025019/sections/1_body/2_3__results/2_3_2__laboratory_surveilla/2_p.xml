<p>Both food and animal data are sometimes collected in a less systematic way than human disease data. Some EUMS have mandatory reporting (
 <italic>i.e</italic>., notification) for some or all reportable diseases both from laboratories and physicians and the number of physician reported cases are often not comparable with the number of confirmed laboratory reports for the same disease.
