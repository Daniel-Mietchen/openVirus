  <title>Host reproduction and mosquito parasitism.</title>
  <p>Seasonal patterns of relative host use (left y axis) and reproductive investment (mean ± SE) in white-tailed deer (a), great blue heron (b), and yellow-crowned night heron (c). Relative host use, the proportion of blood meals (± SE) originating from a given host in a semimonthly period, was determined by PCR-based assays identifying the vertebrate source of blood from field-collected mosquitoes over seven years (2001–2004 and 2006–2008). The number of bloodmeals identified in a period is given on the x axis.</p>
