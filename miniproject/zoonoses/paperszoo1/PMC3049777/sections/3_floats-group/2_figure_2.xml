  <title>Mate attraction and mosquito parasitism of frogs.</title>
  <p>Phenology of detectability (vocalizing males) and relative anuran host use by mosquitoes (right y axis). Relative host use, the proportion of blood meals (± SE) originating from (a) early-breeding (Spring Peeper, Leopard frog) and (b) late-breeding (Bullfrog, Green frog, Green treefrog, Grey treefrog, Pine woods treefrog) frogs, was determined by PCR-based assays identifying the vertebrate source of blood from field-collected mosquitoes over seven years (2001–2004 and 2006–2008) from a study site in Alabama, USA. Mean detectability (± SE) was calculated from monthly detection probabilities of each breeding cohort, using general linear mixed models with a binomial distribution and a logit-link. The number of bloodmeals identified in each month is given on the x axis.</p>
