<p>As in birds, the reproductive behaviors and developmental stages of mammalian prey items are likely to influence the susceptibility of individuals to mosquito attacks. In deer, age-dependent predator avoidance tactics may expose fawns to increased levels of parasitism from mosquitoes, the incidence of which can be quite high
