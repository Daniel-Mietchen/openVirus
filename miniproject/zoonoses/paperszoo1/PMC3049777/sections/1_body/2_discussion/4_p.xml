<p>For frogs, activities that increase predation risk also contribute to increased parasitism by blood-feeding dipterans. The rate of frog capture by bats is significantly higher when frogs are calling, suggesting that sexual advertisement increases predation risk 
 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Tuttle1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The same vocal advertisement is used by some frog-feeding mosquitoes and other blood-sucking flies, which eavesdrop on calling males to locate their hosts

 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Bernal1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Because calls can be the primary mechanism of mate choice by female frogs and calling is energetically expensive 
 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Ryan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, male frogs may devote so much time and energy to calling during the reproductive season that other behaviors, including defensive behaviors, are possibly reduced or abandoned. We infer that a similar mechanism generates the correlation that we observed between male calling activity and use of anurans by mosquitoes.
