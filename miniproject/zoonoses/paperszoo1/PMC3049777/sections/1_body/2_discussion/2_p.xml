<p>For animals that exhibit some form of parental care, periods of reproductive investment are likely to increase susceptibility to mosquito attack for both parents and offspring. Brooding mother birds, for example, must stay at the nest to transfer heat to young and protect them from predators 
 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Ligon1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Having to stay in a brooding position on the nest dramatically reduces the frequency and variety of defensive behaviors in which the mother bird can engage, and these defensive behaviors have been shown to greatly influence the feeding success of mosquitoes 
 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Relative feeding on brooding mother birds (versus nestlings) decreases as nestling age increases, suggesting that while brooding, mother birds are more susceptible to attacking mosquitoes 
 <xref rid="pone.0017681-BurkettCadena1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Nestling birds lack the behavioral (e.g., foot stomping and head shaking) and morphological defenses (plumage) exhibited by adult birds, causing nestling birds to be more susceptible to mosquito attack 
 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Blackmore1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In fact, the number of defensive movements performed by nestling herons increases with age, resulting in a concomitant decrease in mosquito feeding success 
 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Kale1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. These studies illustrate the various aspects of parental care and offspring development in birds which contribute to variation in mosquito feeding success throughout the nesting period.
