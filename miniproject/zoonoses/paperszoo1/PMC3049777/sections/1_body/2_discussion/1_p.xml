<p>Our data suggest that seasonal changes in patterns of host use by mosquitoes reflect the breeding cycles of their host animals. For endothermic hosts—deer and herons—we found that peaks in host use by mosquitoes were remarkably synchronized with peaks in reproductive investment. Seasonal patterns of mosquito feeding on the ectothermic hosts—frogs—on the other hand, tracked temporal peaks of calling by advertising males. Although mate attraction and post-birth/hatching behavior are quite different components of reproductive investment, both activities likely increase the susceptibility of the respective hosts to being fed upon by mosquitoes.</p>
