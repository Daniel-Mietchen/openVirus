<p>This work constitutes the first study to examine changes in species-specific host preference over time. Many other studies

 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> have examined host preference of mosquitoes, however these studies either failed to incorporate the effects of seasonal changes in host use (host use data pooled from all seasons), or examined patterns of host preference at taxonomic levels above that of species (usually order or class

 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Chavez1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Our results suggest that defensive behaviors, (or their absence), as dictated by reproductive phenology, may be even more important than host abundance in determining host availability and therefore, patterns of host use by mosquitoes. Here, we demonstrate that patterns of blood-feeding can change dramatically over relatively brief time periods and that seasonal patterns of host use by mosquitoes reflect the reproductive phenology of the host animals that are associated with changes in host defensive behaviors. These results contribute to our understanding of the biological factors which underlie seasonal patterns of host use which, in turn, drive epidemics of human disease.
