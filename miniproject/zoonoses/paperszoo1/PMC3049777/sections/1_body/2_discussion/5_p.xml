<p>Various behaviors associated with reproduction have undesirable side effects which expose animals to increased vulnerability to attacks by predators 
 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Magnhagen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. These behaviors, such as aggregation, display for mate attraction, and caring for young, which increase an animal's risk to predation are also likely to increase an animal's exposure and/or susceptibility to parasite attack 
 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Zuk1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, resulting in disproportionate feeding on a host during its reproductive phase. Indirect evidence of intense mosquito feeding during the host reproductive season can be found in the temporal ecology of mosquito-transmitted pathogens and parasites. For example, infections of mosquito-transmitted filarial worms in deer peak soon after birth 
 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Weinmann1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, suggesting that vector mosquitoes attack fawns in great numbers during the post-parturition period. In birds, mosquito-borne blood parasites reach their peak parasitemia (parasites/red blood cell) during the breeding season 
 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Allander1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, which may reflect intensive mosquito feeding on brooding and nestling birds. These findings further support our own data that indicate that intense feeding on hosts during reproductive phases drive seasonal patterns of relative host use.
