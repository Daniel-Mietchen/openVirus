<p>Relative host use was strongly associated with host reproductive biology. The most commonly utilized endothermic hosts were white-tailed deer, great blue heron, and yellow-crowned night heron, which together comprised 75% of blood meals from endothermic hosts. The remaining 25% of (endotherm) bloodmeals were split among 43 other host species (

For great-blue and yellow-crowned night herons, the host reproduction models (birds in rookery and chicks in nest, respectively) far outperformed the null models, with ΔAIC
 <sub>c</sub> values of 6.56 and 15.39, respectively, and very high likelihoods of being the best models (
