 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Cupp1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Sampling locations (resting sites) were scattered throughout the study area and throughout each habitat type to obtain representative samples from the spectrum of available mosquito and host species. Mosquitoes were aspirated weekly from natural (vegetation, animal burrows, and hollow trees) and man-made resting sites (resting boxes, fiber pots, and garbage cans)

Individual blood-engorged female mosquitoes were subjected to PCR-based assays targeting the vertebrate cytochrome B gene to identify the source of vertebrate blood
