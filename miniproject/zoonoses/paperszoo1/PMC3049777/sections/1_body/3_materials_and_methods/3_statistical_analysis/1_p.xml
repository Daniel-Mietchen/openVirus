<p>We used linear mixed-effects models fit using maximum likelihood to investigate the relationship between relative host use and host reproductive biology. Relative host use was calculated as the proportion of total blood meals originating from a given host in a given time period (semimonthly or monthly, depending on the host group). Blood meal data for each host species were summed across years prior to calculation of relative host use. All proportions were arcsine square root transformed (angular transformation) prior to analysis. For each host we fit a model containing a fixed effect for the host reproduction variable and a null model which assumed constant host use across time. In all models, we included a random intercept for the time step of each observation to control for possible autocorrelation among the data points. Models were ranked and compared using Akaike's Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AIC
