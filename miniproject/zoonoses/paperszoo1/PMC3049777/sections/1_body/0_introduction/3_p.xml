<p>Many of the host species commonly preyed upon by mosquitoes undergo dramatic seasonal variation in behavior, often associated with reproduction. Specifically, animal parents are known to exhibit changes in habitat-use, time-budget, food choice, and detectability at various stages of their reproductive cycle. Therefore, we hypothesize that seasonal changes in host use by mosquitoes reflects the life history of their most commonly utilized hosts, rather than any trait shared by members of a taxonomic class. Furthermore, because of the changes in host behavior associated with reproduction, we predict that seasonal patterns of host use are driven by temporal peaks in the reproductive biology of a few key host species.</p>
