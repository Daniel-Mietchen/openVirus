<p>Seasonal patterns of host selection by arthropods are a critical component in the amplification and spillover of arthropod-borne zoonoses 
 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Kilpatrick1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Mosquito-borne viruses, for example, circulate in populations of vertebrate reservoir hosts in annual periods of pre-epidemic virus amplification 
 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Dalrymple1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This period of virus amplification usually occurs in spring and early summer, when mosquitoes feed predominantly on birds 
 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Edman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, which are the natural reservoir hosts of pathogenic viruses such as West Nile virus, eastern equine encephalitis virus and St. Louis encephalitis virus 
 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Weaver1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Transmission of mosquito-borne viruses to humans usually occurs in late summer and early fall, when the mosquito population exhibits a shift in host use from birds to mammals
