<p>Although several hypotheses regarding seasonal shifts in host use by mosquitoes have been proposed and tested, the mechanism underlying these shifts remains elusive. The hypothesis that host-feeding patterns are due to seasonal changes in the abundance of avian hosts was not supported by field data from Florida 
 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Edman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. A second hypothesis, suggesting that host preference (olfactory attraction) changes as the season progresses, was also not supported by field data 
 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Edman2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Likewise, no evidence could be found to support a third hypothesis, which proposed that feeding patterns are the result of seasonal changes in the density and feeding success of mosquitoes 
 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. A fourth hypothesis, that host-feeding patterns are due to seasonal changes in habitat use by mosquitoes (mosquitoes forage more often in open habitats when humidity is high and are more likely to encounter hosts in open habitats), was indirectly supported by field evidence 
 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Edman2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, but the authors neglected to demonstrate that mammals were more abundant in open habitats during times of mosquito foraging. All of the above studies 
 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Edman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Edman2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0017681-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> disregard differences in the biology of each host and generalize about mosquito feeding behavior on birds and mammals. While the mosquitoes in these studies were found to feed on a diverse array of birds and mammals, only a few of the host species (3â€“5) comprised the great majority of mosquito blood meals. It therefore seems more plausible that seasonal patterns of host use are driven by mosquitoes feeding upon a few commonly utilized host species, than by mosquitoes selecting the members of the Class Aves or Class Mammalia. Moreover, apart from host abundance, none of the above studies examined the role of host biology in driving seasonal patterns of host use by mosquitoes, despite evidence that host biology affects defensive behaviors
