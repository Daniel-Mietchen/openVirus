<p>With respect to the effect of the potential difference in tracing efforts on case and non-case farms – hence a possibility of under-representation of the contacts to non-case farms, we found that, with the worst tracing efforts, the contacts to case farms would be twice as likely to be traced as those to non-case farms. This implies that, at worst, the estimated probabilities could be double their ‘unbiased’ counterparts.</p>
