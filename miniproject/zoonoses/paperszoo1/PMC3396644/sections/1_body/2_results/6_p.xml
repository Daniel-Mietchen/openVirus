<p>There were 56 traced contact pairs in which virus transmission may have occurred i.e. contacts from an infected farm to a newly infected farm. From the genetic data of the same outbreak 
 <xref rid="pone.0040929-Bataille1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, complete genetic information was available for 28 of these pairs (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040929.s001">Table S1</xref>). Using the estimated per-contact transmission probabilities and the numbers of each contact-type, we estimated that 15.96 outbreaks were explained by the traced contacts (
