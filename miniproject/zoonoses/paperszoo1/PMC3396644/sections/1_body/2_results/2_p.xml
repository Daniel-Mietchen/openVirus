<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0040929-t001">Table 1</xref>, we present a description of both the potentially infectious contacts recorded during the HPAI (H7N7) epidemic in the Netherlands in 2003 and the unknown contacts extracted for purposes of this study. In 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0040929-t002">Table 2</xref>, we present the extracted number of contacts that met our inclusion criteria and their mean estimates of the per-contact probability of virus transmission (and their accompanying 95% CI). We also present in the same table the percentage (and 95% CI) of infections potentially caused by these contacts and the results of the sensitivity analysis.
