<p>We used Mathematica 8 (Wolfram Research, Inc.) to perform the maximisation procedure. The 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) for the maximum likelihood estimates were computed using the likelihood ratio test. We quantified the contribution of the different contacts to the epidemic in terms of the number of new infections that they may have caused. This was obtained by multiplying their estimated per-contact probability with their frequency.</p>
