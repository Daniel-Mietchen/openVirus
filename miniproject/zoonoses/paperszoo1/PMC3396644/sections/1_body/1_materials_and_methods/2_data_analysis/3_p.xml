<p>In this analysis, we assumed that: 1) the ‘exposure’ period started seven days prior to and lasted until the eve of clinical suspicion, 2) the infectious period began seven days prior to the day of clinical suspicion and lasted up to seven days after stamping out, 3) the conditional probability of infection was fully dependent on the contacts indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0040929-t001">Table 1</xref>, and 4) the per-contact probability of infection by the traced contacts is independent of the distance between the source and receiving farms.
