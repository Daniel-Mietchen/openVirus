<p>We hypothesized that, during the epidemic, the tracing process may have been more rigorous on case farms compared to the non-case farms. We explored the effect of this possibility by considering a scenario where an under-representation of the contacts to the escaping farms – for example due to a more lax attitude of the tracing teams when on non-case farms – could have occurred. We estimated the maximum effect that this would have on the estimated probabilities in the following 3 steps: 1) if we let

 </inline-formula> be the tracing probability of a contact, this would be the exact probability of tracing a contact to a non-case farm if no back-tracing at all was made at the non-case farm, 2) with back-tracing in place for the case farms, the probability of tracing their contact would be

 </inline-formula> and finally, 3) the maximum bias due to under-representation occurs at the worst tracing level and would be given by
