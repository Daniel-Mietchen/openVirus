<p>We performed a sensitivity analysis to ascertain the effect, on the probability estimates, of the possible uncertainty in defining the distribution underlying the actual day of virus introduction over the assumed period. We performed this analysis by re-running the calculation with different distributions underlying the estimation of the weighting factor

 </inline-formula>. We assessed two other distributions in which the estimated weighting factors
