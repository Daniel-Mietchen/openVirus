<p>We considered four different (sets of) criteria for determining whether a contact farm pair (A, B) represents a genetic match. These (sets of) criteria differ in the level of genetic overlap required between the sequences from farm A and farm B to qualify as a genetic match. The most liberal criterion we considered was that all mutations in the virus of farm A compared to farm 1 (i.e., the first outbreak) were also found on farm B, i.e. when going from A to B no mutations are lost. This criterion is necessary because it is highly unlikely for the virus to lose mutations (i.e. undergo backward mutation) between source and receiving farms. In the other three, in addition to having no lost mutations, we permitted only a specific number/range of additional mutations: allowing no additional mutations at all, allowing ≤3 and,
