<p>In order to validate the estimated per-contact probabilities, we used the genetic data obtained by sequencing the majority of the samples collected for outbreak farms during the epidemic

In this way, we used the genetic data to validate the estimated probabilities per contact: too few or too many genetic matches would cast doubt on the estimated probabilities. The approach developed for this validation is described below and in the
