<p>With the contact inclusion criteria described under Data section, we extracted traced contact pairs, i.e. farm pairs (A, B) in which at least one contact originating from a then deemed infectious farm A to a hitherto susceptible (but ultimately infected) farm B, and occurring within the exposure period of farm B, was traced. We then used the genetic information generated from the majority of the samples taken from the affected farms during the epidemic as reported by Bataille et al. 
 <xref rid="pone.0040929-Bataille1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> in Figure S2 of their Supporting Information to identify which pairs had virus sequences for both farms. For those pairs (i.e., with complete genetic information), we compared their genetic sequences to ascertain which ones were sufficiently “matching” for transmission between A and B not to be unlikely. The number of genetically matching pairs, minus an estimate of the expected number of “by-chance” genetic matches, was then compared to the predicted number of pairs (amongst those with complete genetic information) in which virus transmission occurred (“transmission pairs”)

 </inline-formula>. This number was estimated from the overall expected number by scaling it according to the expected contribution of the 28 contacts, relative to that of the 56, based on the estimated probabilities.
