<p>For each farm (infected or not) in the dataset, we extracted (and tabulated) all its exposures. In the summary table for the analysis, we indicated, for each contacted farm, the type and number of exposures as well as its ultimate status. A farm was deemed exposed if the visit occurred during the period when the virus was likely to have been introduced onto the receiving farm, here referred to as the potential virus-introduction period. Due to the uncertainty about the actual day of virus introduction, both the potential virus-introduction and infectious periods were assumed to begin seven days prior to the day of clinical suspicion, corresponding to the estimated farm infectious periods during the epidemic (i.e., 7.3 and 6.9 days for the two regions affected) for the period after epidemic detection 
 <xref rid="pone.0040929-Stegeman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The potential virus-introduction period lasted until the day before clinical suspicion while the infectious period lasted up to seven days after stamping out. This extended infectiousness was based on the hypothesis that the stamping out did not immediately rid the entire farm and its surroundings of all infectious material.
