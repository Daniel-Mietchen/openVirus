<p>Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) is one of the OIE listed poultry diseases. Several epidemics involving these viruses have occurred world-wide since its first description in northern Italy in 1878

 <xref rid="pone.0040929-Lupiani1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Examples of epidemics with devastating socio-economic consequences are the 1999 H7N1 epidemic in Italy 
 <xref rid="pone.0040929-Capua1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and the 2003 H7N7 epidemic in the Netherlands

 <xref rid="pone.0040929-Stegeman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Consequences of these epidemics include economic losses incurred in implementing control strategies and reduction in exports as well as a risk of spread to humans

 <xref rid="pone.0040929-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The HPAI (H7N7) 2003 epidemic in the Netherlands involved 255 flocks; the virus was isolated in 241 of these flocks while the other 14 flocks were serologically positive

 <xref rid="pone.0040929-Stegeman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The majority of affected flocks were located in either of two areas with high poultry farm densities: one comparatively large area situated in the centre of the country, and one smaller area in the south; for more details we refer to Boender et al.
