<p>The estimated conditional probabilities of virus transmission are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0040929-t002">Table 2</xref>. In terms of per-contact risk, the estimates reveal that egg transports have the highest risk with approximately 31% chance of transmission followed by the rendering visits with a chance of transmission of 25%. The unknown contacts in the distance band of 0–1 km have the lowest risk per contact although, as is clear from the 95% confidence bounds, its estimated per-contact probability is not significantly different from those of the other unknown contact categories. We expect that the implementation of preventive culling within 1 km of an infectious farm during the epidemic 
 <xref rid="pone.0040929-Stegeman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> has had a (strong) censoring effect on the detection of infected farms with 1 km of an infectious farm, thus producing a downward bias on the transmission probability per unknown contact within 1 km. We note that the estimated per-contact probability for the unknown contacts within the distance band of 1–3 km being higher than that of the 3–10 km distance band contacts reveals a distance-dependent transmission risk similar to the one found by Boender et al.
