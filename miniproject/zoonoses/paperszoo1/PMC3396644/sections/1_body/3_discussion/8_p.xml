<p>With our contact inclusion criteria, 44 infected farms have at least one traced exposure i.e., excluding the ‘unknown’ contacts. The outbreaks that could not be linked to any known potentially infectious contact may not only be attributed to the inability to trace all targeted contacts. Rather, they may serve as a hint about the presence of other (un-targeted and hence untraced or even untraceable) mechanisms. This highlights the need to better understand the possible mechanisms of untraced transmission.</p>
