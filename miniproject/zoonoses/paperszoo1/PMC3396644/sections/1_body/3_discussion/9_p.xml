<p>It is important to realize that the probabilities estimated are conditional on the contact originating from an infectious farm and do not represent the actual risk of HPAI virus transmission by these contacts during the epidemic. We also emphasize that care should be taken when interpreting the per-contact probability estimate for the rendering contacts due to the possible correlation between this contact-type and the increased mortality which could have occurred during the silent spread period of the virus on the farm i.e., the virus could have already been circulating undetected on the receiving farms. Nevertheless, the probability estimates together with the risk-based ranking for the different contacts obtained in this study can help design better control strategies against HPAI virus transmission between-farms by these contacts.</p>
