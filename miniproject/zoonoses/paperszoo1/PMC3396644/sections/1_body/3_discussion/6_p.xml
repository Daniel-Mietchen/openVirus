<p>The pairwise comparison of the genetic information of the contact pairs (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040929.s001">Tables S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040929.s002">S2</xref>) shows that the very low numbers of new infections explained by the traced contacts in our analysis is consistent with the genetic data. This genetic data has been used to construct transmission trees in reference 
 <xref rid="pone.0040929-Bataille1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and in more detail in reference 
 <xref rid="pone.0040929-Ypma1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Our present analysis focused on estimating per contact transmission probabilities for the different between farm contact types using the contact tracing data. Note that there is no straight forward way to directly include genetic data in an estimation of the per contact transmission probabilities as the sequencing data only gives information on the case farms and not on the contact farms that escaped infection. However, both data types (i.e., genetic and epidemiological) can be combined within the same analysis to, for example, determine transmission pathways. This approach was proposed by Cottam et al. 
 <xref rid="pone.0040929-Cottam1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> in their analysis of part of the 2001 FMD epidemic in UK.
