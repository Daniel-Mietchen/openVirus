<p>Our model is designed to represent a typical population (∼5,000–10,000 individuals) of ducks (Anseriformes) that migrates twice a year between a northern breeding ground and a southern wintering ground. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000346-g001">Figure 1</xref>, the model assumes two geographically distinct sites linked by rapid migration (thick black arrows). The duration of the breeding and the wintering seasons are assumed to be the same. At the beginning of each breeding season, new susceptible chicks are added to the flock (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000346-g001">Figure 1</xref>, open thick arrow); i.e., we assume pulsed reproduction.
