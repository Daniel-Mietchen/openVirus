<p>Many important infectious diseases persist on a knife-edge: rapid rates of transmission coupled with brief infectious periods generate boom-and-bust epidemics that court extinction. Such violent epidemic behavior has been observed in measles

 <xref rid="pcbi.1000346-Rohani1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, among others. Several distinct mechanisms have been proposed to explain the long-term dynamics and persistence of these pathogens. For example, measles persistence is primarily determined by the rate at which the susceptible pool is replenished, leading to Bartlett's concept of 
 <italic>critical community size</italic>, the minimum population size above which an infectious disease remains endemic 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000346-Bartlett1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In contrast, plague is enzootic in rodents and their fleas and thus its persistence in human populations is explained by intermittent reintroduction from the animal reservoir 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000346-Prentice1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. King et. al 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000346-King1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> argue that rapid loss of immunity to cholera may replenish the human susceptible pool so quickly that large amplitude cholera outbreaks can be observed semiannually. Finally, rich strain polymorphism allows echoviruses –responsible for aseptic meningitis– to circumvent host immunity and thus reinvade the population

 <xref rid="pcbi.1000346-Greenwood1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. These examples illustrate the need for understanding alternate persistence/re-invasion mechanisms of infectious diseases for effective management and control.
