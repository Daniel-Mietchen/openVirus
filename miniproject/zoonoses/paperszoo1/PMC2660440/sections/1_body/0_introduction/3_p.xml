<p>AIVs infect more than 90 species of birds from 13 orders, mostly Anseriformes (ducks) and Charadriiformes (shorebirds). Long-term studies of AIV prevalence in North America 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000346-Krauss1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000346-Sharp1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> have gathered time series of annual estimates that extend over 26 years for Anseriformes and 20 years for Charadriiformes. The data is stratified over influenza subtype: H3, H4, and H6 were the most prevalent subtypes isolated from Anseriformes. Most interestingly, the prevalence of infection with these subtypes as well as the aggregate prevalence exhibit recurrent outbreaks in duck populations at 2â€“4 year intervals.
