<p>Here we propose a new host-pathogen model that combines within-season transmission dynamics, with a between-season component that describes seasonal migration, reproduction and environmental variation. Analysis of deterministic and stochastic versions of this model shows that environmental transmission plays a critical role for the persistence of avian influenza and its inter-annual epidemics. We conclude that environmental transmission may provide a parsimonious explanation of the observed epidemic patterns of avian influenza in wild waterfowl.</p>
