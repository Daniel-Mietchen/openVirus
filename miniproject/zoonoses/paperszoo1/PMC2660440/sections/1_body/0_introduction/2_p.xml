<p>In this paper, we investigate the persistence and dynamics of low pathogenic avian influenza virus (AIV) in North American bird populations. Avian influenza viruses in wild waterfowl constitute the historic source of human influenza viruses 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000346-Webster1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, with a rich pool of genetic and antigenic diversity 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000346-Webster1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000346-Widjaja1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> that often leads to cross-species transmission. Perhaps the best-known and most topical example is the transmission of H5N1 avian influenza virus to humans 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000346-World1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Human infection with H5N1 is associated with a significant risk of mortality; to date, approximately 50% of infected individuals have died from the infection (see 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000346-World1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and references therein). Developing a better understanding of the ecology of avian influenza viruses is, therefore, very timely.
