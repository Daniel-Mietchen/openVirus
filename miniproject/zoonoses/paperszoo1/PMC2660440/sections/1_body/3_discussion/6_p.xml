<p>Further work is also needed to explore our modeling assumption that host populations form (nearly) closed systems. Empirical evidence suggests that the interaction between the Eurasian and American clades of migratory birds is so small (despite overlap in their Alaskan migratory routes) that their exchange of full genome influenza viruses has yet to be documented 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000346-Krauss2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. While this observation supports our modeling assumption, the data on the smaller scale interaction between flocks of migratory birds within the American continent is insufficient for validation. Alternate modeling assumptions could be explored theoretically.
