<p>Our results hold for low pathogenicity AIV. The extension to high pathogenicity AIVs, as evidenced by outbreaks in tufted ducks and pochards 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000346-Keawcharoen1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, awaits additional empirical information. Another limitation of our model is that we have restricted our consideration to a single immunological subtype that confers life-long immunity. We note that partial cross-immunity in a multi-serotype model would enhance the effective number of susceptibles and, therefore, should be expected to promote persistence. In reference 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000346-Breban1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, we address the conditions under which environmentally and directly transmitted pathogens may coexist.
