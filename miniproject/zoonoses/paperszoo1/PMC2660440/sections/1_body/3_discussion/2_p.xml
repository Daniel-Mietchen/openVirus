<p>In our full hybrid model, we observe that even small levels of environmental transmission (a few cases per year) facilitate AIV persistence. Environmental transmission rates are –on average– hundreds of times smaller than direct transmission rates, yet they appear critical in sustaining the virus. The ability of the pathogen to survive in the environment for a long time before infecting susceptible hosts may thus have profound epidemiological consequences.</p>
