<p>The actual mechanism of persistence of avian influenza in wild waterfowl may be complex, including a number of other factors such as spatial and age structures, waning immunity and strain polymorphism leading to immune escape. Several studies address the role of spatial heterogeneity in a general framework. For example, Lloyd and May 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000346-Lloyd1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> show in a metapopulation model that persistence of epidemics (asynchrony of within-subpopulation dynamics) occurs only if the immigration in between the subpopulations is small. A more recent and thorough analysis by Hagernaas et al. 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000346-Hagenaars1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> discussing both oscillatory and non-oscillatory population dynamics arrives at the same conclusion. Further modeling work is needed in order to evaluate the relative contribution of other possible persistence mechanisms.
