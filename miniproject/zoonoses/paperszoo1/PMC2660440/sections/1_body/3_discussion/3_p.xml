<p>The relative influence of environmental transmission for epidemic persistence depends on the population size. If the population is substantially larger than the critical community size, then the number of infecteds does not go to zero in between recurrent epidemics

If, however, the population is small and the number of infecteds goes to zero, then environmental transmission is a key factor in sustaining the epidemic. Thus, environmental transmission provides an epidemic persistence mechanism within populations smaller than the critical community size.
