<p>In this paper, we have explored the epidemiological dynamics and persistence of avian influenza viruses, with a view to understanding the respective roles of environmental transmission and demographic stochasticity. We have found that an

The continuous version of the model predicts unrealistic infected populations, with values as low as 10
 <sup>−8</sup> individuals (see

Including the interaction between the deterministic clockwork of the continuous system and demographic noise is fundamental in obtaining realistic dynamics (with periodicity of 2–4 years), as it is for other infectious diseases; e.g., see
