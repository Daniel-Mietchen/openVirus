 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000346-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows numerical results for a typical orbit of our deterministic model with both direct and environmental transmission mechanisms (for definitions of the technical terms in this section the reader is referred to

Panel (e) shows a period doubling and an inverse period doubling bifurcation, while no bifurcations are present in Panel (f). The position of the orbit presented on the left is marked with dotted lines.
