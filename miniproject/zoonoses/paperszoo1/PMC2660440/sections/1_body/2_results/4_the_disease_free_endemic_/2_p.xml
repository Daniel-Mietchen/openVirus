<p>For the stochastic model, the disease-free/endemic transition is defined in a more subtle way. The disease-free region is defined by all the parameter sets for which, in all of the realizations of the model, the number of infected

 </inline-formula>. In the disease-free region the probability of an epidemic is zero; however, in the endemic region, the probability of an epidemic increases from zero (close to the boundary with the non-epidemic region) toward one. Therefore, in the case of the stochastic model, it is more difficult to numerically obtain a precise border between the disease-free and the endemic regions. Here we computed the time-average of the infected over 200 years in 100 realizations of the model for a region in the (

Numerical analysis reveals that the results are robust and accurate at these parameters.) Thus, dark blue region corresponds to an epidemic probability of less than âˆ¼1% and encloses the disease-free region. Note that for the probability of a sustained epidemic to be larger than 1%, the re-scaled environmental infectiousness
