<p>Because of the way in which the disease-free/endemic transition is defined for the stochastic model, it is difficult to compare the epidemic threshold of the stochastic model with that of the deterministic model. In our case, however, we may expect that they disagree. The mean-field approximation of a stochastic model is obtained in two steps. First, one derives an infinite set of ordinary differential equations that describes how the moments of all orders of the stochastic variables change with time. Second, under the assumption that all stochastic variables are uncorrelated and normally distributed, the set of equations is truncated at the first moment (i.e., 
 <italic>moment closure</italic>) which is the expectation 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000346-Bailey1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Disagreement between a stochastic model and its mean-field approximation is expected if the assumptions on normality or correlations are violated. This typically happens when any of the population compartments is small. Here, the disagreement at low numbers of infecteds might be particularly enhanced because of the fact that the continuous model allows for the number of infected birds to be less than one so that we always have two different transmission routes of avian influenza. When the epidemic is at its nadir in the continuous model, the direct transmission rate does not vanish (the number of infected always stays larger than zero even though it may be substantially smaller than one) and thus the the chain of transmission is maintained by both direct and environmental transmission mechanisms. In contrast, in the stochastic model the numbers of infecteds often reaches zero. Therefore, AIV maintenance is exclusively due to environmental transmission. We thus expect that the disease-free region of the stochastic model is larger than that of the deterministic model.
