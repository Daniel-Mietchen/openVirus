<p>To understand the extinction and persistence dynamics of avian influenza we integrated the stochastic version of the model. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000346-g003">Figure 3Aâ€“C</xref> show the number of susceptibles, infected and recovered versus time, respectively, in a simulation of our stochastic model. In this case, the infected population often goes extinct and the epidemic is then reignited by environmental transmission. In direct contrast to the predictions of the deterministic model, a major epidemic does not occur every two years as such an event is sparked probabilistically (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000346-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In general, the periodicity of stochastic orbits is larger than that of corresponding deterministic orbits. If an epidemic does not occur then susceptibles continue to build up and the next epidemic will thus be more severe. Note that the incidence peaks of the sporadic epidemics of the stochastic model are higher than those of the biannual epidemics of the continuous model by about a factor of three. The Fourier power spectrum density of the infected time series clearly shows a sequence of peaks corresponding to the annual inflow of susceptibles;

The Fourier transform does not appear to provide a very insightful characterization of the epidemic dynamics owing to tall and narrow prevalence peaks that do not occur at very regular intervals.
