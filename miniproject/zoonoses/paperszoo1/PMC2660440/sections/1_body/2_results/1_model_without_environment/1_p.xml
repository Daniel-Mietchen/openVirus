<p>As a baseline, we first explored a simplified model that includes fecal/oral transmission, migration, seasonality and pulsed reproduction, without environmental transmission. Whether stochastic or deterministic, this model is unable to reproduce the recurrent pattern of avian influenza epidemics. The continuous model shows unrealistic infected populations as low as 10
 <sup>âˆ’8</sup> individuals (see
