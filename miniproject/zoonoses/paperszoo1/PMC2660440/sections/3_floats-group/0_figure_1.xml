  <p>The decay curves of the virus during winter and summer are sketched in blue and red, respectively. The corresponding symbols of the viral persistence rates within each ground are also illustrated. The persistence rates of avian influenza strains in the breeding and wintering grounds are quite different because they increase strongly with the temperature of the environment. Since water temperatures where the ducks are present (i.e., breeding grounds in the summer and wintering grounds in the winter) may be similar, we chose the corresponding persistence rates to be similar, as well. The persistence rate is much reduced (i.e., the persistence time of the virus increases) in the breeding grounds during the winter as the temperature drops. Also, the persistence rate is significantly increased (i.e., the persistence time of the virus decreases) in the wintering grounds during the summer as the temperature increases.</p>
