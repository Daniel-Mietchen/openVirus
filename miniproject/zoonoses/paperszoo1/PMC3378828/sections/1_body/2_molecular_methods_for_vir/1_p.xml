<p id="par0025">Many classical methods of viral discovery such as cell inoculation and monitoring for cytopathic effects can yield pure viral cultures, but are subject to the availability of susceptible cell lines and infectious inoculums. The introduction of molecular methods has greatly simplified the genome characterization of both known and emerging or previously unrecognized viruses. Consensus PCR, targeting conserved viral genome regions, [
 <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] can be used to rapidly screen large numbers of samples for any group of related viruses such as herpes viruses [
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], astroviruses [
 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and enteroviruses [
 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The downside of this sensitive method is the requirement for a priori knowledge of which viral family is likely to be present in order to avoid the need for numerous PCR primer sets targeting a large number of different viral families. Rolling circle amplification preferentially amplifies circular DNA viral genomes and has greatly enhanced their discovery but is less efficient for linear DNA or RNA genomes [
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Microarrays spotted with oligonucleotides of the most conserved viral regions have also been highly successful but are limited by the amount of mismatch they can tolerate such that highly divergent species (relative to those previously known and spotted on arrays) may not hybridize [
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">31•</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Random nucleic acid amplification with or without prior enrichment for viral particles [
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], followed by DNA sequencing (including next generation sequencing) and in silico similarity searches for sequence related to those of known viruses has been highly productive [
 <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">50•</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr">53•</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This metagenomic approach is limited by the need for novel viral sequences to show detectable protein or nucleic acid sequence similarity to those of the many already sequenced viruses.
