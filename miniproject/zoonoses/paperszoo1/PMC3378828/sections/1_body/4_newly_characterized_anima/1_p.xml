<p id="par0050">While the rate of viral discovery has greatly accelerated, the epidemiological studies required to associate infections with symptoms has lagged behind due to difficulties in obtaining large numbers of the most appropriate biological samples. In order for human or animal viral vaccine development to proceed, convincing evidence of pathogenicity is required [
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0515" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Genetically characterizing novel viral genomes in diseased animals provides the information required to design high throughput PCR assays with which to compare viral prevalence in epidemiologically matched disease cases versus healthy controls (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Matching between cases and controls should optimally include age, sex, location, and type of environment (e.g. high intensity farming or free range). Disease association studies as well as temporal association of symptoms with IgM detection, rising IgG can both provide evidence in support of pathogenicity. Disease induction following animal challenge with the purified virus amplified in cell culture, or other pure virus inoculum can directly demonstrate disease causation (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Complicating factors to be considered which may influence clinical outcome include variable host genetics, passive immunity due to maternally acquired antibodies, cross-protection by prior infections with related but less pathogenic viruses, and co-infections with other agents. Repeatability in independent studies can also validate prior conclusions. The severity of symptoms and their frequency must also be onerous enough to justify the cost of vaccine development, efficacy testing under realistic conditions, and ultimately large-scale vaccination.
