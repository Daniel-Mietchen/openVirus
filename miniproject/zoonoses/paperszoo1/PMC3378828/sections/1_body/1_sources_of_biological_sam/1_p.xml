<p id="par0010">Specimens to analyze for new viruses include those from animals with diseases affecting farm productivity or the survival of critically endangered or threatened species. Farmers, with their extensive knowledge and experience of animals, can readily identify new health problems. The health of animals in zoos and aquariums is also of interest given their high level of care, the diverse viral exposures they may experience, and their close proximity to human handlers. Companion animals, due to their extensive health care and close contact with owners may also be a readily accessible source of animal samples for pathogen discovery. Shelters for abandoned or feral animals, because of their crowded conditions and the high susceptibility to infections of their often undernourished and weakened residents also provide a fertile breeding ground for viral epidemics and pathogen discovery (
