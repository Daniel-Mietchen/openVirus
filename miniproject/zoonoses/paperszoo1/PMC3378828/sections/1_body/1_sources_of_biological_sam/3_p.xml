<p id="par0020">Bats, rodents, and primates are notorious sources of zoonotic infections, possibly a result of their very large colony sizes facilitating maintenance of viral transmission chains, frequent association with humans, and their close genetic relatedness to humans respectively. The consumption of wild animals as bush meat, particularly of non-human primates, also provides a portal of entry of animal viruses into human populations [

 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Large unbiased or viral family specific surveys of these and other mammalian groups to characterize their viruses will enhance our understanding of the original animal reservoirs of many current human viruses. Viral infections may be mostly asymptomatic in their long-term hosts, but pathogenic in a new host species. Viral metagenomics and more virus family specific surveys have therefore been used to characterize viral populations in both sick and healthy animals [

Including probes from the growing number of viral genomes on micro-arrays also allows simultaneous disease association studies for multiple viruses using animal (and human) cohorts. The availability of biological samples from large numbers of epidemiologically matched unexplained disease cases and healthy controls is likely to be a major limiting factor for determining which of the rapidly growing number of animal viruses are likely pathogens and therefore targets for transmission control measures or vaccine development.
