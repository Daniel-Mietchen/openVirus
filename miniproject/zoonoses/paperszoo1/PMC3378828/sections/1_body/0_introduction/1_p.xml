<p id="par0005">The rate of viral discovery has recently increased due to the introduction of next generation sequencing technologies and the analyses of biological samples of diverse geographic origins from multiple host species. By 2006 the number of known human viral species was estimated at approximately 180 [
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In 2009 the number of all ICTV defined viral species, including both eukaryotic viruses and bacteriophages, stood at approximately 2200 (

Compared to the sustained efforts in human virus discovery, viruses infecting other species, including &gt;4200 species of mammals [
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], have been greatly under-sampled. While the number of known, globally prevalent human viruses (excluding geographically restricted and emerging viruses), may eventually reach a plateau, the rate of discovery of animal viruses is expected to rapidly increase. The generation of more fully characterized animal viral genomes, from more host species, will improve our understanding of viral evolution, cross species transmissions, and will provide new opportunities for animal vaccine development particularly for domesticated and endangered wild species.
