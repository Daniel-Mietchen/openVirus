<p id="par0035">The wide diversity of viruses capable of switching host species therefore highlights the difficulty in predicting from which viral family will emerge the next human viral pandemic. Because increasing genetic distances between hosts is a significant block to cross species transmission [

 <xref rid="bib0400" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0405" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], there has been a focus on identifying viruses and immune response shared between non-human primates and people exposed to them [

Since the frequency and intensity of viral exposure can also be expected to increase the likelihood of cross-species transmission, the study of viruses in farm or companion animals with extensive contact with both humans and wildlife should also uncover viral species of concern for future zoonoses. Sero-surveys for antibodies to these viruses would reveal the extent of their replication in highly exposed humans. Arboviruses also present a growing threat as seen with resurgent West Nile, Dengue, Japanese encephalitis and Chikungunya viruses following introductions in new locales or extension of the range of their insect vectors [

Vaccinating animal reservoirs for some arboviruses could warrant considerations to reduce spill-over infections into humans.
