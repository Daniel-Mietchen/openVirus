 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Initially, cross-species transmissions are thought to result in weakly adapted viruses that through mutations may evolve to increase their pathogenicity and transmissibility in the new host species. A well understood example of cross-species transmission is of a feline parvovirus adapting to dogs in the late 1970s followed by its global spread and increase in pathogenicity [
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Mutations in the feline parvovirus surface glycoprotein allowed infection and transmission in dogs [

 <xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">58••</xref>]. Further adaptation of the original canine parvovirus may have occurred through intermediate species such as raccoons [
 <xref rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The emergence of HIV1 groups M and N from chimpanzees, HIV group P from gorillas and HIV2 from sooty mangabeys, most likely through bush meat hunting, butchering, and consumption is also generally accepted [

 <xref rid="bib0310" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0315" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. SIVcpz, the presumed progenitor of HIV, may itself be a recombinant of two retroviruses from monkeys preyed upon on by chimpanzees [
 <xref rid="bib0320" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Influenza viruses are especially notorious for their ability to transfer from birds to mammals such as pigs, that can act as intermediate hosts, facilitating recombination with porcine influenza viruses before transmission to humans [

 <xref rid="bib0325" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0330" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Bats and rodents appear to be frequent sources of viral zoonosis but the very high number of these animal species and their global distribution makes a systematic determination of their viromes difficult. The genetic characterization of viruses per se in these frequent virus donor species does not a priori provide information regarding the likelihood of successful transmissions to human. Zoonoses are dependent on complex interactions between viral phenotypes and host genetics (particularly surface receptors and innate immune responses), cross-neutralization by antibodies to related viruses, and epidemiological factors influencing viral exposures. The high mutability of viral genomes indicates that, provided some chronic low-level replication occurs in a new host species, these viruses have the potential to further adapt increasing both their viral load and the possibility of transmission in that species. The diversity of emerging or re-emerging human viruses such as HIV (
 <italic>Retroviridae</italic>) and the SARS virus (
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>) that are transmissible between humans, zoonotically acquired viruses capable of only limited transfer between humans such as the Ebola virus (
 <italic>Filoviridae</italic>) and Lassa virus (
 <italic>Arenaviridae</italic>), ‘dead end’ zoonoses without the necessary adaptation to facilitate ongoing transmission between humans such as rabies virus (
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>), Hendra virus (
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>), and monkeypox virus (
 <italic>Poxviridae</italic>), as well as the arthropod vectored West Nile and Japanese encephalitis viruses (
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>), and Chickungunya virus (
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>), indicate that sequence members of any of the known viral families infecting animals could potentially become epidemic in humans. The recent demonstration of an adenovirus (
 <italic>Adenoviridae</italic>) from a titi monkey outbreak of respiratory symptoms infecting a scientist at a primate center and this person transmitting the virus to a human contact, further illustrates the wide range of viral families that can be considered capable of at least some level of replication in multiple host species [

 </xref>]. This study exemplified the speed with which an adenovirus could be transmitted from an unknown host to titi monkey, between titi monkeys, from a titi monkey to a human and between at least two humans. Some genotypes of hepatitis E virus (
 <italic>Hepiviridae</italic>) are capable of oral-fecal transmission between human while other genotypes are acquired by consuming infected animal meat, but are inefficiently transmitted between human [
 <xref rid="bib0340" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0345" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Simian foamy and T-lymphotropic viruses (
 <italic>Retroviridae</italic>) that have infected persons exposed to non-human primates can also be considered as viruses constantly ‘probing’ human populations but that, unlike HIV1 and HIV2, have not adapted sufficiently to be transmitted between humans [

 <xref rid="bib0370" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0375" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Certain human viruses such as influenza (
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>) are periodically acquired directly from avian or mammalian hosts. The highly lethal H5N1 influenza circulating in birds is currentlyy poorly transmissible between humans or between other mammals although rapid passage experiments in ferrets or direct mutagenesis have exposed its latent capacity to rapidly increase its pathogenicity and transmissibility [
