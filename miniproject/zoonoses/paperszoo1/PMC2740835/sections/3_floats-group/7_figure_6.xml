  <title>Inferred phylogeny, demographic history and root location for Africa rabies virus.</title>
  <p>(A) MCC phylogeny with branches colored according to the most probable posterior location of their child nodes; superimposed under the phylogeny lies the inferred demographic history. (B) Root location posterior probabilities are shown for the standard discrete model (opaque) and for the BSSVS extension with, in addition, distance-informed priors on the infinitesimal migration rates (transparent). The distance-informed priors in the latter had little impact on the results (data not shown). Both the height and width of the cylinders are proportional to root location posterior probability; the same colors as the tree branches in (A) are used. The maps are based on satellite pictures made available in Google Earth (
