  <title>West African dog rabies virus migration over the last three decades.</title>
  <p>The different panels represent temporal projections of reconstructed migration events every 15 years: A) 1977, B) 1992 and C) 2007. In these projections, each MCC branch is again translated into a geographic link that connects the branch's most probable starting and ending location states. The panels only show migration events or partial migration events that have occurred up to a particular date, assuming that the virus migrates at a constant rate over the inferred time span of the branch. The maps are based on satellite pictures made available in Google Earth (
