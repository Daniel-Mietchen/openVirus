  <title>Bayes factor test for significant non-zero rates for the combined HA and NA analysis.</title>
  <p>Only rates supported by a BF greater than 3 are indicated. The color and thickness of the line represent the relative strength by which the rates are supported; thin white lines and thick red lines suggest relatively weak and strong support respectively. The maps are based on satellite pictures made available in Google Earth (
