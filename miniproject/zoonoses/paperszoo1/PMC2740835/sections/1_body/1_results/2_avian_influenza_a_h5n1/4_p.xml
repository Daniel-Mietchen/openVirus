<p>Despite different time scales for HA and NA, most probable location states agree on Guangdong as the predominant location of these sequences throughout the majority of their evolutionary history. As an indication of the A-H5N1 epidemic origin, we consider the inferred location at the root of the trees (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000520-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In the HA tree, Guangdong and Hong Kong share a vast majority of the posterior mass, neighboring locations in which surveillance efforts report early Avian influenza cases 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000520-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000520-Subbarao1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In the NA tree, although Hong Kong and Guangdong still obtain marginally higher support than other locations, all posterior root state probabilities are much closer to their prior probability. The substantially deeper NA root explains this difference as the depth greatly increases uncertainty on the root state. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000520-t001">Table 1</xref> quantifies differences in ancestral state reconstruction uncertainty between the HA and NA trees using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence measure (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The NA tree results in considerably lower KL divergence than the HA tree, signifying a much smaller deviation of the posterior distribution of the root location from the prior. However, lack of phylogeographic structure in the data does not contribute to this difference because the NA trees return a lower association index (AI). This measure of spatial admixture is based on a sum across all nodes in the tree of the complement of the frequency of the most abundant location among all descendent taxa weighted by the depth of the node in the tree 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000520-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, and thus bears some relationship with an entropy value for descendent taxa locations. The AI rescales this sum by its expectation for randomized location assignments and results in low values for relatively strong phylogeny-locality correlation whereas AI values close to one reflect complete spatial admixture. If the basal Hong Kong clade and a chicken strain from Hebei have indeed acquired a different NA through reassortment, the root state might be difficult to interpret for NA and is not necessarily the same as that for HA. Therefore, we also list uncertainty measures for the marginal posterior distribution of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the Gs/GD lineage, named after the A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 strain very close to this node (indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000520-g001">Figure 1</xref>). KL divergence is again lower for this node in the NA phylogeny, but the difference is not as pronounced as for the root node.
