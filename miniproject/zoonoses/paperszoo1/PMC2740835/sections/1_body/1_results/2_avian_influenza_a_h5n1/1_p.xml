<p>To reconstruct the spatial dispersion patterns of Avian influenza A-H5N1, we analyze the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene datasets previously compiled by 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000520-Wallace2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Both datasets contain whole gene sequences from 192 A-H5N1 strains sampled from 20 localities across Eurasia. 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000520-Wallace2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> explore these genes individually, as well as concatenated together, through a strictly parsimony-based ancestral reconstruction method. Our Bayesian approach builds upon stochastic models and naturally affords quantification of uncertainty in both the ancestral state reconstructions and the underlying phylogeographic process. Further, as we are able to infer plausible root positions unlike the original analysis, we are not required to include outgroup sequences. To model sequence evolution, we employ the 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000520-Hasegawa1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> (HKY85) CTMC model of nucleotide substitution; we include discrete gamma-distributed rate variation 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000520-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and assume an unknown, constant population-size coalescent process prior over the unknown phylogeny 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000520-Kingman1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Exploratory analyses using the less restrictive Bayesian skyline plot model indicate that the demographic prior has little influence on the phylogeographic inference (data not shown).
