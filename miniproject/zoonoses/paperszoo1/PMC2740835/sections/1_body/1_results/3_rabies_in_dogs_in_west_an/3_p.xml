<p>Although geographic origins remain elusive, we are able to identify locations that are epidemiologically linked using the BF test under BSSVS (

 </inline-formula>3. The resulting migration graph is markedly parsimonious with a distinctive East-West axis running along the Southern border of the Saharan desert. To glean how this graph reflects the migratory process acting along the rabies phylogeny, panel B projects each of the branches of the MCC phylogeny onto the geographic map. In this projection, we translate each branch into a geographic link that connects the branch's most probable starting and ending location states. The height of a link represents the relative length of the time elapsed on the link's corresponding branch, while the color gradient reflects the relative age of the migration. Many recent (magenta) migration events that occur in a relatively short time contribute to the well-supported East-West axis.
