 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000520-g006">Figure 6A</xref> illustrates the location-annotated MCC phylogeny and demographic history for the African dog rabies lineages. We make this initial inference without either BSSVS or a distance-informed prior. To allow for variation in the underlying coalescent process giving rise to the phylogeny, we assume a piece-wise constant multiple change-point model on the effective population-size with 20 coalecent-interval groups

 <xref rid="pcbi.1000520-Bourhy2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, there exists strong signal of phylogenetic clustering according to sampling location. This observation is also reflected in a low AI (0.087 [0.043â€“0.132]). In contrast to the influenza phylogenies, however, there is no single location for which sampled sequences are phylogenetically dispersed throughout the whole phylogeny. Together with the relative deep time scale of the phylogeny and the absence of sequences sampled closer to the root, this hampers precise inference of the location state at the root. The root state posterior probabilities for all locations range between 0.059 and 0.125, with Chad and Guinea receiving the highest probability (0.115 and 0.124 respectively). These two locations are geographically distant from each other, but they both host viruses from the most basal lineage in the phylogeny (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000520-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Root inference is somewhat different using BSSVS and a distance-informed prior on the rates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000520-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). In this case, a more central location, Niger, obtains the highest posterior probability (0.144) but the KL divergence for the root state reconstruction is only marginally greater than zero (0.0645). The exploitation of BSSVS contributes to this effect; as for Avian influenza A-H5N1, distance-informed priors, alone, on the rates have little impact (data not shown).
