<p>Phylogenetic inference from molecular sequences is becoming an increasingly popular tool to trace the patterns of pathogen dispersal. The time-scale of epidemic spread usually provides ample time for rapidly evolving viruses to accumulate informative mutations in their genomes 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000520-Holmes1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. As a consequence, spatial diffusion—among other processes—can leave a measurable footprint in sampled gene sequences from these viruses 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000520-Holmes1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Reconstructing both the evolutionary history and spatial process from these sequences provides fundamental understanding of the evolutionary dynamics underlying epidemics, e.g.

 <xref rid="pcbi.1000520-Russell1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. It is also hoped that these insights can be translated to effective intervention and prevention strategies 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000520-Wallace1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and elucidating the key factors in viral transmission and gene flow over larger distances is central in formulating such strategies, e.g.
