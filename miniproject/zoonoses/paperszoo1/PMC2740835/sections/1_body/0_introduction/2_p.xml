<p>Phylogeographic analyses are a common approach in molecular ecology, connecting historical processes in evolution with spatial distributions that traditionally scale over millions of years

 <xref rid="pcbi.1000520-Templeton1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> can be remiss in ignoring the interaction between evolutionary processes and spatial-temporal domains. One first reconstructs a phylogeny omitting spatial information and then conditions the phylogeographic inferences on this reconstruction 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000520-Holmes1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000520-Lanciotti1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, exploiting non-parametric tests to evaluate the significance of this conditional structure, e.g. 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000520-Slatkin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000520-Parker1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000520-Zarate1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. To draw conclusions about the epidemic origin or epidemiological linkage between locations, however, we require a reconstruction of the dispersal patterns and process throughout the evolutionary history. Considering locations as discrete states, this boils down to the well-known problem of ancestral state inference 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000520-Slatkin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Parsimony is a popular heuristic approach to map characters onto a single phylogenetic tree 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000520-DSwofford1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Unfortunately, parsimony reconstructions ignore important sources of model uncertainty, including both uncertainty in the dispersal process as well as in the unknown phylogeny 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000520-Ronquist1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In addition, minimizing the number of state exchanges over a phylogeny is misleading when rates of evolution are rapid and when the state exchange probabilities are unequal
