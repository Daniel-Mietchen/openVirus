 </inline-formula> possible transitions have non-neglible probability of occurring and are observed over the evolutionary history. Such is unlikely to be the case for geographical locations; given that there may be many sites and each taxon only has one location (the equivalent of just one single alignment site), we expect most transitions to rarely, if ever, occur. Consequentially, we suspect

 </inline-formula>. BSSVS enables us to simultaneously determine which infinitesimal rates are zero depending on the evidence in the data and efficiently infer the ancestral locations. As a beneficial by-product of BSSVS, directly quantifying the evidence about which rates are non-zero furnishes both the most likely migration patterns and the ability to test between competing migratory hypotheses.
