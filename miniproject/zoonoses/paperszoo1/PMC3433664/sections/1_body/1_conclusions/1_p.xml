<p>It is clear that nuclear technologies have contributed significantly to livestock health research, and their refinement and development has led to methods for diagnosis that are of direct assistance to the farmer. Modern molecular techniques for diagnosis and characterization of DNA owe their development to the earlier use of radiolabeling to carry out the tests. The aim of this review is to enable an appraisal of these technologies and perhaps allow researchers to re-examine them and determine if they can complement what are regarded today as “state of the art technologies”. For instance, stable isotope analysis and molecular characterization can both be used in typing of strains of microorganisms, providing information on environmental parameters on the one hand and the genetic makeup of the organisms on the other. Stable isotopes can also be used to look at animal movements and could have application in addition to tracking the movements of wild birds by tracing outbreaks of transboundary diseases that have arisen from the movement of livestock or incursions of infected wildlife into livestock-rearing areas. It is essential that the research outcomes are translated to the farmer, thereby contributing to food security. A major challenge in the development of such new technologies is in ensuring that they are suitably modified so that they can be easily transferred to developing countries; the Joint FAO/IAEA Division will be in the forefront of enabling this to occur.</p>
