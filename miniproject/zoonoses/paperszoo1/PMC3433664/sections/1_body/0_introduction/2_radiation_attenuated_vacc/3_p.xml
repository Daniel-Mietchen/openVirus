<p>Although only a small number of veterinary vaccines have been produced by using radiation attenuation, it is worth re-examining the potential of the process since it has been a considerable time since there has been any significant investigation. Also, a number of recent innovations in technology suggest that it could provide a viable alternative to other attenuation techniques, particularly with pathogens where recombinant vaccines have not yet delivered effective products. For instance, considerable success is being achieved in the development of an anti-malarial irradiation-attenuated sporozoite vaccine (Hoffman et al.
