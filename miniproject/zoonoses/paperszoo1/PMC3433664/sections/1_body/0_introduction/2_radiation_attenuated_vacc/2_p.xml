<p>Gamma irradiation is one of the most effective means of sterilization, having been applied to ensure biological safety of food products, pharmaceuticals, and for inactivation of dangerous pathogens to enable their safe handling. The Joint FAO/IAEA Program first promoted discussion and scientific exchange on the value of radiation attenuation to develop vaccines against animal parasites nearly 50Â years ago (IAEA 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">1964</xref>). In a series of Expert Meetings, the subject was discussed extensively and a wide range of parasitic organisms including 
 <italic>Dictyocaulus</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Ancylostoma</italic>, 
 <italic>Echinococcus</italic>, 
 <italic>Schistosoma</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Fasciola</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Haemonchus</italic>, 
 <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Anaplasma</italic>, 
 <italic>Babesia</italic> spp, and 
 <italic>Theileria</italic> spp. were identified as potential targets for the development of irradiated vaccines (IAEA

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">1973</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">1981</xref>). This avenue of research was eventually put into abeyance, principally owing to the advent of molecular technologies that offered the possibility of identifying specific protective molecules that would confer resistance and could then be genetically engineered to produce a vaccine. This search for new vaccines has led to novel strategies including peptide vaccines, recombinant vector vaccines, gene-deleted vaccines, marker vaccines, DNA vaccines, synthetic vaccines, and edible vaccines. There have been some highly successful outcomes; recombinant vaccines have been developed which can prevent infection in domesticated livestock infected with 
 <italic>Taenia ovis</italic>, 
 <italic>Taenia saginata</italic>, 
 <italic>Taenia solium</italic>, 
 <italic>Taenia multiceps</italic>, and 
 <italic>Echinococcus granulosus. T. ovis</italic> and 
 <italic>T. saginata</italic> are economically significant parasites while 
 <italic>T. solium</italic> and 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> are zoonotic diseases and the vaccines are useful for treating animals to prevent human infections (Lightowlers 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2006</xref>; Lightowlers et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2003</xref>; Gauci et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2008</xref>; Petavy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2008</xref>). Other significant developments have been in viral vaccines, e.g., rabies (Lubroth et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2007</xref>) and in protection against 
 <italic>Boophilus</italic> ticks (Canales et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2009</xref>). Against other pathogens, such as 
 <italic>Babesia</italic> and 
 <italic>Theileria</italic>, although protective antigens have been identified, effective vaccines have not materialized (Brown et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2006</xref>) and vaccination dependent on infection and treatment methodologies is still in use (Morrison and McKeever 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2006</xref>; Di Giuolo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2008</xref>). Similarly, in spite of the considerable success with cestode parasite vaccines, there has been no similar development with trematode and nematode parasites (Hein and Harrison 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2005</xref>). It is likely that protective subunit vaccines will require the inclusion of multiple immunogenic proteins for them to be effective, considerably complicating the task of creating effective immunogenic antigens. One of the advantages of live, attenuated vaccines, and a reason to re-investigate the potential of radiation attenuation, is their potent immunogenicity since the organisms are still able to replicate and behave initially in a similar manner to a natural infection, thereby stimulating the immune system to secrete the immunoregulatory products and induce the cellular activation that would normally occur. Such vaccines are sometimes produced locally and are not therefore commercially available products; examples include 
 <italic>Eimeria</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, 
 <italic>Babesia bovis</italic>, 
 <italic>Babesia bigemina</italic>, and 
 <italic>Theileria annulata</italic> (Vercruysse et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">2007</xref>). In fact, the most successful category of vaccines presently in use against major transboundary, infectious animal diseases such as foot and mouth disease, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, Rift Valley fever, etc. are live vaccines, including attenuated vaccines (Lubroth et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2007</xref>). Indeed, one of the most successful veterinary vaccines is the attenuated tissue culture vaccine that was used in the control and eradication of rinderpest. Thus, in spite of the considerable research effort into developing recombinant vaccines, conventional vaccine technology still plays a major role in combating animal diseases (Lubroth et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2007</xref>).
