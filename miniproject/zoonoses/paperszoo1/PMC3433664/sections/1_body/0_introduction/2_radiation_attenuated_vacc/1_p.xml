<p>Vaccination is a cost-effective way of controlling animal disease. In the case of viral diseases, it might be the only way to control them successfully in the absence of alternative therapies. Bacterial and parasitic diseases can sometimes be controlled by antibiotics and chemotherapeutics, but these have their limitations, as reinfection can still occur, and it may be necessary to continually treat animals. Also, the increased incidence of antibiotic and drug resistance as well as the presence of residues in food for human consumption emphasizes the importance of seeking alternative methods of control. Hence, there is a strong argument to develop vaccines, especially for parasitic diseases, where presently long-term drug treatment, with all its potential problems, might be the only way to prevent disease. Although anti-viral and anti-bacterial vaccine development has been quite successful, this is not the case for vaccines against parasitic diseases and there are only a few commercially available products.</p>
