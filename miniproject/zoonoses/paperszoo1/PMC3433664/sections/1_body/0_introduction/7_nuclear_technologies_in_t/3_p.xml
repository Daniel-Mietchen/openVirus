<p>Enzyme immunoassays, in the format of antigen- or antibody-coated microtiter plates, sometimes using monoclonal antibodies and recombinant antigens, became a mainstay for animal disease diagnosis. APU pioneered the development of assays to diagnose a number of infectious and parasitic diseases and create the infrastructural basis to enable MS to provide diagnostic processes that were reliable, accurate, and quality controlled. This has been a major contributory factor in the successful deployment of tests for a number of major livestock diseases including foot and mouth disease, brucellosis, rinderpest, and animal trypanosomiases, and their use in major control or eradication campaigns.</p>
