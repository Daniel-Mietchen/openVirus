<p>Serological diagnostic tests, however, even quantitatively highly sensitive immunoassays, still have a number of drawbacks. First, there is a lag phase from the time of infection to appearance of antibodies; second, it may not be possible to differentiate between vaccinated and infected animals; third, their diagnostic sensitivity and specificity may be sufficient to use as screening tests, but unacceptable in situations where it is necessary to confirm that livestock are free from infection following control and eradication. Monoclonal antibody-based tests can be used for direct detection of antigens but are not suitable in all situations.</p>
