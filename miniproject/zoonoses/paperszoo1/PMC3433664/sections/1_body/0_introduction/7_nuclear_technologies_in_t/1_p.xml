<p>Radioimmunoassays (RIA) were introduced some 50Â years ago, heralding a technology that enabled the measurement of minute amounts of analytes in various biological systems with specificity, sensitivity, and precision that until then was impossible to achieve. Radioactive tracers are suitable for labeling molecules because their behavior in biological reactions is identical with that of non-isotopically labeled proteins. Several different isotopes have been used including 
 <sup>14</sup>C, 
 <sup>3</sup>H, 
 <sup>125</sup>I, 
 <sup>35</sup>S, and 
 <sup>32</sup>P although most proteins, peptides, and glycoproteins are labeled with 
 <sup>125</sup>I. Radiolabels were instrumental in delivering the means by which antigens of disease pathogens (viruses, bacteria, parasites) could be identified in various host tissues and secretions by specific DNA hybridization, allowing differentiation between active and previous infections and on a more fundamental level, the potential for phylogenetic characterization and epidemiological studies.
