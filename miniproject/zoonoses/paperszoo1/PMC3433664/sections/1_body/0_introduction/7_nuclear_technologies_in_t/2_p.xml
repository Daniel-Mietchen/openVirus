<p>The term immunoassay covers the wide range of qualitative and quantitative processes involved in antigen/antibody interaction, both the binding of antigen with an antibody from which the concentration of the antigen is determined and also methods in which the aim is to detect the presence of antibody in a system. The tests that heralded the introduction of the first generation of immunoassays were isotopically based competitive methods using radiolabeled antigen; an unlabeled antigen being measured competed with known amounts of the same antigen labeled with 
 <sup>132</sup>I for binding sites on a limited quantity of high affinity antibody. Initially, these assays were used to measure insulin levels in blood, but the combination of high specificity and sensitivity of RIAs led to their widespread application not only in the field of endocrinology but also in many other fields encompassing human and veterinary medicine, environmental sciences, and the food industry, enabling the testing and detection of thousands of substances of biological importance. The use of highly sensitive DNA probes for diagnosis offered an opportunity to detect organisms that were often difficult to detect by conventional techniques and also provide specific identification since the probes were complementary sequences to the organismâ€™s own DNA. For labeling nucleic acids, 
 <sup>32</sup>P is favored because of its high energy and thus the need for only short counting times, or shorter exposure for producing autoradiographs. For disease diagnosis, RIAs were modified so that they could be used in plastic tubes or polyvinyl microtiter plates, thereby making the technology simpler. The use of plastic supports made possible further refinements and modifications that would ultimately lead to the replacement of assays relying on radionuclides with ones based on enzymes. Among the reasons for this were the potential disadvantages of isotopes due to their hazardous nature associated with radioactivity (although alternatives are not without risk viz. carcinogenic chemicals), cost of equipment, shelf-life of radiolabeled reagents, and increasing health and safety issues that required non-isotopic methods to be used if they were available. Additionally, with the demand for ultra-sensitive methods, enzyme labels, with their capacity for catalyzing reactions, were considered to be highly applicable. In addition, the non-radioactive tests could more easily be used in non-specialist laboratories and for development of penside tests.
