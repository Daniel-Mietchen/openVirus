<p>This need stimulated the creation of another wave of isotope-based technologies relying on nucleic acid hybridization to detect genetic material in host tissues. This allows direct identification of infected animals as well as, by selecting appropriate nucleic acid sequences, providing information that may be of epidemiological importance in relation to the strain type or variant of the agent. These tests depend on the preparation of suitable probes to a target DNA that is then labeled using tracers such as 
 <sup>32</sup>S or 
 <sup>32</sup>P so that hybridization to the target can be detected. Radioactive labeled probes were used in dot blot hybridization assays where denatured test samples were applied to nylon membranes. These membranes were then heat treated and a pre-hybridization step introduced before the stage of hybridization. This was carried out by incubating the membranes with the labeled DNA probe under varying buffer conditions and time and temperature conditions. After extensive washing to remove unbound reactants, the hybrids are then detected by autoradiography. These early techniques were not sufficiently sensitive to detect very low concentrations of the target molecule in clinical samples—as is the situation in infectious diseases. To circumvent this problem, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> methods of nucleic acid amplification were introduced, utilizing heat-resistant nucleic acid processing enzymes in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), where, by applying a number of cycles of amplification, there is an exponential increase in the amount of the specific target. The synthesis is carried out repeatedly in a thermal cycler to replicate the DNA. Although this technique increased the sensitivity of the tests and speeded up the hybridization stage, the detection of amplicons by autoradiography was a slow process; although exposure of film for 4–24 h was sometimes sufficient to reveal DNA, the most sensitive detection required long exposure (up to 7 days) and very low temperatures (−70°C). Obviously, the aim of diagnostics is to deliver tests that are easy to perform and for which the results are rapidly and easily interpreted; clearly, PCR in this form would not provide for rapid diagnosis, and in addition, such procedures would be difficult to transfer to laboratories in developing countries. Hence, as was the case with immunoassays, technologies that no longer relied on radioisotopes were adopted for molecular characterization. These alternative procedures use chemicals including ethidium bromide or SYBR Green that can be detected rapidly by fluorescent light, thereby speeding up and simplifying interpretation of results; hence, PCR techniques are now widely used for disease diagnosis.
