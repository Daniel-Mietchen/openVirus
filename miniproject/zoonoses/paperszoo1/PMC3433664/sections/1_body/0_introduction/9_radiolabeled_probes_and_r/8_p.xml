<p>African swine fever (ASF) viruses produce a range of symptoms in domesticated and wild pigs varying from acute to chronic disease and apparently healthy virus carriers. The presence of ASFV antibodies is indicative of infection and as they persist for long periods, they are a good marker for diagnosis of the disease. Enzyme immunoassays, immunoblotting, and indirect fluorescent antibody tests have all been used in diagnosis. Solid phase RIA using microtiter plates and 
 <sup>125</sup>I-labeled IgG has been used to detect both viral antigen and antibody (Crowther et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1979</xref>) and was shown to be 1,000 times more sensitive than an immune-electro-osmophoresis test for detection of ASFV antibody. RIA detected antibodies within 3–4 days of infection, in contrast with the gel diffusion tests that was not positive until 10 days post-infection (Wardley and Wilkinson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR186">1980</xref>). An indirect RIA was also considered to be a possible candidate for diagnosis of Aujeszky’s disease in pigs in the field, as it was found to be highly sensitive in detecting infection, and was also more rapid than a virus neutralization tests Rodak et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">1981</xref>). It could be completed in 1 or 2 days, it did not require the preparation of cell cultures and the use of aseptic conditions, and properly stored control material could be stored for up to a year without decline in effectiveness. With its high specificity and sensitivity, it was considered more reliable in detecting infected pigs earlier and more accurately than virus neutralization tests.
