<p>Definitive diagnosis of brucellosis can be made by isolation and identification of the causative organism. However, a considerable number of serological test have been developed, including primary binding assays such as RIA that have however not found wide application for routine use. RIA utilizing 
 <sup>125</sup>I-labeled immunoglobulins was able to detect both IgG
 <sub>1</sub> and IgG
 <sub>2</sub> subclass antibodies to 
 <italic>B. abortus</italic> in bovine serum, but did not react with IgM class, suggesting that it might be possible to distinguish between infected and vaccinated cattle (Chappel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1972</xref>). In measuring the serological response in cattle vaccinated against 
 <italic>B. abortus</italic>, the RIA gave positive reactions in many cases where the CFT was negative, suggesting that the RIA was more effective detecting brucellosis (Chappel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1982</xref>). In experimentally infected cattle, RIA was most sensitive in cattle that had been vaccinated and gave fewer false-negative reactions than other serological tests (Hayes and Chappel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">1982</xref>). A solid-phase RIA, utilizing 96-well microtiter plates coated with antigen and 
 <sup>125</sup>I-labeled staphylococcal protein A for detection, was considered sensitive and able to discriminate between false positives and false negatives (Lawman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">1984</xref>). Antibody detection was 16 to 32 times more sensitive than CFT and 4- to 64-fold more sensitive than the standard tube test titer. An RIA to detect class-specific antibodies to 
 <italic>B. abortus</italic> was developed using antigen bound to glass tubes and then detecting positive reactions by binding bovine antibodies with rabbit anti-immunoglobulin antiserum followed by incubation with 
 <sup>125</sup>I-labeled sheep anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Levieux 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">1978</xref>). This three-stage technique gave best discrimination between sample and background counts and was some 10,000 times more sensitive than CFT.
