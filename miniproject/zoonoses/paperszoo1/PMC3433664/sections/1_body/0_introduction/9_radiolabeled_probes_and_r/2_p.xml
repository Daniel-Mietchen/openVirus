 <italic>Cowdria (Ehrlchia) ruminantium</italic> is another rickettsia that causes serious losses to ruminants in sub-Saharan Africa, where it is transmitted by ticks of the genus 
 <italic>Amblyomma</italic>. Demonstration of the parasite in live animals or detecting them in ticks is difficult, requiring inoculation into susceptible ruminants. The parasite is not detectable by light microscopy of stained blood smears, and it requires examination of endothelial cells from biopsy or post-mortem specimens of brain tissue. A 
 <sup>32</sup>P-labeled oligonucleotide of a clone known as pCS20, derived from a Zimbabwean strain of 
 <italic>C. ruminantium</italic>, detected 
 <italic>C. ruminantium</italic> DNA in adult ticks that had been allowed to feed as larvae on infected goats, in nymphs that had fed as larvae on infected goats and in adult ticks that had fed as nymphs on infected goats (Waghela et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">1991</xref>). The probe was also used to detect 
 <italic>C. ruminantium</italic> in the midguts of male and female 
 <italic>Amblyomma hebraeum</italic> ticks, the principal vector of the parasite in southern Africa (Yunker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">1993</xref>). The probe also hybridized with DNA of four heartwater strains from Zimbabwe, two from South Africa, one from Nigeria, and another from Guadeloupe in the Caribbean (Mahan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">1992</xref>). 
 <italic>C. ruminantium</italic> DNA was also detected in infected sheep before any febrile reaction had been seen, the first clinical sign of disease. The hybridization signal varied, probably depending on the level of parasitemia in the host (Mahan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">1992</xref>). A radioimmunoassay has been described for the detection of 
 <italic>A. marginale</italic> antibodies in cattle sera (Schuntner and Leatch 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">1988</xref>). Optimal sensitivity and specificity were obtained by using two antigens, an 
 <italic>A. marginale</italic> antigen and an RBC antigen (obtained before infection was established) from the same calf. In addition, sera were pre-absorbed with RBC from healthy cattle and with sonicated 
 <italic>B. bovis</italic>. Of 86 sera obtained from cattle with proven 
 <italic>A. marginale</italic> infection, 85 had positive results by use of this test. Of 100 sera obtained from cattle raised in an anaplasmosis-free area, 98 yielded negative results, and sera obtained from 35 cattle (97 sera) infected with 
 <italic>B. bigemina</italic> and from 18 cattle infected with 
 <italic>T. orientalis</italic> yielded negative results. In 
 <italic>B. bovis-</italic>infected cattle, 99 of 100 sera were negative for 
 <italic>A. marginale</italic>. 
 <italic>A. marginale</italic> antibodies were detected in 18 cattle for 2Â years after natural infection. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were each determined to be 98.8%.
