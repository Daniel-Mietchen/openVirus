 <italic>A. marginale</italic> is a rickettsial hemoparasite of cattle that is transmitted by biological vectors (ticks) and mechanical vectors such as biting flies. The acute phase of disease causes severe anemia, weight loss, abortion, and death, but animals that recover are persistently infected with low levels of organisms that cannot be detected microscopically. These carrier animals act as disease reservoirs and are responsible for causing continual disease outbreaks. In order to understand the role that carrier animals play in disease transmission, it is necessary to use tests that are more effective than serological diagnosis in order to discriminate between active carriers and animals that merely harbor antibodies due to a prior infection; a number of nucleic acid probes have been identified that provide the means to achieve this. A 
 <sup>32</sup>P-labeled nucleic acid probe derived from a gene encoding a surface protein of 
 <italic>A. marginale</italic> proved specific for the parasite, showing no evidence of cross-hybridization with other hemoparasites (Eriks et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1989</xref>). This probe detected 0.01 ng of genomic DNA and 500–1,000 infected erythrocytes in 0.5 ml of blood. Tests with animals that were known to be carriers showed that parasitemia levels varied considerably in individuals, suggesting that animals probably differed significantly in their ability to transmit infection. The same probe was also useful in identifying infections in adult and larval stages of the ticks 
 <italic>Dermacentor variabilis</italic> and 
 <italic>Dermacentor andersoni</italic> that had been infected as nymphs or adults (Goff et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">1988b</xref>). An inhibition radioimmunoassay based on a common-stage 36-kDa antigen was used to detect 
 <italic>Anaplasma</italic> in individual or pooled infected ticks and as a sensitive quantitative assay for characterization of vertebrate and invertebrate infection (Palmer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">1985</xref>). An improved method for isolation of genomic DNA was used to label with 
 <sup>32</sup>P a recombinant probe that showed 100% specificity and sensitivity by hybridization in dot blotting and Southern blotting; it was able to detect 500–1,000 infected erythrocytes per microliter, corresponding to a parasitemia of 0.01% (Aboytes-Torres and Buening 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1990</xref>). Cloned DNA probes labeled with 
 <sup>32</sup>P have also been used to identify goats infected with 
 <italic>A. ovis</italic> (Shompole et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">1989</xref>). The DNA probe detected a parasitemia of 0.0034% in infected blood, a sensitivity that was suitable for use in surveillance and epidemiological studies.
