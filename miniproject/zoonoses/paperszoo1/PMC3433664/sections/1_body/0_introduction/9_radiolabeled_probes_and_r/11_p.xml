<p>In southern Africa, widespread infections with a virus known as equine encephalosis virus (EEV) appeared in 1967 that became a serious disease, often causing epidemics (Viljoen and Huismans 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">1989</xref>). The morphology, clinical symptoms, and pathology of this disease in horses resemble infections caused by African horse sickness virus (AHSV) thereby making diagnosis difficult. In order to obviate this problem, a number of genome-specific probes were developed that would assist in differentiating the two viruses. Different 
 <sup>32</sup>P-labeled EEV serotype-specific probes were prepared and two of them of genome segments 3 and 5 were able to differentiate between EEV and AHSV (Viljoen and Huismans 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">1989</xref>). A reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) based on the gene encoding the NS2 protein of AHSV was developed for rapid detection of AHSV. The specificity of RT–PCR products was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization using a radioactively labeled cDNA probe specific for the NS2 gene. This RT–PCR could discriminate between all known members of the AHSV and equine encephalosis virus serogroups. In an immune horse which had been vaccinated with an AHSV (serotype 4) VP2 subunit vaccine, viral RNA could be detected for up to 22 weeks post-challenge. AHSV RNA was detected in various organs of an infected horse. Viral RNA was also detected by RT–PCR in nine suspected field cases of African horse sickness in which virus was isolated from eight (Bremer and Viljoen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1998</xref>). Several 
 <sup>32</sup>P-labeled genomic probes of bluetongue virus, epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus, and EEV were used to detect virus-specified RNA in infected cells. Probes derived from the genome segment that encoded the non-structural protein NS1 were the most sensitive, detecting RNA within 2–3 h of infection (Venter et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">1991</xref>).
