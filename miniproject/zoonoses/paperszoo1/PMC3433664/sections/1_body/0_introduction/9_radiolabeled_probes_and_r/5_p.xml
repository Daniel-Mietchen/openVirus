<p>Serological tests of infected animals are rarely used for diagnostic purposes, although there is an ELISA and a PCR is also available. Nevertheless, immunoradiometric (IRMA) assays have been used as potential diagnostic tools. A solid-phase IRMA in which 
 <italic>B. anthracis</italic> spores labeled with 
 <sup>3</sup>H were used in direct and indirect tests were heat fixed on slides (Phillips and Martin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">1983</xref>). In a modification of the test, 
 <sup>125</sup>I-labelled protein A was used in an indirect IRMA (Phillips and Martin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">1984</xref>). Neither of these approaches was significantly outstanding due to erratic results and high background noise.
