<p>An indirect micro-radioimmunoassay to detect antibodies in chickens was developed for Newcastle disease using radioactively labeled rabbit anti-chicken Fab and virus-infected microcultures of chick embryo fibroblasts. The Newcastle disease virus-infected micro-cultures were formalin fixed and stored at 4°C for up to 4 months without affecting the sensitivity of the test. The micro-technique was found to be a highly sensitive and specific assay for anti-viral antibody (Cleland et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1975</xref>). Other RIAs utilized a radiolabeled membrane fraction protein, 150,000 MW to detect both antibodies and antigens of Newcastle diseases virus (Spira et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">1976</xref>). Antibody titers were as high as 1:51,200 by indirect RIA and in an inhibition RIA 5 ng of viral protein could be detected. The labeled antigen could be stored for at least 6 weeks at −20°C without loss of activity.
