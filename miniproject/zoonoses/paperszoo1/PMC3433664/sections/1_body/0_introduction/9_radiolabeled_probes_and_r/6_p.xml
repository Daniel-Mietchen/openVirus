<p>Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic strains of the genus 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> which are capable of infecting most mammalian species. Infection occurs either through direct contact with an infected animal or indirect contact with contaminated soil or water. In livestock, the disease causes economic losses due to abortion, stillbirth, infertility, decreased milk production, and death. The detection of leptospira in biological fluids is important for the diagnosis of leptospirosis in animals; however, the sensitivity of dark field microscopy, the usual detection method, is often inadequate. Several serological techniques have been developed to increase the sensitivity of diagnosis including some using radiolabeling. An inhibition RIA was developed using serovar-specific main TM antigen of 
 <italic>L. interrogans</italic> labeled with 
 <sup>3</sup>H sodium borohydride. There was no cross-reactivity with other serovars of 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> and the assay was more sensitive than CFT (Chappel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1985</xref>). An enzymatic radioimmunoassay has been developed for detecting 
 <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic> serovar 
 <italic>pomona</italic> in porcine urine (Chappel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1985</xref>). A solid-phase RIA to detect leptospires or their antigens in urine samples did not show a high sensitivity (Bahaman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1986</xref>). DNA extracted from 
 <italic>L. interrogans</italic> serovar 
 <italic>pomona</italic> was labeled with 
 <sup>32</sup>P and used as a genomic probe to detect leptospiral DNA. The sensitivity of detection was 160 pg of leptospiral DNA or 1.1 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> leptospires, and assays with nylon membranes were somewhat more sensitive than assays with nitrocellulose membranes (Millar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">1987</xref>).
