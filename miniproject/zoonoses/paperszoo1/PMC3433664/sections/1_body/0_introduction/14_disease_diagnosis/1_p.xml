<p>An interesting perspective on the use of stable isotopes lies in their application in the diagnosis of diseases that lead to gastrointestinal malfunction and can be detected on the basis of non-invasive breath tests using stable carbon 
 <sup>13</sup>C. These have been used in human medicine and, to a limited extent, in studies on animals. In veterinary diagnostics, breath samples can be easily collected from animals by means of a face mask or collection chamber with minimal disturbance to the animal. Some 3,000 gases have been identified in exhaled human breath, and some of them have been linked with specific disease processes. Diagnosis is based on ingestion of a suitable substrate labeled with stable carbon relevant to the intestinal process being investigated, then analyzing breath samples by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Applications for breath testing in humans include gastroenterology, hepatology, and oncology. 
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> is a bacterium that induces inflammation of the gut causing chronic gastritis, ulcers, and can also lead to development of cancer. The bacterium survives in gastric acid by excreting large amounts of urease that breaks down any urea in the stomach to ammonia and carbon dioxide. Diagnosis can be made by ingesting urea labeled with 
 <sup>13</sup>C. The presence of 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> will be demonstrated by the production of large amounts of CO
 <sub>2</sub> labeled with 
 <sup>13</sup>C (Graham et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">1987</xref>). Hepatic function affected by hepatitis C infection can be quantified by a 
 <sup>13</sup>C-aminopyrine breath test (Armuzzi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1999</xref>). Preliminary experiments for collecting breath samples to measure intestinal dysfunction in chickens (Hughes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2008</xref>) have shown promise and could be further developed to enable diagnostic applications. Hepatic disorders are a common problem in dogs and cats, and they are difficult to diagnose and may often require hepatic biopsy in order for confirmatory diagnosis. A 
 <sup>13</sup>C-aminopyrine test was developed for use in dogs in which instead of measuring labeled CO
 <sub>2</sub> in the breath, it was extracted from the blood (Moeller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">2001</xref>). This was later validated and optimized for clinical application (Chiaramonte et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2003</xref>; DeBiasio et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2008</xref>). Horses often develop upper gastrointestinal tract dysfunctions due to harsh training and stress, and in the search for safe, non-invasive tests that are simple to perform, stable isotope technologies based on those applied in human subjects have been developed to determine solid-phase emptying of the gut (Sutton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">2003</xref>). The animals are fed a 
 <sup>13</sup>C-octanoic acid labeled meal; the label is not metabolized but is absorbed by the small intestine, then undergoes hepatic oxidation leading to production of 
 <sup>13</sup>C-labeled CO
 <sub>2</sub> in the breath. The rate of appearance of labeled CO
 <sub>2</sub> is a measure of the gastric emptying. Results confirmed that the test gave an accurate measurement of delayed emptying and could be used for investigations of a number of conditions such as gastric ulceration, grass sickness, and duodenitis (Sutton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">2003</xref>). Another test employed 
 <sup>13</sup>C acetic acid as the source of stable carbon and similarly showed potential for measuring intestinal problems in equines (Sasaki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">2005</xref>).
