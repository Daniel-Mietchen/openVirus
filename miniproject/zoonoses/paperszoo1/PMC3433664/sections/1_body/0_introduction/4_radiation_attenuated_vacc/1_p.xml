<p>Infections with animal trypanosomoses threaten an estimated 50 million head of cattle and in regions of sub-Saharan Africa where the tsetse fly vectors of the diseases occur. Every year, African Animal Trypanosomoses (AAT) caused by 
 <italic>Trypanosoma vivax</italic>, 
 <italic>Trypanosoma congolense</italic>, and 
 <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> cause some 3 million deaths in cattle. AAT has a severe impact on agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa; for the tsetse-infested regions, overall losses, in terms of agricultural gross domestic product, have been put at US$ 4.75 billion per year. Currently, drugs are pivotal to the control of trypanosomosis, but the small number of available compounds, together with frequent reports of drug resistance to all species of animal trypanosomoses, makes it imperative that measures are taken that enable more effective use of the available drugs or, alternatively, seek alternative methods of control. Vaccination is an attractive prospect, but so far none of the various strategies devised have been successful and have not been taken beyond the experimental stage (Magez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2010</xref>). These attempts have comprised inducing protective immune responses in the mammalian host, mitigating the pathogenic effects of infection, compromising transmission of infection by stopping the development of trypanosomes in the vector or by blocking the establishment of infection in the mammalian host. One of the main factors that make vaccination difficult is the existence of several different trypanosome species and antigenic variation of the parasite that provides for large variable antigenic repertoire in pathogenic trypanosomes. Given the success of γ-irradiation attenuation with a number of other helminths, viruses, and bacteria, work with trypanosomes have met with only limited success, in marked contrast to recent studies where irradiated organisms have behaved in a manner that enables them to be more effective immunogens that can sometimes elicit substantial cross-protection. One of the most important attributes seems to be in retarding development of the infective stage of the parasite to enable the induction of immunity. It is possible that successful protection requires that immune effector cells that would be stimulated in a natural infection should be preferentially primed, requiring vaccination at the skin, mucosal surfaces etc., where infection normally occurs. In the case of trypanosomes, the infection in the host is effected by the bites of tsetse flies or hematophagous biting flies after which trypanosomes develop in the skin and draining lymph nodes (Mwangi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">1990</xref>). However, in all experiments carried out using irradiated trypanosomes, vaccination and challenge was carried out by the intraperitoneal, intravenous, or subcutaneous routes. Between 50% and 80% of mice vaccinated with 
 <italic>T. congolense</italic> that had been γ-irradiated with 600 Gy were immune to challenge after up to six immunizing injections with 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> to 2 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> inactivated trypanosomes and challenge 7 days after the last dose; dogs and cattle were not protected although the prepatent period after challenge was lengthened (Duxbury et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">1972b</xref>). In a similar study using γ-irradiated 
 <italic>Trypanosoma rhodesiense</italic>, five out of six monkeys were immune to challenge 7 days after receiving six weekly immunizing inoculations (Duxbury et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1972a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">b</xref>). Interestingly, it was found that irradiation attenuated 
 <italic>T. rhodesiense</italic> that had been cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen retained the ability to induce immunity. (Duxbury et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1970</xref>). Experiments with 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> in rats vaccinated with trypanosomes attenuated with 420 Gy showed an increased survival time, with some exhibiting complete immunity after three or more injections with irradiated parasites (James et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">1973</xref>). In experiments with cattle (Morrison et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">1982</xref>), a single dose of 10
 <sup>7</sup> to 10
 <sup>9</sup> 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> irradiated with 600 Gy completely protected against challenge 14 days later. High levels of protective antibodies were produced, especially in cattle in which responses were induced by intravenous inoculation. The success of the single vaccinating dose was probably due to the use of a homogeneous cloned population of trypanosomes, whereas in previous studies mixed populations of parasites were used so that the presence of several antigen types in small numbers was not sufficient to induce immunity. There has been only one attempt using irradiated trypanosomes to protect against infective metacyclic forms produced in the tsetse fly. Mice immunized three times with 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> irradiated 
 <italic>T. rhodesiense</italic> expressing metacyclic antigen types were immune to challenge 2 weeks after the last immunizing dose (Esser et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">1982</xref>).
