<p>Another important arthropod-borne disease of cattle is babesiosis, a parasitic infection that causes significant morbidity and mortality in livestock worldwide. The most abundant species, 
 <italic>B. bovis</italic> and 
 <italic>B. bigemina</italic>, occur throughout most tropical and sub-tropical regions where economic losses from infection are considerable, particularly in developing countries. 
 <italic>Babesia divergens</italic> is economically important in Europe. Babesiosis can be treated with anti-parasitic drugs or controlled with vaccination—a number of live, attenuated vaccines derived from the blood of infected donor animals or from 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> culture are available for 
 <italic>B. bovis</italic>, 
 <italic>B. bigemina</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. divergens</italic>. While effective, there are safety concerns and quality control demands to ensure that vaccines retain their integrity during preparation techniques that require passage of the parasites 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in splenectomized calves. Alternative methods of attenuation utilizing γ-irradiation have proven effective experimentally, and could possibly reduce some of the problems of the current vaccines, but they have not been adopted for large-scale use. A field trial of a blood-derived 
 <italic>B. divergens</italic> vaccine irradiated at 240 or 320 Gy produced an effective immune response without pathogenic effects. Vaccinated calves were protected against a field challenge that produced severe disease in unvaccinated animals (Purnell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">1979</xref>). A larger trial using infected blood irradiated at 280 Gy confirmed these initial findings (Purnell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">1981</xref>). The route of inoculation also had an effect on response to challenge: animals inoculated subcutaneously showed fewer effects than by intravenous inoculation (Taylor et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">1983</xref>). Bovine blood and fetal calf serum are often used in cell culture techniques, and it is common knowledge that these products can be contaminated with viruses, one of the most ubiquitous being bovine viral diarrhea virus. Hence, there is a risk that if used in production of vaccines, the recipient animals could become infected. Gamma irradiation of serum inactivates the viruses of foot and mouth disease, vesicular stomatitis, rinderpest, peste des petits ruminants, Rift Valley fever, and bluetongue while maintaining growth promotion potential. Attenuated vaccines for 
 <italic>B. bovis</italic> and 
 <italic>B. bigemina</italic> (Rojas et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">2006</xref>) require regular supplies of bovine red blood cells (RBCs) and serum for their manufacture, and there is a constant problem with contaminating viruses and bacteria. Irradiation of serum with 25,000 Gy has therefore been used to inactivate viral contaminants and ensure its safety and efficacy in use.
