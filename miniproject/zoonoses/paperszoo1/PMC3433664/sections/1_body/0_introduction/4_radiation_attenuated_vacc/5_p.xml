<p>Coccidiosis caused by intracellular parasites of the genus 
 <italic>Eimeria</italic> is a major enteric disease of intensively reared poultry, causing production losses of more than $800 billion worldwide (Williams 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR187">1999</xref>). The disease can be controlled by anti-coccidial drugs and vaccines composed of live and attenuated parasites, and studies on the use of recombinant vaccines are also in progress (Dalloul and Lillehoj 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2006</xref>). Oocysts of 
 <italic>Eimeria tenella</italic> and 
 <italic>Eimeria maxima</italic> exposed to 200 Gy induced a protective immune response in chickens; irradiated sporozoites invaded host epithelial cells but showed only minimal development and by 72 h had disappeared. Vaccinated chickens showed no weight loss when challenged with live oocysts, but did develop lesions in the intestine (Jenkins et al.
