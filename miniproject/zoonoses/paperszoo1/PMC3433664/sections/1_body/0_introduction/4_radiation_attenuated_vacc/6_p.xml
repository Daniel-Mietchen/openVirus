 <italic>Neospora caninum</italic> is a protozoan parasite that causes neuromuscular paralysis in dogs and abortions in cattle. 
 <italic>N. caninum</italic> has considerable impact upon beef and dairy industries worldwide (Reichel and Ellis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">2006</xref>). The important host immune responses to 
 <italic>N. caninum</italic> include CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, the Th1 cytokines IL-12, interferon gamma, and IgG2a isotype antibodies. In a murine model of the disease, mice could be protected from lethal challenge infection with 2 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> live tachyzoites using two intraperitoneal injections at 4-week intervals with 10
 <sup>6</sup> tachyzoites irradiated with 528 Gy. Splenocytes from mice collected 5 and 10 weeks after vaccination secreted significant levels of interferon g, interleukin (IL)-10, and some IL-4. IgG1 and IgG2a isotype antibodies were present in the serum of infected mice (Ramamoorthy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">2006</xref>). To determine the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing vertical transmission of 
 <italic>N. caninum</italic>, mice were vaccinated and bred after administration of a booster dose 4 weeks after the primary vaccination. Antigen-specific IgG, IFN-γ, and IL-10 were detected in the vaccinated pregnant mice. Vaccinated mice were then challenged with 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>  
 <italic>N. caninum</italic> tachyzoites between days 11 and 13 of pregnancy. Protection against vertical transmission of 
 <italic>N. caninum</italic> was 34%. Brain tissue of the fetuses showed that there were highly significant differences in parasite burdens between control and vaccinated animals (Ramamoorthy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">2007</xref>).
