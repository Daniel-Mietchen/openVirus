<p>The Theileriae comprise a genus of tick-transmitted protozoan parasites infecting wild and domestic animals in many parts of the world. In East and Central Africa, the most important species 
 <italic>Theileria parva</italic> represents a major constraint on the development of beef and dairy production. 
 <italic>T. annulata</italic> is more widespread, causing disease in cattle in the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, India, Southern Russia, and other countries in Asia. The parasites have a complex life cycle in the mammalian host and in the arthropod vector, various species of tick. Theileriosis is controlled by dipping or spraying cattle with acaricides to kill the tick vectors. In addition, 
 <italic>T. annulata</italic> can be controlled using a tissue culture-attenuated vaccine, and for 
 <italic>T. parva</italic> there are a number of curative drugs and also vaccination by infection from stabilated infective particles (IPs) followed by treatment with long-acting tetracycline drugs. There have also been a number of trials of γ-irradiated vaccines to investigate the possibility of immunoprophylaxis by this method. Calves were inoculated with ground-up suspensions of ticks infected with 
 <italic>T. annulata</italic> that had been irradiated at 50, 100, and 150 Gy and the response in the calves measured. The lowest dose did not affect the parasite, but at 100 and 150 Gy the parasitosis was lower in the vaccinated animals than in control animals inoculated with unirradiated parasites and the clinical signs were of reduced intensity. It was suggested that irradiation altered virulence of the parasite rather than impair infectivity. Vaccinated animals were fully resistant to challenge infection 45 days after immunization (Samantaray et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">1980</xref>). Infective particles of 
 <italic>T. parva</italic> were harvested from the tick vector, and cattle were inoculated with aliquots of suspensions of IPs irradiated at doses of 40–1,376 Gy. Doses of irradiation in excess of 80 Gy appeared to destroy the parasite. In other experiments, cattle were inoculated with aliquots of suspensions containing low and high concentrations of IPs irradiated at doses of 40–320 Gy. With low concentrations of IPs, doses of irradiation in excess of 100 Gy appeared to destroy the parasite. With high concentrations, one animal became infected when inoculated with an aliquot of a suspension irradiated at 160 Gy. In all experiments, it appeared that increasing doses of irradiation destroyed increasing numbers of IPs (Purnell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">1974</xref>). It was concluded that γ-irradiation was unlikely to be useful for producing a vaccine antigen against ECF is unlikely to be achieved by these means.
