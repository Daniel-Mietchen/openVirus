<p>Observations on the effects of γ-irradiation on 
 <italic>B. bovis</italic> showed that the numbers of parasites capable of multiplying in the host reduced as the doses increased with complete inhibition of multiplication at 500–700 Gy. At 200–500 Gy, parasites were able to multiply at a reduced rate and produced mild infections that provided a strong immunity to challenge infection. At the highest radiation doses, where no multiplication occurred, calves were not protected (Wright et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">1980</xref>). Cattle vaccinated with the irradiation-attenuated parasites retained their immunity to challenge with a heterologous strain of 
 <italic>B. bovis</italic> for over a year. When infected blood containing 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> infected red cells was irradiated at 350 Gy, the infective dose was reduced to 2.5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> parasites, but the rate of multiplication was similar to unirradiated parasites, and the same level of parasitemia was reached in the vaccinated animals. However, the disease was not as severe. It was concluded that irradiation had produced a predominantly avirulent parasite population (Wright et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">1980</xref>). With 
 <italic>B. bigemina</italic>, inoculation of 1 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> parasitized red cells irradiated at 240 or 360 Gy into calves produced infection, but animals inoculated with parasites treated with 480 or 600 Gy did not develop infections and they were able to survive challenge with unirradiated parasites that killed control, unvaccinated calves. The irradiated parasites could be cryopreserved without loss of immunizing properties (Bishop and Adams 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1974</xref>).
