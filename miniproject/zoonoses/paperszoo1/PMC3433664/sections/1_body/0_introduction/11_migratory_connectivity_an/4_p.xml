<p>Of most concern however is the threat of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) that has caused devastating economic losses globally for the poultry industry, as well as being a potentially serious zoonotic disease of humans. Migratory waterfowl appear to play a role in the dissemination of HPAI, as there appears to be an association with infections in wild birds and outbreaks of disease in domesticated poultry (Gaidet et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2010</xref>; Takekawa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">2010</xref>), but the picture is not clear. It would be useful therefore to reveal migration patterns and enable identification of the breeding areas of birds sampled in intermediate stopover sites, or non-breeding grounds, and in samples collected from disease outbreak sites. Since the beginning of the HPAI epizootic, over 100 bird species from 13 orders have been found to be infected with the H5N1 AI virus. Despite this knowledge, little is actually known about the prevalence of HPAI in birds or how it is transmitted through avian populations via migratory routes. Indeed, there have been few studies on how mass movements of wild animals in seasonal migration affect the transmission and evolution of pathogens within a population and the infection risk to other species. Investigations utilizing satellite tracking devices have not unequivocally linked HPAI in wild birds with the infections occurring in poultry. Hence, there have been recommendations that SIA should be added to banding and satellite tracking technologies as part of the surveillance strategy for HPAI (Chang et al.
