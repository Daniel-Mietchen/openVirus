<p>Migratory connectivity is the term used to describe the relationship between populations of animals (especially birds) and geographic locations at different time points during the year. Migratory connectivity studies are particularly useful for tracking bird-borne diseases; however, traditional methods of banding and recapture provide limited details about the migratory patterns of a species of bird because few banded individuals are ever captured twice and GPS tracking devices are expensive and can be used on only small numbers of individual animals.</p>
