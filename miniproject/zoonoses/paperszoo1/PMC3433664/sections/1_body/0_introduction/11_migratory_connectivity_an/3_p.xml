<p>The ubiquity of ticks and their importance in the transmission of pathogens involved in human and livestock diseases is well known. However, studies on tickâ€“bird systems have mainly focused on land birds; for example, birds can harbor 
 <italic>Ixodes</italic> ticks infected with 
 <italic>Borrelia</italic> spp. that are a cause of Lyme disease in the USA (Reed et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">2003</xref>). However, the role of seabirds in the ecology and epidemiology of tick-borne pathogens is rarely considered. Seabirds typically have large population sizes, wide geographic distributions, and high mobility, which make them significant potential players in the maintenance and dispersal of disease agents at large spatial scales. They are parasitized by at least 29 tick species found across all geographical regions of the world and can harbor a large diversity of pathogens, although there have been no detailed studies of this diversity (Dietrich et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2011</xref>). Birds are also reservoirs of infection and also implicated in the dispersal of West Nile Virus by the bites of mosquitoes. Other common pathogens in wild birds are 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> and 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. which they acquire during their feeding and can be a source of infection for domesticated poultry and humans (Reed et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">2003</xref>).
