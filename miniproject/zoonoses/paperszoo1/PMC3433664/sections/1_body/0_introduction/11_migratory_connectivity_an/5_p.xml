<p>Although SIA has been used extensively in the last 20 years for the study of long-distance dispersal and ecology of migratory birds, especially in North America and Europe (e.g., Hobson

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2008</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2011</xref>; Hobson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2009</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2010</xref>; Van Wilgenburg and Hobson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">2011</xref>), its application in studies on animal migration and infectious disease risk has not been adequately addressed. In addition, since many of the incidents involving HPAI have occurred in wild birds using flyways that originate in Asia, the use of SIA to understand the epidemiology of the disease will be particularly challenging. The use of SIA has already shown promise for establishing the origins of birds from Mongolia (Pérez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2010</xref>). The values of δ
 <sup>2</sup>H in actively growing feathers agreed with those expected from the isotopic values found in the collection sites. There is still need to improve the data on δ
 <sup>2</sup>H isoscapes in the region as these are not well described at present (Chang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2009</xref>) as well as development of a feather collection protocol to standardize sampling efforts and develop an Asian δ
 <sup>2</sup>H feather isoscape base map (Pérez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2010</xref>). Stable hydrogen isotope analysis has also been used to determine the biogeography of avian hematozoan infections caused by 
 <italic>Leucocytozoon</italic> and 
 <italic>Haemoproteus</italic> spp. in birds of prey (Smith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">2004</xref>) to establish the place of origin of the infected birds.
