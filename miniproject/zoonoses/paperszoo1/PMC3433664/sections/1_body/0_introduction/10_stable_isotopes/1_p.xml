<p>In a world where the movement of animals or their products is commonplace and in which changes in environment due to climate change can potentially affect the spread of infectious diseases and their vectors, there is a critical need for technologies that will enable identification of the geographical origin of those diseases and, where necessary, provide information on the feeding habits and associated movements of their vectors. A technique that has been extensively used in studying the ecology of animals, stable isotope analysis (SIA), is likely to be in the forefront of methods that will be most useful in providing the means to understand the epidemiology of diseases. Stable isotopes are the naturally occurring forms of elements with differing nuclear masses and, as the name implies, they do not undergo radioactive decay; many elements have one or more stable isotopes and there are over 250 in existence. However, for the purposes envisaged, it is only necessary to concentrate analysis on a small number of isotopes that are involved in important biological and ecological processes. The isotopes are measured by mass spectrometry as isotopic differences relative to international standards prepared by IAEA and reported as ratios in delta (Î´) units as parts per thousand. The value of SIA is based on the strong correlation between levels of certain isotopes in the environment and the concentration of the same isotopes in animal tissues. A number of isotopes can be usefully employed and fall into two categories: those of low atomic mass, carbon (C), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), oxygen (O), and hydrogen (H); and those of high atomic mass, strontium (Sr) and lead (Pb). The heavy isotopes are representative of environmental processes and can be used to trace uptake from soils.</p>
