<p>The hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition of environmental water varies spatially across the globe, and because it is a constituent of many biosynthetic pathways, the isotopes’ presence is relayed to animal tissues, providing the means to link precipitation isotope values with those in biological tissues. Global grids of hydrogen and oxygen water isotopes have been constructed to provide accurate estimates of δ
 <sup>2</sup>H and δ
 <sup>18</sup>O in water that can then be compared to animal samples of known or unknown origin. These grids can be constructed using the data from the Global Network for Isotopes in Precipitation database collated by the IAEA.
