<p>The presence of the light stable isotopes in animal tissues depends on both biological and environmental processes. For example, stable carbon (δ
 <sup>13</sup>C) and nitrogen (δ
 <sup>15</sup>N) participate in biochemical processes in fixation in plants, while δ
 <sup>13</sup>C found in tissues reflects dietary intake, and δ
 <sup>15</sup>N in tissues is often affected by water and nutritional stress. Stable sulfur (δ
 <sup>34</sup>S) varies widely in aquatic and terrestrial environments and reflects sources of nutrients in food webs. For animal movements, the isotopes of most interest are hydrogen (δ
 <sup>2</sup>H) and oxygen (δ
 <sup>18</sup>O) ratios in tissues that accurately reflect those in lakes, rivers, oceans, and in groundwater. Using stable isotopes to characterize a population involves examining the isotopic signatures of a few individuals that are representative of the entire population. Studies have been in progress for several years using stable isotopes to characterize and differentiate among animal populations (particularly birds) using δ
 <sup>13</sup>C and δ
 <sup>15</sup>N values in metabolically active tissues (blood and muscle), but presently, the most effective tracers appear to be the hydrogen isotopes found in metabolically inert, seasonally grown tissues, such as feathers and claws. Feathers retain this information until replaced or molted, typically once per year. Conversely, claws are continuously growing and can theoretically provide a time-integrated profile depending on claw growth rates. Once the isotope profile of a particular bird population is known, any individuals from the population can provide information on global migration of that species.
