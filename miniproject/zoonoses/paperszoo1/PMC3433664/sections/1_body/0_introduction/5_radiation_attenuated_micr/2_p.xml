<p>Irradiation is a very reliable procedure for inactivating viruses, as it does affect viral proteins and structure and also shows promise for formulation of cross-protective vaccines, thereby reducing the numbers of vaccines that might otherwise be required (Alsharifi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2009</xref>). Gamma irradiation was effective in inactivating bluetongue virus without compromising the presentation of antigenic determinants that stimulated production of neutralizing antibodies in both mice and sheep. Virus preparations from brain and cell cultures were inactivated with 60,000 to 100,000 Gy from a 
 <sup>60</sup>Co source. The vaccine induced a cell-mediated immune response in mice and sheep were protected against infection (Campbell 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1985</xref>; Campbell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1985</xref>). The dose of irradiation did not appear to affect the immunogenicity of the virus. Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is inactivated by irradiation within the range 40,000–44,000 Gy (Motamedi-Sedeh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2009</xref>). In guinea pigs, irradiation-attenuated FMD viruses induced neutralizing antibodies that persisted for up to 8 months, post-vaccination—a similar duration to that obtained using conventional FMD vaccine. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a mosquito-borne and aerosol-transmitted infection of horses (in which the virus multiplies) that presents an emerging zoonotic disease threat to humans, and is in addition a potential biological weapon. The disease is endemic to many areas of Central and South America. In horses, the disease manifests either as a mild fever that progresses into severe and often fatal encephalomyelitis, although it can produce an acute disease causing sudden death; mortality can be as high as 80%. Humans are infected by mosquitoes and the disease produces flu-like symptoms that result in death in some instances. Aliquots of VEEV at 3 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>–3 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> pfu/ml were irradiated with 400–50,000 Gy and then tested for infectivity; irradiation of at least 50,000 Gy was required to abolish infectivity (Fine et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2010</xref>). There was also a 32–50% reduction in epitope binding activity concomitant with loss of infectivity. An attenuated vaccine prepared from VEE viruses irradiated with 50,000 Gy was effective in inducing protection in mice against subcutaneous challenge with live virus, although immunity was not necessarily associated with high levels of neutralizing antibodies (Martin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2010</xref>); however, the vaccine was less effective in protecting against aerosol infections. It was not necessary to include adjuvants in the formulation to ensure induction of immunity.
