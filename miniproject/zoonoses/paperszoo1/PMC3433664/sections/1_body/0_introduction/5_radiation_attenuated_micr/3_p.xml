<p>Chemically inactivated influenza virus vaccines rely on protective antibody responses and do not elicit the cytotoxic T-cell responses that are important in recovery from primary infections. Influenza A virus irradiated with 120,000 Gy induced T-cell responses in mice and protected them against lethal challenge with a heterologous strain of virus (Müllbacher et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">1988</xref>). Mice given a single intranasal vaccination with influenza A virus, inactivated by irradiation at 10,000 Gy, were protected against homologous and heterologous challenge with influenza A viruses, including H5N1 (Alsharifi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2009</xref>). Cross-protective immunity was mediated mainly by T-cell responses and γ-irradiated viruses did not generate neutralizing antibodies or cross-protective antibodies (Furuya et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2010</xref>). The provision of vaccines for influenza is particularly problematic, given the ability of the viruses to mutate, potentially acquiring the ability to translate into new pandemic strains with capacity to cross the species barrier, with serious consequences for both animals and humans (Alsharifi and Müllbacher 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2010</xref>). The recent epidemics caused by influenza A, H1N1 (so-called swine flu), and H5N1 (Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza) serve to illustrate the problems faced by the authorities in providing suitable vaccines to meet the challenge posed by such disease outbreaks. Irradiated vaccines, with their ability to promote both cellular and humoral immunity, and the ability to cross-protect could become potent alternatives to present-day vaccines (Alsharifi and Müllbacher 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2010</xref>).
