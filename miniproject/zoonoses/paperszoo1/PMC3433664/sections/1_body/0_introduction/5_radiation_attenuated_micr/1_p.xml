<p>The basic tenets of irradiation attenuation, namely that inactivated microbial pathogens retain their immunogenicity and induce protective immune responses in the host, were established during experimental studies on 
 <italic>Rickettsia tsutsugamushi</italic> (Eisenberg and Osterman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">1978</xref>). It was found that immunogenicity was little compromised between irradiation does of 2,000 and 4,000 Gy. Mice vaccinated using an intermediate dose of 3,000 Gy was completely protected against homologous challenge. In contrast, mice vaccinated with a formalinized vaccine were not protected. Specific cellular immune responses were detected in mice given the irradiated vaccine, but could not be demonstrated in mice given the chemically treated rickettsiae. It was concluded that irradiated rickettsiae share similar antigenic properties to irradiated organisms, thereby enabling the stimulation of protective immunity. The immunogenic properties of irradiated vaccines, particularly in relation to enabling retention of metabolic activity and the adjuvant and antigenic properties of the organisms, were confirmed by Datta et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2006</xref>). Intraperitoneal injection of 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> irradiated at 6,000 Gy induced protective immune responses in mice that were accompanied by extensive protective CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell memory responses. Moreover, lyophilized, irradiated 
 <italic>Listeria</italic> organisms were also able to protect mice, with implications for the safe and easy storage and transport of such vaccines (Datta et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2006</xref>). The benefits of using as vaccine organisms that had been inactivated, but metabolically active, have also been established with 
 <italic>Brucella</italic> (Magnani et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2009</xref>). Intraperitoneal injection with chemical or heat-treated organisms provided only limited vaccine efficacy, but 
 <italic>Brucella</italic> irradiated at 3,000 Gy while preventing replicative activity retained the properties of live bacteria remaining metabolic activity, transcriptional activity, ability to establish in macrophages, induced cytotoxic T cells, and protected against lethal challenge infection. This characteristic of irradiation-attenuated vaccines might contribute to induction of more comprehensive immunity. For example, mice vaccinated with 
 <italic>B. neotomae</italic> attenuated with 2,500–3,000 Gy gamma rays protected against infection with heterologous, virulent organisms of 
 <italic>Brucella melitensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Brucella abortus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Brucella suis</italic> (Moustafa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2011</xref>). There is also evidence that gamma-irradiated 
 <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> spores induce mucosal immunity in guinea pigs when administered 
 <italic>per os. B. anthracis</italic> spores irradiated with 20,000 Gy induced specific IgG1 and IgA antibody responses against a recombinant protective antigen (Aloni-Grinstein et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2005</xref>). Vaccination against 
 <italic>Pasterurella</italic> can also be induced in mice using bacteria irradiated with 6,000 Gy. In contrast, with 
 <italic>Burkholderia mallei</italic>, the causative organism of glanders in equines, although organisms irradiated at 21,000 Gy were able to induce T-helper cell cytokine responses in vaccinated mice, there was no evidence of protective immunity (Amemiya et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2002</xref>). Results with 
 <italic>Leptospira icterohemorrhagiae</italic> were also equivocal, possibly due to differences in irradiation dosage. Guinea pigs were successfully protected against infection by vaccination with leptospira irradiated at 500 Gy (Hubbert and Miller 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">1965</xref>), but when the inactivation dose was increased to 2,000 Gy, there was no protective effect (Babudieriq et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1973</xref>). Bovine anaplasmosis is caused by a tick-borne rickettsia, 
 <italic>Anaplasma marginale</italic>. Cattle vaccinated with infected red cells γ-irradiated with 700–900 Gy showed marked and prolonged cell-mediated and humoral immune responses and had lower parasitemias and anemia than in control animals (Sharma and Bansal 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">1986</xref>).
