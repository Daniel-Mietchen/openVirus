<p>There have been several other experimental studies on the value of irradiated nematode vaccines. Gould et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">1953</xref>) showed that 
 <italic>Trichinella spiralis</italic> larvae were adversely affected by X-irradiation with reproduction of trichinae largely prevented by exposing larvae 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> to 35 Gy while maturation to adult forms was largely prevented by exposure to 50 or 60 Gy. In pigs, immunity to challenge with infective larvae was prevented by administration of 50,000 larvae attenuated by exposure to 100 Gy from a 
 <sup>60</sup>Co source (Cabrera and Gould 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1964</xref>). 
 <italic>Trichostrongylus colubriformis</italic> is another nematode worm that attaches to the lining of the abomasum of sheep where its blood sucking leads to signs of weakness, poor growth, scouring, poor reproduction, and, in severe infestations, death. A dose-dependent vaccine response is seen with irradiation-attenuated vaccines: 5,000 irradiated third-stage larvae is the threshold level, but with two doses of 20,000 larvae irradiated at 600 Gy, a 78% level of protection is provided in lambs challenged 1 month after the last immunizing inoculation. In a laboratory animal model, the gerbil, strong mucosal antibody responses were detected following vaccination and challenge (Maclean et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">1986</xref>). 
 <italic>Nematodirus battus</italic> is one of the most pathogenic organisms that infect sheep in cool temperate climates, usually arising in May and June. Infected lambs develop acute enteritis with watery diarrhea, accompanied by inappetence and weight loss, and die if not treated. Six-week-old lambs vaccinated with 20,000 gamma-irradiated L3 larvae showed a 66% reduction in worm burden when challenged with 50,000 infective larvae a month after vaccination, suggesting that further studies into the benefits of vaccination are worthwhile (Winter et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188">2000</xref>). Radiation-attenuated L3 larvae of 
 <italic>Strongylus vulgaris</italic> were used to protect ponies against infection. Larvae irradiated with 70 or 100 Gy were effective in inducing protective immunity; recovery of worms was lower in vaccinated ponies and clinical sings were less obvious. Protection was associated with an anamnestic eosinophilia and recognition of 
 <italic>S. vulgaris</italic> L3surface antigens (Klei et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">1982</xref>; Monahan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">1994</xref>).
