 <italic>S. bovis</italic> is an economically important parasite of cattle and other domestic livestock in Sudan where control by chemotherapy and molluscicides is impractical. Sheep were vaccinated with 10,000 or 20,000 schistosomula irradiated at 60 Gy and then challenged with 6,700 live schistosomula. In sheep vaccinated with 10,000 organisms, there was a 71% reduction in the mean worm burden compared with the controls and the mean densities of eggs in the tissues were reduced by 75–82% (Taylor et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">1979</xref>). Immunization with 20,000 irradiated schistosomula did not increase the efficacy of vaccination. Both groups of vaccinated sheep had much milder lesions in the intestines than control individuals. There was also a clear reduction in the severity of liver lesions in the sheep given the lower dose of irradiated schistosomula. In the case of the related parasite of sheep, 
 <italic>Schistosoma mattheei</italic>, from southern Africa, four doses of 10
 <sup>4</sup> cercariae irradiated at 6 Kr that were given by percutaneous infection at 4-week intervals induced a 74% reduction in infection compared to control (Taylor et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">1976</xref>). No significant differences were seen in histopathology of the liver of the sheep. In another experiment, four doses of cercariae irradiated with 60 Gy were used to vaccinate sheep by percutaneous infection; skin-transformed schistosomula were administered by intramuscular injection and by intravenous injection and syringe-transformed schistosomula were administered by intramuscular injection. The reduction in worm burden achieved by these different procedures was respectively 72%, 61%, 77%, 56%, and 78%. These results show that effective immunization is not dependent on the presence of a mature worm infection or on cercarial penetration of the skin by the immunizing infection. Zebu cattle were vaccinated by intramuscular or subcutaneous inoculation with 10,000 schistosomula irradiated at 30 Gy. They were then challenged with 10,000 normal schistomula. Vaccinated animals had significantly lower egg and adult worm counts, milder pathological effects, and higher growth rates and body composition than control animals (Bushara et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1978</xref>). In field trials in endemic areas of Sudan, a single i.m. injection of 
 <italic>S. bovis</italic> cercariae irradiated with 30 Gy reduced worm burdens by 60% and egg production by 80% (Majid et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">1980</xref>; Aradaib and Osburn 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1995</xref>). Similar results were obtained with sheep. Irradiated, cryopreserved 
 <italic>S. bovis</italic> schistosomula were successfully used to protect sheep against challenge, and with more efficient cryopreservation techniques it should be possible to increase the efficacy of a vaccine stabilate (James et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">1985</xref>).
