<p>One of the most important blood-feeding nematode parasites is 
 <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic>, a ubiquitous parasite found in temperate regions as well as in tropical and sub-tropical regions where it has serious consequences for smallholder farmers whose livelihoods depend on the rearing of sheep and goats. Irradiation-attenuated vaccines have been shown to be of some value in protecting against infection. Adult worm-free sheep were protected against challenge with 10,000 infective third-stage larvae, after two doses of 10,000 larvae attenuated by exposure to 600 Gy from a 
 <sup>60</sup>Co source. Resistance was present within 6 days of the last vaccinating dose. IgA and IgG antibodies were present in the abomasum mucus of most sheep and appeared to be implicated in the protective immune response (Smith and Christie 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">1979</xref>). Further experiments confirmed a vaccine efficacy up to 86% in animals older than 6 months, but in lambs of 2 months the response was poor (Mulligan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">1961</xref>; Smith and Angus 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">1980</xref>), and this relative low efficacy in young lambs precluded the development of the vaccine further. Interestingly, it later transpired that through regular passage, the larval preparation used for attenuation became more radiosensitive, and the dose of gamma rays had to be reduced to 400 Gy from 600 Gy; otherwise, the irradiated larvae failed to induce immunity (Sivanathan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">1984</xref>).
