<p>Significant resistance to natural infections with 
 <italic>F. hepatica</italic> was obtained in calves inoculated with metacercariae attenuated using 30 Gy γ-irradiation. The mean fluke burden of vaccinated calves was 61% less than that of the control, unvaccinated cattle (Nansen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">1975</xref>). The resistance was reflected not only in reduced parasite burdens and low fecal egg counts but also in the stability of glutamyltranspeptidase levels in the vaccinated calves compared with non-vaccinated controls. A small proportion of the irradiated larvae were still able to reach and mature in the bile ducts. Conversely, attempts to induce immunity in sheep using various numbers of larvae and irradiation levels and different vaccination schedules failed. Vaccination of sheep with either 100 or 1,000 irradiated (25 Gy) metacercariae on two occasions 6 weeks apart did not induce immunity against challenge with 
 <italic>F. hepatica</italic> 6 weeks after the second vaccinating dose as measured by recovery of flukes from liver and bile ducts. There was no reduction in the pathogenic effects of challenge infection as measured by reduced packed cell volumes and weight gain (Campbell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1978</xref>). In other experiments, sheep were vaccinated with two doses of 2,000 metacercariae 4 weeks apart, irradiated at 70, 100, or 150 Gy. Although parasite viability was compromised and strong humoral antibody responses were generated, there was no protection (Creaney et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1995a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">b</xref>). The mechanisms of action of irradiation attenuation with 10 or 40 Gy on the juvenile stages of 
 <italic>F. hepatica</italic> seem to be directed at expression of cathepsin-B protease and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-specific sugars and concanavalin A (ConA)-specific sugars which may be detrimental to parasite invasion and contribute to the immune responses (Creaney et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1995a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">b</xref>). In lambs vaccinated with 
 <italic>F. gigantica</italic> metacercariae irradiated at 30 Gy, there was an 80% reduction in worm burden and fewer signs of hepatic damage than unvaccinated controls (Agadira et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1987</xref>). In zebu calves vaccinated with 30 Gy irradiated metacercariae, there was a 77% reduction in worm burden when the calves were challenged with 1,000 normal cercariae; in animals vaccinated with 200 Gy irradiated parasites, there was a high level of resistance shown by an 88% reduction in worm burden and mild effects on hepatic function (Younis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">1986</xref>). In goats, 400 metacercariae of 
 <italic>F. gigantica</italic> irradiated at 30 Gy stimulated resistance to challenge infection 8 weeks after vaccination (El Sanhouri et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">1987</xref>).
