<p>Nematode parasites have been controlled for many years using anthelminthic drugs, but the progressive development of drug resistance can compromise their ability to control infection. Furthermore, even after successful treatment, individuals become susceptible to reinfection within 4–12 months. Alternative methods to chemical control include vaccination using radiation attenuation. The first irradiation-attenuated vaccine against a nematode parasite was developed for 
 <italic>Ancylostoma caninum</italic> (Miller 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">1964</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">1971</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">1978</xref>). The third-stage larvae of 
 <italic>A. caninum</italic> were attenuated by X-ray doses &gt;300 Gray (Gy). Intestinal establishment of the adult worms in the intestine was reduced; few male worms survived and females were often sterile. Dogs given 1,000 irradiated larvae did not develop clinical disease. Single or double subcutaneous vaccination of larvae irradiated with 400 Gy successfully protected against challenge, achieving 90% protection after double vaccination. Approximately 75% of the irradiated larvae failed to establish in the gut, probably because they remained in the lungs where they died. The presence on the larvae in a migratory location was considered the main reason for their stimulating a high level of resistance. When normal, un-irradiated larvae were inoculated subcutaneously, they migrated to the intestine in a very short time and few were lost in the lungs during the migration. It was found that X-rays and gamma rays (from a 
 <sup>60</sup>Co source) were equally effective in delivering attenuation, but temperature and concentration of larvae were important factors to standardize, otherwise there was considerable variation in the effectiveness of irradiation attenuation. The vaccine was produced commercially in 1973, but after only 2 years it was discontinued due to low acceptance by veterinarians and poor sales. One of the reasons for the reluctance of veterinarians to use the vaccine was that vaccinated animals continued to shed eggs. For many other diseases, vaccines are often completely sterilizing thereby protecting both the individual vaccinated and unvaccinated animal thereby contributing to herd immunity. In the case of hookworm and other nematode parasites, this ideal is probably unattainable. However, the benefits would be seen in a reduction in worm burden and loss of blood from feeding worms and consequently a reduction in morbidity and mortality. It is necessary in these cases to distinguish between a hookworm infection and hookworm disease (Miller 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">1978</xref>). Although the radiation-attenuated vaccine failed commercially, conceptually it has continued to provide valuable insight into the mechanisms that are responsible for inducing immunity. Larvae are less motile in vaccinated animals than in animals with a primary infection, and it is suggested that this reduced motility results in a failure of larvae to evade the immune reaction (Babayan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2005</xref>). Vaccinated dogs when challenged with infective larvae respond primarily to antigens of &lt;20 kDa that are present in excretory/secretory (ES) products from adult parasites (Boag et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2003</xref>). In addition to a high production of antibodies against an antigen designated ASP-2, an ES product that has potential as a vaccine antigen, and strong proliferation from PMBCs to antigens of third-stage larvae, there were also marked cellular responses. Interleukin-4 production was observed in relation to IFN-γ. The antibodies induced by attenuated larvae inhibited the penetration of infective larvae through tissue, and this is a possible mechanism for the sequestration of larvae in the lungs of vaccinated dogs. It was suggested that a TH2 response is required for generation of protective immunity against hookworm, and that the ES molecule released during the establishment of the larval developmental stage are probable targets of this response (Fujiwara et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2006</xref>).
