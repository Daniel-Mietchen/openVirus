<p>Parasitism by gastrointestinal nematodes is a serious worldwide constraint on livestock productivity causing economic losses from decreased production, mortality, and the costs of continuous treatment and prevention measures. Drugs are an essential component of the management practices used in preventing clinical disease and central to the control of helminth parasites. However, since many of the drugs have been in use for many years, drug resistance is prevalent, to the extent that in the case of nematode worms every class of anthelminthic drug now in use shows signs of resistance in all livestock species (Kaplan

The development of vaccines for multicellular organisms with complex genomes is a formidable task since the immune response will be multi-faceted and involve a range of mechanisms so that any vaccine will be required to activate a number of different pathways. Central to the concept of developing a vaccine is how to evaluate its efficacy and its expected impact on the occurrence of disease in the livestock population. Effective anthelminthic drugs completely clear an animal of parasites, but for a parasite vaccine this is probably not possible, nor may it even be necessary. Computer modeling has shown that for some nematode species, e.g., 
 <italic>Trichostrongylus</italic>, a vaccine efficacy of 60% in 80% of the animals was sufficient to prevent disease (Barnes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1995</xref>). This level of protection would ensure that pasture was not contaminated with large numbers of worm eggs, but in the case of a more prolific egg producer, such as 
 <italic>Haemonchus</italic>, a vaccine efficacy of 70% would be needed to ensure that pasture contamination was minimized. Successful protection against challenge infection requires to meet three parameters: first, a reduction in the infectivity of larvae, so that establishment of adult worms is compromised, and the worm burden is lower; second, a concomitant lowering of the pathogenicity; and third, an effect on female worm fecundity so that egg numbers are decreased (Loukas et al.
