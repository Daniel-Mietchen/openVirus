<p>Trematode worms can be divided into three types depending on where the adults establish in the host, hence, blood flukes, liver flukes, and rumen and intestinal flukes. There are several different species of blood flukes, but the most important are 
 <italic>Schistosoma japonicum</italic> and 
 <italic>Schistosoma bovis</italic>. The former is a zoonotic species that occurs in cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and pigs in China and South East Asia and is a serious disease threat to millions of people in Asia. 
 <italic>S. bovis</italic> is a parasite of cattle, sheep, and goats in Africa where it causes significant mortality. Liver fluke infections occur worldwide, the most important species being 
 <italic>Fasciola hepatica</italic> and 
 <italic>Fasciola gigantica</italic>, and they pose a threat in many developing countries. They can infect cattle, sheep, goats, horses, and pigs, and there are cases of zoonotic infections too. In Europe and America, 
 <italic>F. hepatica</italic> is the only species that occurs, but in Africa and Asia both species occur, often overlapping in distribution. The third group of trematode parasites, represented by the paramphistomes, is of less economic importance than the blood and hepatic flukes.
