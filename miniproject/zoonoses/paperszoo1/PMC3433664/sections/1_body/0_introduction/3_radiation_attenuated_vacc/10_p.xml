<p>The prevalence of 
 <italic>S. japonicum</italic> in buffalos and cattle in China can be as high as 45%, and since bovines are a reservoir of human disease caused by 
 <italic>S. japonicum</italic>, its control will benefit both livestock production and human health. Several studies using attenuated parasite larvae have given promising results (Li Hsu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">1984a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">b</xref>). Cattle were immunized intradermally and intramuscularly with 10,000 schistosomula that had been irradiated with 240, 360, or 480 Gy. One to three immunizing doses were given and the cattle were challenged with 500 normal cercariae 30 days after the last immunizing injection. There were significantly lower numbers of adult worms in the animals vaccinated with schistosomula exposed to 32 Gy than those with 24 or 48 Gy. The reduction was greatest, 87%, in animals that were given three immunizing doses. Field trials of the vaccine were also conducted in two areas in Anhui Province; one area with a snail infection rate of 0.27% was considered lightly endemic and the other, with an infection rate in the snails of 4–8%, was considered heavily endemic for 
 <italic>S. japonicum</italic> (Li Hsu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">1984a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">b</xref>). Schistosomula were irradiated at 38 Gy and buffalo were vaccinated twice and transported to the lightly endemic area. The vaccinated buffalo showed a body weight gain of 34% compared with 21% in control, unvaccinated buffalo and 150 days after placing in the pasture the average reduction in worm counts was 75%, while egg counts were reduced by 80%. Cattle and buffalo given three doses of irradiated vaccine were placed in the area that was highly endemic for 
 <italic>S. bovis.</italic> All animals lost weight, although this was slightly higher in the unvaccinated animals. However, worm burdens were reduced by 65% and 75% in vaccinated cattle and buffalo, respectively. The reduction in egg counts was 55% in vaccinated cattle and 70% in the vaccinated buffalo. Pigs vaccinated with schistosomula inactivated by 200 Gy irradiation were 95% resistant to challenge judged by fecal egg counts and pathology. Interestingly, the vaccinated pigs did not produce antibodies against a 62-kDa myosin protein, Sj62, which was thought to be implicated in development of resistance to schistosome infection (Bickle et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2001</xref>). The actual mechanisms of action of radiation attenuation in schistosomes are not well understood, but it is believed that for the process to be effective, attenuation must be sufficient to retard migration of larvae through the lungs. This increase in immunogenicity may be related to alterations observed on gene expression in irradiated larvae (Dillon et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2008</xref>).
