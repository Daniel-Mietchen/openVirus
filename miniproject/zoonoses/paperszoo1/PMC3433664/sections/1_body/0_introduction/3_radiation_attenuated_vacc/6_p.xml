<p>Parasitic bronchitis of sheep and goats also occurs in hilly regions of India and neighboring countries. Several species of strongyloid nematodes are involved but the most prevalent and most pathogenic is 
 <italic>Dictyocaulus filaria</italic> which causes high mortality and morbidity in young animals. Immunity can be induced by vaccination of lambs with two doses of 1,000 larvae irradiated at 400 Gy by X-rays or gamma rays (Sokolic et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">1963</xref>). When vaccinated animals were challenged a lower number of larvae and reproductive female worms were recovered from them, the clinical and pathological effects of infection were less pronounced, parasite development, particularly oogenesis, was lower, and there was no mortality in vaccinated lambs compared with unvaccinated controls. Effective control of this parasite in India was made possible using a gamma-attenuated 
 <italic>D. filaria</italic> vaccine developed in 1971 to treat 6-week-old lambs as part of sheep husbandry practice. In another study, sheep vaccinated with 500 Gy irradiated third-stage larvae on two occasions a month apart and then allowed to feed in natural pasture showed a high degree of resistance against 
 <italic>D. filaria</italic> and were also protected to some degree against infection with other nematodes (Dhar and Sharma 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1981</xref>). Over an 8-month observation period, there was a reduced prevalence of infection and significantly lower output of larvae in the feces of vaccinated lambs.
