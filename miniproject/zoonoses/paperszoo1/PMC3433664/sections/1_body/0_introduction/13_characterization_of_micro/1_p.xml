<p>Studies of stable isotopes have unequivocally demonstrated that the isotope ratios in animal tissues are a function of the food and water that they consume and can therefore be related to the geographic origins of those animals thereby providing a means of determining origin in migratory animals. In the same way, there is substantial evidence to indicate that stable isotope ratios of microorganisms that are maintained 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> are also a function of the nutrients and water that are used in the preparation of culture media (Kreuzer-Martin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2004a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">b</xref>). A survey of carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen stable isotope ratios in over 500 samples of bacteriological culture media used to produce 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> showed that they varied according to the isotopic variation in the plant and animal products upon which the media were based (Kreuzer-Martin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2004b</xref>). The variation was sufficient to translate into substantial isotope variation in cultures grown on different batches of media. This finding has potentially important application in the field of microbiology where different bacteria or viruses are cultured and possibly used in vaccine production. By determining the stable isotope signatures of batches of organisms at the time of production, it would be possible to identify those products at a later date. Even if several manufacturers provided genetically identical organisms that would express the same genotype, they would not show the same isotope ratios. In this way, it would be possible to determine the origin of attenuated versions of organisms in vaccines, leading to more effective quality control of vaccines and allow closer monitoring of their distribution and use in the field.
