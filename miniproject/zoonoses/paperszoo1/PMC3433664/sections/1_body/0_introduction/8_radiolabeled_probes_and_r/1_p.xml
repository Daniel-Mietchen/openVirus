<p>Many routine diagnostic tests provide an indirect identification of the parasite by the detection of antibodies in the serum of the infected animal. Serology involving the detection of antibodies does not allow easy differentiation between recent or latent infections, whether an animal is a carrier, or if it is free from infection following successful drug treatment. Nucleic acid-based diagnostics potentially allow such discrimination by hybridizing with any parasite DNA if it is present in the infected animal.</p>
