<p>More informed analysis of the susceptibility of trypanotolerant livestock to infection was undertaken by comparing the humoral immune responses of N’dama (trypanotolerant) and Zebu (susceptible) cattle using immunoprecipitation of proteins from 
 <sup>35</sup>S-methionine and 
 <sup>35</sup>S-cystein labeled trypanosomes (Shapiro and Murray 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">1982</xref>). Three proteins of MW 110,000–300,000 were recognized by cattle that were able to control infections and the trypanotolerant N’dama were able to recognize more of the trypanosome proteins than the Zebu cattle. Immune responses in cattle infected with two different clones of 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> and antibody response was followed by radioimmunoassay. The variable surface glycoproteins (VSGs) of the two clones was labeled with 
 <sup>125</sup>I and precipitated with immune sera (Musoke et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">1981</xref>). There were at least two peaks of antibody activity to the infecting clones, with the second peak much higher than the first. IgG1 and IgM antibodies were eluted from immunoabsorbent columns on which the VSGs were coupled for use in neutralization tests. IgM antibodies from the first peak of antibody activity were more efficient in neutralizing trypanosomes than IgGl, but the reverse was true of the antibodies isolated from the second peak. Similar radioimmunoassays in 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic>-infected wildebeest (Rurangirwa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">1986</xref>) showed a typical sequence of IgM, IgG1, and IgG2 antibodies, with a higher frequency of occurrence than seen in cattle. Trypanosomes were also metabolically labeled with 
 <sup>35</sup>Se-methionine to determine the interaction between immune serum and peripheral blood leukocytes. Sera from wildebeest had a higher propensity to induce adherence to both homologous and heterologous leukocytes.
