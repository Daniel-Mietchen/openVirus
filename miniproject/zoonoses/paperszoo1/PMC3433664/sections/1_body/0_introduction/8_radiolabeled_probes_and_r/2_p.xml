<p>Radiolabeled probes have been used in helminth parasites to provide information on host–parasite relationships in mammalian host. In order to determine the progressive migration of cercariae of 
 <italic>F. hepatica</italic> in the mammalian host, metacercariae were labeled with 
 <sup>35</sup>Se by exposing the infected snail host to 
 <sup>75</sup>Se-methionine. Mice were inoculated with labeled metacercariae and their distribution in the gut, body cavities, and liver was determined by autoradiography (Hsu 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">1986</xref>). In similar studies, cercariae of 
 <italic>S. bovis</italic>, 
 <italic>Schistosoma intercalatum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> were labeled with 
 <sup>75</sup>Se by exposing the intermediate snail host to the probe for 20 h in order to determine the relationships between the cercariae and schistosomulae (Christensen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1983</xref>). The cercariae retained the label for at least 32 days. For 
 <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic>, infective larvae were labeled by adding 
 <sup>75</sup>Se to fecal sediment containing the infective larvae. Labeled worms could be identified by autoradiography for up to 37 days after infection (Georgi and Le Jambre 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">1983</xref>). Glycoproteins of 
 <italic>S. japonicum</italic>, 
 <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. haematobium</italic> that were genus or species specific were identified by labeling schistosomes with 
 <sup>35</sup>S-methionine (Nordena and Strand 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">1984</xref>). Characterization of genomic DNA for several species of nematode parasites of cattle provided potential diagnostic probes for differentiation of infections in cattle. DNA probes prepared from 
 <italic>Haemonchus placei</italic>, 
 <italic>Ostertagia ostertagi</italic>, 
 <italic>Cooperia oncophora</italic>, and 
 <italic>Oesophagostomum radiatum</italic> were able to detect as few as 25 eggs in fecal samples from infected cattle (Christensen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1994</xref>).
