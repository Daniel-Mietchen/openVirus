<p>For 
 <italic>Babesia</italic> infections, the requirements for diagnosis are related to the different stages of infection. During the early stage of infection, the parasitemia is low, and it is not easy to detect the parasite in the low number of infected erythrocytes. During the acute phase of infection, it is easy to identify infected animal by light microscopy, but it might also be necessary to differentiate between different hemoprotozoa to ensure appropriate chemotherapy. After treatment and recovery, it is necessary to monitor the effectiveness of treatment, and finally, there is a stage lasting several months when an animal becomes a “carrier” where antibodies are present but the parasitemia is extremely low. Detection of 
 <italic>B. bigemina</italic> using conventional microscopy lacks sensitivity, as a large number of parasites (0.01% parasitemia) must be present to enable reliable detection. The problem of diagnosis is even more problematic in animals that have had a primary infection and then recovered, whereupon they harbor microscopically undetectable, sub-clinical infections. As these animals serve as reservoirs of infection, it is necessary to identify them as simply and speedily as possible. Originally, the only method available for their identification was to inoculate blood from the suspect animal and inoculate into splenectomized calf and examine it for signs of infection. Oligonucleotide probes selected from the SSrRNA of 
 <italic>B. bigemina</italic> were therefore developed to use in the sensitive detection of the parasite in bovine blood (Reddy and Dame 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">1992</xref>). The probes were labeled with 
 <sup>32</sup>P and their sensitivity and specificity to detect parasite RNA assessed; they were able to detect 
 <italic>B. bigemina</italic> RNA at levels of 0.012 fmol and showed no cross-reactivity with 
 <italic>B. bovis</italic>, the parasite most likely to compromise clinical assessment of infection. When used to detect 
 <italic>B. bigemina</italic> in bovine blood, the probes detected 100 parasite-infected red cells in 20 μl of bovine blood. In calves experimentally infected with 1,000 
 <italic>B. bigemina</italic> infected bovine erythrocytes, positive signals were obtained from blood samples collected from the infected animals from day 2 after inoculation. In contrast, parasites were not detected in the blood until 8 days or more after infection. A 
 <sup>32</sup>P-labeled DNA probe of 
 <italic>B. bigemina</italic> was also found to hybridize with strains of the parasite from Texas, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, and Kenya (Buening et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1990</xref>). The probe hybridized with 10 pg of 
 <italic>B. bigemina</italic> DNA and 150 infected erythrocytes and was useful for detecting carrier animals. For 
 <italic>B. bovis</italic>, DNA probes were constructed and those that specifically hybridized to 
 <italic>B. bovis</italic> DNA were selected for testing (Petchpoo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">1992</xref>). A probe with the highest sensitivity detected 25 pg of purified 
 <italic>B. bovis</italic> DNA and as few as 300 parasites in 10 μl of infected blood. The probe did not cross-hybridize to 
 <italic>B. bigemina</italic>, 
 <italic>Trypanosoma evansi</italic>, 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, 
 <italic>A. marginale</italic>, 
 <italic>Boophilus microplus</italic>, and cow DNA. In the Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA, the probe could differentiate between isolates of 
 <italic>B. bovis</italic> from different geographic locations. Vaccine strategies for 
 <italic>B. bovis</italic> include the use of attenuated live parasites and various inactivated preparations. Although the attenuated vaccine provides the best protection against challenge with both homologous and heterologous strains, it has a number of disadvantages, including a short shelf-life, variation in virulence, contamination with host erythrocytes, and perpetuation of the life cycle by creation of a carrier state. Protective immunity in babesiosis may be directed against surface antigens associated with the merozoite stage. Possible candidate merozoite surface antigens of 
 <italic>B. bovis</italic> have been identified by immunoprecipitation of 
 <sup>125</sup>I-labeled proteins with immune bovine serum and monoclonal antibodies (Goff et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">1988a</xref>).
