<p>This high level of discrimination has been used to distinguish between different 
 <italic>Theileria</italic> species including 
 <italic>T. parva</italic>, 
 <italic>T. annulata</italic>, 
 <italic>Theileria mutans</italic>, 
 <italic>Theileria buffleli</italic>, and 
 <italic>Theileria taurotragi</italic> (Allsopp et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1993</xref>). Six 
 <sup>32</sup>P oligonucleotide probes were designed that enabled unequivocal species-specific identification by detection of parasite subunit ribosomal RNA. The test also led to identification of previously unknown species of 
 <italic>Theileria</italic> spp. in buffalo and sable antelope. The internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of several 
 <italic>T. parva</italic> isolates were sequenced in order to distinguish between parasites that cause East Coast fever (
 <italic>Theileria parva parva</italic>) and those that cause corridor disease (
 <italic>Theileria parva lawrenci</italic>). Six oligonucleotides labeled with 
 <sup>32</sup>P were used in slot blots to detect parasites from cattle and buffalo. 
 <italic>T. parva parva</italic> isolates hybridized with only a few of these probes, whereas 
 <italic>T. p. lawrenci</italic> were more variable and hybridized with many more of them (Collins and Allsopp 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1999</xref>). It was possible to characterize and isolate as 
 <italic>T. p. parva</italic> with &gt;90% probability or as 
 <italic>T. p. lawrenci</italic> with &gt;80% probability, and the probes could be useful in determining the distribution of different genotypes and subspecies of 
 <italic>T. parva</italic>. DNA probes have also been used to characterize the vaccine that is used in East, Central, and Southern Africa to protect cattle against 
 <italic>T. parva</italic>. The vaccine, known as the Muguga cocktail, comprises three stocks of 
 <italic>T. parva</italic>, Muguga, Kiambu 5, and Serengeti-transformed. Four radiolabeled nucleic acid probes were used to determine the relationships among the three stocks of the vaccine (Bishop et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2001</xref>), the first attempt to comprehensively characterize the vaccine. There was close similarity between the Muguga and Serengeti stocks whereas the Kiambu 5 stock was significantly different from them. In view of these findings, it was suggested that only one of the Muguga and Serengeti-transformed stocks was essential for vaccination. However, later studies indicated that the two stocks were extremely diverse; they each comprised eight genotypes whereas Kiambu 5 showed no diversity. The Serengeti stock contained two of the genotypes present in Muguga as well as Kiambu genotype (Patel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2011</xref>).
