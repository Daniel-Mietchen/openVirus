<p>Microscopic examination of blood smears for piroplasms is the most widely used diagnostic method for detecting acute infections with 
 <italic>Theileria</italic> spp., but is inadequate for detecting chronic infections in carrier animals where the parasitemia is low, resulting in false-negative diagnosis. A more reliable and sensitive detection method is to employ a specific theilerial antigen in PCR; a primer derived from a 
 <italic>T. parva</italic>-specific 104-kDa antigen (p104 gene) labeled with 
 <sup>32</sup>P was able to detect as few as 1.4 parasites per microliter of blood (Odongo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2010</xref>). For detection of 
 <italic>Theileria sergenti</italic> infection, a genomic DNA library of 
 <italic>T. sergenti</italic> was screened to detect clones containing the parasite's DNA sequences; two positive DNA inserts were purified from the recombinant plasmids and used as probes labeled with 
 <sup>32</sup>P. The probes were sensitive enough to detect 15Â pg of purified 
 <italic>T. sergenti</italic> DNA (equivalent to 1,200 parasites), while in diluted red blood cells infected with 
 <italic>T. sergenti</italic> they were able to detect 8,000 parasites (Kajiwara et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">1990</xref>).
