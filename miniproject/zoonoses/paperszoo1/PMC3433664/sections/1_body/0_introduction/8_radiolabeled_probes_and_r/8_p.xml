<p>Radiolabeled probes have also been used in studies on the immune responses to infections with pathogenic trypanosomes. The involvement of antibodies, macrophage activation, and complement in destroying 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> in immune animals was determined by using parasites labeled with 
 <sup>75</sup>Se-methionine (MacAskill et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">1980</xref>). The labeled trypanosomes were inoculated intravenously into mice that had been immunized by infection and drug treatment, and 1 h later their distribution in various tissues and organs was determined. Destruction of the trypanosomes took place largely in the liver by antibody-mediated phagocytosis. In contrast, when experiments were conducted in mice with acute fulminating infections, no hepatic uptake was observed (MacAskill et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">1981</xref>). It was concluded that the mice produced insufficient levels of antibodies to opsonize the extremely high numbers of trypanosomes present in the circulation since opsonization was observed when mice were inoculated with a trypanosome strain that caused a more chronic infection (MacAskill et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">1981</xref>). A similar approach was used to determine the basis for trypanotolerance shown by certain breeds of cattle. Experimental studies were undertaken in two breeds of mice, one A/J that was fully susceptible to infection with 
 <italic>T. congolense</italic> (MacAskill et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">1983</xref>) and one, C57Bl, which was tolerant to infection. When the hepatic uptake of 
 <sup>75</sup>Se-labeled 
 <italic>T. congolense</italic> by infected mice was measured as an index of antibody production, it was found that only C57B1 mice could remove circulating labeled parasites, this ability persisting for several weeks after infection. It was concluded that the trypanotolerant strain of mice depended on its more efficient antibody response to resist the effects of trypanosome infection (MacAskill et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">1983</xref>). In other studies, a radioisotopic technique utilizing 
 <sup>3</sup>H-uridine was developed to determine the tissue distribution of intravenously inoculated 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> in susceptible (Swiss–Webster) and resistant (deer) strains of mice. During the initial 24 h of infection with labeled organisms, trypanosomes were cleared from the bloodstream of deer mice to a significantly greater extent than in Swiss–Webster mice Anderson and Banks
