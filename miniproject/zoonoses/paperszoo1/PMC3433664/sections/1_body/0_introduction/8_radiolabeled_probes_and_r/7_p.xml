<p>A quantitative solid-phase radioimmunoassay (RIA) was developed for the purpose of ranking sera from exposed animals according to their titer of anti-
 <italic>B. bovis</italic> antibody. The antigen was sonicated lysed infected blood cells, and antibody binding was detected with 
 <sup>125</sup>I-labeled anti-bovine IgG. A high specificity for 
 <italic>B. bovis</italic> was demonstrated. There was good agreement in identifying exposed cattle when the test was compared with an indirect fluorescent antibody, and the RIA was more effective in detecting changes in antibody titer (Kahl et al.
