  <title>BDV antigens expressed in neurons in all brain areas.</title>
  <p>Bank vole 1. A.–C. Demonstration of BDV N protein with monoclonal antibody Bo-18. A. Cortex. A small proportion of neurons in the superficial granular layer (arrow) and numerous neurons in the superficial pyramidal layer (arrowhead) express viral antigen in cell bodies (arrowhead). The fine lined staining in the remaining parenchyma represents viral antigen in cell processes (see also B). B. Hippocampus, CA1. A few pyramidal cells (arrow) and scattered neurons in Stratum radiatum and Stratum oriens (arrowheads) express viral antigen C. Cerebellum. Purkinje cell bodies (black arrow) and processes (black arrowhead) exhibit the most prominent reaction. Some neurons in the granular layer (white arrow) and the molecular layer (white arrowhead) are also positive. D. Staining for BDV P protein shows a similar expression pattern, but with generally lower intensity. Arrows and arrowheads: see C. Bars = 20 µm.</p>
