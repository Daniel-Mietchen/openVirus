  <title>BDV antigen expressed in the peripheral nervous system.</title>
  <p>Demonstration of BDV N protein with monoclonal antibody Bo-18. A. Bank vole 5. Section of 
   <italic>M. quadriceps femoris</italic> (*) with embedded femoral nerve (arrows) expressing BDV antigen in axons. Bar = 20 µm. B. Bank vole 4. Esophagus (E: epithelial layer). Between muscle layers (M) is a myenteric plexus structure with two neurons expressing BDV antigen (arrowheads). The adjacent mediastinal nerve exhibits abundant viral antigen in axons (arrow). Bar = 20 µm. Inset: B. Bank vole 4, expressing BDV antigen in neurons of a myenteric ganglion structure (arrow) in the urinary bladder wall. Bar = 10 µm. C. Bank vole 6. Trachea (RE: respiratory epithelium; M: muscle layer) and adjacent mediastinal ganglion with BDV antigen in neurons (arrows). Viral antigen is also expressed in axons of nerve fibers in the tracheal wall (arrowheads). Bar = 20 µm. D. Urinary bladder wall. Bank vole 36. BDV antigen is expressed in axons in an interstitial nerve (arrow) and in nuclei of smooth muscle cells (arrowheads). Inset: Bank vole 6. Smooth muscle cells express BDV antigen in both nucleus and cytoplasm (arrowhead). Bars = 10 µm. E, F. BDV antigen expression in non-neuronal cells. E. Bank vole 36. 
   <italic>M. quadriceps femoris</italic> with BDV antigen in axons of interstitial nerve fiber (arrowheads) and in the cytoplasm of a myofiber (arrow). Inset: Bank vole 6. Myocardium with BDV antigen in a single myofiber. Bars = 10 µm. F. Bank vole 36. Adrenal gland. BDV antigen is expressed by several chromaffine cells in the medulla (M). C: Cortex. Bar = 10 µm.
