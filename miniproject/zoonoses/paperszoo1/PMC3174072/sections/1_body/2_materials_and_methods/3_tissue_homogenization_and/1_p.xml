<p>Brain tissue and feces (50–100 mg) were homogenized in 1 ml of Tripure Isolation Reagent (Roche) with 5-mm glass beads (LENZ Laborglas) and sterile sand (Merck) by 5000 rpm on the MagNAlyser homogenizer (Roche) for 45 sec. After centrifugation at 3000 g for 5 min, the supernatant was subjected to RNA extraction. For 50 to 100 µl of urine, RNA was extracted with 1 ml of the Tripure reagent; for smaller available volumes of urine, the amount was 500 µl. RNA findings were confirmed and DNA existence studied from brain tissue samples homogenized similarly in 1 ml of extraction buffer of the AllPrep RNA/DNA kit (Qiagen), and further processed according to manufacturer's instructions.</p>
