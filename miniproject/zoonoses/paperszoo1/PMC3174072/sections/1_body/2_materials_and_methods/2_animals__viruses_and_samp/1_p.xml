<p>Thirteen serologically BDV-negative, pregnant laboratory-born bank voles of wild-caught parents, entered a Biosafety level 3 laboratory 1 to 2 weeks before giving birth to 2 to 6 pups each. Each litter lived, together with their dam, in an individually ventilated, HEPA-filtered cage (Isocage Unit, Tecniplast, Italy). We checked the function of the cage unit and the welfare of the voles daily. In addition to the usual forage and water, the voles ate raw potatoes to guarantee their fluid balance. The 41 newborn voles were infected intracerebrally (i.c.) with a 25G needle with 5 µl of fourth rat passage of the BDV/He80 strain, the so-called “rat BDV”

After 2 (13 voles), 4 (17 voles), 6 (16 voles) or 8 (2 voles) weeks post infection (p.i.), the voles were euthanized under isoflurane anesthesia by cervical dislocation. One severely symptomatic vole was euthanized at 3 weeks p.i., and another died 5 weeks p.i. Voles from each litter were equally included in groups at pre-set times. Before anesthesia, we observed the voles in their individual cages, followed by collection of blood samples from the retro-orbital sinus with capillary tubes under anesthesia just before euthanasia. Subsequently, urine and the rectum with feces (at least four times the volume of rectal tissue) and a range of tissues were aseptically collected, including brain, salivary glands, heart, lung and mediastinum, liver, kidney, spleen, urinary bladder, inner genitals, and
