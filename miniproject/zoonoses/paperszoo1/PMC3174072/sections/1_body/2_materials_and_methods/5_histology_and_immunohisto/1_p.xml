<p>Sections (3–5 µm) were prepared and stained with hematoxylin-eosin for histological evaluation, or were subjected to immunohistology. Immunohistology for the demonstration of BDV antigens was performed with the Ventana DAB biotin avidin detection kit on the Ventana Discovery Automatic Slidestainer (Ventana Medical Systems). The protocol included 20 min incubation with either rabbit polyclonal anti-BDV-nucleocapsid protein (N) 1∶5000

 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. BDV-infected horse brain tissue served as a positive control for all three anti-BDV antibodies. Consecutive sections incubated with the pre-immune serum instead of the anti-BDV antisera served as negative controls. Cleaved caspase-3 expression was demonstrated according to an earlier protocol
