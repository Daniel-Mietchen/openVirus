<p>Urine and rectal/fecal RNA was reverse transcribed and the BDV nucleocapsid protein (N) gene amplified with nested PCR as described previously 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Kinnunen1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Brain RNA was processed in the same way but with a single, outer PCR round. The BDV phosphoprotein (P) gene RNA was detected by real-time qPCR as described 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Wensman1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. BDV DNA was detected with the same N and P primers and probes in the same conditions but without the reverse transcription (RT) step. Only samples positive for both N and P RT-PCRs were interpreted as containing BDV RNA.
