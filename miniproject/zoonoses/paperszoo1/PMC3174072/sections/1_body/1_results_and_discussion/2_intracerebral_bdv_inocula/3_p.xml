<p>Apart from urinary bladder smooth muscle cells, other extraneuronal cells, such as the chromaffine cells in the adrenal medulla and myocytes in heart and skeletal muscle, occasionally expressed BDV antigen in voles with widespread expression in the peripheral nervous system (

All other tissues were BDV-antigen-negative. These findings are in accordance with BDV antigen detection in extraneuronal cells in a naturally infected horse
