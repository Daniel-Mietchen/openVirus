<p>To identify the BDV target cells and viral spread, immunohistology was employed using mono- and polyclonal antibodies for BDV N 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Haas1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and P 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Viral antigen was detectable in a large proportion of neurons in all brain areas (cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, brain stem), and was detected both in cell bodies and processes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023622-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The expression patterns for both antigens were identical, but the nucleoprotein reaction was generally more intense (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023622-g001">Figure 1</xref>), as would be expected in the acute phase of the infection when N is expressed more abundantly than P 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Watanabe2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. All neuronal cell types appeared infected, but in variable proportions. No obvious difference appeared in the distribution and intensity of viral antigen expression at the different time points p.i.
