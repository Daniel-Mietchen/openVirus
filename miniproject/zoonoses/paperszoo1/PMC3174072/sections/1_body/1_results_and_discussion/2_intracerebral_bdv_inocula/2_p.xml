<p>BDV is known to spread centrifugally via peripheral nerves in experimentally infected rodents

 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Ackermann1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. To assess whether this also occurs in bank voles, we examined a range of tissues for the presence of BDV antigen and observed it in axons in peripheral nerves, for example in the mediastinum and the mesentery, in skeletal muscle (femoral nerve), and in the urinary bladder in a large proportion (68%) of voles and as early as 2 weeks p.i. (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0023622.s001">Table S1</xref>), which was seen in an additional 2 voles that did not appear to excrete virus into their urine at the time of euthanasia. These findings suggest that in bank voles, BDV spreads sooner than in mice (day 120 p.i.)
