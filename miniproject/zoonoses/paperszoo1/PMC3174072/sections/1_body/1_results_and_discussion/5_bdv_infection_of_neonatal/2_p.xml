<p>The brains of all voles were examined histologically for pathological changes associated with BDV infection. Voles with clinical symptoms exhibited no evidence of an inflammatory reaction. The cerebrum, hippocampus, and brain stem were unaltered, as was the cerebellum in most (4 of 6) cases. The vole euthanized due to its clinical signs, however, showed reduced number of Purkinje cells (PC). Small numbers of disseminated PCs were undergoing necrosis or apoptosis or both, as confirmed by immunohistology for active, cleaved caspase-3 in occasional PCs (

This was despite the lack of apparent differences in viral antigen expression in comparison to that of other infected voles. In the vole that had shown an occasional tremor, its number of PCs also appeared lower than in controls.
