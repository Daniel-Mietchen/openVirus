<p>Seven voles, which were euthanized 4 and 6 weeks p.i., had very mild focal leptomeningeal and occasionally adjacent parenchymal perivascular inflammatory infiltration consisting of mononuclear cells (macrophages, some lymphocytes) in the parietal cortex (

This was associated neither with clinical symptoms, morphological evidence of neuronal cell death, nor increased neuronal BDV antigen expression. Similar mild mononuclear infiltrations may appear in BDV-infected mice and neonatally infected rats independent of viral distribution
