<p>Taking into account that the control voles remained asymptomatic, one can conclude that these neurobehavioral changes in infected voles were likely a consequence of BDV infection. However, based on sample size, these findings are not supported statistically (Mid-P exact, p = 0.055). Nonetheless, they are consistent with findings in neonatally BDV-infected laboratory mice and rats
