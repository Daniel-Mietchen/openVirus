<p>Each vole was clinically monitored on a daily and blinded basis and closely observed in an individual cage to detect any potential treatment-related symptoms. Then they were euthanized. The majority (31 of 41; 76%) of those infected and all 9 control voles remained free of clinical symptoms for the entire observation period; the remaining 10 voles (24%), however, developed neurobehavioral changes (

Four of these voles exhibited severe symptoms: One circled and fell down and had to be euthanized 3 weeks p.i., another occasionally showed tremor and was euthanized 6 weeks p.i., the third died after one day of locomotor hyperactivity, and the last one was first hyperactive and later atactic, tremoric, spastic, apathic, and emaciated, with scruffy fur (

Female voles (7 of 16) were significantly more frequently affected than males (3 of 25; Mid-P exact test p = 0.0154), consistent with a study in rats that suggested a role for sexual hormones in Borna disease pathogenesis. However, the most relevant finding from our clinical examination was that BDV does generally not kill bank voles, but the infection is able to establish itself, and the virus to be shed for several weeks ― all important prerequisites for a reservoir.
