<p>The clinical symptoms observed in the vole with evidence of PC death were dominated by circling and falling; symptoms probably resulting from the lack of PCs' inhibitory effect on the vestibular nuclei

Unlike in rats, BDV appeared to induce no neuronal cell death in experimentally infected gerbils, while inducing clinical symptoms, and, contrary to our findings, the neuronal BDV expression pattern differed between symptomatic and healthy gerbils
