<p>Bank voles can be productively infected after intracerebral inoculation of various doses of BDV. The infection does not generally lead to pathological alterations and is mainly subclinical. A minority of the infected voles produce antibodies. BDV infection in the bank vole is primarily neurotropic, although it spreads centrifugally from the widely infected central nervous system into several peripheral nerves and ganglia, for instance in the urinary bladder. Often, the virus is also excreted in urine and feces. Furthermore, BDV RNA is commonly reverse transcribed into DNA in bank vole brain tissue, verifying that this newly detected phenomenon, which is necessary for genome integration of sequences of an RNA virus, occurs readily 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> during BDV infection. In addition to confirming this crucial step in the endogenization process, these data provide evidence that the bank vole can be a potential BDV reservoir.
