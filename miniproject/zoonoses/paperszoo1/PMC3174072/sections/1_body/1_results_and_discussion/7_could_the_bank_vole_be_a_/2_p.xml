<p>The bank vole is very common in Europe 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Amori1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, also throughout the areas of BDV distribution 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Staeheli1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Kinnunen1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Degiorgis1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Dauphin1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Bank voles occupy many kinds of woody habitats, but in winter may reside inside animal sheds and homes 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Amori1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Population densities fluctuate strongly, in a few-year cycle 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Kallio1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Olsson1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Moreover, BDV case numbers have fluctuated in such cycles

 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Drrwald3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, but any association with bank vole population densities remains to be shown. Interestingly, asymptomatic bank voles excrete and transmit another pathogen, Puumala hantavirus, in saliva, urine, and feces for at least 44 to 84 days p.i. with persistence of this virus 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Hardestam1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, which has some similarities to BDV excretion in our findings.
