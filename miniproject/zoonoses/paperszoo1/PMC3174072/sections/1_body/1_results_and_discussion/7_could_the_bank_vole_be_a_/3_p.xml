<p>Further experimental infections could be extended to include other inoculation routes and frequent urine, feces, and saliva sampling to characterize in more detail the pattern of BDV excretion, as well as to use cohousing with uninfected individuals to study transmission. In this study, no horizontal transmission of BDV from infected offspring to dams was detectable but cannot be excluded: Dams remained healthy, and no viral RNA, antigen, or antibodies could be detected at the end of the study, around 12 days after weaning and 40 days after infection of the pups. However, rat dams, after infection of their litters and when co-housed during the entire period, can acquire the infection and succumb to severe Borna disease between 3 and 5 months
