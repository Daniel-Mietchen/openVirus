<p>The present study clearly demonstrates for the first time that one mammal, a wild rodent species very common in endemic BDV regions, the bank vole, can be infected with and excrete BDV, generally without developing clinical disease or overt pathological changes. More specifically, we were able to establish productive infection after intracerebral viral inoculation, based on the combined demonstration of viral RNA and antigen. That BDV is rarely lethal in the bank vole would fit well into the picture of a possible reservoir. Specifically, the reservoir species cannot be too severely affected to be able to spread a pathogen; benign behavioral alterations may even assist the spread.</p>
