<p>The mechanism of BDV reverse transcription in the bank vole remains to be elucidated. How and why BDV, but not some other RNA viruses, activates the reverse transcriptases, remains enigmatic, although BDV replicates in the nucleus. Likely candidates for reverse-transcribing BDV genes in bank voles are LINE-1 transposons (L1), which do exhibit reverse transcription activity 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Horie1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Not only the human, but also the mouse and rat genome has included L1s ever since their common evolutionary ancestor 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Pascale1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, rendering it very likely that the bank vole also has these genes. Whatever the mechanism of reverse transcription in the brain of a BDV-infected bank vole, no mutations were detectable between the short BDV amplicons obtained from RNA and DNA.
