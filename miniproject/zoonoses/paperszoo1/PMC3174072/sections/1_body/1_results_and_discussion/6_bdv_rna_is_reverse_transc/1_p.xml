<p>Recent studies demonstrate reverse transcription of BDV-like sequences and integration of the respective DNA into mammalian genomes 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Horie1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Belyi1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. We were interested to know whether RNA from exogenous and consequently replicating BDV in bank voles is efficiently transcribed into DNA. We employed two PCRs without the RT step to amplify BDV N and P genes from infected voles' brain DNA
