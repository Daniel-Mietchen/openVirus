<p>Although this reverse transcription was consistent during bank vole BDV infection, further studies should investigate whether these viral genes exist in episomal DNA form or are inserted into the genome. The bank vole genome is not yet available to address directly the question whether endogenized BDV-like elements (EBL) exist in the bank vole genome, as demonstrated for some other rodents such as the rat, mouse, and squirrel

 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Belyi1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. EBLs may play a role in the epidemiology of BDV, since they may be advantageous and enable a species to function as a reservoir. Species showing EBL sequences (like primates, shrews, mice, and rats) seem more resistant to severe or lethal bornavirus infection than those with none (horse, dog, cat, and rabbit)
