<p>BDV N gene DNA was present in 27 (66%), of those 41 infected, but not in the control voles, thus excluding amplification of possible endogenous BDV-like sequences (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0023622-t001">Table 1</xref>). BDV N DNA prevalence increased with increasing infection dose from 50% (4 of 8) to 78% (14 of 18), and was highest at 4 weeks p.i. at 73% (11 of 15; data not shown). This reverse transcription from RNA into DNA had occurred in half (5 of 10) of those voles studied as early as 2 weeks p.i. and was still detectable at 8 weeks p.i. In addition to the universal finding of N DNA, BDV P gene DNA was identifiable in one vole (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0023622.s001">Table S1</xref>). This vole had received the highest dose and underwent testing at 4 weeks p.i. In addition, several other (12 of 41, 29%) infected voles showed a borderline result in the P-qPCR (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0023622.s001">Table S1</xref>). PCR positivity was sensitive to digestion of the template with DNAse, but not RNAse, confirming that detection of BDV DNA sequences was due to the presence of specific DNA and was not a result from nonspecific RNA amplification (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0023622-t003">Table 3</xref>). The sequenced 258-bp long N-amplicons from RNA RT-PCR and DNA PCR of one vole tested 6 weeks p.i. were 100% identical, with no sequence heterogeneity (quasispecies) observable (data not shown).
