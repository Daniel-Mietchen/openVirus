<p>We utilized an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Kinnunen1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> to study the antibody response of infected bank voles. BDV-specific antibodies were not detectable at 2 weeks p.i., only at 4 weeks p.i. and thereafter (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0023622.s001">Table S1</xref>). These results are similar to those from other experimentally infected rodents, in which antibodies were detectable from days 10 to 35 p.i. onwards, depending on rodent species, strain, immune state, and viral dose 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Morales1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Herzog1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Furrer1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Overall, antibodies were detectable in 41% (16 of 39) of the voles. Most (59%) voles, among them some tested after 6 weeks p.i., had no detectable antibody level. This phenomenon was once reported in one infected laboratory rodent 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Sauder1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> but is common in naturally infected animals such as cats, sheep, and horses 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Vahlenkamp1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Grabner1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. The reason for the delay in or absence of a humoral response is unknown, but what must be considered is that our study animals were outbred and most likely had fully functioning immune systems – which is not necessarily the case in laboratory-bred rats and mice 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Ritter1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Moritoh1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This is supported by the fact that laboratory mice die soon after tick-borne encephalitis virus infection 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Mavtchoutko1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, whereas bank voles thrive despite infection
