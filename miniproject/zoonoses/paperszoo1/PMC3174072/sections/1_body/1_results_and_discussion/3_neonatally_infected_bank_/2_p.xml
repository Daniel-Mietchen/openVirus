<p>Interestingly, BDV was detectable earlier in urine than in feces, although it did, overall, appear more often in the latter (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0023622-t002">Table 2</xref>). Such a difference in excretion kinetics may in part be related to an inhibitory effect of feces on RT-PCR. Results in hantavirus-infected bank voles (10 to 100 times fewer spiked hantavirus RNA copies/ml detectable in feces than in urine) suggest this 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Hardestam1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. If so, the fecal RNA prevalence is probably an underestimate, and excretion might occur also at the earlier time point. However, our results also indicate strong and long-lasting BDV excretion in urine, since BDV RNA was found in urine at all time points p.i. Similar to hantavirus in bank voles 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Hardestam1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, BDV may be excreted intermittently in urine, because not all voles exhibiting BDV antigen in the bladder also showed BDV RNA in their urine at the time of sampling.
