<p>BDV is known to be excreted in the urine but not in feces of neonatally infected rats

 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Morales1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Having demonstrated BDV antigen in nerves and ganglia of urinary bladder and the alimentary tract (esophagus), we examined the bank voles for BDV excretion in urine and feces by RT-PCR

 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Wensman1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Viral RNA was detectable both in urine (6 of 36; 17%) and in feces (20 of 37; 54%) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0023622-t002">Table 2</xref>) of infected voles, but not in controls. The urine tested positive as early as 2 weeks p.i., but the feces were positive from 4 weeks on except for one euthanized symptomatic vole at 3 weeks (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0023622.s001">Table S1</xref>). The proportion of PCR-positive excreta increased with time up to week 6 p.i., most likely reflecting the time-span for centrifugal spread via peripheral nerves. Indeed, voles excreting BDV almost invariably expressed BDV antigen in their peripheral nerves (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0023622.s001">Table S1</xref>) and in particular in the urinary bladder, where interstitial nerve fibers tested positive in 60% (15 of 25) of the voles tested at weeks 4 to 8 p.i. (
