<p>In order to verify whether BDV infection can be established in bank voles, we inoculated newborn bank voles intracerebrally (i.c.) with 10

Litters including the dams were housed in separate, individually ventilated, HEPA-filtered cages, and young bank voles were euthanized 2, 4, 6, or 8 weeks post-infection (p.i.). Their brains were collected and examined by reverse transcriptase (RT) PCRs for BDV nucleocapsid (N) and phosphoprotein (P) genes
