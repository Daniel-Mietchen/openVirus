<p>Both BDV RNA and antigen were detectable in all infected voles, whereas controls were BDV-negative (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0023622.s001">Table S1</xref>), demonstrating productive infection. In one infected vole, no BDV-N RNA was detectable despite the presence of BDV N-antigen, which confirmed the productive infection. All other infected vole brains tested positive for the RNA and protein of both BDV-N and -P. Dams and controls remained negative until the end of the study.
