<p>Natural bornavirus infections are associated with chronic progressive neurological diseases: Borna disease virus (BDV) causes a classically fatal meningoencephalomyelitis mainly in horses 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Ikuta1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, and avian Bornavirus (ABV) causes proventricular dilatation disease, which affects the autonomous nervous system in birds 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Kistler1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. BDV infection can, however, also remain subclinical or result in mild neurobehavioral manifestations 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Ikuta1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Vahlenkamp1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Especially in humans, markers of BDV infection have been demonstrated in several neuropsychiatric diseases

 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Heinrich1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, but although BDV or a BDV-like agent appears to infect humans 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-deLaTorre1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, the existence of human Borna disease is still debatable
