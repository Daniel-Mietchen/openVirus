<p>However, BDV or a BDV-like agent are not only endogenized, but also induce exogenous infections with associated diseases. Borna disease of horses is a long-known disease in central Europe, but is nowadays also occurring elsewhere, and occurs in several other vertebrates, for example the sheep, rabbit, dog, cat, and cow
