<p>BDV is a neurotropic and noncytolytic RNA virus comprising, together with ABV, the family

Surprisingly, since they have an RNA genome and are not retroviruses, extensive database searches have recently shown that bornaviruses, millions of years ago, integrated their genomic DNA counterpart into the genomes of primates and some other vertebrates
