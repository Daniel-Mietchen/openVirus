<p>Based on the epidemiological evidence of a wild rodent reservoir for BDV and our previous findings of BDV antibodies in bank voles, we hypothesized that bank voles can act as a BDV reservoir and could therefore be productively infected without overt pathology. Furthermore, because of the recent demonstration of integration of BDV and BDV-like DNA sequences 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Horie1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Belyi1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, we decided to test whether reverse transcription of exogenous BDV RNA into DNA occurs in these wild mammals during infection. We therefore infected neonate bank voles intracerebrally, monitored the voles for 2 to 8 weeks, and subsequently assessed the extent of BDV infection, the associated pathological changes, and the potential generation of BDV DNA. We found support for both hypotheses: a possible role for bank voles as a BDV reservoir or transmitter, and, after exogenous infection,
