<p>The epidemiology of BDV is still enigmatic. Should the results of the controversial circulatory immune complex-detecting method be confirmed 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Wolff1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Bode1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, the virus infects up to 100% of humans 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Patti1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and horses and would spread through the close contact of countless infected individuals. However, research groups using several other methods suggest a much lower prevalence 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Chalmers1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Furthermore, numerous epidemiological data point towards the existence of a wild-life reservoir 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Staeheli1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Drrwald2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. For instance, in horses and sheep, the infection is not easily transmitted horizontally; BDV prevalence is higher on farms with poor rodent control and hygiene 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Drrwald3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>; and BDV strains cluster geographically rather than according to species or year of isolation 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Kolodziejek1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Furthermore, epidemics are observed at 2 to 5 year intervals 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Drrwald2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Drrwald3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, and as for feline infections risk factors are their hunting and a rural habitat 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Berg1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Moreover, BDV can be transmitted horizontally in laboratory rats via urine 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Sauder1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. While these data provide indirect evidence of a possible reservoir in small wild mammals, natural infections have, indeed, been detected alongside probable equine Borna disease cases in small wild mammals: insectivores (the bicolored white-toothed shrew, 
 <italic>Crocidura leucodon</italic>) in Switzerland have been BDV-positive based on the demonstration of BDV RNA and antigen in tissues, and voles (root/tundra vole, 
 <italic>Microtus oeconomus</italic>; bank vole, 
 <italic>Myodes glareolus</italic>) in Finland have harbored antibodies 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Hilbe1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Puorger1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The bank vole is one of the most common rodent species in Europe 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Amori1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> ― its distribution in Europe clearly includes the areas where BDV infections in animals are reported 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Staeheli1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Kinnunen1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Degiorgis1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Dauphin1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.
