<p>Currently no reports exist on infection studies carried out in wild rodents. However, numerous laboratory animals can be experimentally BDV-infected 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Pletnikov1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Rats mainly develop fatal, non-suppurative encephalitis, when infected as immunocompetent adults, whereas neonatal infection leads to mild symptoms including locomotor hyperactivity, learning deficits, and abnormal social behavior, but with no evidence of an inflammatory response

 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Lancaster1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Neonatal infection in laboratory rats leads to abundant BDV excretion at least in urine

 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Sauder1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The literature on BDV infection of other laboratory rodents is less copious, but the golden hamster and certain mouse strains establish asymptomatic infections, whereas most mice of the MRL strain develop a fatal encephalomyelitis

 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Anzil1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Hallensleben1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and neonatally infected gerbils perish despite the lack of any pathological changes 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Watanabe1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Still, what has been learned from infection studies in laboratory rodents, which often have altered susceptibility to infections due to deficits perhaps in innate immunity 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Ritter1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0023622-Moritoh1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, is not necessarily easy to generalize to any wild rodent species.
