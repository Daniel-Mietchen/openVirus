<p>We developed a stochastic, individual-based simulation model to track the initial spread of HIV over a dynamic network of sexual contacts. The model distinguished married and single men and women, “
 <italic>femmes libres</italic>” and commercial sex workers (CSW). During the timeframe of the simulations (one year), the population was assumed to be constant (no birth, death or migration). The sexual network consisted of stable (spousal) links, short-term links and male visits to CSWs. Stable links were fixed throughout a simulation; short-term links were allowed to form and break up at each time step, and involved both married and single men and women, and 
 <italic>femmes libres</italic>. Network parameters for married and single men and women were set according to modern studies from Yaoundé (the closest available survey location) (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0009936-t004">Table 4</xref> and references therein). 
 <italic>Femmes libres</italic> were assigned with replacement to the remaining “open” short links of men: their sexual promiscuity was thus governed by the sex ratio (the shortage of short links by single and married women compared with short links of men) in each scenario. The number of CSWs was also automatically set in each scenario to match the demand for CSW visits.
