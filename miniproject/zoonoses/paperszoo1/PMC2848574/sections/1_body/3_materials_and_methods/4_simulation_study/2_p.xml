<p>Simulations had a time step of one week. All runs were preceded by an initialization phase restricted to link formation and breakup until the sexual network settled to a steady state. The initial HIV infection was then introduced into a single male to reflect the most likely source of a bushmeat hunter, and the spread of the virus was followed for a year. At each time step, sexual contacts were generated randomly over stable and short links; CSW visits involved a single sexual contact. HIV transmission was restricted to acute infection; its probability per contact was modified by GUD and circumcision status. Transmission rates were scaled according to estimates on modern HIV (

The basic acute transmission rate of early HIV was per default assumed to be lower than that of modern HIV, but higher than modern rates of chronic transmission. Circumcision status in men was fixed for the duration of the simulations. GUD dynamics was not modeled explicitly: healed genital ulcers were replaced randomly from the appropriate class of individuals. The age of GUD episodes and HIV infections was updated at the end of each time step. Chronic HIV infection was per default not transmissible, but protected against repeated acute infection. Population figures were set to reflect historical scenarios as described in the main text. Simulations were implemented in the R software package
