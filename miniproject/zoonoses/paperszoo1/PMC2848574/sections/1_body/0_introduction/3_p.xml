<p>Transmission of simian retroviruses to humans is not exceptional. Simian foamy viruses (SFV) have frequently been transmitted to humans exposed to bushmeat, apparently without further spread 
 <xref rid="pone.0009936-Wolfe1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and the epidemic human T-cell lymphotropic viruses (HTLV) arose from their simian counterparts (STLV) through contacts over thousands of years. It is generally accepted that SFV, STLV, as well as SIV, entered the human population through bushmeat handling. Although such events are common today
