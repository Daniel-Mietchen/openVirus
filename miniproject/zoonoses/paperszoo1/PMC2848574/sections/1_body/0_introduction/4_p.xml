<p>The estimated times of cross-species transmission to humans of the different HTLV-1 subtypes span between less than 3,000 and up to about 50,000 years ago

 <sup>th</sup> century

 <xref rid="pone.0009936-Wertheim1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. This fact prompted the search for factors driving HIV emergence, which can be attributed to phenomena new in the 20
 <sup>th</sup> century. As one of many speculative theories, a hypothesis involving SIV-contaminated polio vaccines has been extensively debated 
 <xref rid="pone.0009936-Hooper1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, but decisively refuted by many lines of scientific evidence

 <xref rid="pone.0009936-Wertheim1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Another hypothesis proposes that unsterile injections serially transmitted SIV from a bushmeat handler to other humans in a chain of acutely infected people, improving its adaptation to the new host
