<p>Here, we aimed to identify which factors could have favored SIV adaptation to humans and facilitated its emergence and spread as HIV. First, we investigated the timing of the splits between HIV-1 groups M and O, and HIV-2 groups A and B and their respective closest SIV lineage, either by reviewing the literature or by using phylogenetic methods to narrow down the missing links. Having established a likely time interval of cross species transmission, we then reviewed colonial medical, and demographic literature, including original archival sources, to investigate how the proposed risk factors, including GUD incidence, city growth, health systems, gender distribution, and commercial sex work (CSW), varied in time and space, across the relevant African regions. Additionally we reviewed ethnographic literature on male circumcision per ethnic group, and assessed whether its geographical distribution, in early 20
 <sup>th</sup> century, overlapped with the putative epicenters for the HIV groups. Finally, we developed computer simulations based on detailed population, sociological and medical data found in our literature and archival searches to identify the key factors that might have facilitated the emergence of HIV-1 group M. Since spatial and temporal coincidence have previously been considered as evidence for factors involved in the emergence of a pathogen
