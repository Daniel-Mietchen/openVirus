<p>Most theories for the origin of HIVs depend on a specific mechanism to facilitate the first few serial transmissions of the virus in humans, and largely limit the problem to initial adaptation

However, the emergence of an epidemic might also have depended on the conditions for large scale spread in the general population by the conventional route, i.e. by heterosexual transmission. Without favorable conditions for further spread, even a virus that passed initial adaptation might quickly go extinct. While we cannot exclude that the initial adaptation of HIVs depended on specific transmission routes (e.g. parenteral transmission), we investigated the possibility that epidemic emergence may have depended on large population centers riddled with sexual promiscuity and GUD. Bearing in mind that few cities in Central and West Africa were well developed during the peak GUD period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009936-g002">Figure 2</xref>), our hypothesis may explain why few well-adapted strains emerged; and it may not be coincidence that exactly two HIV-1 groups emerged in Central Africa, at a time when two cities (Kinshasa and Douala) stood out in the region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009936-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Therefore we focused on the co-factors sexual promiscuity, GUD, and lack of circumcision in cities. Our review of the colonial medical literature established that GUD, particularly syphilis, chancroid, and LGV, peaked in the relevant cities, in the period 1910–35, with incidences 1.5–2.5 orders of magnitude higher than in mid 20
 <sup>th</sup> century, coinciding in time with the narrow timeframe of the emergence of epidemic HIV groups.
