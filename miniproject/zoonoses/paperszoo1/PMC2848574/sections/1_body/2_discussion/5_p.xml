<p>Our computer simulations of detailed historical scenarios for Kinshasa confirmed that the period around the origin of HIV-1 group M in the city was uniquely permissive for the emergence of an epidemic by heterosexual transmission. While exact probabilities of HIV emergence cannot be computed (e.g. we have no information on the initial infectivity of a novel zoonotic HIV), our semi-quantitative approach could robustly predict an increased relative probability associated with this time period. Furthermore, our simulations suggested that the peak in GUD prevalence was the most important contributor to chains of transmission of ill-adapted HIV. A related important result of the simulations is the inability of zoonotic HIV to generate epidemics in the pre-colonial village scenario (characterized by the absence of GUD and CSWs), which explains the long standing absence of HIV epidemics in the pre-colonial environments. According to these results, the window of high permissivity for epidemic HIV emergence was open by the spread of GUD infections due to the organized colonization of the relevant African areas, and probably closed by the aggressive treatment campaigns against GUDs from the mid thirties. Therefore, we predict that newly emerging HIV groups will have a less dramatic spread if GUD remains under control. Remarkably, the direct effect of population size and circumcision proved to be relatively small, although their effect is recognized and they may have acted indirectly.</p>
