<p>Thus, we looked for factors to explain why emergence of HIV is temporally and spatially restricted to the era and areas observed. Our review of the co-factors of sexual transmission indicated GUD as paramount and lack of male circumcision of secondary importance. GUD provides a portal of entry and attracts cells carrying CCR5, the co-receptor most used by HIVs and SIVs upon sexual transmission. In addition, GUD and especially syphilis induces a potent inflammatory response, and tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-Î± production
