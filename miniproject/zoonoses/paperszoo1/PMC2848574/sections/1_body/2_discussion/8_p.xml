<p>We hypothesized that differences in male circumcision levels between cities may help to explain why HIV zoonotic strains emerged only in particular countries. Our extensive survey revealed circumcision patterns that were historically low in the putative centers of HIV emergence (Kinshasa, Douala, and Abidjan). Our simulations showed only a moderate direct effect of circumcision in the probability of generating long chains of transmission. However, lack of circumcision also favors GUD transmission

The prevalence of circumcision might thus have affected HIV emergence indirectly through its effect on GUD incidence. Lack of circumcision may have been more important for HIV-2 emergence, because epidemic HIV-2 groups emerged
