<p>Third, while initial bursts of SIV spread, and resulting adaptation, might have happened in small settlements, further spread of the epidemic was probably centered on cities with large populations. Large cities were at the center of star-like traffic networks, connecting them to nearby settlements, and allowing for quick transfer of the virus from a local initial outbreak. Furthermore, outbreaks in small settlements might quickly become self-limiting by exhausting the supply of susceptible individuals, and sustained epidemics probably depended on the early transmission of the virus to a large center with fast replenishment of susceptible individuals to maintain the epidemic. Thus, major, well-connected centers, such as Kinshasa and Douala (which were better served by railway and fluvial connections, and had far more traffic than the other cities), may have acted as an “attractor” and a “hub” for HIV epidemics. Although these ideas were not explicitly modeled in this study, they may help to understand why exactly two HIV-1 strains evolved and spread considerably in Central Africa, and perhaps may give clues on the origin of the subtypes.</p>
