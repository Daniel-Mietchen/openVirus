<p>Independently of the regional differences encountered, our finding of a very widespread trend of adoptions of circumcision, in early 20
 <sup>th</sup> century, by ethnic groups previously not practicing it, and the resulting temporal increase of circumcision rates in most relevant countries, is a solid result. It explains, as far as we know for the first time, the discrepancy between modern levels of circumcision, as showed by the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) 
 <xref rid="pone.0009936-Macro1" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>, and the levels inferred from the Ethnographic Atlas
