<p>In agreement with earlier studies our molecular dating confirmed that all major epidemic HIV lineages were transmitted to our species in a narrow time frame. We dated the divergence of the HIV-1 groups M and O from their closest related SIVs using a different, but complementary approach compared to Wertheim and Worobey (2009) 
 <xref rid="pone.0009936-Wertheim1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Whereas Wertheim and Worobey (2009) aimed at estimating the TMRCA of SIV in chimpanzees and sooty mangabeys 
 <xref rid="pone.0009936-Wertheim1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, we focused on obtaining an upper bound on the cross-species transmission from the chimpanzee species. To this purpose, we focused on separate 
 <italic>pol</italic> data sets for HIV-1 group M/SIVcpz and HIV-1 group O/SIVgor/SIVcpz. Because the relatively conserved 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene does not contain sufficient temporal signal (which may explain the relatively low rate and old TMRCAs of Wertheim and Worobey (2009) for a similar 
 <italic>pol</italic> data set), we calibrated the phylogenies using the group M and group O TMRCAs respectively. Therefore, we essentially extrapolated on the rate of HIV-1 evolution, but also Wertheim and Worobey (2009) 
 <xref rid="pone.0009936-Wertheim1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> noted that the SIVcpz sequences could not be used on their own for meaningful date estimates. We obtained a relatively narrow timeframe for the interspecies transmissions, defined, for each HIV group, by the period between the split from the closest SIV and the intragroup TMRCA. Moreover, interspecies transmission and possible adaptation to humans probably happened close to the latter date, which would restrict the timeframe even further.
