<p>In this study, we narrowed down the origin of the epidemic HIV clades (HIV-1 groups M and O, HIV-2 groups A and B) to the first half of the 20
 <sup>th</sup> century, using phylogenetic molecular clock calculations. Our colonial archival literature survey shows that GUD epidemics peaked in cities in their early phases of development, providing a better coincidence with this narrow time frame than the driving factors proposed by other theories. Ethnographic literature illustrates that circumcision frequencies were historically considerably lower, and spatially more variable, than they are currently; in particular for HIV-2, low circumcision prevalence in cities indeed showed a geographical match with emerging HIV epicenters. Through epidemiological modeling we could simulate that early ill-adapted HIV could generate long chains of transmission only during a period of high GUD intensity. The effects of circumcision and city size were more likely indirect, through their capacity to enhance GUD intensity and allowing the initial hub of infections to potentially reach a threshold, and to spawn secondary foci. We conclude that intense GUD in nascent cities was probably the main factor that permitted zoonotic SIV to emerge as epidemic HIV, possibly in association with low circumcision rates.
