<p>Our proposal that Kinshasa, Douala, and Abidjan constituted the initial hubs of the epidemic HIV groups can also explain the following historical facts: 1) the presence of already diversified HIV-1 group M in Kinshasa in 1959–60, as evidenced by two seropositive samples (a subtype B/D and a subtype A) in only a few hundred stored blood and tissue samples available for screening

 <xref rid="pone.0009936-Nahmias1" ref-type="bibr">[134]</xref>; 2) the serologically confirmed evidence that HIV-1 group O was present in Douala's communities of sex workers by 1962

 <xref rid="pone.0009936-Hooper1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>; this fact is better understood assuming that HIV-2 had expanded in the previous decades in a major, internationally connected, Ivorian city.
