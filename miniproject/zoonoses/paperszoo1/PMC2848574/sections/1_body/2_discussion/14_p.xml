<p>Our hypothesis satisfies both temporal and spatial coincidence between the factors which we invoke and the emergence of a pathogen. Such coincidence has previously been considered evidence that the factors are causally implicated

 <xref rid="pone.0009936-Ppin1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. It also offers a conceptual simplicity because it proposes as causal factors for SIV adaptation to humans and initial spread the very same factors that most promote the continued spread of HIV nowadays: promiscuous sex, particularly involving sex workers, GUD, and possibly lack of circumcision. However, we are aware that the evidence we provide does not rule out the possibility of other processes having contributed to HIV emergence and/or adaptation. For example, parenteral transmission might also have contributed to the initial adaptation and/or initial spread of HIV (as seems to have been the case for SIVmac 
 <xref rid="pone.0009936-Apetrei1" ref-type="bibr">[135]</xref>), or to further epidemic expansion. What we claim is that this is not necessary to explain the spatial and temporal patterns of HIV emergence, while high GUD incidence seems to have been the key determinant.
