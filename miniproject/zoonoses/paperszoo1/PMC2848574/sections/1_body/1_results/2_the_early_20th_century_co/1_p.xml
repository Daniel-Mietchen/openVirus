 <xref rid="pone.0009936-Plantier1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Of these five, four (HIV-1 groups M and O, and HIV-2 groups A and B) have been able to spread at an epidemic level and are currently infecting at least tens of thousands of people, and likely adapted to humans and started to spread in early 20
 <sup>th</sup> century, whereas HIV-1 group N may have started to spread in mid century (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0009936-t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the early 20
 <sup>th</sup> century seems to have constituted a particularly permissive time window for SIV zoonoses with clear epidemic consequences; for example, both epidemiological evidence and population size studies indicate that HIV-1 group M as well as HIV-2 group A spread epidemically at rates nearly equivalent to a tenfold increase in each decade
