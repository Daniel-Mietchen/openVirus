 <xref rid="pone.0009936-Salemi2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, suggests that driving factors specific to early 20
 <sup>th</sup> century have assisted HIV emergence in our species. The prevailing theories would predict more HIV groups emerging after 1950 than before. Injection intensity was much higher in mid 20
 <sup>th</sup> century than before

 <xref rid="pone.0009936-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>; other rural peoples also migrated to cities abundantly, albeit not necessarily to the same extent as the Ngbaka-Mabo. The mid century also likely generated increased human exposures to SIV, and particularly SIVcpz, because the main wild chimpanzee population collapse, partly due to intensified hunting, happened between 1946 and 1980
