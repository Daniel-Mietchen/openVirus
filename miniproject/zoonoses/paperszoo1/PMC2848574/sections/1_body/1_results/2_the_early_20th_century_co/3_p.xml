<p>To understand why only the early 20
 <sup>th</sup> century generated all epidemic HIVs, we aimed to reveal the full spectrum of factors that might have had the potential to increase SIV/HIV transmissibility and adaptation in the established critical time interval. In order to be consistent with a causal relationship, the factor or factors responsible should coincide both spatially and temporally with the origin of the epidemic 
 <xref rid="pone.0009936-Frank1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, and thus should have peaked in early 20
 <sup>th</sup> century in the geographic areas coinciding more or less with the ranges of the relevant SIV-carrying primates.
