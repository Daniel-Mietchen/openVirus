<p>To further substantiate these observations, we gathered tables of surgical operations discriminating circumcisions to treat phimosis and paraphimosis in major cities

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009936.s010">Dataset S1</xref>); in the first case, we assume parents would wait for puberty to circumcise the boy within the tribal rituals, even if he had phimosis; in the second case, a boy could have phimosis only during the first years of life. Therefore, ethnic groups performing universal circumcision should contribute little to the statistics of circumcisions for phimosis made in the colonial health system. These statistics should include mainly males from groups not performing universal circumcision. Therefore, we assume that high numbers of such recorded operations in a city reflect a relatively high proportion of uncircumcised adults living there. We display the results in
