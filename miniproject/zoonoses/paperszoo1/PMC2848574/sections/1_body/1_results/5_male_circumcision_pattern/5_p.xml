<p>For the main cities of the relevant areas, we collected demographic surveys at several points in time which discriminated the urban population by ethnic group. To each ethnic group present in a city, at a given time, we assigned a “circumcision class” (e.g., generalized at puberty, absent, etc), based on the information provided in ethnographic sources, and we calculated upper and lower estimates of frequency of circumcision in male adults (see

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009936.s010">Dataset S1</xref>). This permitted us to calculate, for each city, and at a given time, the distribution of its male population by the defined circumcision classes, and lower and upper estimates of circumcision frequency. The results are displayed in
