<p>Among the four West African cities that clearly stood out in size before World War II (Abidjan, Freetown, Monrovia, and Conakry (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009936-g002">Figure 2B</xref>)) the first had a much lower circumcision rate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009936-g003">Figures 3B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009936-g004">4B</xref>). Both HIV-2 epidemic groups (A and B) appear to have originated in Côte d'Ivoire

 <xref rid="pone.0009936-Santiago1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Therefore, the match between lack of circumcision in cities and HIV emergence appears to be stronger for HIV-2 than for HIV-1. Although Côte d'Ivoire contains only about 5% of the sooty mangabey range 
 <xref rid="pone.0009936-Santiago1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0009936-Hooper1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, it is the country of origin of half of the identified HIV-2 strains, and Ivorian cities, such as Abidjan and Bouaké, had much lower circumcision rates up to World War II than the other West African cities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009936-g003">Figures 3B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009936-g004">4B</xref>). Our findings of significant differences between the cities are robust and independent of the assumptions we introduced to estimate circumcision rates (expressed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009936-g004">Figure 4</xref>); they are clearly demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009936-g003">Figure 3</xref> (which does not work with circumcision rate estimates).
