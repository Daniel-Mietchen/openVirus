<p>Both HIV-2 groups A and B originated most likely in CÃ´te d'Ivoire

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009936-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), to our knowledge these cities did not differ much from Ivorian cities in their GUD levels, and no epidemic HIV-2 seems to have emerged in them. This motivated us to investigate other factors that may explain why HIV groups emerged only in particular cities.
