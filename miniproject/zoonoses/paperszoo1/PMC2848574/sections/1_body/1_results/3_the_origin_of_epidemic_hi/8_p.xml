<p>By 1928, there was a decided colonial response to these medical conditions. Mass surveys, movement restrictions, monitoring of sex workers and treatment of venereal diseases were initiated and were broadened further in scope and technically improved after 1932

During this period, the proportion of syphilis cases representing PSS also declined, from being the majority in the twenties, to only 1–9% in 1949–58

With penicillin adding up to old arsenic, bismuth, and sulfonamide treatments after 1947, incident ulcerative syphilis, chancroid, and LGV became residual. PSS cases declined to 40–60 per year in 1949–51, and to 10–25 in 1954–58, these representing incidences of about 1.5–2.5 orders of magnitude lower than those of the period 1919–35
