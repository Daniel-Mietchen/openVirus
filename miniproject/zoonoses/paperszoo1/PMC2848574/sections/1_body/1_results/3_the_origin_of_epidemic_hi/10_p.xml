<p>Although we cannot exclude reporting biases concerning GUDs (or any other diseases) in colonial reports, these biases are likely to be less of an issue for cases detected in the major cities from the 1920s onwards, when health systems became better established. For this reason, we attempt to quantify GUD incidences only for cities, and from 1919 onward, despite having reviewed many other reports beyond these bounds.</p>
