<p>In summary, the period 1945–80 is characterized by a low intensity of the four main GUDs in major cities: PSS, chancroid, and LGV became rarer due to the better health systems, and penicillin use; PSS became a small fraction of treated syphilis cases; and genital herpes prevalence was still low. The incidences of the three former GUDs in cities showed peaks up to the mid thirties, when the cities were still small (10,000–50,000 inhabitants), sex ratios were very male-biased, and health systems were incipient.</p>
