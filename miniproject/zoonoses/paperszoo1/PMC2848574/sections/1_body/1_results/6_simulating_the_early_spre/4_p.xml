<p>We defined several markers to characterize the efficiency of epidemic spread in the simulations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009936-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Per simulation, we determined the total number of infections (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009936-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) and the duration of an epidemic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009936-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), which characterize the extent of the first outbreak of infections and the ability of the virus to persist in the population even in its initial ill-adapted form (with reduced transmission efficiency compared with modern HIV). Long-term establishment (epidemic emergence) of HIV probably also depended on rapid initial adaptation to the new human host species. The capacity for this adaptation is also determined partly by the total number of human hosts and the duration of the epidemic (the age of the oldest lineage). However, an additional important determinant of adaptation is the length of the longest transmission chain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009936-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), i.e. the number of “serial passages” in human hosts.
