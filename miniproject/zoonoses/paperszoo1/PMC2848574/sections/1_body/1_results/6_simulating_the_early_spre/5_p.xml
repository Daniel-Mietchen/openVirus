<p>In all three quantifiers of epidemic emergence, the performance of the historical scenarios followed the same pattern: Kinshasa 1919&gt; Kinshasa 1929≫ Kinshasa 1958≫ pre-colonial village (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009936-g005">Figure 5</xref>). E.g. compared with the 1958 scenario, the 1929 scenario had 5-fold, the 1919 scenario 11-fold higher chance to generate at least 100 infections (6, 30 and 68 times out of 1,000 simulations); the pre-colonial village scenario never generated more than two infections. The probability of the ill-adapted virus to persist until the end of the simulated year was also dramatically higher for the 1919 and 1929 scenarios compared with the pre- and post-origin scenarios (73 and 37 vs. 5 and 0 times out of 1,000 simulations), as was the probability of generating a transmission chain of at least length five (81 and 49 vs. 10 and 0 times out of 1,000 simulations; see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009936.s005">Table S4</xref> for more detailed simulation outcomes). We thus found that the scenarios dated around the origin of HIV-1 group M (1919 and 1929) were indeed much more permissive for the heterosexual spread of emergent HIV compared with scenarios dated either before or after the estimated origin. This result proved to be robust with respect to varying a number of parameters in the model (

Note also that even in the most permissive scenarios, the initial zoonotic infection was a dead end in more than 50% of the simulation runs. Furthermore, the more permissive 1919 and 1929 scenarios yielded a bimodal distribution of outcomes indicating the effect of early stochastic events: after the first few transmissions, the epidemics that happened to reach the highly connected core of the sexual network can spread extensively; those that fail to do so, are likely to die out quickly.
