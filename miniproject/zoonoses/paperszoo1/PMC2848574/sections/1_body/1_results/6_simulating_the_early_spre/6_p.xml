<p>While the resistance of the pre-colonial village to HIV emergence is not surprising, the dramatic decrease in permissiveness between 1929 and 1958, in spite of continued explosive population growth, demands further explanation. Furthermore, the 1919 scenario proved to be consistently more permissive than the 1929 scenario, in spite of considerable population growth over the decade. To identify the key factor(s) behind the observed differences, we explored systematically the effect of removing or reducing several factors that have been implicated in the emergence of HIV. Based on the most permissive 1919 scenario, we tested 10-fold reduced population size, balanced sex ratio (with 90% of the sexually active population in stable relationship), absence of GUD infections and universal circumcision. The removal of GUD infections proved to have by far the most dramatic effect (

Remarkably, both a strongly reduced population size (âˆ¼1,200 sexually active individuals) and universal circumcision had a much weaker effect on the spread of ill-adapted HIV in the simulations. We also explored all combinations of these mitigating factors and found a consistently dominant effect of GUD prevalence (

We thus conclude that the period around the estimated origin of HIV-1 group M was uniquely permissive for the emergence of the virus by heterosexual transmission, and that the unprecedented GUD epidemics of the time were the main contributor to this high permissiveness.
