<p>Our simulations followed the early spread of the epidemic from the first zoonotic SIV infection over a dynamic network of sexual contacts, which was parameterized according to recent surveys

The modifier effects of GUD infections and circumcision were implemented in the transmission process. We also assumed that transmission of these early strains (not yet adapted to humans) was limited to acute infection, as has been observed for recent cross-species SIV transmissions
