<p>We focused on the origin of HIV-1 group M in Kinshasa for which we were able to collect the most complete historical data. Our simulations were parameterized to follow the recorded population size and structure of Kinshasa at several relevant time points, partly based on the availability of detailed population and medical records (

 <xref rid="pone.0009936-Worobey1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>; both time points were characterized by rampant GUD epidemics, highly male-biased sex ratio and lower levels of circumcision than today. The year 1958 was chosen as a time point beyond the window defined by our phylogenetic dating study; although the city population had considerably expanded, GUD infections were generally under control and circumcision was almost universal. Finally, we have explored a “pre-colonial village” scenario to reflect a large settlement in the region before colonization, characterized by a healthy population structure and the absence of GUD infections and sex work.
