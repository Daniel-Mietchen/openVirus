<p id="Par28">Alternatively, multiple members of a restriction factor family could evolve to target the same virus in different ways, thereby constraining viral evolution such that the virus must maintain multiple defence strategies. An example of this is the pair of human paralogues 
 <italic>APOBEC3F</italic> and 
 <italic>APOBEC3G</italic>. APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G deaminate cytosine bases in the viral genome within different preferential sequence contexts

 </sup>. Thus, primate lentiviruses (such as HIV-1) have had to evolve multiple mechanisms to antagonize these APOBEC3 proteins; for example, Vif binds to APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G using distinct domains

 </sup>. In this way, the host limits the ability of the virus to evolve while increasing antiviral activity.
