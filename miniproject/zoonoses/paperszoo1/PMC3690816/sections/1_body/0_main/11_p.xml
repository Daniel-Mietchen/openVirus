<p id="Par21">Because viruses have existed throughout vertebrate evolution, the arms race between hosts and viruses is ancient

 </sup>. In fact, many host restriction factors have evolved under positive selection for many millions of years. Under a long-term or recurrent viral selection pressure, a single amino acid in a restriction factor that directly interacts with a viral antagonist may repeatedly be mutated many times during evolution, or a restriction factor may accumulate mutations at multiple residues to escape from antagonism by many different viruses. This leads to an unusually high ratio of the non-synonymous mutation rate (dN) to the synonymous mutation rate (dS) — 
 <xref rid="Glos9" ref-type="list">dN/dS</xref> — at single residues and across entire proteins (
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). To estimate the dN/dS ratio of a gene, ancestral gene sequences can be reconstructed using orthologous gene sequences from modern-day species that diverged millions of years ago, and statistical methods are used to calculate the rate of evolution across a phylogenetic tree

 </sup>. This method has shown that many human restriction factors have been evolving under episodic positive selection throughout primate evolution (
