 </bold> HIV-1 and HIV-2 are the result of multiple cross-species transmission events of SIV from chimpanzees and sooty mangabeys, respectively, into humans

 </sup>. Primate restriction factors have been shown to have an important 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> role in preventing lentiviral cross-species viral transmission events. For example, experimental infection of rhesus macaques — which are not infected with SIV in the wild — with HIV or SIV can mimic a cross-species transmission event. During experimental HIV-1 infection, rhesus macaque TRIM5α and APOBEC3G completely restrict viral replication

 <italic>TRIM5</italic> attenuate viral replication by 100- to 1,000-fold during experimental infection with SIV from sooty mangabeys
