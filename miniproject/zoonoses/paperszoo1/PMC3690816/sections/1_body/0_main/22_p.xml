<p id="Par32">Studying the evolution of restriction factors can help us to understand why humans are susceptible to viruses that exist today, as our immune responses to contemporary viruses have been shaped by our evolutionary responses to previous infections. The modern innate immune system is generally not yet optimized against modern viruses, but rather was selected for by previous rounds of co-evolution with ancient viruses. By determining the types of viral infection that occurred in the past and how they were eliminated, we can form new ideas about how to manipulate the immune system to our advantage in the ongoing battle against viruses.</p>
