However, our immune system may be better at preventing cross-species viral transmissions than intra-species viral transmissions because viruses that have crossed the species barrier have already partially adapted to the host. Perhaps for this reason, the evidence for the effects of restriction factors on intra-species viral acquisition is less clear.
