<p id="Par19">Viral antagonists can overcome restriction factors using several mechanisms. For example, viral antagonists can couple the restriction factor to protein degradation pathways; cause the mislocalization of the restriction factor and thus downregulate functional expression; or function as mimics of the restriction factor substrate (
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). To antagonize the restriction factor SAMHD1, the Vpx protein encoded by HIV-2 and related primate lentiviruses targets SAMHD1 for ubiquitylation followed by proteasomal degradation (
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) by simultaneously binding to SAMHD1 and an adaptor protein in the cullin 4 ubiquitin ligase complex

 </sup>. By contrast, the lentiviral Vpu protein antagonizes the restriction factor tetherin by altering its normal subcellular localization (
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Through a direct protein–protein interaction, Vpu sequesters tetherin in the 
 <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network and redirects it from the cell membrane to endosomes, where it is unable to restrict viral budding from the cell membrane

 </sup>. A third mechanism of antagonism is illustrated by K3L, a poxvirus-encoded antagonist of the host antiviral RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) pathway. Following recognition of double-stranded RNA, PKR inhibits protein translation by phosphorylating eukaryotic initiation factor 2 subunit-α (eIF2α). K3L is structurally homologous to eIF2α and competes for binding to PKR (
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). By acting as a mimic of eIF2α, K3L prevents the phosphorylation of eIF2α and the translational shutoff that the PKR pathway would otherwise induce (reviewed in Ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>). Viruses might also use other strategies that have not yet been characterized to allow viral replication despite the presence of restriction factors. A key feature common to all these modes of antagonism is the direct interaction between the viral antagonist and the host restriction factor, which has set the stage for the evolutionary 'arms race' that is characteristic of many restriction factors, as described below.
