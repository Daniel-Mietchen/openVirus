 <label>Box 2 | Selective sweeps are the mechanism of adaptation</label>
 <p id="Par46">An important aspect of the positive selection of restriction factors is that the selection (and therefore evolution) of an advantageous mutation acts on a population level. The cost of a viral infection must affect the ability of the population to reproduce before it will exert a selective pressure on the population to evolve. During a population-wide infection, some individuals may carry a previously neutral genetic mutation that now confers those individuals with a reproductive advantage in the face of infection, and this advantageous genotype can rapidly rise in frequency until the mutation reaches a frequency of 100% (known as fixation). In a classic

  <xref rid="Glos11" ref-type="list">hitchhiking</xref>) with the genomic sequence that confers the fitness advantage, thus decreasing genetic diversity near the region of the genome under positive selection (reviewed in Refs

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>, 
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>). Therefore, genomic loci that are under positive selection in a population are predicted to have skewed allele frequencies across long genetic distances surrounding the selected locus. Eventually, if a mutation reaches fixation within a species, between-species comparisons will reveal an excess of non-synonymous mutations in this region relative to the number expected under neutral selection
