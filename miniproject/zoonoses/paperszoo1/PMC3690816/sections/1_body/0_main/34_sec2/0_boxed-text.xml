 <label>Box 1 | Coordination of restriction factors with other arms of the immune system</label>
 <p id="Par44">The relationship between restriction factors and the rest of the innate immune system is a growing area of research. In many ways, restriction factors are similar to pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) because they recognize structural patterns on pathogens. In fact, TRIM5α (tripartite motif-containing protein 5α) — which binds to a viral capsid lattice structure
  <sup>
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>
  </sup> and accelerates capsid uncoating to cause viral restriction — has recently been shown to also function as a PRR for retroviruses
  <sup>
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
  </sup>. After binding to retroviral capsids, TRIM5α causes the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signalling and a distinct innate immune response. Moreover, even in the absence of retroviral capsids, TRIM5α has been shown to have a role in innate immune responses, as it functions as a constitutive signalling intermediate in the NF-κB cascade

  </sup>. Similarly, tetherin has been shown to activate NF-κB in addition to its viral restriction function

 <p id="Par45">SAMHD1 (SAM domain- and HD domain-containing protein 1) also functions as both a restriction factor and a mediator of the innate immune response to non-viral events. SAMHD1 protects dendritic cells and monocytes from HIV-1 infection by decreasing the level of cellular dNTPs to below the level required for the synthesis of viral DNA

   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>
  </sup>. In addition, SAMHD1 has a role in the innate immune response even in the absence of retroviral infection, as genetic mutations in 
  <italic>SAMHD1</italic> (and in 
  <italic>TREX1</italic> (3′ repair exonuclease 1)) are associated with autoimmunity in humans
  <sup>
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
  </sup>. Similarly to TREX1, SAMHD1 might have a protective role against autoimmune responses by preventing the accumulation of inappropriate retrotransposon by-products, such as single-stranded DNA
  <sup>
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>,
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>
  </sup>. Studying retroviral restriction factors will undoubtedly contribute to our understanding of many aspects of the innate immune system.
