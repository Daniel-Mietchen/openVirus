<p id="Par26">Heterozygosity for a restriction factor may be advantageous to a population on a short timescale, as host polymorphisms would force a virus to evolve the ability to target multiple alleles of a given host factor. This was recently suggested for the restriction factor APOBEC3G in African green monkeys

 <italic>APOBEC3G</italic> is polymorphic in African green monkeys, and some individuals have a single amino acid change that renders APOBEC3G resistant to its viral antagonist, Vif. In an experimental infection of African green monkeys with SIV, the virus from a monkey that was heterozygous for the Vif-resistant allele of 
 <italic>APOBEC3G</italic> was unable to evolve the ability to antagonize APOBEC3G, whereas the virus from a monkey that was homozygous for the Vif-resistant allele was quickly able to evolve the ability to antagonize APOBEC3G. This suggests that maintaining polymorphism in a restriction factor can be functionally beneficial.
