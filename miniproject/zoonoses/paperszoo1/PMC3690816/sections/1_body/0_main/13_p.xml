<p id="Par23">If single nucleotide changes were the only effector mechanism in the co-evolution of hosts and viruses, the host would be at a seemingly enormous disadvantage, because RNA viruses and some small single-stranded DNA viruses have nucleotide substitution rates that are 1,000 times faster than those of their hosts

 </sup>. How then does a host restriction factor ever win an arms race with a virus, especially considering that a host might be simultaneously challenged by many different types of virus? The answer lies in the types of genetic landscape that viruses and hosts can explore.
