 </sup>. In both species, a TRIM–CYP fusion protein with potent antiviral activity is produced, although the viral targets are not identical. Moreover, TRIM–CYP and TRIM5α can both be expressed by the same individual, allowing for the restriction of multiple lentiviruses. By restricting viral replication in this manner, the host also slows down the evolution of the virus.
