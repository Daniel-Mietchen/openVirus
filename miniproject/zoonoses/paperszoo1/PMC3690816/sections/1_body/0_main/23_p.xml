  <italic>Identifying previous viral infections.</italic>
 </bold> Paleovirology is the study of ancient, extinct viruses (paleoviruses) and their effects on modern-day hostâ€“virus interactions

 </sup>. We know that ancient retroviruses infected primates because there are remnants of viral sequences in primate genomes

 </sup>. However, many other retroviruses did not become endogenous in the host genome, and so we have no direct evidence of their existence. In fact, no endogenous lentiviral sequences have been found in primate genomes except in a single genus of prosimians

 </sup>. However, by identifying signatures of positive selection in host restriction factors, we can infer the existence of many additional paleoviruses, as well as the historical timeframe and species in which the infection took place. By combining evolutionary analyses with functional tests, we can determine the type of virus that is likely to have driven selection in the host (
