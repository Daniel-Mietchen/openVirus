<p id="Par11">Restriction factors are proteins of the innate immune system encoded in the germline genome that inhibit the replication of viruses during their life cycle in host cells. These host proteins are dedicated antiviral factors that are often induced by interferon (IFN) signalling as part of the innate immune response. They are antagonized by viral factors and are rapidly evolving. The term 'restriction factor' was historically adopted by laboratories studying retroviruses following the characterization of the mouse

  <italic>Fv1</italic> locus
 </xref>, which conferred resistance to murine retroviruses
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup>. However, this term can also be applied more broadly to host-encoded gene products that inhibit the intracellular replication of any animal virus. Recent work has shown that host susceptibility to viral infection and disease is determined, in part, by the components of the innate immune system (such as restriction factors) and the viral proteins that have evolved to evade or destroy these host defences. In this Review, we describe the general characteristics of restriction factors and show how the evolutionary conflict between viruses and restriction factors has shaped the immune systems of modern-day vertebrates. We use examples of host restriction factors that block primate lentiviruses, although we believe that many of the principles are generally applicable to other viruses and other hosts. These topics are of particular relevance today, as there have been many recent discoveries of restriction factors and determinants of viral susceptibility.
