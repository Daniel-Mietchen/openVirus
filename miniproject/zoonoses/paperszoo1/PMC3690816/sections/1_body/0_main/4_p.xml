<p id="Par14">There are several distinguishing characteristics of restriction factors that allow one to make inferences about their role in the evolution of both the host and the virus. Typically, we define a host gene as a restriction factor gene if it encodes a protein that: has antiviral activity as its major biological function; is induced by IFNs or by virus infection; is antagonized by a viral protein; and shows evolutionary 'signatures' of genetic conflict (

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, as they can be enlightening with regard to understanding the additional cellular roles that restriction factors might have.
