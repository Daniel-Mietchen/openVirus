  <italic>Host heterozygosity.</italic>
 </bold> Genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding host restriction factors can be maintained as a result of population-level adaptation against viruses. 
 <xref rid="Glos12" ref-type="list">Balancing selection</xref> in restriction factors may result when multiple viruses co-infect a population, such that different host haplotypes are advantageous against different viruses, essentially maintaining polymorphism within the population (known as 
 <xref rid="Glos13" ref-type="list">frequency-dependent selection</xref>). Several of the best-known examples of genes under balancing selection are genes involved in immunity. These include: MHC genes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup>, which maintain multiple alleles that present a variety of antigens and therefore protect against a variety of pathogens; the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase gene
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>, a housekeeping gene that contains polymorphisms that are associated with clinical disorders and also with malaria resistance; and 
 <italic>TRIM5</italic>, which has been suggested to be under balancing selection in Old World monkey populations
