<p id="Par38">The four groups of HIV-1 — which are each the result of an independent cross-species transmission event to humans from chimpanzees infected with SIV — differ in their global spread, with group M representing the pandemic strain. It has recently been shown that the adaptation of HIV-1 to human-specific mutations in the restriction factor tetherin was achieved only by group M and N viruses and not by the non-pandemic group O and P strains

 </sup>. Clearly tetherin did not prevent any of the four cross-species transmission events, but it has been suggested that overcoming tetherin-mediated restriction was necessary for the efficient replication of HIV-1 group M in humans and therefore for pandemic spread (reviewed in Ref.
