  <italic>Expression and activity of viral restriction factors.</italic>
 </bold> Many restriction factors are IFN-stimulated genes (
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which is consistent with their fundamental role in antiviral responses. The IFN-mediated induction of many restriction factors is also an indication that their major activity is in combating pathogens, rather than some central metabolic or developmental role in the organism. Moreover, as many restriction factors cause destructive events, such as protein modifications or nucleotide mutations, their expression needs to be tightly controlled to avoid deleterious effects on cell growth in the absence of viral challenge. However, IFN-mediated induction is not a universal property of restriction factors, as some are expressed constitutively. In cases in which expression of the protein is constitutive, it is probable that the restriction factor also has a role in restricting endogenous events. For example, in the APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases, APOBEC3G is constitutively expressed by many cell types, including T cells and germ cells

 </sup>. Although it has a well-characterized role in T cells in the inhibition of retroviruses through the hypermutation of viral genomes during reverse transcription, we suggest that APOBEC3G might have an even more ancient role in protecting the host genome in germ cells from
