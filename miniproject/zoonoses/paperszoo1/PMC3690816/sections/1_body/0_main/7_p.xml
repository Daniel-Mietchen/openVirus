<p id="Par17">We propose that the major biological activity of restriction factors is to inhibit viral replication. In many cases in which restriction factor function can be examined by gene knockout in mice, ablation of the restriction factor has no untoward effect on mouse development. For example, mice lacking the single mouse 
 <italic>Apobec3</italic> gene are viable, and the only reported phenotype is that they are more susceptible to murine retroviruses than are their wild-type counterparts
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>. In fact, natural mutations in 
 <italic>Apobec3</italic> and the 
 <italic>Mx</italic> locus that abolish function exist in some inbred mouse strains
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. Similarly, mice with natural or engineered mutations in the tetherin, viperin (also known as 
 <italic>Rsad2</italic>) or interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (
 <italic>Ifitm3</italic>) genes are also viable but are more sensitive to some viral infections

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. However, it is possible that some restriction factors have other cellular roles in addition to viral restriction. For example, TRIM5Î± has a more general role in antiviral signalling in addition to its specific role in retroviral restriction
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>, and mutations in human 
 <italic>SAMHD1</italic> are associated with autoimmune disease
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup> (
 <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Box 1</xref>). However, perhaps as a result of the duplication of many restriction factor genes within a host (described further below), restriction factors can undergo subfunctionalization, in which one gene retains an essential cellular function whereas its 
 <xref rid="Glos5" ref-type="list">paralogue</xref> becomes a dedicated antiviral factor.
