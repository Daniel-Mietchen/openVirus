<p id="Par41">Moreover, these proteinâ€“protein interactions between host restriction factors and viral antagonists provide tempting targets for small-molecule inhibitors. An ideal inhibitor of a viral antagonist would specifically disrupt the ability of the antagonist to bind to the host restriction factor or to other host machinery required for restriction. This would enable a host restriction factor to specifically inhibit viral replication, without any effect on the rest of the immune system of an individual. Inhibitors of viral antagonists could be used as therapeutic treatments in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. Several inhibitors of HIV-1 Vif have been identified

 </sup>. Achieving inhibition of a viral antagonist without disrupting host functions might be difficult because many viral antagonists use or mimic host machinery for their activity. Also, the virus might be able to quickly evolve resistance mutations, as genes encoding viral antagonists often do not have as many functional constraints as more conserved viral genes.
