<p id="Par30">Just as restriction factor families expand when an increase in antiviral activity is advantageous in the presence of viruses, restriction factor families can also contract in the absence of a selective pressure. For example, the restriction factor APOBEC3H from macaques and chimpanzees has potent antiviral activity against lentiviruses

 </sup>. This suggests that restriction factors such as APOBEC3H, which is a highly active DNA mutator, might impose a cost on the host genome and therefore might be selected against in the absence of the relevant viral pressure.
