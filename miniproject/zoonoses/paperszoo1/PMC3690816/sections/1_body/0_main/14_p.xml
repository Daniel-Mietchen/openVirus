  <italic>Limitations on viral evolution.</italic>
 </bold> RNA viruses maintain densely packed genomes that include overlapping reading frames and RNA hairpin structures involved in genome packaging and replication. The limitations on the genome size of RNA viruses necessitate that many viral proteins carry out multiple functions

 </sup>. This constrains their evolutionary potential, as mutations to optimize one function (for example, adaptation to a polymorphism in a host restriction factor) might compromise another function of that protein (for example, capsid assembly). In addition, the small viral genome size generally prevents gene duplication-driven mechanisms of adaptive evolution, whereas these mechanisms can occur in host genomes. One possible exception to the lack of gene duplication in viruses is the pair of homologous genes
