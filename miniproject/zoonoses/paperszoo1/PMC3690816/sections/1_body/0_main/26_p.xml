<p id="Par36">Natural infection of African green monkeys by SIV is also thought to be non-pathogenic, as infection does not cause immunodeficiency despite high viral replication levels

 </sup>, suggesting a recent selective pressure on 
 <italic>APOBEC3G</italic>. Furthermore, the SIV strains that circulate in these subspecies have regained the ability to antagonize APOBEC3G. This suggests that there is an arms race between SIV and African green monkeys that implies some degree of SIV pathogenesis in African green monkeys. For example, SIV might formerly have been pathogenic to African green monkeys, or pathogenesis might be present even now in an unmeasured or mild form. In this manner, the evolution of a host restriction factor and the reciprocal viral evolution can inform our views of viral pathogenesis.
