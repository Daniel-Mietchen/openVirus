<p id="Par34">One of the clearest examples in which a paleovirus was identified by examining positive selection comes from the analysis of APOBEC3DE, a member of the APOBEC3 family in primates that restricts endogenous retrotransposons. 
 <italic>APOBEC3DE</italic> has rapidly evolved in primates, particularly in the chimpanzee and bonobo lineages

 </sup>. Since its divergence from the human gene, 
 <italic>APOBEC3DE</italic> in the chimpanzee lineage has accumulated 24 mutations, of which 23 are non-synonymous changes. These changes have broadened the antiviral activity of chimpanzee APOBEC3DE to include the ability to restrict lentiviruses. Human APOBEC3DE, by contrast, has not evolved the ability to restrict lentiviruses. Therefore, by identifying the adaptive consequences of rapid evolution in chimpanzee 
 <italic>APOBEC3DE</italic>, we suggest that a lentivirus infected the common ancestor of chimpanzees and bonobos in the past; this infection probably occurred approximately 2–5 million years ago, after the chimpanzee–bonobo ancestor diverged from humans. Similarly, the acquisition of a TRIM–CYP fusion gene with antilentiviral functions in owl monkeys 2–6 million years ago strongly argues for such a challenge occurring in this lineage of primates, which is both phylogenetically and geographically distinct from the primates that are known to be infected with lentiviruses currently. By studying the evolution of restriction factors, we can form a more accurate picture of the ancient history of retroviral infections in primates.
