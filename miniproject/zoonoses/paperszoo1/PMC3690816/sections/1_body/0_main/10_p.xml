  <italic>Positive selection as a fundamental principle of virus–host interactions.</italic>
 </bold> Many non-coding regions of the genome evolve under 
 <xref rid="Glos6" ref-type="list">neutral selection</xref>; for example, non-synonymous (amino acid-altering) and synonymous mutations are predicted to accumulate at the same rate in 
 <xref rid="Glos7" ref-type="list">pseudogenes</xref>. Most host protein-coding genes evolve under negative (purifying) selection, which removes non-synonymous mutations from the population to maintain the function of the protein. By contrast, the interactions between restriction factors and viral antagonists evolve under positive selection, a selective regime that results in an excess rate of non-synonymous mutations compared with synonymous mutations (
 <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">Box 2</xref>). Positive selection is often a result of two genetic entities evolving in conflict with one another, as illustrated by the

 </sup>. Virus–host interactions are examples of 'Red Queen' competition, as host restriction factors exert a selective pressure on virus replication and pathogenic viruses exert fitness costs on their hosts. Mutations that allow a restriction factor to evade a viral antagonist provide a means for the host to escape the fitness costs conferred by the virus. This imposes a selective pressure on the viral antagonist to evolve specificity for the new restriction factor encoded by the host species. As a result, a prey–predator-like 'arms race' dynamic is established, leading to the rapid evolution of both the host and the virus (

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> contain genetic 'signatures' of positive selection.
