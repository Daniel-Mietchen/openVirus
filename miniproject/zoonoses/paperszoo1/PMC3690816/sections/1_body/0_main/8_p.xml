  <italic>Viral antagonists of restriction factors.</italic>
 </bold> Viruses have evolved antagonists to restriction factors. These viral proteins are often encoded by 'accessory genes' that are not needed for viral replication except in the presence of restriction factors

 </sup>. Restriction factors such as tetherin that inhibit the replication of multiple virus families can be antagonized by diverse viral proteins from the different virus families (
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In cases in which there is no known viral antagonist to a particular restriction factor, it is possible that the virus can escape restriction through mutation of the viral protein targeted by the restriction factor, as is the case for lentiviral evasion of TRIM5Î±-mediated restriction through viral capsid mutations

 </sup>. It is also theoretically possible that a recently evolved restriction factor might not yet have selected for a viral antagonist. However, in most cases, we think that the inability to identify a viral antagonist is more likely to be attributable to the fact that the relevant sets of viruses and host species have yet to be examined.
