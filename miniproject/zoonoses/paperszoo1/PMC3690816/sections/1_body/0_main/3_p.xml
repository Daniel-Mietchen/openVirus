<p id="Par13">Classical innate immunity against viruses is mediated by specialized cells such as natural killer cells, dendritic cells and macrophages. By contrast, restriction factors are germline-encoded factors that mediate a 'cell-intrinsic' immune response. They are part of the broader innate immune repertoire of cellular molecules that detect and respond to viral infections in the absence of previous exposure. Typically, viral infections are detected by cytoplasmic or membrane-bound 
 <xref rid="Glos2" ref-type="list">pattern-recognition receptors</xref> (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which trigger an IFN response that induces a programme of expression of IFN-stimulated genes with broad-ranging effects on cell growth and metabolism (reviewed in Refs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>). Many of these IFN-stimulated genes are restriction factors that specifically inhibit viral growth within infected cells.
