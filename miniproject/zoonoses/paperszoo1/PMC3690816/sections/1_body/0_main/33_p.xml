<p id="Par43">Restriction factors are early, potent and specific cellular blocks against retroviral replication. They have clearly had an important role in innate immunity against viruses throughout primate evolution, and more work needs to be carried out to define how and when they are important in viral zoonoses, global epidemics and the progression to disease. In this way, characterizing the evolution of restriction factor antiviral activity will help us to understand why we are winning or losing current battles against viruses.</p>
