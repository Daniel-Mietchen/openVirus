  <italic>Predicting viral pathogenicity.</italic>
 </bold> In the virusâ€“host arms race, positive selection occurs when the reproductive fitness of either party is challenged. If a virus is not pathogenic to the host, it is not likely to exert a selective pressure on the host. Therefore, adaptive changes in host restriction factors would not be expected to occur during a non-pathogenic infection. Mildly pathogenic viruses would be expected to impart weak selective pressures that might increase the allele frequency of a selected mutation but would not drive polymorphisms to fixation
