  <italic>Identifying host–virus interaction domains and implications for treatment.</italic>
 </bold> The interactions between a virus and a host restriction factor can be mapped down to distinct protein–protein interfaces and, in some cases, to single amino acid residues. Because these interaction domains are directly engaged in genetic conflict, they often contain the residues that are most rapidly evolving. By looking at genetic signatures of positive selection, the sites involved in protein–protein interactions can be predicted and then tested functionally, as was recently done with remarkable accuracy for SAMHD1 (Refs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>). Without knowing anything about the domains of SAMHD1 that are required for antagonism by the lentiviral protein Vpx, two groups carried out positive selection analyses of SAMHD1 using the dN/dS test and identified two different regions of SAMHD1 that have evolved very rapidly in primates. When functionally tested, these two regions of SAMHD1 were shown to be required for its degradation by Vpx proteins from different lentiviruses in a virus-specific manner. This information has helped to explain how lentiviruses and SAMHD1 have evolved on a molecular level. By mapping host–virus interactions, the constraints of the evolutionary arms race can be more fully understood.
