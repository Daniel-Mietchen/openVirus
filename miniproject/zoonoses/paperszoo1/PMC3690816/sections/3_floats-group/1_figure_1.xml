  <title>Mechanisms of viral antagonism of host restriction factors.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> | Degradation. The lentiviral accessory protein Vpx antagonizes the host restriction factor SAMHD1 (SAM domain- and HD domain-containing protein 1) by targeting it for degradation
   <sup>
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
   </sup>. Vpx bridges SAMHD1 to an E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase complex, which ubiquitylates SAMHD1, thus targeting SAMHD1 for degradation by the proteasome. 
   <bold>b</bold> | Mislocalization and sequestration. The HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu antagonizes the host restriction factor tetherin by promoting its mislocalization, which leads to functional downregulation
   <sup>
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
   </sup>. Vpu interacts with tetherin at the plasma membrane and facilitates its trafficking to early endosomes. Tetherin is then either sequestered in the 
   <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network, where it is unable to restrict viral budding from the cell surface, or degraded in lysosomes. 
   <bold>c</bold> | Mimicry. The poxvirus accessory protein K3L antagonizes the host RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) pathway by acting as a mimic of the PKR substrate, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 subunit-α (eIF2α)
   <sup>
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
   </sup>. PKR is activated by binding to double-stranded RNA and induces an antiviral signalling pathway that leads to the inhibition of protein translation. By competing for PKR binding, K3L prevents the phosphorylation of eIF2α, thus pre-empting the antiviral response of host protein translation shut-off.
