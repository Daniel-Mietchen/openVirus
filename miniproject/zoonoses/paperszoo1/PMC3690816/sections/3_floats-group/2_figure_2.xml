  <title>Genetic conflict between virus and host.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> | A host restriction factor (blue) that is antagonized by a viral factor (green) cannot restrict viral replication, and the host is susceptible to viral infection. This exerts a fitness cost on the host, and escape mutations will be selected for in the host factor. In return, when the host factor restricts viral replication, a fitness cost is exerted on the virus. Mutations that allow the virus to regain restriction factor antagonism (for example, by re-forming a proteinâ€“protein interface between the viral antagonist and the host factor) are selected for in the virus. This back-and-forth fitness adaptation in the virus and host leads to a conflict that is visible on the genetic level. 
   <bold>b</bold> | Over time, in the absence of genetic conflict, most genes evolve under negative (purifying) selection. This leads to a lower rate of non-synonymous mutations (dN) than of synonymous mutations (dS) in the host gene, and the dN/dS ratio is predicted to be less than one. In the presence of a genetic conflict, such as that caused by a viral antagonist, the host gene will rapidly accumulate non-synonymous mutations, and the dN/dS ratio is predicted to be greater than one. Grey boxes represent synonymous changes, and orange boxes represent non-synonymous changes.
