  <title>Identifying paleoviruses using positive selection.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> | Phylogeny of a restriction factor. Lineages under positive selection (shown in red) are identified using likelihood methods to calculate the ratio of the rate of non-synonymous mutations (dN) to the rate of synonymous mutations (dS) of the restriction factor for each branch. 
   <bold>b</bold> | Infectivity assays. Restriction factor 
   <xref rid="Glos14" ref-type="list">orthologues</xref> from extant species are tested for antiviral activity against a panel of viral targets, with the goal of finding species-specific antiviral activity. 
   <bold>c</bold> | Inference of a paleovirus. In lineages that are under positive selection, a paleovirus similar to the virus against which the restriction factor has gained species-specific activity is predicted to have existed during the time of selection.
