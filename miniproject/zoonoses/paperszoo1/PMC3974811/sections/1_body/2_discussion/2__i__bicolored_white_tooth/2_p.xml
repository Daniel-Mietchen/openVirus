<p>In this study we focused on shrews because all investigations of more than 500 wild rodents of at least ten species from BD endemic regions done in the past revealed all of them to be negative (for overview see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0093659-t003">Table 3</xref>). These results and the wide distribution of rodents, which is in contrast to the restricted occurrence of BD, indicated that other species than rodents with special features are more likely to be a reservoir of BDV. After the detection of BDV in bicolored white-toothed shrews the investigation of further shrew species became important. Bicolored white-toothed shrews were BDV-positive at 4 of 9 locations investigated in this study. BDV-positive bicolored white-toothed shrews were found at all locations with recent cases of BD in horses
