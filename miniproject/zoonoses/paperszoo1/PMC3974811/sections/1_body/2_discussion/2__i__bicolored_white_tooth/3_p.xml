<p>The finding that bicolored white-toothed shrews are infected naturally does not rule out the existence of other reservoir species. Recently antibodies against BDV have been detected in a few wild rodents in Scandinavia

 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Bourg1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, but as long as the controversially discussed specificity of BDV antibodies has not been clarified discussions about BDV infections in these species remain speculative (antibodies against BDV have been found worldwide in almost all species investigated). So far no BDV sequences are available which prove the existence of BDV in bank voles in Finland
