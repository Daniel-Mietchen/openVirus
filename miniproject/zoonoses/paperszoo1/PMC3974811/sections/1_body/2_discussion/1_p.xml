<p>Bicolored white-toothed shrews 
 <italic>(Crocidura leucodon,</italic> HERMANN 1780) are indigenous hosts of BDV because: (i) direct BDV signals were not found in other shrew and rodent species, (ii) bicolored white-toothed shrews display no tissue damage despite BDV infection, (iii) they are distributed within BD endemic territories and their distribution fits to the elevations and to the northern fringe of BD occurrence, (iv) the sequences obtained from infected shrews fit exactly into the cluster of geographic origin that have been described for mammalian BDV of horses and sheep within the different endemic regions, and (v) the solitary, mating, and dispersal behavior of shrews is different from that of rodents and corresponds to the special features of BD and the formation of epidemiological hot spots; the relevance of the identification of a native virus reservoir is supported by the following: (vi) BDV infections are maintained in local shrew populations, (vii) the yearly varying and seasonal incidences of BD correlate well with the population dynamics of a species with high metabolic rates strongly depending on a constant food supply, and (viii) BDV N elements can be integrated into the genome of bicolored white-toothed shrews after infection.
