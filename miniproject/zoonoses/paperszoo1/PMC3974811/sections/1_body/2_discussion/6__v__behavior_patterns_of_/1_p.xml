<p>Shrews are insectivores 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Herter1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Insectivore-like mammals appeared in the Late Cretaceous 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-MacPhee1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Typically shrews are solitary animals 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Herter1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. They rear up to four litters from March to September 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Cantoni1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Natal dispersal is mainly observed in female weanlings 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Favre1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Most of the offspring settles locally, which creates a high potential for inbreeding 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Duarte1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Dispersal distance is low 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Balloux1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. This inbreeding and low distance dispersal feature could fit to the limited distribution of BDV within endemic territories.
