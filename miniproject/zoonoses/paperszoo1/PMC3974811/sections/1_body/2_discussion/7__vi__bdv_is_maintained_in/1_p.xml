<p>Nine of 17 shrews collected over five consecutive years at one property from 2005–2009 were BDV-positive (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0093659-t002">Table 2</xref>). The percentage of positives differed by the years. This feature fits with the yearly varying peaks that have been reported for BD 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Drrwald2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Although the number of BDV-positive shrews was low in general (24%), the percentage of positives at the property in Güterglück was high (53%). Since BD has never been recorded in Güterglück this could support the hypothesis of a self-sustaining infection cycle of BDV in bicolored white-toothed shrews.
