<p>An unexpected phenomenon in the shrews was the presence of large amounts of viral antigen in epithelial cells of the oral cavity and in keratinocytes of the skin. Skin had not been investigated for viral presence in previous experimental studies on BDV distribution and shedding. In shrews the presence of virus in the skin could be of considerable epidemiological relevance and a source of infectious virus for natural (obviously shrews) and spill-over hosts (such as horses, sheep and other susceptible animals).</p>
