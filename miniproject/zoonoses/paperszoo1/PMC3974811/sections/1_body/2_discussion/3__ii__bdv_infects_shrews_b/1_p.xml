<p>First hints indicate that BDV might be very well tolerated by shrews. There are no tissue alterations which distinguish infected from non-infected animals, neither in the nervous system nor in other organs. The distribution pattern of BDV proteins N and P observed immunohistochemically in the shrews of our study resembles the viral distribution of neonatally infected immunotolerant animals with virus replication in a large variety of tissues

 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Stitz3" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Very remarkable is the completely diffuse viral distribution in the central nervous system and the absence of an inflammatory reaction. In contrast to neonatally infected Lewis rats, which show neuroanatomical abnormalities like cerebellar atrophy and dentate gyrus degeneration 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Weissenbck4" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, there are no noticeable neuroanatomical alterations in the brain of shrews. It is generally known from the experimental rodent model that BDV infection can be transmitted via urine and contact 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Sauder1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> but also vertically by intrauterine transmission 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Okamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Shedding of virus, at highest titers in the urine, has been demonstrated in immunotolerant but never in immunocompetent animals. Thus it has been speculated that only animals infected in utero or as newborns may serve as natural vector due to their capacity of virus excretion.
