<p>Shrews CL19 and CL35 were negative in immunohistochemistry (including brain and spinal cord). They differed from the other BDV-infected bicolored white-toothed shrews by the restriction of BDV nucleic acid to the brain. The immune status of these shrews is unknown. They could represent animals at an early stage of infection. Due to the collection time late in the year it is more likely that they reflect immunocompetent individuals which were able to prevent or clear infection outside the brain. Traces of BDV signals in stomach und lung of these shrews indicate that virus was still present in their environment.</p>
