<p>Two points could explain the natural infection of bicolored white-toothed shrews within a limited area of their normal territory. Either a more recent evolutionary event introduced BDV to this species, or there is another infection source within the BD endemic regions linked to 
 <italic>C. leucodon</italic> but not to other shrew species. The strong genome conservation of mammalian BDV 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> could be caused by the involvement of another species in the transmission cycle due to the restrictions that are put genetically on viruses which jump between far distant host species

 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Weaver2" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. In a first attempt to investigate potential food of shrews for BDV we collected earth worms from the property where BDV-infected shrews had been found over four consecutive years. All earth worms were negative for BDV nucleic acid.
