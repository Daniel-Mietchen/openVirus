<p>Looking at maps, the main regions of occurrence of classical BD are lowland areas bordered by low mountain ranges (compare with 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093659-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Valleys and gaps between low mountain ranges appear to have enabled the further distribution of BD. No mountain border exists east of the East German endemic region, but BD does not occur there.
