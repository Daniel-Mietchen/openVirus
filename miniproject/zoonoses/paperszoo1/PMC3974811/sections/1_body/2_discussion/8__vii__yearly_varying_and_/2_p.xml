<p>Our study only involved shrews that were found/trapped by accident. The bicolored white-toothed shrews were more often trapped in autumn and early winter which indicates higher contacts between shrews and human settlements in the second half of the year. In this time shrews visit stables and houses. At first glance, this contrasts with the absolute frequency of cases of BD in horses and sheep which peaks in May/June but displays a nadir in September/October/November 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Drrwald2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The natural incubation period of BD is unknown. Only a few experimental infections of horses have been conducted so far, but based on artificial intracerebral infections. The incubation periods of these experiments ranged from two to several weeks
