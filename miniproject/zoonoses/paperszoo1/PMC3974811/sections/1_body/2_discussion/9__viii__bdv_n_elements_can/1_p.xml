<p>BDV N elements were identified by BDV DNA PCR in three bicolored white toothed shrews but not in the other eleven BDV positive shrews investigated. This confirms for the first time genome integrations associated with recent BDV infections in the natural host, and correlates with results of experimental infections of laboratory mice and newborn bank voles

 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Kinnunen2" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref> BDV genome integration depends on infection dose and time after infection and is not detectable in all experimentally infected animals. It may also depend on the age of infected animals because all experimental studies conducted so far were based on newborn individuals

 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Kinnunen2" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. The fact that 14 bicolored white-toothed shrews were positive by RT-PCR but not all of them expressed antigen or integrated BDV N elements could be due to sampling at different times after infection.
