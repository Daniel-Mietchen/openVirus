<p>The BDV sequences of bicolored white-toothed shrews fit well into the group of mammalian BDVs and are unconnected to avian bornaviruses. The single description of mammalian BDVs in birds 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Berg1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref> has to be viewed critically because the sequences obtained resemble those of laboratory strains 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Drrwald2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In addition to the description of mammalian BDV sequence groups by Kolodziejek 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Kolodziejek1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref> the integration of sequences from BDVs of shrews allows the definition of major groups (for definition see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093659-g004">Figure 4</xref>, for geographic distribution see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093659-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Local BDV sequences remain stable for decades 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Kolodziejek1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. This allows conclusions about the origin of BDVs and relationships between the sequence groups. BD was comprehensively reported near the Swabian Alb as early as the early 19
 <sup>th</sup> century 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Authenrieth1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Sequence group 1A is located in this region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093659-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and displays a high variability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093659-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In Bavaria viruses of three sequence groups are prevalent (1A, 2, 4). Group 1B is bound to the Rhine valley and valleys of the tributaries of the Rhine in Switzerland, The Principality of Liechtenstein and Austria. Sequence group 3 is located in the region around the city of Borna. Group 4 is the most northerly.
