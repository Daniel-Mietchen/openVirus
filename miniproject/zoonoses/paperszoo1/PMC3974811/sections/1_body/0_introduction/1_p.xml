<p>Borna disease viruses (BDVs) are nonsegmented negative stranded RNA viruses of the family 
 <italic>Bornaviridae</italic> within the order 
 <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> which replicate and transcribe in the nucleus of infected cells and use cellular splicing for generating some mRNAs 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Briese1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Schwemmle1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The viruses are noncytolytic, have a high tropism for cells of the central nervous system and infect mammals 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Staeheli1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, birds 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Kistler1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Staeheli2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and have even been found in a snake venome gland which could be a sign of natural infection of reptiles 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Horie1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. A large number of species harbors BDV-like elements in their genomes indicating these viruses emerged long ago 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Horie1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Kobayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Clinical symptoms are mainly caused by immunopathological reactions of antiviral CD8 T cells to infected cells 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Hausmann1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Stitz1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Two disease complexes are known which are caused by these processes: Borna disease (BD) in mammals 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Zwick1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and proventricular dilatation disease in birds 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Staeheli2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The mammalian BDVs were the first to gain attention. They represent a homogenous group of viruses with strong genetical restriction and differ from the avian bornaviruses, which exhibit a broader sequence variation and do not replicate efficiently in mammalian cells 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Staeheli2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Fatal neurological disorders in horses and sheep of unknown origin were observed in certain areas of Germany in the 19
 <sup>th</sup> and 20
 <sup>th</sup> centuries 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Zwick1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Authenrieth1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The viral etiology was proved by Zwick in the 1920s 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Zwick1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Drrwald1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Nonpurulent meningoencephalitis with marked perivascular cuffing is the typical pathohistological presentation of BD 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Joest1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. BDV never caused epidemics although cases were observed more frequently in some years than in others 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Drrwald1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Drrwald2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The disease is endemic in certain regions of Germany, the Swiss-Liechtenstein-Austrian Rhine valley and valleys of tributaries of the upper Rhine 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Drrwald2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The only exception so far was a BD case in a pony in Styria (Austria) from which a new subtype of BDV was isolated 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Nowotny1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Pleschka1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Very rarely other animal species such as rabbits, cattle, dogs 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Weissenbck3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and zoo animals like new world camelids have been reported to succumb to the disease (for overview see 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Drrwald2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>). The possibility of infections of humans with BDV was hypothesized over years based on antibody findings and later putative BDV sequences obtained from human specimens, but this has been questioned recently since reported human-derived BDV sequences proved to be inadvertent laboratory artefacts 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Schwemmle2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Drrwald3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and psychiatric syndromes could not be linked to BDV antibodies 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Hornig1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>; moreover the specificity of antibodies against BDV in humans remains questionable since they have been found to be more frequent in patient groups with chronic diseases 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Bode1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Gungor1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> which points towards a high percentage of immunological cross-reactivity not linked specifically with BDV. Within the geographical distribution range of the disease some locations are more frequently affected than others 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Drrwald4" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Netzer1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. It often occurred in the past that one farm had single losses due to BD over years but neighboring farms had no losses at all, which raised several speculations about the origin of the disease 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Netzer1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The disease is more frequent in spring and early summer and has a seasonal low in autumn 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Drrwald2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The incidence of BD decreased in the 1970s and has remained at a low level since 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Drrwald2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Experimental infections of rodents support a possible reservoir function by persistent tolerated infections in some animals following different modes of infection 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Gosztonyi1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Pletnikov1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and a spreading of the virus via urine 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Sauder1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. However, a natural reservoir in rodents was not found 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Ihlenburg1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Vahlenkamp1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The epidemiological pattern of BD as well as the geographic clustering indicates an existence of reservoir species for BDV 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Drrwald2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Thus it was a major breakthrough when BDV infections in bicolored white-toothed shrews (
 <italic>Crocidura leucodon)</italic> were reported from Switzerland 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Hilbe1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Puorger1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The sequences obtained from the shrews fit into the geographical cluster of the Swiss-Liechtenstein-Austrian-Rhine valley group. The shrews had been trapped near locations where BD in horses had been reported in the years before.
