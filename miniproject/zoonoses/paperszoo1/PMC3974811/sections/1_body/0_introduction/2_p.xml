<p>To further elucidate the role of shrews in natural BDV infection the objectives of this study were to investigate (i) bicolored white-toothed shrews from endemic regions in Germany, (ii) bicolored white-toothed shrews from locations where BD had not been reported during the last decades, and (iii) other species of shrews. The role of shrews as a natural reservoir of BDV would be further supported if infections were demonstrated in shrews of another, geographically separated endemic area which harbor BDVs that correspond genetically to the area.</p>
