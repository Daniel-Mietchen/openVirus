<p>BDV DNA [by employing BDV PCR without reverse transcription (RT) step] was demonstrated in three shrews (CL17, CL54, CL64). Only the BDV primer pair established by Sorg and Metzler 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Sorg1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> within the nucleoprotein (N) gene detected BDV DNA [(242) 
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′-GTCACGGCGCGATATGTTTC-3′</named-content> (261), (508) 
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′-GATGACGATCCTATCACAACC-3′</named-content> (491), 267 bp, numbering corresponds to GenBank accession number U04608]. The nucleotide sequences obtained by the BDV DNA PCR were identical to those achieved by RT-PCR for the corresponding individual. All other primer pairs used for amplification of BDV [other parts of the N gene and the phosphoprotein (P) gene] did not detect BDV DNA.
