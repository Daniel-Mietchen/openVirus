<p>14 out of 107 shrews proved positive for BDV nucleic acid by RT-PCR. All positive individuals (CL17, CL18, CL19, CL35, CL54, CL62, CL64, CL72, CL73, CL74, CL75, CL76, CL77, CL78) belonged to the species

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093659-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and were collected at three different locations in central Saxony-Anhalt and one location in the southern part of Saxony-Anhalt (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093659-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Thus 14 out of 58 (24%) bicolored white-toothed shrews from Saxony-Anhalt were positive for BDV. All other shrew species were negative for BDV nucleic acid (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0093659-t001">Table 1</xref>). At one property in central Saxony-Anhalt, Güterglück, shrews were collected over five years. Here, nine of 17 bicolored white-toothed shrews (53%) were positive in four consecutive years (
