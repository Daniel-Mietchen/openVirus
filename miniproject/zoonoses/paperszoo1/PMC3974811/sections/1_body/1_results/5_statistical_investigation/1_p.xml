<p>The statistical analysis of BDV positive individuals within shrew species revealed significant differences between 
 <italic>C. leucodon</italic> and 
 <italic>C. russula</italic> (p = 0.005, Mann-Whitney-U-test 2-tailed) and 
 <italic>C. leucodon</italic> and 
 <italic>S. araneus</italic> (p = 0.030, Mann-Whitney-U-test 2-tailed). Differences between 
 <italic>C. leucodon</italic> and 
 <italic>S. minutus</italic>/
 <italic>S. alpinus</italic> were not investigated due to the low number of specimens collected.
