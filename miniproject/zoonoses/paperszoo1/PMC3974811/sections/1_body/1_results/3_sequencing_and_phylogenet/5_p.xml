<p>The BDV sequences obtained during the following years (2007–2009) from shrews collected at the same property in Güterglück (CL35, CL54, CL72–76) form a similar cluster and are closely related to the sequence found in a shrew collected near Buhlendorf, 6 kilometers from Güterglück, in 2008 (CL62).</p>
