<p>Twelve RT-PCR-positive shrews showed abundant immunostaining. Brain and spinal cord had no infiltration of inflammatory cells and had a diffuse pattern of specific immunoreactivity indicating that all components of central nervous system tissue (neurons, glial cells and their processes) harbored BDV proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093659-g006">Figures 6A, 6B</xref>). Sometimes the staining intensity was more pronounced within neuronal nuclei and axons. Also sciatic nerves and other peripheral nerves visible in skeletal muscle samples and other tissues were strongly positive. Here the positive signals were strongest within the axons and less distinct within myelin sheaths. Vegetative nerve fibers of different diameters and occasionally vegetative ganglia were clearly positive. Labelled vegetative ganglia were consistently present within the muscle layers of the intestine. Nerve fibers were positive in the dermis and subcutis, in interstitial tissue of salivary glands, pancreas, heart, kidney, liver and lung, in the muscularis, submucosa and propria of the gastrointestinal tract, and in the red pulp of the spleen. A large variety of other tissues were also strongly immunopositive: olfactory epithelium (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093659-g006">Figure 6H</xref>). Parenchymal cells of the large abdominal organs (liver, kidney) were predominantly negative, with the exception of single hepatocytes. Among mesenchymal tissues, immunostaining was widely positive in smooth muscle cells (gastrointestinal tract, skin, blood vessel walls, bronch(iol)i (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093659-g006">Figure 6K</xref>). Both antibodies produced comparable staining patterns and intensities. The anti-P-antibody tended to produce a more distinct nuclear staining pattern, while the staining achieved with the Bo18 antibody was more diffuse. The negative controls did not show any immunohistochemical signals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093659-g006">Figures 6C, 6E, 6I, 6L</xref>). Two bicolored white-toothed shrews (CL19, CL35) displayed no positive signals in immunohistochemistry despite positivity in BDV RT-PCR.
