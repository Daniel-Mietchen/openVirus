<p>This study provides evidence that 
 <italic>C. leucodon</italic>, the bicolored white-toothed shrew, can harbor BDV without tissue damage in territories endemic for BD, whose BDV sequences fit to the epidemiological sequence cluster of the corresponding region. At one location a high percentage of BDV-positive shrews was identified in four consecutive years without locally associated spill-over disease in horses and sheep; this is a novel finding which points towards a self-sustaining infection cycle in bicolored white-toothed shrews. BDV infections continue to exist in endemic regions although the disease in horses and sheep has significantly decreased in recent years and almost vanished in some regions. Further investigations of 
 <italic>C. leucodon</italic> and other insectivorous species may help to increase our knowledge on the epidemiology of BDV.
