<p>Nucleic acid extraction was conducted by employing the QIAamp Viral RNA Purification Kit (QIAGEN, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This kit is designed to isolate total nucleic acid (viral RNA, viral and cellular DNA). All BDV RT-PCRs were carried out using a One Step RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN, CA, USA) as described by Kolodziejek 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Kolodziejek1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. A screening RT-PCR (available also as nested PCR) within the p40 gene, which proved to be best for detection of classical and highly variant BDV strains was conducted 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Sorg1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> (for sensitivity examination see 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Nowotny1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>). In addition, a larger group of organs from BDV-positive individuals was investigated. All BDV-positive shrews were finally investigated by BDV RT-PCRs with six further BDV-specific primer pairs, as described by Kolodziejek 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Kolodziejek1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. For investigation of potential genome integration of BDV all above primer pairs were used and PCRs without reverse transcription were performed. Furthermore, one genomic PCR for determination of the exact species was applied. For this purpose one primer pair amplifying a 549 bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b sequence of 
 <italic>Crocidura leucodon</italic> shrews was designed with the help of the Primer Designer program (Scientific and Educational Software, version 3.0) and synthesized by Invitrogen (Life Technologies, UK). The primers consisted of the following sequences: (568) 
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′- TTGCAGGAGTACACCTGTTATT -3′</named-content> (589) and (1116) 
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′- GGTTTTCAACTATGCTTGTGAT -3′</named-content> (1095). The numbering corresponds to the 
 <italic>Crocidura leucodon</italic> cytochrome b gene sequence of GenBank accession number DQ065609. The BDV (DNA) PCR and the cytochrome b PCR were performed by employing the Qiagen Fast Cycling PCR Kit (QIAGEN, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
