<p>All shrews were weighed and their size measured in a frozen state. Pictures were taken of each shrew shortly before dissection. The exact species was determined either by visual inspection or, if this was not certain, the skulls were analyzed after dissection. Shortly before dissection, the animals were thawed and different organ samples were taken for BDV reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical investigation. BDV-positive shrews were also investigated by BDV PCR (without RT) and by PCR on the cytochrome b gene to confirm the exact species.</p>
