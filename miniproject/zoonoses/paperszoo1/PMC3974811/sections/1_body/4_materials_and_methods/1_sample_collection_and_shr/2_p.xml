<p>The collection focused mainly on a few locations in the central and southern territory of Saxony-Anhalt in Germany which reflects the distribution area of the BDV sequence groups 3 and 4 [defined in this paper, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093659-g004">Figures 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093659-g005">5</xref>]. Moreover shrews found in Thuringia, Saxony, Lower Saxony (Germany) and South Tyrol (Italy) were included in the study. We focused only on shrews which were caught by cats, trapped inadvertently in rodent traps, or found dead. Immediately after collection the shrews were stored at −20°C and later at −80°C. The shrews were numbered according to the initials of their Latin species name (CR, CL, SA, SAR, SM) and the order of collection (No. 1–107). In addition, we investigated some other insectivores from the central Saxony-Anhalt (one mole 
 <italic>Talpa europaea</italic> FISCHER 1817, one hedgehog 
 <italic>Erinaceus europaeus</italic> FISCHER 1814). From one property on which BDV positive shrews were found over the years (Güterglück, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany) 20 earth worms 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> (LINNAEUS 1758) were collected in order to investigate the possibility of BDV infection in the food of shrews.
