<p>Brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, nasal mucosa, salivary glands, heart, lung, stomach, intestine, pancreas, liver, kidney, spleen, skeletal muscle, and skin from the RT-PCR positive shrews were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Tissue samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin wax and stained according to a previously described protocol 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Chvala1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref> with two different antibodies: (i) the monoclonal antibody Bo18 which is directed against amino acids 19â€“27 of the nucleoprotein (N) of BDV 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Billich1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref> and (ii), a polyclonal antibody directed against the entire recombinant phosphoprotein (P) of BDV 
 <xref rid="pone.0093659-Weissenbck2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. As negative controls, the same organs of three RT-PCR negative
