   <bold>Competing Interests: </bold>RD is employed at IDT Biologika GmbH, Germany. This company had a vaccine on the market against Borna disease for horses and sheep until 1991 but is not dealing with the topic of Borna disease any more. After leaving University RD continued research on the epidemiology of Borna disease in his private time. This does not alter the authorsâ€™ adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.
