 <caption>
  <p>Radial phylogenetic tree representing the position of the BDV sequences obtained from shrews. Sequences of BDV-positive bicolored white-toothed shrews are marked with red diamonds [this paper], blue circles 
   <xref rid="pone.0093659-Hilbe1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, 
   <xref rid="pone.0093659-Puorger1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and purple triangle 
   <xref rid="pone.0093659-Bourg1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Sequences of BDVs from spill-over hosts do not have marks. The tree (Neighbor- Joining method) includes a 1824 bp stretch of the BDV genome comprising the N, P, and X genes and consists of 63 sequences. Bootstrap values less than 99% are hidden.
