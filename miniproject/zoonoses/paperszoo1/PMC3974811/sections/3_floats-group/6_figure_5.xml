  <title>Locations of BDV-positive bicolored white-toothed shrews within BD endemic regions.</title>
  <p>Endemic regions of BD (green circles, main endemic areas; green dots, BD occurs but is rare), locations at which positive bicolored white-toothed shrews were found in this study (orange triangles) and were reported in Switzerland 
   <xref rid="pone.0093659-Hilbe1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, 
   <xref rid="pone.0093659-Puorger1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> (red triangles) and Bavaria 
   <xref rid="pone.0093659-Bourg1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> (brown triangles), genetic cluster groups (1A,B; 2; 3; 4), and movements of BD into new territories (blue arrows); BD was first described by Authenrieth in the Swabian Alb 
   <xref rid="pone.0093659-Authenrieth1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>; there was never an epidemic in the city of Borna but the disease occurred frequently in horses on farms in the district of Borna from the late 1880s until the 1960s but it is rare there now 
   <xref rid="pone.0093659-Drrwald1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>; BDV-positive shrews from three major clusters (1, 3, 4) have been found so far. The distribution of BD in the scheme is based on reference data
