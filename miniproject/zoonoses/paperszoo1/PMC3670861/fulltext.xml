We examined the kinetics of diagnostic markers and their associations with clinical parameters in 93 patients with travel-acquired dengue fever. Kinetics analyses suggested a longer average duration for viremia (9 days, CI95%: 8&#x02013;10) and non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigenemia (15 days, CI95%: 12&#x02013;20) than reported in endemic populations. While none of the tests sufficed alone, the best diagnostic coverage was achieved by combining antibody detection with RNA or NS1 testing. Studied by regression models, early relative levels of viremia and NS1 antigenemia proved to be significantly associated with several clinical parameters: high viremia predicted greater likelihood and increased length of hospitalization, the degree of NS1 antigenemia correlated positively with hematocrit and liver transaminases, and both viremia and NS1 antigenemia levels negatively with platelet counts in follow-up. Levels of viremia and NS1 antigenemia may serve as predictors of the clinical manifestations in travel-acquired dengue.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Finnish governmental subsidy for health science research, the Academy of Finland, and the Finnish Medical Foundation.

For a rational choice and timing of the tests, the kinetics of the various diagnostic markers needs to be understood.

Severe dengue infections should be treated in dedicated high-dependency units, where a mortality of less than 1% can be achieved <xref rid="pone.0065900-Simmons1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.

For this study, we retrospectively recorded data on all the DENV IgM-positive patients in Finland 1999&#x02013;2008 (a total of 154 cases). From these patients, all samples taken within 21 days since illness onset were collected, including the early IgM-negative sera. Four patients were excluded due to suspicion of false positive IgM. This group consisted of one published case of Japanese encephalitis <xref rid="pone.0065900-Lehtinen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, one laboratory-confirmed tick-borne encephalitis (strong positive anti-TBE IgM in serum and cerebrospinal fluid along with a characteristic clinical picture, and only weakly positive serum anti-dengue IgM), and 2 patients who did not show diagnostic seroconversion in serial samples. After additionally excluding those with insufficient clinical information (57 patients), the data comprised a total of 139 samples from 93 patients (1&#x02013;3 samples per patient). The first samples from a subgroup of patients (72/93) were evaluated previously <xref rid="pone.0065900-Huhtamo1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>; these early-phase sera were included in the present study along with convalescent samples for analyses of the kinetics of virologic markers, and with additional clinical data for studying the associations between virologic markers and clinical parameters.</p><p>The clinical and laboratory data were analyzed by two kinds of statistical approaches: (1) those exploring the kinetics of diagnostic markers either with a single-test approach or as combinations of two tests, and (2) those examining the associations between virologic markers and clinical parameters. For analyses of the kinetics, we included all 139 serum samples taken within 21 days since the onset of symptoms (93 patients, 1&#x02013;3 samples each). For the association analyses, we included a subgroup of 89 patients with data on the following potential confounding factors: age, sex, day of illness, presence of co-infections and chronic diseases, which were controlled in the statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Collection of clinical data</title><p>The following clinical information was retrieved retrospectively from medical records: demographic characteristics (age, gender, country of birth), chronic diseases (long-lasting condition that can be controlled but not cured, such as diabetes mellitus), previous vaccinations against other flaviviruses, travel destination, symptoms, results of routine laboratory investigations, presence of co-infections (additional diagnosis of an acute infectious disease other than dengue), possible hospitalization and its length. The date of the onset of symptoms was designated as day 1. Laboratory parameters were classified as being normal, decreased, or elevated according to current reference values.

The serum aliquots were stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C and &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C for RNA and NS1 detection, respectively. The RNA extractions were carried out from 100 &#x000b5;l of serum specimens by the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. For the DENV NS1 antigen detection we used the commercial Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag EIA assay (Bio-Rad) adhering to manufacturer's instructions. Some of the NS1 Ag tests (69/135) and one-step real-time RT-PCRs (69/132) were carried out separately prior to this study <xref rid="pone.0065900-Huhtamo1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. For the 63 sera tested for RNA for this study only, the Stratagene thermocycler was used instead of the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System. The comparability and reproducibility of the results obtained with the two pieces of equipment was ascertained by means of appropriate internal controls. The infecting DENV serotype was determined by virus isolation, DENV-typing RT-PCR <xref rid="pone.0065900-Lanciotti1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and consequent sequencing <xref rid="pone.0065900-Huhtamo1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065900-Huhtamo2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, or by direct sequencing of RT-PCR products <xref rid="pone.0065900-Lanciotti1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065900-Scaramozzino1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> obtained directly from serum samples.</p><p>The default setting for Finnish travelers is a primary infection, as the vast majority are &#x02013; apart from a vaccinated minority &#x02013; flavivirus na&#x000ef;ve.

The kinetics of serum DENV RNA, NS1 antigen, and DENV-specific antibodies were studied using generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) <xref rid="pone.0065900-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In all models, a smoothing spline of the number of days since illness onset was employed as the explanatory variable. Two kinds of univariate models were formed: (1) those with Gaussian error distributions and an identity link function, where continuous values of diagnostic markers (inverse cycle threshold [ct] -value, NS1 ratio, IgM index, and log<sub>10</sub>-transformed IgG titre) were used as dependent variables, and (2) those with binomial error distributions and a logit link function with binary outcomes (negative/positive) of the four diagnostic tests as dependent variables. Similarly, we studied the kinetics of different combinations of two diagnostic tests over the course of illness, using GAMM with binomial error distribution and a logit link function, the classes of the dependent variable being negative in both tests/positive in either of the tests.</p><p>Associations between virologic markers (serum DENV RNA and NS1 antigen) and clinical parameters (routine laboratory test results, symptoms during follow-up, likelihood and length of hospitalization) were studied by regression models. The full model had the clinical parameter as the dependent variable, and potential confounding factors (age, sex, day of illness, presence of co-infections and chronic diseases) as explanatory variables. Each of the virologic markers (serum DENV RNA and NS1 antigen) were included in the full model in turn, and a model set constituting 95% of Akaike weights of all models nested within the full model was then averaged <xref rid="pone.0065900-Burnham1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> using MuMIN package <xref rid="pone.0065900-Barton1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> in R software. Gaussian error distributions, an identity link function, and continuous diagnostic explanatory variables (the inverse ct-value from RT-PCR [cut-off ct-value &#x02013; sample ct-value], NS1 ratio from antigen EIA) were applied to models with continuous values of routine laboratory findings as dependent variables. A Poisson error distribution adjusted for overdispersion, a log link function, and continuous diagnostic variables were used in models studying the duration of hospitalization. For models examining binary dependent variables (likelihood of abnormal laboratory findings/occurrence of different symptoms/hospitalization), we employed binomial error distributions, a logit link function, and binary diagnostic outcomes (serum DENV RNA/NS1 positivity). Explanatory variables were considered statistically significant (on 0.05 level), if the 95% confidence intervals of their coefficients excluded zero.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>

In settings where RNA detection is not readily available, the combination of IgM and NS1 appears to be a feasible approach. The advantages of NS1 over RNA detection are low cost and ease of testing. Moreover, the long detection span of NS1 antigen enhances diagnostic specificity in the later phase of the disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Virologic markers and clinical picture</title><p>Dengue in travelers is considered mostly a mild disease <xref rid="pone.0065900-Baaten1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, yet severe forms of the disease are occasionally seen <xref rid="pone.0065900-Wichmann1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. None of our cases were classified as dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome according to the WHO criteria valid at the time of data collection. A significant proportion of the study patients were hospitalized, however; the decision was taken on the basis of the clinicians' evaluation of the patients' general condition. In Finland it is customary to hospitalize febrile travelers whenever there is any reason to believe that their clinical status may get worse, regardless of whether a diagnosis has been established or not. In most cases dengue was not diagnosed until after the patient was admitted to hospital.</p><p>Despite the fact that the dengue cases were predominantly mild, regression analyses revealed several associations between the relative levels of virologic markers (DENV RNA and NS1) and the various clinical parameters studied. The initial levels of viremia predicted both likelihood and duration of hospitalization. Notably, the clinicians were unaware of their patients' viremia (or NS1 antigenemia) status at the time of illness, and the number of days from the onset of illness was controlled in the statistical analyses; if not, both of these could have had a confounding effect on the associations observed.</p><p>The initial levels of NS1 antigenemia were not associated with hospitalization, but correlated positively with some central laboratory parameters, such as hematocrit and liver transaminases. Notably, both serum viremia and NS1 antigenemia levels correlated negatively with platelet counts over the course of illness.</p><p>Studies conducted in endemic settings have related high serum viremia and NS1 antigenemia with severe dengue <xref rid="pone.0065900-Vaughn1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065900-Duyen1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>; this relation has not been confirmed in some other studies, though <xref rid="pone.0065900-Chau1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065900-Duong1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. To our knowledge, correlations between virologic and clinical markers have not previously been assessed in travelers. To study these associations, a prospective study design with standardized data collection would have been superior to the retrospective approach. Due to the relatively low incidence of dengue among Finnish travelers, a prospective study would have been difficult to conduct in the current setting, though. One of the limitations of the retrospective research approach was the lack of comprehensive data on pre-existing flaviviral immunity. However, other known potential confounding factors (day of illness, and age, sex, and presence of co-infections and chronic diseases) were controlled in the analyses exploring the correlations between virologic and clinical markers. Despite infections being predominantly mild in this study, the observed correlations with clinical parameters (e.g. hematocrit and thrombocytopenia) suggest that viremia and NS1 antigenemia may serve as predictors of the clinical manifestations in travel-acquired dengue.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study suggests a longer average duration of serum viremia and NS1 antigenemia in travel-acquired dengue than that observed in endemic areas, emphasizing the importance of carrying out individual studies among different patient populations. Our results highlight the importance of combining diagnostic tests, such as NS1 and IgM detection, to provide better diagnostic coverage. The early appearance and long detection span of NS1, easy performance and rapidity of the test, as well as high specificity for dengue viruses as compared to antibody testing make the assessment of NS1 a feasible tool for diagnosing traveler's dengue. Both viremia and NS1 antigenemia showed correlation with several clinical parameters, suggesting a potential role in predicting disease outcome in traveler patients.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0065900.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
