  <title>Kinetics of diagnostic combinations.</title>
  <p>The solid lines and shaded areas provide the predicted probabilities and their 95% confidence intervals for at least one of the two diagnostic tests showing a positive result on a given day of illness. Non-solid lines indicate the predicted probabilities of positive result for each test alone. The circles illustrate time points of samples negative in both tests, the size of the circle being proportional to the number of observations.</p>
