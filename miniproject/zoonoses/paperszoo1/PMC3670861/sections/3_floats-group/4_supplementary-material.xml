   <bold>Correlations between virologic markers and laboratory parameters.</bold> Associations between relative amounts of DENV RNA and NS1 antigen in the first serum sample, and the minimum/maximum values of hemoglobin, leukocytes, platelets, ALT, and AST during follow-up. Lines indicate predictions from averaged linear models (thick line  =  statistically significant, thin line  =  non-significant association), and open symbols the observed data. In hemoglobin plots, solid line and open dots indicate the predictions and data for women, dashed lines and open squares those for men.
