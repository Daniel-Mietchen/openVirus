   <bold>Correlations between virologic markers and hospitalization.</bold> Associations between relative amounts of serum DENV RNA/NS1 antigen at the time of presenting to hospital and probability and length of hospitalization. The circles indicate the degree of serum viremia/NS1 antigenemia for individual patients at the time of presenting to hospital and the choice of treatment place (out-patient/hospitalized)/length of hospitalization. The size of the circles is presented in proportion to the number of observations.
