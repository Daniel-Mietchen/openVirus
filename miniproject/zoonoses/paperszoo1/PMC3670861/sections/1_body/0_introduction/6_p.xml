<p>The present study investigated the clinical and diagnostic data of 93 Finnish travelers with acute dengue infections, aiming at (1) describing the kinetics of DENV viremia, NS1 antigenemia, and DENV-specific antibodies, (2) assessing their use in diagnostics as combinations, and (3) examining the potential correlation between diagnostic markers (viremia and NS1 antigenemia) and clinical parameters in travel-acquired dengue.</p>
