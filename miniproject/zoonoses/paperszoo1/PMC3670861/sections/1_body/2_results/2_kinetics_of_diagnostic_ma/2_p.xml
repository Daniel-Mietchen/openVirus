<p>During the first 12 days of illness, all serum samples from patients with DENV-1 infection (n = 35), but only 69% (n = 32) of those from patients with DENV-3 infection were NS1 positive (p = 0.0003, Fisher's exact test). In the 13 samples taken after day 12, this difference was no longer seen. The kinetics of viremia showed no serotype-dependent differences (data not shown).</p>
