 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065900-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows the kinetics of plasma viremia, NS1 antigenemia, and DENV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies in the 93 patients studied. DENV RNA and NS1 antigen were detected already on the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> day of illness (the earliest serum samples), with a probability of 91% (95% CI: 82–96% for PCR positivity and 80–96% for NS1 positivity) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065900-g001">Figure 1E, 1F</xref>). On the 7th day of illness, 65% (95% CI: 54–74%) of the sera were still positive for DENV RNA, and 80% (95% CI: 71–87%) were positive for NS1. Patients were likely to remain PCR positive up to illness day 9 (95% CI: day 8–10), whereas NS1 positivity would last longer, until illness day 15 (95% CI: day 12–20). On day 21, none of the sera proved positive for DENV RNA, while 20% were still positive for NS1 (
