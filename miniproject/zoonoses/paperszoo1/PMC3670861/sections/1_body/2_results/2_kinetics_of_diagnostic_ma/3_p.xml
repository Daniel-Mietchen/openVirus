 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065900-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows the sensitivities for the combinations of two diagnostic tests over the first three weeks of illness. When RNA detection was combined with IgM detection, only 1% (1/120) of the serum samples remained negative (the negative sample taken on illness day 14). The combination of NS1 and IgM detection remained negative in 3% (4/120) of the samples. Although not primarily intended for identifying acute infection, the combinations with IgG detection were also studied. When either RNA or NS1 tests were used together with IgG detection, 2% (3/129) or 3% (4/130) of the samples were negative, respectively. When combining IgM and IgG detection, the results proved negative for 10% (12/124) of the samples; when using RNA and NS1 detection together, 25% (32/127) proved negative.
