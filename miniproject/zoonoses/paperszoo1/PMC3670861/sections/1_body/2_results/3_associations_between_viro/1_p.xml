<p>Associations between virologic markers (serum viremia/NS1 antigenemia) and clinical parameters were studied with regression models in a subgroup of 89 patients who provided data on the following potential confounding factors controlled in the analyses (age, sex, day of illness, presence of co-infections and chronic diseases). All associations reported below were statistically significant on the 0.05 level when confounding factors were controlled for.
