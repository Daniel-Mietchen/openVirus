<p>All patients were classified as having an uncomplicated dengue infection. Most of the cases were categorized as primary infections. Only three patients were considered to have a probable secondary infection: in the first sample they had a considerable anti-DENV IgG level concomitantly with a negative anti-DENV IgM, yet their samples were positive for DENV-RNA. No other cases with a considerable early IgG and low or non-existent IgM were detected. None of the suspected secondary cases had received flaviviral vaccines in the past.</p>
