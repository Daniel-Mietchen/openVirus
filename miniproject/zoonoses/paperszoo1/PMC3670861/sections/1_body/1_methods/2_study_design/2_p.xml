<p>The clinical and laboratory data were analyzed by two kinds of statistical approaches: (1) those exploring the kinetics of diagnostic markers either with a single-test approach or as combinations of two tests, and (2) those examining the associations between virologic markers and clinical parameters. For analyses of the kinetics, we included all 139 serum samples taken within 21 days since the onset of symptoms (93 patients, 1â€“3 samples each). For the association analyses, we included a subgroup of 89 patients with data on the following potential confounding factors: age, sex, day of illness, presence of co-infections and chronic diseases, which were controlled in the statistical analyses.</p>
