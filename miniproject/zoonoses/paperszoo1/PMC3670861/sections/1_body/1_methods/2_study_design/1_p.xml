<p>In Finland, laboratory diagnostics of dengue has been based on serological testing performed in a single laboratory for all the patients throughout the country (HUSLAB, Helsinki University Central Hospital). For this study, we retrospectively recorded data on all the DENV IgM-positive patients in Finland 1999–2008 (a total of 154 cases). From these patients, all samples taken within 21 days since illness onset were collected, including the early IgM-negative sera. Four patients were excluded due to suspicion of false positive IgM. This group consisted of one published case of Japanese encephalitis

After additionally excluding those with insufficient clinical information (57 patients), the data comprised a total of 139 samples from 93 patients (1–3 samples per patient). The first samples from a subgroup of patients (72/93) were evaluated previously
