<p>RNA extraction, the detection of RNA by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (tested in 132 samples), and of the NS1 antigen by EIA (tested in 135 samples) were performed as previously described 
 <xref rid="pone.0065900-Huhtamo1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The serum aliquots were stored at −70°C and −20°C for RNA and NS1 detection, respectively. The RNA extractions were carried out from 100 µl of serum specimens by the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. For the DENV NS1 antigen detection we used the commercial Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag EIA assay (Bio-Rad) adhering to manufacturer's instructions. Some of the NS1 Ag tests (69/135) and one-step real-time RT-PCRs (69/132) were carried out separately prior to this study 
 <xref rid="pone.0065900-Huhtamo1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. For the 63 sera tested for RNA for this study only, the Stratagene thermocycler was used instead of the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System. The comparability and reproducibility of the results obtained with the two pieces of equipment was ascertained by means of appropriate internal controls. The infecting DENV serotype was determined by virus isolation, DENV-typing RT-PCR
