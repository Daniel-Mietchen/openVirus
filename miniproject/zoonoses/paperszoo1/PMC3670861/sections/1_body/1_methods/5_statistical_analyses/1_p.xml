<p>All statistical analyses were performed with R software 
 <xref rid="pone.0065900-R1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The kinetics of serum DENV RNA, NS1 antigen, and DENV-specific antibodies were studied using generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) 
 <xref rid="pone.0065900-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In all models, a smoothing spline of the number of days since illness onset was employed as the explanatory variable. Two kinds of univariate models were formed: (1) those with Gaussian error distributions and an identity link function, where continuous values of diagnostic markers (inverse cycle threshold [ct] -value, NS1 ratio, IgM index, and log
 <sub>10</sub>-transformed IgG titre) were used as dependent variables, and (2) those with binomial error distributions and a logit link function with binary outcomes (negative/positive) of the four diagnostic tests as dependent variables. Similarly, we studied the kinetics of different combinations of two diagnostic tests over the course of illness, using GAMM with binomial error distribution and a logit link function, the classes of the dependent variable being negative in both tests/positive in either of the tests.
