<p>Associations between virologic markers (serum DENV RNA and NS1 antigen) and clinical parameters (routine laboratory test results, symptoms during follow-up, likelihood and length of hospitalization) were studied by regression models. The full model had the clinical parameter as the dependent variable, and potential confounding factors (age, sex, day of illness, presence of co-infections and chronic diseases) as explanatory variables. Each of the virologic markers (serum DENV RNA and NS1 antigen) were included in the full model in turn, and a model set constituting 95% of Akaike weights of all models nested within the full model was then averaged

 <xref rid="pone.0065900-Barton1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> in R software. Gaussian error distributions, an identity link function, and continuous diagnostic explanatory variables (the inverse ct-value from RT-PCR [cut-off ct-value â€“ sample ct-value], NS1 ratio from antigen EIA) were applied to models with continuous values of routine laboratory findings as dependent variables. A Poisson error distribution adjusted for overdispersion, a log link function, and continuous diagnostic variables were used in models studying the duration of hospitalization. For models examining binary dependent variables (likelihood of abnormal laboratory findings/occurrence of different symptoms/hospitalization), we employed binomial error distributions, a logit link function, and binary diagnostic outcomes (serum DENV RNA/NS1 positivity). Explanatory variables were considered statistically significant (on 0.05 level), if the 95% confidence intervals of their coefficients excluded zero.
