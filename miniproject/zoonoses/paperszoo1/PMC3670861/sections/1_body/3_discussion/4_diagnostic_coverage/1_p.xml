<p>When scrutinizing the first 3 weeks after onset, none of the diagnostic methods could alone serve as a sufficient diagnostic tool for the whole time period, as expected. Combining RNA or NS1 detection and antibody testing resulted in a high overall sensitivity, which accords with results from previous studies

The advantages of NS1 over RNA detection are low cost and ease of testing. Moreover, the long detection span of NS1 antigen enhances diagnostic specificity in the later phase of the disease.
