<p>Despite the fact that the dengue cases were predominantly mild, regression analyses revealed several associations between the relative levels of virologic markers (DENV RNA and NS1) and the various clinical parameters studied. The initial levels of viremia predicted both likelihood and duration of hospitalization. Notably, the clinicians were unaware of their patients' viremia (or NS1 antigenemia) status at the time of illness, and the number of days from the onset of illness was controlled in the statistical analyses; if not, both of these could have had a confounding effect on the associations observed.</p>
