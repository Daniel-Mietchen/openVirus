 <xref rid="pone.0065900-Duong1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. To our knowledge, correlations between virologic and clinical markers have not previously been assessed in travelers. To study these associations, a prospective study design with standardized data collection would have been superior to the retrospective approach. Due to the relatively low incidence of dengue among Finnish travelers, a prospective study would have been difficult to conduct in the current setting, though. One of the limitations of the retrospective research approach was the lack of comprehensive data on pre-existing flaviviral immunity. However, other known potential confounding factors (day of illness, and age, sex, and presence of co-infections and chronic diseases) were controlled in the analyses exploring the correlations between virologic and clinical markers. Despite infections being predominantly mild in this study, the observed correlations with clinical parameters (e.g. hematocrit and thrombocytopenia) suggest that viremia and NS1 antigenemia may serve as predictors of the clinical manifestations in travel-acquired dengue.
