<p>Dengue in travelers is considered mostly a mild disease 
 <xref rid="pone.0065900-Baaten1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, yet severe forms of the disease are occasionally seen 
 <xref rid="pone.0065900-Wichmann1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. None of our cases were classified as dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome according to the WHO criteria valid at the time of data collection. A significant proportion of the study patients were hospitalized, however; the decision was taken on the basis of the clinicians' evaluation of the patients' general condition. In Finland it is customary to hospitalize febrile travelers whenever there is any reason to believe that their clinical status may get worse, regardless of whether a diagnosis has been established or not. In most cases dengue was not diagnosed until after the patient was admitted to hospital.
