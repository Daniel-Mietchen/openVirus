<p>The need for better diagnostics of dengue and prediction of disease outcome is becoming increasingly urgent 
 <xref rid="pone.0065900-Simmons1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. On account of differences in patient characteristics, separate data on endemic populations and travelers from non-endemic regions are essential. Our previous study suggested that the kinetics of DENV viremia and NS1 antigenemia may differ in traveler populations. This study further explores the kinetics of diagnostic markers, as well as their use as combinations, and correlations with clinical parameters in travel-acquired dengue.
