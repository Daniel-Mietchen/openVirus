<p>NS1 antigen was already detectable in the earliest serum samples, consistent with previous studies in endemic areas

 <xref rid="pone.0065900-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, as in viremia, the NS1 positivity lasted longer than that reported in endemic populations. This might be due to slower clearance of the antigen in primary infections, or a higher sensitivity of the assay in the absence of pre-existing anti-NS1 antibodies. Compared to an average duration of 5 to 7 days recorded in endemic settings

 <xref rid="pone.0065900-Alcon1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, NS1 positivity lasted on average until illness day 15, the span of NS1 antigen detection being also significantly longer than that of serum viremia.
