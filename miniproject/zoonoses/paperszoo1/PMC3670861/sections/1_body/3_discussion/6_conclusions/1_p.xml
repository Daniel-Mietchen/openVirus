<p>This study suggests a longer average duration of serum viremia and NS1 antigenemia in travel-acquired dengue than that observed in endemic areas, emphasizing the importance of carrying out individual studies among different patient populations. Our results highlight the importance of combining diagnostic tests, such as NS1 and IgM detection, to provide better diagnostic coverage. The early appearance and long detection span of NS1, easy performance and rapidity of the test, as well as high specificity for dengue viruses as compared to antibody testing make the assessment of NS1 a feasible tool for diagnosing traveler's dengue. Both viremia and NS1 antigenemia showed correlation with several clinical parameters, suggesting a potential role in predicting disease outcome in traveler patients.</p>
