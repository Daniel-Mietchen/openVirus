<p>We illustrate an application of sampling optimization by applying our approach to West Nile virus, a mosquito-borne pathogen introduced to the United States in 1999 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Nash1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Since introduction the disease has resulted in numerous deaths in humans 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Centers1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and large-scale declines in bird abundances 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-LaDeau1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Testing for West Nile virus has often relied on counts of dead birds. However, as pointed out by Hochachka et al. 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Hochachka1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, this may only be useful for indicating the later stages of severe epidemics and thus fails to lead to effective containment of the epidemic. Here, we examine an alternative strategy wherein both mosquito traps and sentinel chickens, groups of chickens placed in cages and distributed throughout an area, are used to detect a disease epidemic. In the following analyses we investigate sampling between vector and bird host populations but neglect spillover hosts such as humans and horses.
