<p>Suppose that a host is initially infected. (

  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003668.e252.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula> is close to zero at early times, so the above conditions imply that the optimal sampling strategy is to sample only hosts. As the infected vector population grows and becomes larger than 
 <inline-formula>
  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003668.e253.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula>, there is a switch from sampling only the host population to sampling only the vector population. Since this switch depends on the ratio of the proportions of the populations that are infected, the switch will occur at different times for different total population sizes, assuming a constant number of initially infected individuals and constant transmission rates. Note that if it is more expensive to sample the host population than the vector population (
 <inline-formula>
  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003668.e254.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula>) then the time to switch from sampling only hosts to sampling only vectors is earlier. Conversely, if it is more expensive to sample vectors (
 <inline-formula>
  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003668.e255.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula>) then the switch time becomes later.
