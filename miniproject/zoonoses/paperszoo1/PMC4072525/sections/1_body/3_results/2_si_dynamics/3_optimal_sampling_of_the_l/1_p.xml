<p>Here we consider specific solutions of the linearized SI system, given by system (2), under the linear cost function described in the previous section:

 </inline-formula>. This simplified system can provide practitioners with some insight on sampling design when not much detailed information is known about the functional form of disease dynamics. When there is doubt about the validity of these approximations, the full solutions developed in the previous section can be used to determine the range over which linear approximations will be useful. Here and through the rest of the manuscript we only consider the introduction of disease by the more migratory host population, though calculations are provided for alternative initial conditions in
