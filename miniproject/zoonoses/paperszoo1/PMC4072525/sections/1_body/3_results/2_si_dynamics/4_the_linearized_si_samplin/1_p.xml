<p>We now revisit the example of West Nile virus using the linearized approximations derived in the previous section. First, the presence of a critical-time in the binomial sampling model was demonstrated because

 </inline-formula> (parameter values given in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003668-t001">Table 1</xref>), which satisfied condition (25). Using (24), the critical time to switch from sampling hosts to vectors was

 </inline-formula> days. This is a short timescale when the sampling period is weekly; therefore, if the population is large then it is unlikely that the virus will be detected in the first week after initial infection and a reasonable time-independent strategy is to place most or all of the sampling effort into the vector population.
