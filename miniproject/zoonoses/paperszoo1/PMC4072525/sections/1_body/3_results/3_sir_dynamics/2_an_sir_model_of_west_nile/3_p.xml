<p>Applying 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003668.e328">equation (26)</xref> can potentially be misleading when the initial infection is presumed to be in the host population and it really originates in the vector. In this case the true switch time is given by 
 <inline-formula>

 </inline-formula> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003668.s006">Text S4</xref>, equation (S27)) for which a switch time does not exist for any 
 <inline-formula>
  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003668.e363.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula>. The switch from vectors to recovered hosts for these alternative initial conditions is given by equation (S27), and this exists when 
 <inline-formula>
  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003668.e364.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>

 <inline-formula>
  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003668.e365.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula> days so the optimal strategy would be to always sample for infected vectors. This suggests there would be error in this scenario from poor assumptions about the initial condition when 
 <inline-formula>
  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003668.e366.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula>, though for higher recovery times we correctly decide to sample infected vectors. We examine the potential costs of this incorrect decision in terms of the expected time to detection at the end of the following analysis.
