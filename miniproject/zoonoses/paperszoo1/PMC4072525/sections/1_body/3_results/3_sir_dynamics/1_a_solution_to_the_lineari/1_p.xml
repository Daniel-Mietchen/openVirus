<p>In the case where the host population follows the SIR dynamics defined in (5) we must consider sampling between infected vectors (

 </inline-formula>). As a host progresses through the infected class and into recovery the relative quantities of virus and antibodies within the host change. Typically, different testing procedures are used to detect infected individuals and recovered individuals
