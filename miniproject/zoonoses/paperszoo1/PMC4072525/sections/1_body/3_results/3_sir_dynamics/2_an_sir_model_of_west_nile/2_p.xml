<p>Applying the linearized dynamics and binomial sampling model, we found that the critical switch between infected hosts and vectors,

 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003668.e328">equation (26)</xref>), was less than two days for all recovery times (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003668-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore, with a weekly sampling protocol it will be more economically efficient to sample for infected vectors rather than for infected hosts. We next tested whether it is better to sample infected vectors or recovered hosts. Looking at 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003668.e352">equation (28)</xref>, we found it is optimal to sample from the recovered host class when

  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003668.e359.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula>. Otherwise, it is optimal to sample from the infected vectors class. Taken together, our analysis suggests that if the recovery time is less than about 8 days, it will be best to sample from the recovered host stratum; otherwise it will be best to sample from the infected vector stratum, and in all scenarios the infected host class can be ignored.
