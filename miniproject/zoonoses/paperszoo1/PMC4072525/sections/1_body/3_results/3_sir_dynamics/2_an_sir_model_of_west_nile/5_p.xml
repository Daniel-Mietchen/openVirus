<p>Our results from the linearized binomial sampling models for both the SI and SIR dynamics appeared robust to several of our assumptions as the effects of both the linearized dynamics and choice of sampling model had little effect on the optimal sampling design for West Nile virus. However, our results were sensitive to low host population sizes where the nonlinear models suggest that a mixed sampling design that incorporates both vectors and infected hosts will be optimal when it is possible to sample a significant proportion of the host population. In cases where the host population is sufficiently large, our analysis recommends placing sampling effort into infected vector populations given that current evidence suggests either long recovery times or persistent infections for West Nile virus in bird populations
