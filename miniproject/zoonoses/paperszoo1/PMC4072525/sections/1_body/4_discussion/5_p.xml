<p>Despite the recognized impact of emerging zoonoses on human health 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-LloydSmith1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> we are aware of no work that attempts to integrate the active surveillance systems explored here with disease surveillance in humans. In diseases where humans are spillover hosts, such as West Nile virus, low human incidence is expected. Passive surveillance is often more economically efficient when dealing with rare events 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Doherr1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> but this reporting process differs from the assumptions made in this work. In passive surveillence the reporting effort will often vary through time due to seasonal and institutional effects. Incorporating these factors into a predictive framework will require the statistical analyses of these patterns 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Gerardogiorda1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. When including the surveillance of humans for West Nile virus we expect that reductions in the time to detection will occur when the recovery rate (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003668-g004">Figure 4</xref>), though the particular effects will depend on the amount of sampling effort and the transmission rate to humans from the vector. In general we expect that accounting for passive human surveillance of zoonoses may change the optimal active surveillance strategy for wildlife populations as it may not be necessary to sample hosts that have strong interactions with humans or species that significantly lag behind the epidemiological response of humans.
