<p>Another important case that we did not consider here are zoonotic diseases such as avian influenza, which spread much more easily within one zoologic species than across-species. For these diseases, the goal of surveillance is to detect a subtype of the disease more virulent in humans, indicated by sustained human to human transmission. This sampling needs to be tailored to detect clusters of human cases linked to a single avian-to-human transmission that deviate from what is to be expected from low-level human-to-human and bird-to-human transmission

This kind of surveillance will require more detailed contact tracing that is not accounted for in our framework, though the basic structure we have described here could still be applied. More complex statistical analyses will also be needed to determine whether levels of infecteds and recovereds are significantly higher than background levels in order to determine if an outbreak is occurring. Analyses such as those determining epidemic thresholds from public health data (e.g.

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Kleinman1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>) will be useful starting points for integrating thresholds into detecting epidemics of endemic zoonotic diseases.
