<p>The effectiveness of disease control measures often depend on when outbreaks are first discovered. Early detection can significantly reduce the costs associated with disease eradication, human illnesses, and devastation of livestock or crops. For example, the 2001 epidemic of foot and mouth in Great Britain was reported only 2 weeks after the epidemic began

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Thurmond1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. A hypothetical foot and mouth epidemic in California not detected for 2 weeks could have a financial impact of over $15 billion dollars, and an epidemic not detected for 3 weeks could have an impact of up to $69 billion dollars

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Thurmond1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Tildesley1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, the complementary question of how to achieve early detection has been relatively neglected by theory. Greater attention to the design of disease surveillance methods may facilitate earlier detection and reduce the economic impacts of disease epidemics.
