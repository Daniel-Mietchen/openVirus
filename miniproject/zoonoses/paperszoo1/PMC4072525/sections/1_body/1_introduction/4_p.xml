<p>The CDC guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance of human based diseases 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-German1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> are standards that have been used in many assessments of zoonotic surveillance systems, although differences may exist between human and zoonotic surveillance goals 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Drewe1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. A recent survey on the assessment of surveillance systems found that a number of different metrics have been used to determine zoonotic surveillance performance; two of the most frequently mentioned criteria are the sensitivity of surveillance (the ability to detect outbreaks or infection rates) and the time to outbreak detection from initial exposure 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Drewe1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Here we assume the goal of surveillance is to detect the outbreak as early as possible to minimize financial damages or spillover human infections, a common goal for zoonoses 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Connelly1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Our results provide some basic rules of thumb for practitioners designing active surveillance protocols for vector-borne diseases.
