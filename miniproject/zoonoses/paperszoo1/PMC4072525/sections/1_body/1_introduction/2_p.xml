<p>Passive surveillance methods are the voluntary reporting of cases by primary care providers and citizens to public health officials

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Hadorn1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. For vector-borne diseases active surveillance may include the use of sentinel animals and the longitudinal sampling of vector populations

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Hadorn1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, and recent work has begun to link active zoonotic surveillance data to epidemiological models. For example, Gerardo-Giorda 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Gerardogiorda1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> combined surveillance data and epidemiological models to identify counties that were most important for surveillance efforts of rabies in New York State. It is likely that analytical approaches will prove useful in making active zoonotic surveillance methods more cost effective, an important consideration for surveillance organizations with limited resources
