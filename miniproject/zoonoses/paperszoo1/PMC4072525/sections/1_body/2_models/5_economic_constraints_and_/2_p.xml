<p>We used the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Lenhart1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> to find the sampling strategy 
 <inline-formula>
  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003668.e118.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula> that maximizes the probability of detection (given by 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003668.e105">equation (14a)</xref>) or minimizes the time to disease detection (given by 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003668.e106">equation (14b)</xref>). The KKT approach allows the minimization of a function subject to inequality constraints, e.g., constraining the sample sizes to be nonnegative. Further details on this method, as well as some general results for cases with linear objective functions, are provided in
