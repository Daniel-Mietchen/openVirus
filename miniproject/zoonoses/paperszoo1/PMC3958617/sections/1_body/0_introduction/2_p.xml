<p>Bats are one of the most successful and diverse mammalian orders on the earth (

In recent years, bats have gained significant notoriety after being implicated in numerous emerging infectious disease events, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak 10 years ago and the current Middle East respiratory syndrome endemic (

Moreover, bats have been suggested to be important reservoir hosts of many highly lethal zoonotic viruses that can cross species barriers to infect humans and other domestic or wild mammals, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Hendra virus and Nipah virus (

Therefore, it is essential to enhance our knowledge and understanding of the genetic diversity of bat-associated viruses to prevent future outbreaks.
