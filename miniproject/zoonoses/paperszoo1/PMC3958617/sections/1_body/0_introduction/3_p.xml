<p>In recent years, next-generation sequencing methodologies have been used in a number of metagenomics studies dedicated to assessing the virome of bats, and these studies have revealed many known and novel viruses in bat samples (

However, the most valuable information, such as the sampling time, location, bats species and specimen type, is available only sporadically in related literature or individual sequence records. Obtaining comprehensive information on bat-associated viruses becomes a formidable task. Therefore, we developed the database of bat-associated viruses (DBatVir), a comprehensive, up-to-date and well-curated repository of bat-associated animal viruses.
