<p>As of January 2014, DBatVir collects information on 4176 bat-associated animal viruses of 23 virus families detected from 196 bat species in 69 countries worldwide. These data will give us an overview of the depth of viral richness observed in bats and provide substantial grist for future attempts to assess and predict epidemic risks. More extensive surveillance in other species of bats and at other geographic locations may be needed to identify more viruses with the potential to cause human diseases or novel viruses related to known human pathogens. To our knowledge, DBatVir is the only publicly available web resource dedicated to bat-associated animal viruses thus far. It devotes to provide comprehensive, up-to-date and well-curated information to the scientific community worldwide. DBatVir will not only be helpful to virologists who want to better understand the virome diversity of bats but will also be useful to zoologists concerned with the health of domestic and wild animals. Furthermore, this database is particularly valuable to epidemiologists and public health researchers, as it is beneficial in the monitoring and tracking of current and future emerging zoonotic diseases.</p>
