<p>The ability to predict and prevent viral epidemics has become a major objective in the public health disciplines. Effective prediction of future viral zoonoses requires an in-depth understanding of the heterologous viral population in key animal species that will likely serve as reservoir hosts or intermediates during the next viral epidemic (

Moreover, the past decade has experienced a surge in the discovery of emerging viruses of bat origin, several of which have had a significant impact on public health, tourism and trade. Therefore, it is important to catalog as comprehensively as possible the animal viruses present in bats.
