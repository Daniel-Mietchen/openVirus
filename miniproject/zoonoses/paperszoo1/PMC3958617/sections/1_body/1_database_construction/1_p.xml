<p>Molecular methods are now commonly used in the diagnosis and functional analyses of viruses; thus, DBatVir is built as a sequence-centric database. To retrieve all known sequences of bat-associated animal viruses from the public domain, we performed exhaustive searches in both the PubMed and Nucleotide databases of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the keyword ‘(bat OR bats) AND (virus OR viruses)’. The related GenBank records were then downloaded and parsed using in-house BioPerl scripts to generate readable profiles for further expert review (
 <xref rid="bau021-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Sequences of phages, insect and plant viruses, as well as samples derived from animals other than bats, were manually excluded. The associated metadata of each sequence, such as the sampling time, location, bat species, specimen type (e.g. feces, blood or tissues) and viral detection method (e.g. polymerase chain reaction or metagenomics), were further extracted from the related literature (if available) or the original GenBank records. Taxonomic information of all viruses and bats were retrieved from the Taxonomy database of NCBI. Additional information concerning the viruses, such as genome organization, average size and virion illustrations, and the bats, including common names, diet type and geographic distribution, were further collected from the ViralZone database (

 <xref rid="bau021-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), were also carefully integrated into the database.
