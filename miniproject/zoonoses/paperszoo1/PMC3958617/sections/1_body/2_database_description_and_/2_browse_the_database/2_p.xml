<p>To provide an intuitive overview of the geographic distribution of current data, a global map with markers color-coded by number of bat-associated viruses detected in each country is also available (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bau021-F1">Figure 1</xref>D). Moreover, a submenu with a geographic category organized by continents and countries is provided in the menu panel for convenient regional bat-associated virus analyses. Each country/continent name offers a direct link to the respective tab in the content panel showing detailed information of the bat-associated viruses detected in corresponding region. It is particularly helpful to investigate the potential distribution bias of bat-associated viruses in different regions. For example, to date, 570 and 553 bat-associated viruses were detected from 19 counties of Africa and 17 countries of Europe, respectively. Though the general data are similar between the two continents, 18 virus families are found in bats from Africa, with 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> as the most predominant family (36%), whereas only 10 virus families are reported in bats from Europe and the principal family is 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic> (56%) (
