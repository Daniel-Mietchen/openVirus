<p>Users can browse the database content by the categories of viruses or bats using the submenus with the respective taxonomic tree in the menu panel. The hierarchical taxonomic trees show virus/bat families by default for brevity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bau021-F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Each branch of the trees can be further expanded to show genera or species with a single click. Direct links to individual tabs in the content panel are given for each branch of the trees in the submenus. The main content panel presents a uniform grid for each tab that includes brief information on the viruses (species and family), specimens (sample type, collection date and sampling country), associated bats (species, family and diet type), determined sequences and related literature (exemplified in the right panel of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bau021-F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Each line of the table is expandable with a double click to show additional information, such as virus detection method, detailed sampling location, GenBank accessions and length of related sequences. Furthermore, a clickable linear map is offered for each complete viral sequence to highlight the genomic organization of the virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bau021-F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Handy buttons are provided on the bottom toolbar to export the grid as local Excel tables or to download the related sequences in FASTA format for further offline analyses. Browsing the data by virus and bat taxonomic categories is valuable to understand the host range of viruses and virome diversity of bats. For instance, from current data, the most widely distributed virus among bats is coronavirus, which has been detected from all the 10 bat families studied to date (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="bau021-T1">Table 1</xref>). The bat family 
 <italic>Vespertilionidae</italic> has been involved in 20 of the 23 virus families detected in bats so far (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="bau021-T1">Table 1</xref>). It is reasonable given the fact that 
 <italic>Vespertilionidae</italic> is the biggest family of bats containing &gt;40 genera.
