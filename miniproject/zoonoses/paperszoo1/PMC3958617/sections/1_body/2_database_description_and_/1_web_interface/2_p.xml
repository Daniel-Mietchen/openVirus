<p>The quality of web interface is considered one of the most important aspects of a good database. We built a highly responsive and intuitive user interface by advanced JavaScript programming to provide users with the look and feel of a desktop application rather than a traditional web page. For example, all information tables are fully sortable and filterable with a single click on the column title, and each column is also movable and scalable (or hidden) by dragging and dropping it on the title. In addition, with a single click on the column title, a statistical pie chart of the selected information is available for easy online analyses (
