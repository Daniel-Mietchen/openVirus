<p>The major utilities of the database, including database browsing/searching and live data statistics, as well as a detailed help document, are highlighted on the homepage by clickable icons with direct links to the respective main page. To offer a user-friendly interface, all information from the database is presented in a single desktop-like main page. A multifunctional menu panel is provided on the left side of the main page for easy navigation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bau021-F1">Figure 1</xref>A), and this panel can be collapsed into a clickable vertical bar to maximize the visible section of the content panel on the right side (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bau021-F1">Figure 1</xref>C). The menu panel includes several submenus for users to browse the data by categories of viruses, bats or regions (see below). The content panel can handle multiple independent pages as different tabs in the panel, which behaves like an Excel workbook that contains multiple sheets (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bau021-F1">Figure 1</xref>D). Any new information requested by the users is presented in an individual tab in the content panel to avoid the unnecessary refresh of entire main page. In addition, the previously viewed content pages are hidden as inactive tabs rather than closed; thus, users can easily return to any previous content by clicking on the respective tab title to reactive it instantly without any redundant data reload.
