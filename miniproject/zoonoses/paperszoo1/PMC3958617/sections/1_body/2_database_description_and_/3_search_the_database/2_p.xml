<p>The text search enables extracting virus information using any querying keywords. For a quick start, a single entry that is instantly familiar to users of common Internet search engines is offered. In addition, a configurable query form is available for advanced users to perform customized complex searches of all information in the database (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bau021-F1">Figure 1</xref>B). The search results are displayed in an individual tab in the content panel with explicit tables of bat-associated viruses matching the query. The result table is a high-performance grid as aforementioned, which enables instant sorting, filtering and table/sequences downloading, as well as easy online statistical analyses on the query output. Thus, the text search utility is not only useful to quickly extract required information but also valuable to make specialized analyses on any customized subset of the data from the database. For example, both feces and swabs are widely investigated samples of bats, and &gt;500 viruses were detected from either type of samples worldwide. However, the viruses detected from swabs involve 17 virus families, whereas those from feces are limited to 11 families. It is noteworthy that swabs are a generic sample type that include fecal swabs, rectal swabs, oral swabs, nasal swabs and others. But many studies mixed different kinds of swabs (or even different types of samples) for easy virus detection. So researchers should be more specific in any cross-study comparative analysis and more cautious in follow-up data interpretation.
