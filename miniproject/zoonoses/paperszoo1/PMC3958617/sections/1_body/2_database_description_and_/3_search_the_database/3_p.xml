<p>Sequence similarity searches within the database are available using the configurable BLAST submission form in the search panel. Users can perform sequence comparison against all bat-associated virus sequences (nucleic acid or amino acid) in the database or limit their searches within sequences from complete genomes for brevity. The searching output is present in the BLAST result tab in the content panel. Cross-links to the corresponding sequences in GenBank and DBatVir are provided for all hits in the output. The genetic diversity of newly emerged bat-associated viruses is always one of the interesting focuses. For instance, four to five genetically distinct virus strains of henipaviruses have been detected with different virological and biological properties (
 <xref rid="bau021-B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Therefore, to facilitate follow-up sequence analyses, an integrated pipeline for online multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction based on the BLAST result is also provided. Users can customize the sequences to be included in follow-up phylogenetic analyses according to their similarities with the query sequence to avoid potential redundancy. The produced multiple alignment and phylogenetic tree can be easily displayed online or downloaded for further offline analyses.
