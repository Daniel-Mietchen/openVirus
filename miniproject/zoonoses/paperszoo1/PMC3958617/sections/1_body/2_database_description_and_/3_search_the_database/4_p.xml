<p>Knowledge of viral hosts enables the identification of maintenance populations from which epidemics may emerge (
 <xref rid="bau021-B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). To bridge the gap between virologists and zoologists, the information concerning the bats, such as the common names, diet type and known distribution, as well as the phylogeny of bats are carefully integrated into DBatVir. All bat-related information are presented in a sortable and filterable table, along with example photos of each bat species and useful external links for convenient access to additional information (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bau021-F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Users can use the search entry on the bottom toolbar to quickly extract the information of interested bats by name, diet type or distributed country. Moreover, an intuitive global map with markers indicating the known distributed countries of each bat species is available for users to easily understand the distribution range of the bat. Good knowledge of bats is essential for better interpretation of the data on bat-associated viruses. For example, the incongruent associations between the phylogenies of bats and their SARS-related coronaviruses revealed recent host shifts, which may assist in understanding the emergence of SARS (
 <xref rid="bau021-B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Majority of bats are insectivores, and most of the rest are frugivores. The current data show that the predominant virus families detected in insectivorous and frugivorous bats are 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>, respectively. This implies the potential association between bat's diet and the associated virome.
