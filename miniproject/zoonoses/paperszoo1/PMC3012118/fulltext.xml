The biological characterization of these wild-type and mutant NAs was analyzed by pseudotyped particles (pseudoparticles) system. Compared with the wild-type AH N1, the wild-type 09N1 exhibited higher NA activity and released more pseudoparticles. Deletion/insertion of the 09s60 segment did not alter this relationship. The infectivity of pseudoparticles harboring NA in combination with the hemagglutinin from HPAI H5N1 (AH H5) was decreased by insertion of 09s60 into AH N1 and was increased by deletion of 09s60 from 09N1. When isolated from the wild-type 2009H1N1 virus, 09N1 existed in the forms (in order of abundance) dimer&#x0003e;&#x0003e;tetramer&#x0003e;monomer, but when isolated from pseudoparticles, 09N1 existed in the forms dimer&#x0003e;monomer&#x0003e;&#x0003e;&#x0003e;tetramer. After deletion of 09s60, 09N1 existed in the forms monomer&#x0003e;&#x0003e;&#x0003e;dimer. AH N1 from pseudoparticles existed in the forms monomer&#x0003e;&#x0003e;dimer, but after insertion of 09s60, it existed in the forms dimer&#x0003e;&#x0003e;monomer. Deletion/insertion of 09s60 did not alter the NA glycosylation pattern of 09N1 or AH N1. The 09N1 was more sensitive than the AH N1 to the NA inhibitor oseltamivir, suggesting that the infectivity-enhancing effect of oseltamivir correlates with robust NA activity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza A viruses cause seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics <xref rid="pone.0015825-Horimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015825-Knipe1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015825-Palese1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The outbreak of a novel H1N1 influenza strain became a major global issue in April 2009 and, to date, this virus, here designated 2009H1N1, has been detected in 214 countries and has caused 17,919 deaths <xref rid="pone.0015825-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In addition, a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus has been circulating in Europe and Asia for more than a decade and has spread to more than 60 countries; thus far, it has infected 486 humans and killed 287 of them <xref rid="pone.0015825-WHO2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Although reports of human-to-human HPAI H5N1 transmission are rare, its high lethality has raised considerable concern worldwide.</p><p>Influenza viruses contain eight negative-sense single-stranded RNA segments that together encode 11 proteins <xref rid="pone.0015825-Knipe1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Two of these proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), are large glycoproteins found on viral envelope <xref rid="pone.0015825-Horimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015825-Knipe1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015825-vonItzstein1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. HA mediates binding of the virus to host cell receptors and promotes entry of the viral genome into the target cell through membrane fusion, whereas NA cleaves terminal sialic acids from oligosaccharide side-chain receptors that bind the mature progeny virus particles, thereby releasing them from infected cells, and regulates virus entry <xref rid="pone.0015825-Knipe1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. HA and NA are also human antigens; the host immune responses to these proteins are used to classify influenza A viruses into 16 HA subtypes and nine NA subtypes (hence the &#x0201c;H#N#&#x0201d; designation for influenza A serotypes) <xref rid="pone.0015825-Horimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015825-Knipe1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. HA is a trimeric, rod-shaped molecule that is anchored in the viral membrane by its carboxyl (C)-terminus; cleavage of the HA precursor molecule (HA0) into two subunits (HA1 and HA2) is required for full activity <xref rid="pone.0015825-Horimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015825-Knipe1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015825-Doms1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015825-Skehel1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

The evolution of influenza HA and NA proteins has been monitored closely in recent years and has revealed significant variation in the NA stalk region <xref rid="pone.0015825-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0015825-Rambaut1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Based on their sequences, NA stalk regions have been divided into six types <xref rid="pone.0015825-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Compared to the A/Gs/Gd/1/96/H5N1-like stalk region, the A/WSN/33/H1N1-like stalk region has a 16-amino acid (aa) deletion of residues 57&#x02013;72, A/Puerto Rico/8/34/H1N1-like has 15-aa deletion of residues 63&#x02013;77, A/Hong Kong/156/97/H5N1-like has a 19-aa deletion of residues 54&#x02013;72, A/chicken/Italy/1067/99/H7N1-like has 22-aa deletion of residues 54&#x02013;75, and A/chicken/Hubei/327/2004/H5N1-like has a 20-aa deletion of residues 49&#x02013;68 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The extent of these deletions appears to have increased gradually; however, the biological impacts of variations in the NA stalk are not yet clear.</p><p>Studies of the A/WSN/33/H1N1 strain have shown that its biology has not been altered significantly by accumulating deletions and insertions <xref rid="pone.0015825-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.

Our previous studies showed that the NA activity of A/Ohio/07/2009/H1N1 was much higher than that of HPAI H5N1 (A/Anhui/1/2005) and that this increased activity is a key reason that the NA inhibitor oseltamivir enhances the infectivity of 2009H1N1 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>In our previous study, a primary sequence alignment revealed a 20-aa (60-bp) deletion in the stalk region of HPAI H5N1 (A/Anhui/1/2005) NA relative to that of 2009H1N1 NA <xref rid="pone.0015825-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Here, we examined the precise role of NA, and particularly its stalk region, in influenza A virus assembly, release, and entry, by deleting the 20-aa segment (residues 49&#x02013;68) from the stalk region of 2009H1N1 NA, and inserted this segment, designated 09s60, into the stalk region of H5N1 NA. We then made HA/NA pseudoparticles containing all possible combinations of each HA with each wild-type and mutant NA. The pseudoparticles were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy, virion quantification; hemagglutination, NA, and infectivity assays; and Western blot analysis of HA and NA expression in pseudoparticles producer cells and incorporation into pseudoparticles. The effect of oseltamivir on these pseudoparticles was also assessed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>For pseudotyping, A549 targeting cells and 293T human embryo kidney pesudoparticle producer cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with or without 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Construction of NA and HA expression plasmids</title><p>The cDNA fragments encoding full-length NA (A/Ohio/07/2009, the most early released NA sequence of 2009 H1N1 which without aa difference with that of A/California/05/2009/H1N1 isolate) and HA (A/California/05/2009) proteins from 2009 pandemic H1N1 and HPAI H5N1 (A/Anhui/1/2005) were cloned into the expression plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015825-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) as reported previously <xref rid="pone.0015825-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0015825-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

One of the notable differences between the H5N1 and 2009H1N1 NA proteins was that the 09N1 contained a 20-aa (60-bp) &#x0201c;insertion&#x0201d; in its stalk region relative to the AH N1 stalk region. This 20-aa segment of 09N1, designated s60 or 09s60, was deleted from 09N1 to generate 09N1-s60 and inserted into AH N1 to generate AH N1&#x0002b;09s60. Due to lacking of antibody against AN NA, a 6&#x000d7;His-coding sequence [(ATG)<sub>6</sub>] was added to the C-terminal ends of the AH N1 and AH N1&#x0002b;09s60 coding sequences to facilitate Western blot analysis.</p><fig id="pone-0015825-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0015825.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Diagrams of HA/NA expression plasmids, GagPol-encoding plasmid, and CMV&#x02013;GFP reporter plasmid, and transmission electron microscope observation.</title><p>A.

Eight types of pseudoparticles were made.

Together with the transmission electron microscopy observation, our data suggest that the AH H5 and 09H1 HA proteins are incorporated with similar efficiency into all pseudotype combinations and that the s60 insertion/deletion does not affect this efficiency.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015825-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, the molecular mass of the 09N1 NA protein in pseudoparticles harboring 09H1 or AH H5 was identical to that of the NA from wild-type 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus; the monomer and dimer molecular masses were &#x0223c;60 and &#x0223c;120 kDa, respectively. The molecular mass of the 09N1-s60 NA protein in pseudoparticles harboring 09H1 or AH H5 was &#x0223c;50 kDa. The 09N1 and 09N1-s60 proteins exhibited similar incorporation efficiencies with 09H1 and AH H5, suggesting that the incorporation of 09N1 was unaffected by the s60 deletion in its stalk region. Similarly, when expressed with 09H1 and AH H5, the molecular masses of AH N1 and AH N1&#x0002b;09s60 were &#x0223c;50 and &#x0223c;60 kDa, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015825-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). These proteins exhibited similar incorporation efficiencies in AH H5- and 09H1-containing pseudoparticles, suggesting that the incorporation of AH N1 NA was unaffected by the s60 insertion.</p><p>Notably, the NA proteins lacking s60, the 20-aa stalk segment (AH N1 and 09N1-s60), produced almost no dimers, whereas the NA proteins containing s60 (09N1 and AH N1&#x0002b;09s60) existed primarily as dimers; thus, the 20-aa segment appears to be the critical domain for dimer formation and does not seem to affect glycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015825-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this report, we focused on the NA enzymes of two influenza A virus strains that have had catastrophic effects, HPAI H5N1 and pandemic 2009H1N1. This latter virus originated in birds, jumped to swine, and then became the human pandemic strain 2009H1N1 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0015825-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015825-Neumann1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. H5N1 jumped to humans directly from birds <xref rid="pone.0015825-Shu1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The NAs of both of these viruses display human host adaptations, but of the two, 09N1 is more robust and is thus more efficient at viral release. During the 2009H1N1 entry stage, 09N1 might be a powerful &#x0201c;block&#x0201d; against viral entry, thus making the virus sensitive to oseltamivir. Although many virologists believe that NA is tetrameric <xref rid="pone.0015825-Horimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015825-Knipe1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015825-Castrucci1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015825-Collins1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015825-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, we found that the 09N1 protein of the wild-type virus was primarily dimeric, although some of it was tetrameric form, and a much smaller amount was monomeric western blot analysis. Interestingly, although 09N1 in pseudoparticles was also primarily dimeric, a substantial fraction of it was monomeric, and very little was tetrameric western blot analysis.</p><p>Like the AH N1 NA protein, the 09N1-s60 NA protein, which lacks a 20-aa segment (residues 49&#x02013;68; designated s60) of the 09N1 stalk region, was primarily monomeric, with a small amount of the dimeric form. When the s60 segment of 09N1 was inserted into the AH N1 stalk region, the resulting AH N1&#x0002b;09s60 protein was primarily dimeric, with some of the monomeric form also present. Thus, the stalk region is critical for dimer formation, which may occur <italic>via</italic> oxidation of Cys49, and the dimer is the major functional unit of NA. Unlike HA, NA was poorly glycosylated despite the presence of as many as five potential glycosylation sites, including the four sites in the 20-aa stalk region.</p><p>Of the 29 aas in the NA transmembrane domains, there are 8 aas difference (27.5&#x00025;) which is much higher than the that of other regions, although reports indicated that the transmembrane domain of NA was critical in apical transport <xref rid="pone.0015825-Kundu1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015825-Barman1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, as far as we know, no report showed that the transmembrane domain was critical for pseudoparticle's budding. At the budding stage, pseudoparticles were secreted by the gag-pol protein derived from murine leukemia virus, the NA could only help pseudoparticle release by cleaving terminal sialic acids from oligosaccharide side-chain receptors that bind the HA. The more activity of NA, the more pseudoparticles released. Of the NA activity, 09 NA is almost 100 times higher than that of AH NA, the extreme high NA activity of 2009 pandemic H1N1 NA was confirmed by our previous reports <xref rid="pone.0015825-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015825-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Together with our NA incorporation analysis, the NA activity is determined by the character of each NA, particular the ectodomain not the transmembrane domain.</p><p>Comparison of all of the native and mismatched pseudoparticles showed that those harboring AH H5 had a much higher infectivity than those harboring 09H1. This finding suggests that the HPAI H5N1 virus also has a high infectivity, and this characteristic may underlie the dire clinical outcomes of H5N1-infected patients. Of the AH H5-harboring pseudoparticles, higher infectivity was observed for AH H5::AH N1 than for AH H5::AH N1&#x0002b;09s60, and higher infectivity was observed for AH H5::09N1-s60 than for AH H5::09N1, suggesting that AH H5 partners more effectively with NA proteins that have a short stalk or that exist as monomers. Of the lower infectivity of all pseudoparticles harboring 09HA, the diversity in glycosylation might be a reason since we observed that HA2 of our pseudoparticles was poorly glycosylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015825-g007">Figure 7B</xref> right). We did not observe any influence of the NA stalk on the infectivity of 09H1-harboring pseudoparticles, but we cannot discount the possibility that any such influence might have been masked by the lower infectivity of 09H1.</p><p>When we compared the NA activities of all eight pseudoparticle combinations of AH H5 and 09H1 with 09N1, 09N1-s60, AH N1, and AH N1&#x0002b;09s60, we found that the s60 insertion or deletion did not appear to affect NA activity except when AH H5 was combined with 09N1. Because of this confusion, we doubled the methodology; the NA-Star NA Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit is extremely sensitive and hence lacks the desired reproducibility and specificity.</p><p>Oseltamivir is a NA inhibitor designed to bind to the putative NA tetramer <xref rid="pone.0015825-Collins1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, our current data demonstrate that the NA of the wild-type 2009 pandemic H1N1 is primarily dimeric and that it exists in both dimeric and monomeric forms in pseudoparticles. This finding, in conjunction with our previous finding that NA dramatically inhibits NA activity <xref rid="pone.0015825-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, casts doubt upon the accepted pharmacologic mechanism of action of oseltamivir. We previously noted that oseltamivir boosts the infectivity of influenza virus <xref rid="pone.0015825-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>; the present comparison of NA activities in pseudoparticles pairing AH H5 and 09H1 partnered with native and mismatched NA proteins shows clearly that the infectivity-enhancing effect of oseltamivir correlates positively with the NA activity. Therefore, we feel we must again raise an alarm concerning the use of oseltamivir to treat influenza A in clinical practice: when the patient's lung has a high viral load, oseltamivir administration might enhance the infectivity of the virus, particularly if the virus has a high NA activity to begin with. The resulting robust pulmonary immune response could result in unexpected lung failure.</p><p>Retrovirus-based influenza HA/NA pseudoparticle systems have been demonstrated to accurately represent the biology of the corresponding wild-type viruses <xref rid="pone.0015825-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0015825-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015825-Bian1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015825-Lin2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. For research on HPAI viruses, the use of pseudoparticle systems eliminates not only routine biosafety issues but also the possibility of production of a manmade, highly pathogenic virus. Pseudoparticles containing only HA and NA provide a convenient model for research on HA/NA matching patterns, viral release, viral entry, neutralizing antibodies, and many other biological features involving HA and NA. Although this system cannot completely represent the entire virus generated by reverse genetics, it has provided us with a safe and convenient platform for our HA/NA studies.</p><p>Due to the lacking of antibody against AH NA, we added a 6 x His-encoding sequence to the C-terminal ends of the AH NA and AH N1&#x0002b;09s60 coding sequence to facilitate Western blot analysis. We have assessed any possible influence of His tag on NA's function, there was no difference in NA activity and cooperation with HA between the pseudoparticles harboring NAs with or without His tag (data not showed).</p><p>The HAs of HPAI viruses have multiple basic amino acids at their cleavage sites (RERRRKKR) and are cleaved by ubiquitous proteases in a wide range of organs, resulting in lethal systemic infection <xref rid="pone.0015825-Horimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. We observed that pseudoparticles harboring AH H5 were more infective than those harboring 09H1, but whether the presence of the HPAI HA cleavage site enhances the infectivity of HPAI H5N1 viruses is unknown. We are currently performing experiments to address this issue.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Sino Biological Inc., AbMax Biotechnology Co., Ltd., and Prof. Mifang Liang for providing us antibodies.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>This study was supported by the 863 Hi-Tech Research and Development Program of the People's Republic of China (#2007AA02Z157), the State Special Key Program on Infectious Diseases of China (#2009ZX10004-711), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC#30970159), and the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (Y2101159).
