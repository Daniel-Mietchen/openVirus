<p>The pseudoparticles were assayed for hemagglutination activity. The normalized pseudoparticle samples were serially diluted 1∶2 in PBS in microplate wells (50 µL/well). Next, 50-µL aliquots of turkey red blood cells (1% suspension) were added to each well. Hemagglutination was scored 30 min later.</p>
