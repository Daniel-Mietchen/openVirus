<p>The cDNA fragments encoding full-length NA (A/Ohio/07/2009, the most early released NA sequence of 2009 H1N1 which without aa difference with that of A/California/05/2009/H1N1 isolate) and HA (A/California/05/2009) proteins from 2009 pandemic H1N1 and HPAI H5N1 (A/Anhui/1/2005) were cloned into the expression plasmids (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015825-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) as reported previously 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The H5N1-derived HA and NA were designated AH H5 and AH N1, respectively, and the 2009H1N1-derived HA and NA were designated 09H1 and 09N1, respectively. One of the notable differences between the H5N1 and 2009H1N1 NA proteins was that the 09N1 contained a 20-aa (60-bp) “insertion” in its stalk region relative to the AH N1 stalk region. This 20-aa segment of 09N1, designated s60 or 09s60, was deleted from 09N1 to generate 09N1-s60 and inserted into AH N1 to generate AH N1+09s60. Due to lacking of antibody against AN NA, a 6×His-coding sequence [(ATG)
 <sub>6</sub>] was added to the C-terminal ends of the AH N1 and AH N1+09s60 coding sequences to facilitate Western blot analysis.
