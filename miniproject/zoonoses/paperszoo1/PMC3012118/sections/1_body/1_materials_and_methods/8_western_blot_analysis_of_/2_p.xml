<p>To evaluate HA and NA incorporation into pseudoparticles and to assess the possible influence of NA mutations as well as partner mismatches on HA incorporation, the pseudoparticles were concentrated and purified using a standard protocol. Then, 10
 <sup>9</sup> copies of each pseudoparticle were mixed with 4× LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen), heated to 100°C for 5 min, and analyzed by Western blotting as described below.
