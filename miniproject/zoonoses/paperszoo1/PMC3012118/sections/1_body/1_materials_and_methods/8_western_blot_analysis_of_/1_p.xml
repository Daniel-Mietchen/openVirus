<p>The expression of HA and NA in 293T producer cells was analyzed after pseudoparticle harvesting. Cells in 6-well plates were washed twice with PBS to remove residual culture medium and then lysed in a 500 µL/well of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). After centrifugation to remove cell debris, 20 µL of each cell lysate sample was mixed with 4× LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen), heated to 100°C for 5 min, and analyzed by Western blotting as described below.</p>
