<p>For Western blot analysis, the prepared cell lysate and pseudoparticle samples (in non-reduced condition) were subjected to electrophoresis on 12% NuPage gels (Invitrogen). After electrophoresis, the separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Pall Corp., Port Washington, NY) using a semi-dry transfer method. For HA and NA detection, the membranes were blocked with skim milk overnight at 4°C. They were then incubated with a primary antibody against 09H1 (Sino Biological Inc, Beijing, China), AH H5 (Dr. Mifang Liang), 09N1 (AbMax Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China), or 6×His-Tag (mouse monoclonal antibody from CWBIO, Beijing, China) for 1.5 h at room temperature. After three washes in PBS, the membranes were incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 20 min at room temperature and washed three times in PBS. NA and HA were then visualized using a DAB Substrate Kit (Vector Laboratories).</p>
