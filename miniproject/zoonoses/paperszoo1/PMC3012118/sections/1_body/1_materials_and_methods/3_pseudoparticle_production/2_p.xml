<p>At 72 h post-transfection, pseudoparticles were harvested from the transfected cell culture media by filtration through a 0.45-µm Durapore polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane filter (Millipore Ireland, Cork, Ireland). For quantification, purified pseudoparticles were treated with 0.24 U/ml DNase and RNase at 37°C for 1 h to eliminate any contaminating DNA and RNA and then frozen at –70°C to inactivate the DNase and RNase. The pseudoparticles were then treated with proteinase K (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at 40°C for 30 min to digest the envelope proteins and release the CMV–GFP RNA. The proteinase K was inactivated at 100°C for 2 min.</p>
