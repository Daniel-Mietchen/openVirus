<p>The amount of CMV–GFP RNA in each pseudoparticle was quantified by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription (qRT)–PCR using the forward primer 
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′-CCCGTGAGTCAAACCGCTAT-3′</named-content>, the reverse primer 
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′-GTGATGCGGTTTTGGCAGTA-3′</named-content>, and the probe 5′-FAM-
 <named-content content-type="gene">CCACGCCCATTGATG</named-content>-NFQ-3′, where FAM is the fluorescent dye 6-carboxy-fluorescein and NFQ is a non-fluorescent quencher. The assay was carried out on an ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with a PrimeScript One Step RT–PCR Kit (Takara, Japan). Pseudoparticles were normalized for RNA copy number before infectivity, hemagglutination, and NA activity assays, and Western blot analysis of the HA and NA expression and incorporation.
