<p>As we reported previously 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, pseudoparticles were produced by transfecting 293T cells with four plasmids: an HA expression plasmid, an NA expression plasmid, a GagPol-encoding plasmid, and a cytomegalovirus (CMV)–green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter plasmid (for details, please see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015825-g001">Figure 1A, B, and C</xref>). Eight types of pseudoparticles were made. Those containing HA and NA from the same virus (
 <italic>e.g</italic>., AH H5::AH N1 and 09H1::09N1) were considered “native,” and those containing HA and NA of different viruses (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, AH H5::09N1 and 09H1::AH N1) were considered “mismatched”. A pseudoparticle containing a mutant NA could be either a “native mutant” (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, AH H5::AH N1+09s60) or a “mismatched mutant” (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, AH H5::09N1-s60), depending on whether the AH and NA came from the same (native) or different (mismatched) viruses.
