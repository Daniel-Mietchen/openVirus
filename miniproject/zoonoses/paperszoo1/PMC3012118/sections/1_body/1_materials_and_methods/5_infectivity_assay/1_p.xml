<p>Pseudoparticles were assayed for infectivity as reported previously 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Briefly, pseudoparticles (normalized for RNA copy number) were diluted 1:1 in 100 µL of DMEM. To infect cells, the cell culture medium was removed and replaced with the diluted pseudoparticle suspension. The plate was allowed to stand for 4 h, and the pseudoparticle suspension was removed and replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. At 72 h post-infection, the infected cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The number of GFP reporter-positive cells was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (BD FACSAria; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ).
