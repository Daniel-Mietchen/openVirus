<p>The NA activity of the 09N1, 09N1-s60, AH N1, and AH N1+09s60 proteins was assayed using an NA-Star Influenza Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit (Applied Biosystems). All reagents were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. For each sample, normalized pseudoparticles were diluted 1∶1 in NA-Star Assay buffer, incubated with 10 µL of NA-Star chemiluminescent substrate for 30 min at room temperature, and analyzed using a luminometer (2103 Envision Multilabel Reader; Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA).</p>
