<p>Influenza viruses contain eight negative-sense single-stranded RNA segments that together encode 11 proteins 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Knipe1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Two of these proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), are large glycoproteins found on viral envelope 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Horimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Knipe1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-vonItzstein1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. HA mediates binding of the virus to host cell receptors and promotes entry of the viral genome into the target cell through membrane fusion, whereas NA cleaves terminal sialic acids from oligosaccharide side-chain receptors that bind the mature progeny virus particles, thereby releasing them from infected cells, and regulates virus entry 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Knipe1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. HA and NA are also human antigens; the host immune responses to these proteins are used to classify influenza A viruses into 16 HA subtypes and nine NA subtypes (hence the “H#N#” designation for influenza A serotypes) 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Horimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Knipe1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. HA is a trimeric, rod-shaped molecule that is anchored in the viral membrane by its carboxyl (C)-terminus; cleavage of the HA precursor molecule (HA0) into two subunits (HA1 and HA2) is required for full activity 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Horimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Knipe1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Doms1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Skehel1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. NA is a mushroom-shaped tetramer of monomers that contain four structural domains: a cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain, a stalk, and a globular head 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Knipe1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Castrucci1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Collins1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The evolution of influenza HA and NA proteins has been monitored closely in recent years and has revealed significant variation in the NA stalk region 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Rambaut1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Based on their sequences, NA stalk regions have been divided into six types 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Compared to the A/Gs/Gd/1/96/H5N1-like stalk region, the A/WSN/33/H1N1-like stalk region has a 16-amino acid (aa) deletion of residues 57–72, A/Puerto Rico/8/34/H1N1-like has 15-aa deletion of residues 63–77, A/Hong Kong/156/97/H5N1-like has a 19-aa deletion of residues 54–72, A/chicken/Italy/1067/99/H7N1-like has 22-aa deletion of residues 54–75, and A/chicken/Hubei/327/2004/H5N1-like has a 20-aa deletion of residues 49–68 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The extent of these deletions appears to have increased gradually; however, the biological impacts of variations in the NA stalk are not yet clear.
