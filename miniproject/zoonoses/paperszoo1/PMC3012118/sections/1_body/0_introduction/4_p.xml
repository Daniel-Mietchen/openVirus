<p>In our previous study, a primary sequence alignment revealed a 20-aa (60-bp) deletion in the stalk region of HPAI H5N1 (A/Anhui/1/2005) NA relative to that of 2009H1N1 NA 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Here, we examined the precise role of NA, and particularly its stalk region, in influenza A virus assembly, release, and entry, by deleting the 20-aa segment (residues 49â€“68) from the stalk region of 2009H1N1 NA, and inserted this segment, designated 09s60, into the stalk region of H5N1 NA. We then made HA/NA pseudoparticles containing all possible combinations of each HA with each wild-type and mutant NA. The pseudoparticles were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy, virion quantification; hemagglutination, NA, and infectivity assays; and Western blot analysis of HA and NA expression in pseudoparticles producer cells and incorporation into pseudoparticles. The effect of oseltamivir on these pseudoparticles was also assessed.
