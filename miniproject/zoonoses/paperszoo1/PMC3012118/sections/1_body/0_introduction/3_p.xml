<p>Studies of the A/WSN/33/H1N1 strain have shown that its biology has not been altered significantly by accumulating deletions and insertions

 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Matsuoka1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Our previous studies showed that the NA activity of A/Ohio/07/2009/H1N1 was much higher than that of HPAI H5N1 (A/Anhui/1/2005) and that this increased activity is a key reason that the NA inhibitor oseltamivir enhances the infectivity of 2009H1N1
