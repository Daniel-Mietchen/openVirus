<p>Despite the considerable amount of variation known to exist in the NA stalk region, little research has focused on the effects of these variations on NA activity. Therefore, we examined the NA activity of 09N1, 09N1-s60, AH N1, and AH N1+09s60 not only in their native combinations (AH H5::AH N1, AH H5::AH N1+09s60, 09H1::09N1, and 09H1::09N1-s60) but also in mismatched pseudoparticles (09H1::AH N1, 09H1::AH N1+09s60, AH H5::09N1, and AH H5::09N1-s60). As we reported previously, the NA activity of 09N1 was much higher than that of AH N1 (17, 18). When combined with AH H5, AH N1 and AH N1+09s60 exhibited NA activities of 42310±3335 and 46580±7054 chemiluminescent units, respectively, indicating that the 20-aa insertion had little effect on AH N1 activity (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.340). The insertion also had little effect when AH N1 and AH N1+09s60 were combined with 09H1; the resulting NA activities were 16770±6573 and 14230±7636 chemiluminescent units, respectively (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.231). AH N1 and AH N1+09s60 exhibited higher activity in native pseudoparticles (those harboring AH H5) than in mismatched pseudoparticles (those harboring 09H1; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001;
