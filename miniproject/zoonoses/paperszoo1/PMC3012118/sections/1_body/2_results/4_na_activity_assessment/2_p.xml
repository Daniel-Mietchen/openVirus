<p>When combined with AH H5, 09N1 and 09N1-s60 exhibited NA activities of 1373620±478097 and 1657100±598128 chemiluminescent units, respectively, indicating that the 20-aa deletion significantly increased the activity of 09N1 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.011). However, when combined with 09H1, the deletion in 09N1 did not significantly alter its activity; in this case, 09N1 and 09N1-s60 had NA activities of 2367470±698727 and 2518920±619100 chemiluminescent units, respectively (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.172). The NA activities of 09N1 and 09N1-s60 were higher in combination with 09H1 than with AH H5 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015825-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, right), again indicating a higher activity in the native pseudoparticles than in the mismatched pseudoparticles.
