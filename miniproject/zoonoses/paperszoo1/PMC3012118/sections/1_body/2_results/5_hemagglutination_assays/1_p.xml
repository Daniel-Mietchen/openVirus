<p>To examine the influence of the wild-type and mutant NA proteins on their partner HA proteins, the pseudoparticles were normalized for RNA copy number and assayed for hemagglutination activity, as described previously 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The mean HA titers were similar for all native, mismatched, and mutant combinations of AH H5 (AH H5::AH N1, AH H5::AH N1+09s60, AH H5:09N1, and AH H5:09N1-s60; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015825-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, left), indicating that neither the viral origin of the NA partner nor the NA deletion/insertion mutation affected the hemagglutination ability of AH H5. For combinations of 09H1 (09H1::AH N1, 09H1::AH N1+09s60, 09H1::09N1, and 09H1::09N1-s60), the mean HA titers were somewhat higher with 09N1 and 09N1-s60 than with AH N1 and AH N1+09s60, but neither the deletion in 09N1 nor the insertion into AH N1 caused a significant change in the hemagglutination titer (
