<p>For the mismatched 09H1 pseudoparticles, the infectivities of the wild-type (09H1::AH N1; 2.75±1.91%) and mutant (09H1::AH N1+09s60; 4.70±3.37%) pseudoparticles were similar (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015825-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). In contrast, the mismatched AH H5 pseudoparticles differed in infectivity; that of the mutant (AH H5::09N1-s60; 11.05±5.07%) was significantly higher than that of the wild-type (AH H5::09N1; 4.02±3.18%) pseudoparticle (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.007; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015825-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). This result indicates that the deletion of s60 from 09N1 increased the viral infectivity of the mismatched AH H5::09N1 pseudoparticle. The control H5 and H1 pseudoparticles, which were generated without NA, exhibited the lowest infectivities (1.22±0.25 and 0.75±0.16%, respectively;
