<p>To more closely examine the role of NA, and the NA stalk in particular, we determined the infectivity of pseudoparticles containing the eight native and mismatched combinations of HA and wild-type or mutant NA. The pseudoparticles were normalized to a virus titer of 1Ã—10
 <sup>4</sup> copies per targeting cell before assaying.
