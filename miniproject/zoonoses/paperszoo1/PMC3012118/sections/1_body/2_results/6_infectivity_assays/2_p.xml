<p>The infectivity of the native wild-type combination AH H5::AH N1 was 76.0±18.6%, a value almost 40 times that of the other native wild-type combination (09H1::09N1), which had an infectivity of 1.95±1.48% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015825-g005">Fig. 5</xref>; blue bars). The infectivity of the native mutant combination AH H5::AH N1+09s60 (58.4±22.3%) was significantly lower than that of the native wild-type combination AH H5::AH N1 (76.0±18.6%; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.005), suggesting that the insertion of s60 into AH N1 reduced the viral infectivity of the H5N1 pseudoparticle. On the other hand, deletion of s60 from the 09N1 stalk region did not alter its infectivity; the wild-type (09H1::09N1; 1.95±1.48%) and mutant (09H1::09N1-s60; 2.75±2.38%) native H1N1 pseudoparticles did not differ significantly in infectivity (
