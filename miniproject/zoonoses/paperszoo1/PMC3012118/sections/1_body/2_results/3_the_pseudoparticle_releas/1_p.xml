<p>By removing terminal sialic acids from the oligosaccharide side chains to which viral HA binds, NA plays a central role in the release of the virus from infected cells 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Knipe1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. To compare the virus-releasing ability of 09N1 and AH N1, and to examine the role of the stalk region in this function, we generated eight pseudoparticles by combining each of the two HAs (AH H5 and 09H1) with each of the four wild-type and mutant NAs (09N1, AH N1, 09N1-s60, and AH N1+09s60. The number of pseudoparticle RNA copies produced was determined using real-time qRT-PCR with primers and a probe targeting the mRNA for the CMVâ€“GFP reporter gene packaged in the pseudoparticles.
