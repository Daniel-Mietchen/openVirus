<p>The pseudoparticle copy number did not differ significantly between AH H5::AH N1 and AH H5::AH N1+09s60 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.062), AH H5::09N1 and AH H5::09N1-s60 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.129), 09H1::09N1 and 09H1::09N1-s60 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.060), and 09H1::AH N1 and 09H1::AH N1+09s60 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.061; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015825-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). On the other hand, for the AH H5-harboring pseudoparticles, approximately twice as many pseudoparticles were released by 09N1 and 09N1-s60 as by AH N1 and AH N1+09s60 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015825-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, left); similarly, for 09H1-harboring pseudoparticles, more pseudoparticles were released by 09N1 and 09N1-s60 than by AH N1 and AH N1+09s60 (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015825-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, right). Taken together, these results show that 09N1 is more effective at pseudoparticle release than AH N1 and that the 20-aa deletion/insertion in 09N1 and AH N1 does not alter this relationship.
