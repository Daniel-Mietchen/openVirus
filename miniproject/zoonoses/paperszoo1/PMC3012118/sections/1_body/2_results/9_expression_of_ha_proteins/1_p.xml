<p>To confirm that the HA proteins were expressed efficiently in all pseudotype combinations, and to assess any possible effects of mismatched or mutant NAs on HA expression in pseudoparticle producer cells, we analyzed HA expression using Western blotting. Cells infected with any of the pseudotype combinations expressed AH H5 with a glycosylation pattern and a molecular mass similar to those of HA from purified, inactivated wild-type H5N1 virus (
