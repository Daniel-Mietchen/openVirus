<p>We also compared the sequences of the NA proteins from influenza A/Ohio/07/2009/H1N1 (#FJ969534) and influenza A/Anhui/1/2005/H5N1. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015825-g002">Figure 2</xref> (lower panel), these two NA sequences, designated 09N1 and AH N1, respectively, differ at 55 of 469 residues (11.7%). In particular, the 09N1 stalk region contains a 20-aa segment (designated s60 or 09s60; highlighted in yellow) that is not present in AH N1. This gap in the AH N1 stalk region sequence results in the loss of four potential glycosylation sites (gray boxes) and a cysteine residue from AH N1. Of the 29 aas in the transmembrane domains, there are 8 aas difference (27.5%) which is much higher than the that of other regions, As previously noted, the 15 charged active site residues are conserved
