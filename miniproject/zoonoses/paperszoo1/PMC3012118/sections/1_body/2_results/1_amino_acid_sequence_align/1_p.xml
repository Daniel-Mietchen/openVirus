<p>We compared the amino acid sequences of the HA proteins from the 2009 pandemic influenza strain A/California/05/2009/H1N1 (GenBank #FJ966952) and influenza A/Anhui/1/2005/H5N1 (#DQ371928). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015825-g002">Figure 2</xref> (upper panel), these two HA sequences, designated 09H1 and AH H5, respectively, differ at 207 of 569 residues (36.4%), exhibiting considerable variation in their glycosylation, receptor binding, and cleavage sites.
