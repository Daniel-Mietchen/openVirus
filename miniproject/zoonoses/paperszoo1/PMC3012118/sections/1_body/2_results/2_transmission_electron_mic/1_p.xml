<p>To verify the pesudoparticles, we observed it using transmission electron microscopy. The pesudoparticles were visible as a particle surrounded with HA and NA spikes, which matches the typical viral morphology of influenza virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015825-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Meanwhile, no typical viral morphology of influenza virus was found neither in the supernatant from naïve 293T cell nor in the supernatant from 297T cell transfected with a GagPol-encoding plasmid and a CMV–GFP reporter plasmid but no HA and NA expression plasmids. Together with the following serial functional assessment on both HA and NA of pseudoparticles, what we observed is the functional HA/NA bearing pseudotyped influenza viruses particle.
