<p>Notably, the NA proteins lacking s60, the 20-aa stalk segment (AH N1 and 09N1-s60), produced almost no dimers, whereas the NA proteins containing s60 (09N1 and AH N1+09s60) existed primarily as dimers; thus, the 20-aa segment appears to be the critical domain for dimer formation and does not seem to affect glycosylation (
