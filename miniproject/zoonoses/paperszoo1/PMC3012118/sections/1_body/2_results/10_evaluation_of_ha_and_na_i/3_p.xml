<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015825-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, the molecular mass of the 09N1 NA protein in pseudoparticles harboring 09H1 or AH H5 was identical to that of the NA from wild-type 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus; the monomer and dimer molecular masses were ∼60 and ∼120 kDa, respectively. The molecular mass of the 09N1-s60 NA protein in pseudoparticles harboring 09H1 or AH H5 was ∼50 kDa. The 09N1 and 09N1-s60 proteins exhibited similar incorporation efficiencies with 09H1 and AH H5, suggesting that the incorporation of 09N1 was unaffected by the s60 deletion in its stalk region. Similarly, when expressed with 09H1 and AH H5, the molecular masses of AH N1 and AH N1+09s60 were ∼50 and ∼60 kDa, as expected (
