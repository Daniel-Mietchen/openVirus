<p>The AH H5 protein was expressed at similar levels in all pseudotype combinations, and its molecular weight and a glycosylation pattern in all combinations were similar to those of purified wild-type HPAI H5N1 HA (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015825-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>, right). Notably, HA2 of the pseudoparticles was a bit light than that of wild-type 2009 pandemic H1N1, this may due to difference of the glyscosylation efficiency in variant generating approaches, wild type was inoculated in egg, while, pseudoparticles were produced in 293T cells. Together with the transmission electron microscopy observation, our data suggest that the AH H5 and 09H1 HA proteins are incorporated with similar efficiency into all pseudotype combinations and that the s60 insertion/deletion does not affect this efficiency.
