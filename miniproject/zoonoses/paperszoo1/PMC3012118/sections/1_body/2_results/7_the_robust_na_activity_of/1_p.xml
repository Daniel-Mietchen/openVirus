<p>We previously reported that oseltamivir boosts the infectivity of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus dramatically 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and suggested that its robust NA activity was the major cause of this effect 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Here, we examined the effect of oseltamivir on the infectivity of pseudoparticles containing the eight native and mismatched combinations of HA and wild-type or mutant NA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015825-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, white bars). Oseltamivir significantly enhanced the infectivity of all of the pseudoparticles save the mismatched wild-type 09H1::AH N1, which is barely infectious. Among the native AH H5-harboring pseudoparticles, the infectivity of AH H5::AH N1 and AH H5::AH N1+09s60 was high, even in the absence of oseltamivir, but oseltamivir provided a further boost, suggesting that the NA activity of AH N1 is lower than that of 09N1, causing AH N1 to have only a slight effect on HA entry in the presence of oseltamivir. Oseltamivir boosted the infectivity of the mismatched AH H5 pseudoparticles AH H5::09N1 and AH H5::09N1-s60 by 15 and 8 times, respectively, suggesting that the higher the NA activity, the higher the infectivity-enhancing effect of oseltamivir.
