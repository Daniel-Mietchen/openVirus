<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015825-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, the molecular masses of AH N1 and AH N1+09s60 expressed in pseudoparticle-infected 293T cells were ∼50 and ∼60 kDa, as expected. These two proteins had similar expression efficiencies in all pseudotype combinations, suggesting that the insertion in the AH N1 stalk region did not alter its expression. Notably, AH N1 was almost entirely monomeric, whereas AH N1+09s60 was primarily dimeric. Thus, the s60 insertion favored dimerization but did not alter the glycosylation pattern.
