<p>The expression of the 09N1, 09N1-s60, AH N1, and AH N1+09s60 NA proteins in pseudoparticle producer cells was analyzed by Western blotting using a 2009 pandemic H1N1 wild-type virus isolate as a control. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015825-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, the wild-type NA from this virus was detected primarily as a ∼120-kDa dimer but also as a tetramer and, in lesser amounts, as a ∼60-kDa monomer. The molecular mass and glycosylation pattern of 09N1 expressed in pseudoparticle-infected 293T cells appeared identical to those of the wild-type NA, but the proportion that was tetrameric was smaller. The 09N1-s60 protein appeared to be a ∼50-kDa monomer, suggesting that the ∼10-kDa deletion of s60 abolished NA oligomerization but did not alter its glycosylation pattern. The expression efficiency for the 09N1 and 09N1-s60 proteins was very similar in all pseudotype combinations, suggesting that the s60 deletion in the 09N1 stalk region did not alter its expression.
