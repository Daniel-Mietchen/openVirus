<p>Like the AH N1 NA protein, the 09N1-s60 NA protein, which lacks a 20-aa segment (residues 49â€“68; designated s60) of the 09N1 stalk region, was primarily monomeric, with a small amount of the dimeric form. When the s60 segment of 09N1 was inserted into the AH N1 stalk region, the resulting AH N1+09s60 protein was primarily dimeric, with some of the monomeric form also present. Thus, the stalk region is critical for dimer formation, which may occur 
 <italic>via</italic> oxidation of Cys49, and the dimer is the major functional unit of NA. Unlike HA, NA was poorly glycosylated despite the presence of as many as five potential glycosylation sites, including the four sites in the 20-aa stalk region.
