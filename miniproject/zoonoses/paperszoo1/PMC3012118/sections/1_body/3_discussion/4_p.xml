<p>Comparison of all of the native and mismatched pseudoparticles showed that those harboring AH H5 had a much higher infectivity than those harboring 09H1. This finding suggests that the HPAI H5N1 virus also has a high infectivity, and this characteristic may underlie the dire clinical outcomes of H5N1-infected patients. Of the AH H5-harboring pseudoparticles, higher infectivity was observed for AH H5::AH N1 than for AH H5::AH N1+09s60, and higher infectivity was observed for AH H5::09N1-s60 than for AH H5::09N1, suggesting that AH H5 partners more effectively with NA proteins that have a short stalk or that exist as monomers. Of the lower infectivity of all pseudoparticles harboring 09HA, the diversity in glycosylation might be a reason since we observed that HA2 of our pseudoparticles was poorly glycosylated (
