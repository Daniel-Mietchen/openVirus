<p>In this report, we focused on the NA enzymes of two influenza A virus strains that have had catastrophic effects, HPAI H5N1 and pandemic 2009H1N1. This latter virus originated in birds, jumped to swine, and then became the human pandemic strain 2009H1N1

The NAs of both of these viruses display human host adaptations, but of the two, 09N1 is more robust and is thus more efficient at viral release. During the 2009H1N1 entry stage, 09N1 might be a powerful “block” against viral entry, thus making the virus sensitive to oseltamivir. Although many virologists believe that NA is tetrameric

 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, we found that the 09N1 protein of the wild-type virus was primarily dimeric, although some of it was tetrameric form, and a much smaller amount was monomeric western blot analysis. Interestingly, although 09N1 in pseudoparticles was also primarily dimeric, a substantial fraction of it was monomeric, and very little was tetrameric western blot analysis.
