<p>Due to the lacking of antibody against AH NA, we added a 6 x His-encoding sequence to the C-terminal ends of the AH NA and AH N1+09s60 coding sequence to facilitate Western blot analysis. We have assessed any possible influence of His tag on NA's function, there was no difference in NA activity and cooperation with HA between the pseudoparticles harboring NAs with or without His tag (data not showed).</p>
