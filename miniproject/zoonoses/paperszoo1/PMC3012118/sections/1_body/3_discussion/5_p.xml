<p>When we compared the NA activities of all eight pseudoparticle combinations of AH H5 and 09H1 with 09N1, 09N1-s60, AH N1, and AH N1+09s60, we found that the s60 insertion or deletion did not appear to affect NA activity except when AH H5 was combined with 09N1. Because of this confusion, we doubled the methodology; the NA-Star NA Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit is extremely sensitive and hence lacks the desired reproducibility and specificity.</p>
