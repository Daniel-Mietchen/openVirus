<p>Retrovirus-based influenza HA/NA pseudoparticle systems have been demonstrated to accurately represent the biology of the corresponding wild-type viruses

 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Lin2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. For research on HPAI viruses, the use of pseudoparticle systems eliminates not only routine biosafety issues but also the possibility of production of a manmade, highly pathogenic virus. Pseudoparticles containing only HA and NA provide a convenient model for research on HA/NA matching patterns, viral release, viral entry, neutralizing antibodies, and many other biological features involving HA and NA. Although this system cannot completely represent the entire virus generated by reverse genetics, it has provided us with a safe and convenient platform for our HA/NA studies.
