<p>Oseltamivir is a NA inhibitor designed to bind to the putative NA tetramer 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Collins1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, our current data demonstrate that the NA of the wild-type 2009 pandemic H1N1 is primarily dimeric and that it exists in both dimeric and monomeric forms in pseudoparticles. This finding, in conjunction with our previous finding that NA dramatically inhibits NA activity 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, casts doubt upon the accepted pharmacologic mechanism of action of oseltamivir. We previously noted that oseltamivir boosts the infectivity of influenza virus 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>; the present comparison of NA activities in pseudoparticles pairing AH H5 and 09H1 partnered with native and mismatched NA proteins shows clearly that the infectivity-enhancing effect of oseltamivir correlates positively with the NA activity. Therefore, we feel we must again raise an alarm concerning the use of oseltamivir to treat influenza A in clinical practice: when the patient's lung has a high viral load, oseltamivir administration might enhance the infectivity of the virus, particularly if the virus has a high NA activity to begin with. The resulting robust pulmonary immune response could result in unexpected lung failure.
