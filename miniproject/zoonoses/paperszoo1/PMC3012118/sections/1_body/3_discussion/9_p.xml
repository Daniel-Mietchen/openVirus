<p>The HAs of HPAI viruses have multiple basic amino acids at their cleavage sites (RERRRKKR) and are cleaved by ubiquitous proteases in a wide range of organs, resulting in lethal systemic infection 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Horimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. We observed that pseudoparticles harboring AH H5 were more infective than those harboring 09H1, but whether the presence of the HPAI HA cleavage site enhances the infectivity of HPAI H5N1 viruses is unknown. We are currently performing experiments to address this issue.
