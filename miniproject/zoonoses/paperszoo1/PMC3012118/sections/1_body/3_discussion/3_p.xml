<p>Of the 29 aas in the NA transmembrane domains, there are 8 aas difference (27.5%) which is much higher than the that of other regions, although reports indicated that the transmembrane domain of NA was critical in apical transport 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Kundu1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0015825-Barman1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, as far as we know, no report showed that the transmembrane domain was critical for pseudoparticle's budding. At the budding stage, pseudoparticles were secreted by the gag-pol protein derived from murine leukemia virus, the NA could only help pseudoparticle release by cleaving terminal sialic acids from oligosaccharide side-chain receptors that bind the HA. The more activity of NA, the more pseudoparticles released. Of the NA activity, 09 NA is almost 100 times higher than that of AH NA, the extreme high NA activity of 2009 pandemic H1N1 NA was confirmed by our previous reports
