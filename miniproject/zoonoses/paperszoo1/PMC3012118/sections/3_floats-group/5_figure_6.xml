  <title>Western blot analysis of expression of NA in pseudoparticle producer 293 cells and NA incorporation into pseudoparticles.</title>
  <p>(A) Pseudoparticles and their producer 293T cell lysates were analyzed for 09N1 and 09N1-s60 expression. Wild-type H1N1 virus A/California/7/2009 (300 ng) was used as a positive control. Mock, normal 293T cell lysate; pps, pseudoparticles. (B) Pseudoparticles and their producer 293T cell lysates were analyzed for AH N1 and AH N1+09s60 expression. Mock, normal 293T cell lysate; pps, pseudoparticles.</p>
