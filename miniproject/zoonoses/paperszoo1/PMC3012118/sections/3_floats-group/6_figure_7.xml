  <title>Western blot analysis of expression of HA in pseudoparticle producer 293 cells and HA incorporation into pseudoparticles.</title>
  <p>(A) Pseudoparticles and their producer 293T cell lysates were analyzed for AH H5 expression. Wild-type H5N1 virus A/Vietnam/1194/2005 (300 ng) was used as a positive control. (B) Pseudoparticles and their producer 293T cell lysates were analyzed for 09H1 expression. Wild-type H1N1 virus A/California/7/2009 (300 ng) was used as a positive control.</p>
