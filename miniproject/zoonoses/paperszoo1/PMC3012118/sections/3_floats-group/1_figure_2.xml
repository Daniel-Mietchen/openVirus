 <caption>
  <title>Alignment of influenza virus A hemagglutinin (HA; upper) and neuraminidase (NA; lower) sequences to those of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain (2009H1N1).</title>
  <p>Dots indicate residues that are identical to the corresponding residues in 2009H1N1, and dashes indicate deleted residues. Signal peptides are shown in bold type. Gray boxes indicate potential glycosylation sites, as predicted from the amino acid sequence. For HA, red residues represent the precursor cleavage site that links the functional HA1 and HA2 domains, and blue residues represent the binding site for the sialic acid receptor. For NA, conserved active site residues are highlighted in green, and the 20-aa insertion/deletion segment of interest in the stalk region is highlighted in yellow.</p>
