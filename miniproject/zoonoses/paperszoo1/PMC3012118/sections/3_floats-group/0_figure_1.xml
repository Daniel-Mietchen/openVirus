  <title>Diagrams of HA/NA expression plasmids, GagPol-encoding plasmid, and CMV–GFP reporter plasmid, and transmission electron microscope observation.</title>
  <p>A. HA/NA expression plasmids, HA/NA encoding sequences were inserted between the CMV promoter and poly A Tbgh (bovine growth hormone) tail. B. Murine leukemia virus GagPol-encoding plasmid, GagPol-encoding sequence was inserted between the CMV promoter and the Rabbit beta-globin G ploy A tail. C. CMV–GFP reporter plasmid, the EGFP sequence was inserted into the U3 and U5 sequence of murine leukemia virus. D. Transmission electron microscopy image of pseudoparticles.</p>
