<p>In the 77 dog serum samples, the detectable VNA was 18.2% (14/77), and the overall percentage of VNA positive was relatively lower than the samples from FBs. However, some of the VNA positive dogs had high levels of antibodies with two reached 9.27 and 11.3 IU/ml, respectively. We think the randomly collected serum samples include those from vaccinated dogs due to rabies awareness by the owners.</p>
