<p>Although FB-associated human rabies cases have been reported in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the actual number of human cases remain unknown. In Africa, about 0.33% rabies seroconversion was recorded in badger populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Rabies in such animals was detected in Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], but was simulated in Great Britain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, FB-associated human rabies has never been reported except in southeast China. In our surveyed counties, where 69-80% of human rabies cases were inferred to be caused by this animal species, such epidemiological data lack laboratory-based diagnosis, and may confuse the actual role of FB in the transmission of rabies to domestic dogs and humans. Therefore, in this study, we conducted an active laboratory-based rabies survey to determine the frequency of rabies virus infection and seroprevalence in both dogs and FBs. The percentage of RV infection was 3.8% (8/209) in dead FBs, 1.8% (1/56) in live FBs and up to 13% (2/15) in domestic dogs that had bitten people. Conversely, apparently healthy FBs were found with a high percentage of rabies seroconversion (69.6%), whereas dogs were only 18.2%. However, no rabies vaccination program has been performed in wildlife in China. The high percentage of rabies seroconversion in FBs is an interesting discovery, and could be due to abortive rabies infections in the population. Domestic dogs still are the most affected species, and are the most likely source for rabies transmission to humans and other animals in the endemic region. Our data also suggest that FBs may not be as susceptible to rabies as other carnivores.
