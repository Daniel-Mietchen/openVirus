<p>Serum samples were collected from the captured FBs and dogs in our expanded surveyed areas. All the FBs were alive and appeared healthy when the serum was collected. Dog sera were from watchdogs belonging to residents of different villages in Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Anhui provinces. The method of titration of virus neutralizing antibodies (VNA) by Fluorescent Antibody Virus Neutralization (FAVN) test was described elsewhere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Briefly, 3-fold serial dilutions of standard serum (0.5 International Units, IU/ml) and test serum samples were prepared in microplates in quadruplicate. Fifty _μl of challenge rabies virus (CVS-11) containing 100 TCID
 <sub>50 </sub>was also added to each well. After 60 min incubation at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO
 <sub>2 </sub>incubator, 50 μl cell suspension containing 2 × 10
 <sup>4 </sup>cells was added to each well and the plates were incubated for 48 h at 37°C. After fixation at room temperature for 30 min in 80% acetone, the cell monolayers were stained by addition of FITC-conjugated anti-rabies nucleoprotein monoclonal antibodies (Laboratory of Epidemiology, Veterinary Institute, Changchun, China) to each well. Staining was carried out in an incubator at 37°C for 30 min and fluorescence was observed by UV microscope (Zeiss, Germany). Wells exhibiting no specific fluorescence were considered antibody positive. Neutralizing antibody titers were calculated using the Spearman-Kärber formula and expressed in IU/ml by comparison with a reference serum (13.5 IU/ml, product of AFSSA, France), 0.1 IU/ml is considered as the cut-off of seroconversion after rabies virus infection in both ferret badgers and dogs.
