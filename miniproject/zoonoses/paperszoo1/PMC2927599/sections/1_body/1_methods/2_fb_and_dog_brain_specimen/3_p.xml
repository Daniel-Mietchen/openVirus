<p>The FAT on brain specimens was performed according to methods described elsewhere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Briefly, the brain tissue impressions were made on slides. After air drying, the slides were fixed with 80% acetone for 20 min. The FITC-conjugated anti-rabies virus nucleoprotein monoclonal antibodies (made in Laboratory of Epidemiology, Veterinary Institute, Changchun, for routine rabies diagnosis) was added and incubated for 40 min at 37ÂºC. After three-times' wash using PBS buffer (0.01 M, pH 7.4) -Tween-20 (0.1%), the slides were left to dry in the air at ambient temperature, and observed under a UV fluorescent microscope (Zeiss Corporation, Germany) for typical rabies virus staining.
