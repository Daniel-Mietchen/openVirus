<p>We compared RV N sequences from rabid FB isolates with those in dogs from China, foxes from Europe/Middle East, dogs in Africa, and rabies vaccine strains from Asia, Europe and the US (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Dog RVs in China were categorized into two groups. Group 1 compromises RVs all across south and southeast China, and group 2 is formed by Chinese isolates distributed in Guizhou, Jiangsu, Henan, Jilin provinces, and is closely related to Asian and occidental vaccine strains, and cosmopolitan dog RVs (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In general, Chinese dog-associated lineages shared nucleotide identity from 87 to 98% (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Same phylogenetic pattern was reconstructed using the G gene sequences (data not shown).
