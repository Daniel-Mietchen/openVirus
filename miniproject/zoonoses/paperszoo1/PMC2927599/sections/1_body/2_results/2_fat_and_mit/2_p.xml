<p>From the 56 brain samples we collected from live FBs in Jiangxi, Anhui and Zhejiang provinces, only 1 sample was rabies positive by FAT (1.8%, 1/56). Since captured and injured by the hunter, this positive animal did not present obvious clinical signs of rabies before euthanized for diagnosis. From the 15 dog brain samples collected in the same regions, 2 were rabies positive by FAT (13%, 2/15). All RVs from FAT positive samples were successfully isolated by MIT.</p>
