  <p>Expected relationship between outbreak size (as fraction of the population affected) and 2 key epidemiologic parameters: I0 is the number of primary cases of infection introduced into the human population from an external source such as a zoonotic reservoir (increasing in the direction indicated); R0 is the basic reproduction number, a measure of the transmissibility of the infection with the human population (see text). The curves are obtained from a modified version of the Kermack-McKendrick equation and show that expected outbreak size is particularly sensitive to small changes in I0 or R0 when R0 is close to 1. Examples of zoonotic pathogens with R0&gt;1, R0&lt;1 and R0 close to 1 are shown. RIVF, Rift Valley fever virus. (Reprinted with permission from [
