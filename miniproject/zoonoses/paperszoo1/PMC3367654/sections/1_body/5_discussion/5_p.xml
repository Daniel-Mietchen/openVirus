<p>Even if a pathogen is capable of infecting and causing disease in humans, most zoonotic pathogens are not highly transmissible within human populations and do not cause major epidemics. The possible magnitude of an infectious disease outbreak is related to the basic reproduction number, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). For pathogens that are minimally transmissible within human populations (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> close to 0), outbreak size is determined largely by the number of introductions from the reservoir. For pathogens that are highly transmissible within human populations (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>&gt;&gt;1), outbreak size is determined largely by the size of the susceptible population. For pathogens that are moderately transmissible within human populations (corresponding to 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> â‰ˆ 1), notable outbreaks are possible (especially if multiple introductions occur), but the scale of these outbreaks is very sensitive to small changes in 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>. In other words, small changes in the nature of the host-pathogen interaction can lead to large increases (or decreases) in the scale of the public health problem (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Such pathogens may be likely sources of emerging infectious disease problems in the future. However, we currently have no way of predicting whether a novel human pathogen will behave like rabies (frequently introduced into the human population, but not capable of causing major epidemics) or HIV (probably rarely introduced, but capable of causing a global pandemic).
