<p>For the zoonotic species, we distinguished those known to be transmissible between humans, allowing that this might be through an indirect route (e.g., a vector or an intermediate host), from those for which humans can only acquire infection (directly or indirectly) from a nonhuman source. For the transmissible zoonotic species, we further distinguished those that are sufficiently transmissible to cause major epidemics in human populations from those that cause only relatively minor outbreaks. This classification was intended to distinguish between pathogens with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>&gt;1 in humans from those with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>&lt;1, where 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is the basic reproduction number, i.e., the average number of secondary infections produced by a single primary infection introduced into a large population of previously unexposed hosts. Direct estimates of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> are unavailable for most zoonotic pathogens.
