<p>Throughout the study, we quantified associations as the relative risk (RR) and tested for statistical significance using a standard Ï‡
 <sup>2</sup> test (with correction for small expected values). Although these statistical analyses are susceptible to bias introduced by related species (e.g., several species of hantavirus exist, most of which are zoonotic and many of which are regarded as emerging or reemerging), the analysis at the family level is an indication of the extent of any such bias.
