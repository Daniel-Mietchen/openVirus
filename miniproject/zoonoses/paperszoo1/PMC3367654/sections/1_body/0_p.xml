<p>A recent, comprehensive literature survey of human pathogens listed &gt;1,400 different species (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">
  <italic>1</italic>
 </xref>), more than half known to be zoonotic, i.e., able to infect other host species (

  <italic>1</italic>
 </xref>
 <italic>,</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">
  <italic>2</italic>
 </xref>). The survey data showed that those pathogens regarded as emerging and reemerging were more likely to be zoonotic than those that are not (

  <italic>1</italic>
 </xref>
 <italic>,</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">

 </xref>), confirming an association between these characteristics which had long been suspected (

  <italic>4</italic>
 </xref>
 <italic>,</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">
