<p>More than 20 virus families contain human pathogens, with just 4, the 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Reoviridae</italic>, accounting for more than half of the species affecting humans and, likewise, more than half of the emerging and reemerging species. Overall, no significant difference was found between the 9 largest families (pooling the remainder) in the fraction of species regarded as emerging or reemerging (χ
