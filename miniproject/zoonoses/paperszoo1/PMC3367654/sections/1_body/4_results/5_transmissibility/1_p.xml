<p>Overall, most zoonotic pathogens are either not transmissible (directly or indirectly) between humans at all (i.e., humans are a dead-end host) or are only minimally transmissible. Examples include rabies virus, Rift Valley fever virus, and 
 <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> (the agent of Lyme disease). A small minority (â‰ˆ10%) of pathogen species that are technically zoonotic are, in fact, spread almost exclusively from person to person (e.g., 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> or measles virus) or can do so once successfully introduced from a nonhuman source (e.g., some strains of influenza A, 
 <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>, or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus). However, a substantial minority of zoonotic pathogens (about 25%, i.e., 200 species) are capable of some person-to-person transmission but do not persist without repeated reintroductions from a nonhuman reservoir (e.g., 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157, 
 <italic>Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense</italic>, or Ebola virus). This pattern is fairly consistent across the major pathogen groups.
