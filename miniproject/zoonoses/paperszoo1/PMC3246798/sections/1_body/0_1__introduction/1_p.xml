<p>In 1983, Odend' Hal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] published a short book listing the worldwide distribution of animal viruses. It reported the classification as well as host, historical movements, and diagnostic techniques available. Of the 110 viruses cited, 35 were arboviruses, those viruses that are transmitted primarily by an arthropod vector. This first attempt at mapping animal viruses provides a useful baseline for reviewing the current state of arboviruses of livestock. Arboviruses are mainly classified to the virus families 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Reoviridae,</italic> and 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The majority of these virus families have a ribonucleic acid genome, with the clear exception of the 
 <italic>Asfarviridae</italic> to which African swine fever virus belongs (
