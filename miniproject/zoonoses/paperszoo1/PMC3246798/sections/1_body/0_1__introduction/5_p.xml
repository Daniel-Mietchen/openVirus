<p>A key aspect in preparing for the emergence of arthropod-borne diseases is the establishment of tests capable of detecting them. Development of such tests needs to address a number of fundamental issues. These include key features such as sensitivity of the assay and its specificity for the target virus. The assay must also be validated to provide assurance of its reliability, or at least give an indication of what might be missed. The assay under development needs to compete with existing technologies in terms of cost and speed to deliver desirable benefits to encourage adoption. The application of a particular test needs to be considered. Some tests may be applied to surveillance for virus, in which case the test needs to be amenable to cost-effective delivery of high volumes of samples. This in turn can complement serosurveys for particular viruses or be applied to sampling arthropod vectors in order to provide early warning of potential disease incursion. </p>
