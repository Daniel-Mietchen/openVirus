<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref> an updated list of arthropod-borne virus pathogens of humans, livestock, and wildlife is provided. During recent years several pathogenic arboviruses have apparently dispersed to new locations. The most well-known cases have been the movement of West Nile virus from the Old world to the New World [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and the introduction of bluetongue virus into northern Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This has prompted a wide range of authors to review the potential viruses that could emerge in the UK and Europe and assess the risk of such emergence events in the future [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].
