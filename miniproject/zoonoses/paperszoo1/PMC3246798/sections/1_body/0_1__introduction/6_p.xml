<p>For some technologies, the cost of individual tests is prohibitive for application to large numbers of samples or in resource-poor areas such as Africa. In each of these areas, molecular detection techniques have been very competitive as evidenced by the numerous tests developed in recent decades. Many of the assays reported in this paper provide a result considerably faster than more traditional detection methods such as virus isolation and plaque-reduction neutralization tests. Genetic variability of viruses is an inherent weakness in the use of molecular detection techniques with primer-mismatch being a constant problem. This has to some extent been overcome by the wealth of sequence data now available on many of the viruses that affect livestock. </p>
