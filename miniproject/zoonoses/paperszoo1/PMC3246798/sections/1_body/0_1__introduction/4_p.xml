<p>A wide range of routes would enable arthropod-borne viruses to translocate into a disease-free area. These can be divided into those that are part of the normal ecology and are influenced by the environment and climate that are presumably occurring all the time. Avian migration is an example of this pathway. Avian species are known to harbour many pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and certain viruses such as avian influenza and Newcastle disease virus are transmitted around the globe through bird migration. For arthropod-borne viruses, virus movement can occur via transportation of the vector [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] or through infection of the host, particularly a viraemic animal that is subsequently fed on by an arthropod in a disease-free destination. The range of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever appears to be increasing slowly in south-east Europe associated with spread by its tick vector (
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> spp.). Bluetongue virus transmission into the UK is believed to have resulted from direct introduction of its midge vector (
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> spp.) assisted by wind movements in 2007 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It is likely that movements by these routes, if they happen, are occurring continuously and cannot realistically be controlled. Therefore, effort needs to be directed towards reducing the impact of introduction. The alternative to natural introduction is often mediated by the actions of man. Again, this could occur through passive introduction of the vector through the movement of humans, livestock, or trade goods between endemic and disease-free areas or by the movement of infected livestock between countries. Theoretically, these mechanisms of entry can be regulated and effort should be directed to prevention programs.
