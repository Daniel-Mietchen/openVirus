<p>Here we provide an overview of those arthropod-borne viruses that cause clinical disease in livestock and lead to economic losses. It will not consider important arboviruses that cause significant human disease with no livestock involvement such as yellow fever, dengue, Toscana virus, and chikungunya virus. Background information on the disease caused by particular viruses is described, the main arthropod vector and the reported current geographical distribution is provided for the viruses selected. This is followed by a brief review of reported rapid molecular tests that detect specific viruses or those tests that detect virus groups that contain numbers of animal pathogens. </p>
