<p>Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is one the most important and widespread diseases caused by tick-borne viruses. The causative agent, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus does not cause disease in livestock, but vertebrates play a role in virus transmission as part of a tick-vertebrate-tick enzootic cycle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B141">141</xref>]. Although there is no evidence of clinical disease in animals, contact with viremic animals, tick bite, or crushing ticks taken from infected animals can lead to human infection. In humans, CCHF virus causes a disease with four phases: incubation, prehaemorrhagic, haemorrhagic, and convalescence phases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B141">141</xref>]. Following the short incubation period (3–7 days), sudden onset of fever, headaches, myalgia, and dizziness occur [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B143">143</xref>]. A few days later, a rapidly developing haemorrhagic period occurs, with haematomas appearing on the skin and mucous membranes with mortality rates ranging from 3% to 30%. The surviving patients will go through the convalescence period lasting 9-10 days which can include variable symptoms such as tachycardia, temporary hair loss, poor vision, and loss of appetite. Infected humans can spread CCHF via close contacts resulting in community and nosocomial outbreaks [
