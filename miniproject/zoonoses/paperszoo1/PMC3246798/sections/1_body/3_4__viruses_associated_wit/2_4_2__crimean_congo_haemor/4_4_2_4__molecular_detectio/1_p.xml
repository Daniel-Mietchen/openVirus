<p>Since the mid 1990's several nested and real-time RT-PCR assays, which all target genomic S segment of the tripartite genome. These assays have been developed to achieve fast initial and differential laboratory diagnosis of CCHFV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">104</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B155">155</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B158">158</xref>]. Both the nested and real-time RT-PCR assays are comparable in terms of sensitivity, but the results can be achieved in two hours with one-step real-time RT-PCR, whereas it takes 4-5 hours to run nested RT-PCR without gel electrophoresis. Due to the high genetic variability of CCHFV isolates, the first real-time RT-PCR assay detecting CCHFV was based on a Sybr Green method that intercalates to any double stranded DNA and requires identification of the positive product using gel electrophoresis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">104</xref>]. More specific assays can be developed by designing primers and probes directed at strains of interest, for example, those circulating in geographically defined areas. Strains from the Balkan region have been successfully identified by using a one-step real-time RT-PCR that is based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe technology employing the endonuclease (5′ → 3′) activity of
