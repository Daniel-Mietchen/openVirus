<p>The main forms of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) found in Europe and Asia do not cause clinical disease in livestock although human cases are on the increase in Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B168">168</xref>]. However, a number of closely related variants of TBEV cause disease in livestock. These include louping ill virus (LIV), Spanish sheep encephalitis virus (SSEV), Greek goat encephalitis virus (GGEV), and Turkish tick-borne encephalitis virus (TTEV). Of these, LIV is the most studied virus as the cause of disease in sheep and red grouse. In red grouse, LIV causes rapid and fatal encephalitis whereas in sheep, disease is biphasic, especially in young nonimmune animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B169">169</xref>]. The initial clinical signs of louping ill include fever and weakness before animals develop neurological signs of disease. A range between 5 and 60% of infected animals develop clinical signs and death can occur between 24 and 48 hours following the development of neurological signs. During the neurological phase, the most damage is caused to the cerebellum. Clinically, the second phase is characterized by cerebral ataxia, hyperexcitability, and progressive paralysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B169">169</xref>]. Occasionally, natural infection of louping ill has also been reported from other species such as dogs, roe and red deer, and llamas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B170">170</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B173">173</xref>]. The other variants are genetically distinct, but closely related to louping ill. They are much less studied, but appear to all cause disease that resembles louping ill [
