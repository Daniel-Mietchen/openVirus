<p>Tick-borne encephalitis virus is found in many areas throughout Europe and Asia. Transmission to humans is mainly through tick bites but can occasionally result from consumption of unpasteurized milk [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B175">175</xref>]. LIV is endemic within upland areas in the UK, particularly in Scotland, Wales, the northwest and southwest of England [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B169">169</xref>]. There have also been reports of LIV in Ireland and Norway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B176">176</xref>]. Sheep infected with SSEV have been reported from the Basque region of Spain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B174">174</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B177">177</xref>]. The first isolation of GGEV was made in the village of Vergina in northern Greece [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B178">178</xref>]. Subsequent studies have suggested that GGEV circulates in the 
 <italic>I. ricinus</italic> population in northern Greece, although at low density [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B179">179</xref>]. TTEV was first reported from northwestern Turkey (Anatolia) as encephalitis in sheep and was subsequent confirmed by nucleotide analysis to be related to tick-borne encephalitis virus [
