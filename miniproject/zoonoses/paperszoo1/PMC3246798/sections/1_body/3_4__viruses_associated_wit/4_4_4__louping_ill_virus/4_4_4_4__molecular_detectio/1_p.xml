<p>The first nested one-step RT-PCR for louping ill detection was developed in mid-1990s. This assay, which targets the envelope (E) and membrane (M) genes of the virus genome, can be used for virus identification in ticks and other species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B184">184</xref>]. As the E gene is the most conserved of the three LIV structural genes, a one-step Taqman RT-PCR assay has been developed with primers for this protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B185">185</xref>]. Brain and spinal cord samples were tested and detection limit of 1â€‰PFU/mL was achieved, making this assay as sensitive as the traditional plaque assay. In recent years, real-time RT-PCR assay detecting eight different tick-borne flaviviruses (including louping ill) and West Nile virus has been developed in the UK [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B186">186</xref>]. The assay employs degenerate primers targeting nonstructural protein 5 and is based on incorporation of Sybr green. The assay is not as sensitive as species specific assays, but makes it an ideal choice when a single virus cannot be specified before testing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B186">186</xref>]. A recently reported assay uses one-step real-time RT-PCR with pyrosequencing which enables the rapid differentiation between TBEV subtypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B187">187</xref>]. Although, this assay was developed to differentiate between the main TBE subtypes, it is also able to detect louping ill virus. Specific detection assays for SSEV, TTEV, and GGEV have not been reported.
