<p>African swine fever virus infects warthogs and bush pigs in Africa with no clinical disease, but domestic pigs can succumb to severe infection with an incubation period of five to fifteen days [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B127">127</xref>]. The disease can manifest in any one of four forms depending on the virulence of a strain. Highly virulent strains cause peracute and acute infections with clinical signs of high fever, anorexia, diarrhoea, recumbency, and general reddening of skin or discoloration on the ventral chest and abdomen, tips of the ears or tail, and on distal limbs. Death can occur within a day, sometimes before obvious clinical signs. The less virulent strains cause subacute and chronic infection. The subacute form manifests as a mild illness with an intermittent fever lasting approximately one month although pregnant animals might abort. In chronic cases, low fever, pneumonia and swelling of joints may occur. Some animals infected with low virulence strains can seroconvert without any clinical symptoms. Morbidity rates can reach close to 100% in herds that are na√Øve for ASFV whereas mortality rates vary, but can be as high as 100%, depending on virulence of the strain. Those animals that have survived acute or chronic disease can become persistently infected and act as carriers for the virus.
