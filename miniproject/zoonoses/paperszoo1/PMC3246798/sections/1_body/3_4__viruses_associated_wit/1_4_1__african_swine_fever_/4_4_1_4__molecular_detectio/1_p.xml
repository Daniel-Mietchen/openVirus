<p>As there is no cure or vaccine for ASFV, slaughter is the only tool for control and eradication of this highly contagious virus in infected areas. Therefore, fast and reliable laboratory diagnosis is required to limit the socio-economic burden of outbreaks. Furthermore, highly specific, differential diagnosis of disease is necessary, as clinical signs of African swine fever may resemble those of other infections, especially classical swine fever. The current OIE manual recommends Taqman real-time PCR such as the assay developed by King and coworkers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B136">136</xref>]. As real-time PCRs are high throughput, sensitive, specific, and quick to run, recent development of these assays has focused on improvement of existing real-time assays by applying varying PCR chemistries. This has led to several modifications of real-time PCR including use of minor groove binding probes or molecular beacon assays [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B138">138</xref>]. A recent method has been further developed with field diagnostics in mind. Two assays, a LAMP method and a linear-after-the-exponential PCR (LATE-PCR), have both been adapted for use in field conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B139">139</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B140">140</xref>]. These methods could considerably shorten the time between infection and diagnosis as there is no requirement for samples to be transported to the laboratory.
