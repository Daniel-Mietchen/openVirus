<p>The subclinical infection of ASFV in warthogs and bush pigs is maintained by soft ticks of the genus 
 <italic>Ornithodoros</italic>. In Africa, the main vector is 
 <italic>O. moubata, </italic>whereas in Southern Europe ASFV is transmitted by 
 <italic>O. erraticus </italic>[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B135">135</xref>]. 
 <italic>O. moubata</italic> is most abundant in eastern and southern Africa particularly in Cameroon, Central African Republic, and Sudan. The most prevalent viral hosts include warthogs, domestic pigs, and man. Although, ticks do play a part in virus transmission, the epidemiological role is thought to be low, especially in those areas where tick populations are small [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B134">134</xref>]. The more likely route of virus spread is through direct oronasal contact with an infected animal or indirectly via fomites and contaminated pig feed. The most recent outbreaks in previously ASFV-free areas could have been transmitted through feed products containing infected pig meat.
