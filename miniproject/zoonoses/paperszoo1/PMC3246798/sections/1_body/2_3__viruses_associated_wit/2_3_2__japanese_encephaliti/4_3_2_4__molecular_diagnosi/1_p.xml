<p>A real-time RT-PCR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">96</xref>] that targets the 3 untranslated regions has been reported with detection to 112 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL. A multiplex real-time RT-PCR for detection of JEV, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus (serotypes 1–4), and St. Louis encephalitis virus has been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>] with a sensitivity of 2 PFU/mL. Real-time RT-LAMP [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">98</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">99</xref>] assays have been developed for detection of JEV with detection levels as low as 0.1 PFU.
