<p>Numerous real-time RT-PCR methods have been developed for rapid detection of RVFV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">103</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">106</xref>]. The detection limit of these assays is typically between 10 and 100 genome copies. An alternative approach is the use of reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) technique [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107">107</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108">108</xref>]. The detection limits of RT-LAMP assays are comparable to real-time RT-PCR.
