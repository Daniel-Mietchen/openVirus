<p>Molecular detection of WNV has been reviewed recently by Shi and Kramer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B120">120</xref>]. Such assays usually detect between 40 and 100 genome copies, although some suggest that sensitivity can be even lower [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B121">121</xref>]. Further developments have enabled multiplexing with other arboviral diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B122">122</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B123">123</xref>] and improved assay sensitivity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B124">124</xref>] suggesting that the detection limit is 0.07 genome copies/mL. RT-LAMP assays have been developed for WNV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B125">125</xref>] and used to detect the virus in mosquito samples [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B126">126</xref>]. The sensitivity limit of these assays has been reported to be approximately 0.1â€‰PFU.
