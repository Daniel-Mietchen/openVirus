<p>A range of haematophagus insects have been associated with transmission of VSV including Sand flies (Diptera: 
 <italic>Psychodidae</italic>), black flies (Diptera: Simulidae), mosquitoes (Diptera: 
 <italic>Culicidae</italic>), and 
 <italic>culicoides</italic> midges (Diptera: 
 <italic>Ceratopogonidae</italic>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>]. Experimentally, only the sand fly (
 <italic>Lutzomyia shannoni</italic>) and the black fly (
 <italic>Simulium vittatum</italic>) have been shown to transmit the virus transovarially or to susceptible hosts. Serological evidence suggests that wild mammals can be infected with VSV but as yet there is no clear wildlife reservoir for the disease.
