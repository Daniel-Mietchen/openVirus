<p>Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) causes disease in cattle, horses, and pigs and is significant as it is clinically similar to foot and mouth disease (FMD). The initial incubation period is between two and eight days with a fever that often goes undetected. Early signs include drooling and frothing at the mouth. Blister-like lesions form in the mouth, on the dental pad, the tongue, the lips, the nostrils, the hooves, and the teats. Oral lesions can be sufficiently painful to cause the infected animal to refuse food and weight loss can occur. Infection is not fatal, although recovery from acute disease can take two weeks and ulceration can take months to heal.</p>
