<p>The genome of Akabane virus, like other orthobunyaviruses, is segmented, consisting of a small (s), medium (m), and large (l) segments. Standard RT-PCR assays have been described for detection of Akabane virus that target the S segment of the virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>]. A further development has been to incorporate detection of Akabane virus with that of Aino virus, a causative agent of congenital defects in cattle. This combined assay takes the format of a real-time multiplex RT-PCR that also targets the S segment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]. The limit of detection is reported to be between 3 and 30 genome copies.
