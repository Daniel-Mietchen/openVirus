<p>Akabane is a disease of ruminants. In adults the disease is generally asymptomatic with a transient viraemia occurring between one and six days after infection, which lasts for about six days. Occasional cases of encephalomyelitis have been observed in some infected animals [

Abnormalities vary depending on the trimester when infection occurs, although most are severely affected and euthanized shortly after birth.
