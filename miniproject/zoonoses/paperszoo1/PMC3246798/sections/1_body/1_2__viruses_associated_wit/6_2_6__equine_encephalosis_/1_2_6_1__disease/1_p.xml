<p>Equine encephalosis virus (EEV) causes an acute disease in horses with a high fever and depressed appetite. A characteristic of the disease is the swelling of the lips and eyelids. Neurological disease is common and abortion can result from infection. Clinical features such as oedema are similar to those observed for AHSV and this should be considered in the diagnosis. However, fatalities are rare, particularly when supportive treatment is provided.</p>
