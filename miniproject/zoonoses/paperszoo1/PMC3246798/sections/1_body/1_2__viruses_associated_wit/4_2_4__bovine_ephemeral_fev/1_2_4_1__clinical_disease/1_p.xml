<p>Bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) causes disease in domestic cattle and water buffalo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. The disease is also known by the names 3-day sickness, stiff sickness, bovine epizootic fever, lazy man's disease, or dengue of cattle. The clinical outcome can vary from inapparent infection to death, but generally disease has four main phases. After an incubation period of between one and ten days, disease begins with a sudden fever that can be bi-,â€‰tri-, or polyphasic with peaks 12 to 18 hours apart. Fever lasts around half a day before the infected animal may become depressed and reluctant to move. Mucous discharge from the nose and profuse salivation can be observed and milk production is reduced or ceased altogether. This period of disability usually lasts between one and two days after which most animals start to recover. Although mortality rates as high as 30% have been observed, in most uncomplicated cases it is less than 2%. Sequelae include reduced milk production and other complications include pneumonia, mastitis, abortion in late pregnancy and temporary infertility of bulls [
