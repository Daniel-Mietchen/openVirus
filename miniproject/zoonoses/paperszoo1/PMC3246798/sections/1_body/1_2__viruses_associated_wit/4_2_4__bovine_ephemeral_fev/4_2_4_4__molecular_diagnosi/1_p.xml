<p>Currently, virus isolation seems to be the standard method for bovine ephemeral fever diagnosis and only two molecular diagnostic assays detecting BEFV have been reported. Real-time RT-PCR has been developed by Stram and coworkers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>], whereas Zheng and coworkers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>] reported the development of reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method. Both assays target the G gene and are highly sensitive assays, real-time RT-PCR being able to detect 10 BEFV genome copies in a sample [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. The advantage of RT-LAMP is that no specialist equipment is required as there is no requirement for thermal cycling. However, a range of specialist apparatus is now available specifically for application with RT-LAMP such as lateral flow devices and turbidometers.
