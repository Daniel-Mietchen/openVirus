<p>The earliest EHDV RT-PCR assays have been based on American isolates, mainly on serotypes 1 and 2 targeting different genomic segments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Since the spread of EHDV into new territories, the RT-PCR assays reported have been type-specific rather than serotype specific or even multiplex RT-PCR assays that can simultaneously detect both bluetongue and EHDV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. A real-time RT-PCR has been reported that detects eight serotypes of EHDV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>].
