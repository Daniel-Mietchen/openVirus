<p>Epizootic haemorrhagic fever virus (EHDV) causes a haemorrhagic disease in ruminants, especially in white-tailed deer in America and in cattle elsewhere. The clinical signs are often similar to those caused by bluetongue virus which complicates diagnosis. The clinical signs reported in cattle include reduction in milk production, fever, loss of appetite, weakness, excessive nasal and ocular discharge, oral ulcerations, discolouration of the udder, and oedema of hooves [
