<p>African horse sickness virus (AHSV) is the causative agent of African horse sickness, a disease of 
 <italic>Equidae</italic> with a high level of mortality. Horses are the most affected species whereas mules and donkeys show mild clinical signs or no signs at all, and zebras are considered a natural host and reservoir for AHSV [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The mildest form, horse sickness fever, is characterised by mild to moderate fever lasting up to 5 days and affecting most commonly the African donkey. A cardiac (subacute) form is recognised by long-lasting fever, oedema of the head, neck, chest, or supraorbital fossae and petechial haemorrhages in the eyes and tongue with mortality rates around 50%. The most severe manifestation with highest mortality rates is a pulmonary (peracute) form, which is characterised by a rapid onset of disease. Death can occur without previous indication of illness or an animal can show signs of fever, depression and respiratory distress. The most commonly seen clinical presentation is a mixed (cardiac-pulmonary) form which can reach mortality rates as high as 70% 3â€“6 days after onset of fever.
