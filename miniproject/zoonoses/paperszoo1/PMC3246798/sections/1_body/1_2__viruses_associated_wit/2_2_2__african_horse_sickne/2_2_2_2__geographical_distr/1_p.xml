<p>The virus is currently endemic in subtropical and tropical areas of Africa below the Saharan desert, which seems to provide a natural barrier against spread northwards [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Nine serotypes have been recognised which all have been reported in southern and eastern Africa. Serotypes 4 and 9 are found in western Africa and are the only serotypes that have caused outbreaks outside of Africa. The major outbreaks outside Africa have so far occurred in the Middle East, Spain, and Portugal. Spain has experienced five outbreaks of African horse sickness since 1966 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The first outbreak in 1966 started from Gibraltar and was caused by serotype 9, which resulted in 637 animals dying or being slaughtered. In 1987, a number of subclinically infected zebras were imported into a Safari park near Madrid, which caused four further outbreaks between 1987 and 1990. However, these outbreaks were due to serotype 4 of AHSV. This was the first time that a serotype other than 9 had been recorded north of the Sahara desert. Before the eradication of the virus in Spain at the end of 1991, the outbreaks resulted in over 1300 horses dying or being destroyed and the virus spreading into Portugal, Tunisia, and Morocco [
