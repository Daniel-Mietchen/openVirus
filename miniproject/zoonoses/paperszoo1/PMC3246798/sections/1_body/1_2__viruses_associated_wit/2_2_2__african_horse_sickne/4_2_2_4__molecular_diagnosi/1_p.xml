<p>The first RT-PCR assays for AHSV detection and serogroup identification were time consuming and labour intensive procedures which involved either restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) or dot-blot hybridisation assays [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. These were followed by several conventional RT-PCR assays, which still required gel-based visualisation and took between four and six hours to complete [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. However, a huge improvement in molecular diagnosis has occurred during recent years, resulting in numerous real-time RT-PCR assays that are able to detect, quantify, and discriminate the serotypes of AHSV in a short period of time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Currently AHSV is only endemic in Africa, where laboratory conditions vary and real-time RT-PCR equipment can be too costly. Therefore, some studies have aimed to develop both real-time RT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR in parallel or solely improve conventional RT-PCR to provide better and faster diagnostic tools that are available in all circumstances [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. These studies have shown high sensitivity and specificity of both conventional and real-time RT-PCR assays for all nine serotypes. Detection limit for both conventional and TaqMan real-time RT-PCR has been reported to be 1.2 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. More importantly new, improved RT-PCR assays can provide results within three hours of sample receipt.
