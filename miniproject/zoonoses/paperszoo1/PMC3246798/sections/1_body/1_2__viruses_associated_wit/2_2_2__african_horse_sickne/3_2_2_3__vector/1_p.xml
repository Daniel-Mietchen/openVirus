<p>Like bluetongue virus, African horse sickness virus is spread by biting midges of the 
 <italic>Culicoides </italic>genus. The major vector for transmission is 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic>, but also 
 <italic>C. bolitinis</italic> has been shown to play a role in virus spread [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In 1998, over 100 horses died in an isolated population in Clarens Valley in South Africa and AHSV was isolated from the most locally abundant midge species, 
 <italic>C. bolitinis</italic>, collected during light trap studies. It has been suggested that other 
 <italic>Culicoides </italic>species might be involved, especially where low-grade cycling of virus is occurring.
