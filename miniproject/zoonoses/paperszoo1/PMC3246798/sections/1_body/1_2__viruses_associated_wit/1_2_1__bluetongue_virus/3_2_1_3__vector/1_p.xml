<p>The only known biological vectors of bluetongue virus are the biting midges of the 
 <italic>Culicoides </italic>genus. The most widespread vector is Afro-Asiatic 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic>, which is distributed in Asia, the Middle East, most of Africa, and in southern and eastern Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The absence and scarce distribution of 
 <italic>C. imicola </italic>during the bluetongue outbreaks in Italy in 2000 onwards led to a search for novel vectors for virus transmission. Light-trapping and RT-PCR experiments identified the 
 <italic>C. pulicaris</italic> and 
 <italic>C. obsoletus</italic> complex (
 <italic>C. obsoletus ss</italic>., 
 <italic>C. chiopterus</italic>, 
 <italic>C. dewulfi</italic>, 
 <italic>C. scoticus</italic>) as potential vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Later, field studies during the 2006 outbreak in Northern Europe also found no 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> in traps, but identified 
 <italic>C. dewulfi</italic>, 
 <italic>C. obsoletus,</italic> and 
 <italic>C. scoticus</italic> as possible vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In addition, these species have a palearctic distribution and they are known to be widespread throughout Europe. The high parity rates of 
 <italic>C. dewulfi</italic> and 
 <italic>C. obsoletus</italic> complex observed in Netherlands further supports the possibility of these species playing a role in bluetongue transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These observations suggest that more than one species of midge are responsible for bluetongue virus distribution.
