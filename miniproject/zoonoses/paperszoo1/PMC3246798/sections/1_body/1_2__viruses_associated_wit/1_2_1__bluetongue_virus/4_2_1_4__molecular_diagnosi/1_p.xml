<p>Since the early 1990's, a range of RT-PCR assays targeting different BTV genome segments have been developed with a common drawback that they were only able to detect a limited number of serotypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, most of these methods required the use of agarose gel electrophoresis for nucleic acid detection, which made them laborious and unpractical for diagnostic purposes. However, the spread of BTV in Northern Europe has seen the reporting of a number of conventional [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and real-time RT-PCR assays detecting all 24 serotypes simultaneously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. These assays have been designed for diagnostic requirements; they are all rapid, reliable, and sensitive, enabling high throughput testing, which can be applied directly to clinical samples. The genome of bluetongue virus consists of ten double-stranded RNA segments coding for seven structural and three nonstructural (NS) proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Several of these genome segments are highly conserved within serotypes, which make them potential targets for molecular detection. All recently published real-time RT-PCR and traditional RT-PCR assays use different BTV genome segments as a target. Orrù and coworkers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] designed an assay targeting genome segment 10 (encodes NS3) using a stem-loop Molecular Beacon (MB) fluorescent probe. The probe can be used for both real-time RT-PCR detection and quantification purposes. Two groups have published duplex assays using two primer sets, where one assay targets BTV genome segment 7 (encoding the main BTV-specific antigen, VP7) and the other targets the segment 1 (encoding the viral polymerase, VP1) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Using genome segment 1 as a target not only allows detection of all 24 serotypes, but will also detect geographic variants within individual serotypes by differentiating the samples to eastern (Middle-East, Asia, Australasia) and western (Africa, The Americas) genotypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Considering the high genetic variability through reassortment and mutations of RNA viruses, it is possible that current real-time RT-PCR assays might fail to detect some strains of BTV in the future. To address the problem of the genetic variability of BTV, the most recent real-time RT-PCR assay is based on the primer-probe energy transfer (PriProET) which is characterised by its tolerance towards mutations in probe region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. This assay is designed to detect all 24 serotypes.
