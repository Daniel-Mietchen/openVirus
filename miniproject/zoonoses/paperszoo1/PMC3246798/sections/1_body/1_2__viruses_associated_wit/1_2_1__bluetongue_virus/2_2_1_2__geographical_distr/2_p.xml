<p>Bluetongue virus was first reported in Africa when the disease was described in European Merino sheep that had been introduced into the Cape Colony [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Historically, the disease has predominantly been found between latitudes 40°N and 35°S until 1998 when the virus entered Europe and caused repeated outbreaks involving mainly five serotypes (BTV-1, BTV-2, BTV-4, BTV-9, and BTV-16) around the Mediterranean Basin affecting 12 European countries, three North African countries, and Israel [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. BTV-8 emerged in south-east England in 2007 and spread to locations throughout the UK. However, the UK government introduced a voluntary vaccination programme in 2008, which controlled the disease and no further outbreaks have been reported within the UK [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In 2008, small localised outbreaks of BTV serotype-6 were reported in cattle herds in the Netherlands and Germany [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This was the second serotype to bypass southern Europe and emerge directly to northern Europe.
