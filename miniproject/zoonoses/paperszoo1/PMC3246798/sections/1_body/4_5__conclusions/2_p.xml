<p>Test development and implementation could take two forms. The first option is to develop specific tests that detect a single virus, often at high sensitivity. The alternative is the development of assays that detect a range of related pathogens in single step. This has been applied to groups including the flaviviruses, alphaviruses, and phleboviruses. The latter option has the benefit of screening for more than one pathogen. However, this approach is often less sensitive and may require further analysis to identify the exact virus involved. </p>
