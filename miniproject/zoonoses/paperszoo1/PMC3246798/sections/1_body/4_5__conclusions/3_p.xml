<p>Currently, rapid detection methods are dominated by nucleic acid amplification methods, particularly the polymerase chain reaction. By linking nucleic acid amplification to sequencing, it is possible to rapidly identify a large number of potential pathogenic viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B114">114</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B188">188</xref>]. This approach has been applied to detection of flaviviruses using universal primers ([
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B186">186</xref>], and references therein). New technologies such as microarray [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B189">189</xref>] and next generation sequencing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B190">190</xref>] are being applied to the investigation of infectious viruses. However, these technologies are expensive to establish and maintain for purely diagnostic or surveillance purposes. Future development is required in this area to make these technologies more accessible and affordable for use in the detection of arthropod viruses of livestock.
