<p>The majority of the viruses reviewed have been thoroughly characterized and there are a wide range of molecular diagnostic tests available. These include bluetongue virus, AHSV, VSV, WNV, and ASFV. These tend to be those viruses that cause the greatest impact either to livestock health or as a consequence of spillover into the human population as a zoonotic agent. New serotypes and variants emerge and techniques may require modification or augmentation in response to genetic differences. Other viruses have molecular tests available, but these are not widely in use, either because many countries do not consider them necessary or do not have suitable containment facilities to handle the virus. This group includes EHFV, BEFV, Akabane virus, the equine encephalitides, JEV, RVFV, CCHFV, and variants of tick-borne encephalitis virus. Further effort is needed to establish molecular tests for these viruses more widely in preparation for potential outbreaks. Finally, there is a small group for which no molecular diagnostic tests have been reported. This includes equine encephalosis virus, Wesselsbron disease virus and Nairobi sheep disease virus. These viruses require some test development. </p>
