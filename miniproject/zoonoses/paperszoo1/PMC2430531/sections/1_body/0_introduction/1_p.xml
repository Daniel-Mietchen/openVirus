<p>In the United States of America, the mortality rate resulting from infectious diseases has declined precipitously over the course of the twentieth century 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Armstrong1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, and major scourges such as typhoid fever and malaria are no longer serious public health threats 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Humphreys1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. However, among the poorest populations living in the US there remains highly prevalent a group of serious parasitic and bacterial diseases such as Chagas disease, cysticercosis, and toxocariasis 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Hotez1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, which, like the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), are characterized by their high prevalence, chronic and disabling features, and disproportionate effect on the poor 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Hotez1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Hotez2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. These infections occur outside of tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and I refer to them as 
 <italic>neglected infections of poverty</italic>, because they not well known to the US public-health community, and they promote poverty because of their impact on child development, pregnancy outcomes, and worker productivity 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Hotez3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In this review I highlight the largely underappreciated burden of the neglected infections of poverty in the US and make policy recommendations for addressing such health disparities.
