<p>An important obstacle to the control or elimination of the neglected infections of poverty in the US is the absence of reliable population-based estimates of prevalence and disease burden data about these conditions 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Hotez1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Hotez4" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. These neglected infections are underdiagnosed and most are not reportable to the CDC. The estimates I provide here are preliminary and based on very few active surveillance studies, including some obtained by analyses of sera collected from National Health and Examination Surveys. For some of the neglected infections of poverty, seropositivity may be equated with active infection

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-DeGiorgio1" ref-type="bibr">[113]</xref>, whereas for others it may reflect both current and past infections

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Despommier1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>. For infections such as Chagas disease estimates reported here vary widely. We also lack a system for the national collection of fecal samples for intestinal parasitic infections. Expanded measures are urgently needed to implement active surveillance and obtain population-based estimates of the neglected infections (

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[152]</xref>, and possibly congenital Chagas disease. Screening for congenital toxoplamosis would also likely benefit persons of all socioeconomic circumstances
