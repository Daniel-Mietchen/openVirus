<p>The parasitic worm infection ascariasis is one of the world's most common neglected tropical diseases 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Hotez2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, and a leading global cause of impaired child development 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Bethony1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In very young children, high-intensity

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Walzer1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, while other investigators also reported that ascariasis was still highly endemic in the region
