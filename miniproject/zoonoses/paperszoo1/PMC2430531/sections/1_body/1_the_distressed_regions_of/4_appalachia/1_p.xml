 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Glasmeier1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Poverty and isolation is particularly severe in Central Appalachia, which includes parts of West Virginia, Eastern Kentucky and Tennessee, and the southwestern tip of Virginia 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Glasmeier1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The plight of the poorest people in this region, typically those working in the coal mining industry, was brought to national attention both during the early 1960s when John F. Kennedy made a presidential campaign swing through the region
