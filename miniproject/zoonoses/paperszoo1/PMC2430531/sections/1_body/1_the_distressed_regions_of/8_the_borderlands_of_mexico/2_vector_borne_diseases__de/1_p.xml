<p>Poor housing without plumbing, air conditioning, or window screens is a key factor in promoting vector-borne diseases

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Glasmeier1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Over the 20-y period between 1980 and 1999 there were 65,514 cases of dengue fever reported from the Mexico side of the border, compared to only 64 cases in the US

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Brunkard1" ref-type="bibr">[95]</xref>. An earlier assessment suggested that the higher-quality dwellings on the US side accounted for this disparity 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Gubler1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>; however, more recent studies indicate that dengue is under-reported in the US near the Mexican border 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Brunkard1" ref-type="bibr">[95]</xref>. A cross-sectional survey in Brownsville, Texas and Matamoros Tamaulipas, Mexico detected 2% and 7.3% recent infections, respectively, with evidence of past infection in 40% of Brownsville residents 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Brunkard1" ref-type="bibr">[95]</xref>. Risk factors and predictors of dengue among the Brownsville residents include low weekly family income, absence of air conditioning, and inadequate street drainage

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Brunkard1" ref-type="bibr">[95]</xref> translates to approximately 200,000 people with recent dengue fever (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000256-t001">Table 1</xref>), there are almost six million impoverished Mexican Americans in the US. If 2% of this population suffers from a recent dengue infection, I estimate there are 110,000 recent dengue infections in the US (
