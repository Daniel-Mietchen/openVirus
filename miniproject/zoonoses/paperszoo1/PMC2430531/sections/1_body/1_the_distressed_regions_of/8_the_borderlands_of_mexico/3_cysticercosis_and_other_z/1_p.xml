<p>Cysticercosis results when humans accidentally ingest eggs of the pork tapeworm, 
 <italic>Taenia solium</italic>, which are shed or excreted by close household or family contacts. This condition is now a leading cause of epilepsy, seizures, and other neurological sequelae in the US–Mexico borderlands

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-White1" ref-type="bibr">[120]</xref>, accounting for approximately 10% of seizures presenting to emergency rooms in Los Angeles and, presumably, other border cities as well

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Wallin1" ref-type="bibr">[119]</xref>, I previously estimated that up to 3,500 new cases of cysticercosis occur annually 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Hotez4" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In a seroprevalence study of rural Ventura County, California, it was found that 1.8% of that population have cysticercosis

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-DeGiorgio2" ref-type="bibr">[114]</xref>. I previously reported that there are 41,400 Hispanics in the US with cysticercosis 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Hotez4" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, but based on the observation that 9.4 million Hispanics live in poverty in the US 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Pew1" ref-type="bibr">[96]</xref>, the number of people with cysticercosis may be substantially higher. If 1.8% of this population is also infected, there may be as many as 169,000 cases of cysticercosis among Hispanics in the US (
