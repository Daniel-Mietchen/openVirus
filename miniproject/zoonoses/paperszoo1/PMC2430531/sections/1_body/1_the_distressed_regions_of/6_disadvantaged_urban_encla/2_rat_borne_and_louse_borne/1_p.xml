 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Demers1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. Similarly, bartonellosis, caused by the gram-negative bacterium

 <italic>B. quintana</italic> is the cause of louse-borne trench fever, so named because it was common among soldiers living under extreme conditions in the trenches during World War I

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. Beginning in the 1990s, small outbreaks of 
 <italic>B. quintana</italic> bacteremia and endocarditis was noted among the homeless living in Seattle, Washington, and elsewhere

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Brouqui1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. With global warming and increased flooding such rat- and louse-borne infections may increase among the homeless
