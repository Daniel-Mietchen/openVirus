<p>High-poverty areas in American inner cities are sometimes defined as neighborhoods where more than 40% of the population is poor 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Jargowsky1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. Jargowsky described such neighborhoods as ones that “tend to have a threatening appearance marked by dilapidated housing, vacant units with broken or boarded up windows, abandoned or burned out cars, and men ‘hanging out’ on street corners” 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Jargowsky1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. One measure of inner city poverty used by sociologists and economists is a dissimilarity index, which measures the degree of segregation by race and income, with blacks living in the poorest neighborhoods 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Glasmeier1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The cities with the highest dissimilarity index are the Northeastern cities and the Midwestern cities near the Great Lakes (
