<p>Toxocariasis is an important neglected infection of poverty among socioeconomically disadvantaged black children

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Sharghi1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. Playgrounds and sandboxes in poor urban neighborhoods are often contaminated with eggs of the dog roundworm,

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Chorazy1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. When children accidentally ingest these roundworms eggs the released larvae migrate through tissues to cause visceral larval migrans and eosinophilic granuloma of the liver

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Buijs1" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>, and may possibly be linked to the rise in asthma observed in inner city children 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Busse1" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>, as well as impaired cognitive development and lower intelligence 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Sharghi1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>,

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Marmor1" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>. Based on serologic studies that measure antibody to 
 <italic>T. canis</italic> antigens, the prevalence rate of toxocariasis among inner city blacks living in Connecticut cities was found to be 10% and even higher among inner city Hispanics 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Sharghi2" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>. As noted previously, the prevalence among socioeconomically disadvantaged blacks in the American South was as high as 30% 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Herrmann1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. In an unpublished study from the CDC it was recently estimated that approximately 21% of blacks are seropositive (

 <italic>T. canis</italic> antibody

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and prevalence estimates between 10% and 21%, as many as 1.3 million to 2.8 million individuals may be exposed or infected (
