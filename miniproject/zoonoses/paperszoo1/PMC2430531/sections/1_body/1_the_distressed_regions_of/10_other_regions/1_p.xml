 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Furness1" ref-type="bibr">[146]</xref>. The greatest number of cases occurs between June and October and among children aged 1–4 and 5–9 y and adults aged 35–39 y

Although both giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis are common, there is no evidence to suggest that they disproportionately affect poor and under-represented minority populations. In contrast, the intestinal protozoan disease amebiasis does disproportionately affect the poor, but no US prevalence data are available for this disease. Among the notifiable neglected infections of poverty there were 166 cases of leprosy (with most of the cases in Texas, California, New York and Louisiana
