<p>Since the 1980s, the US has relocated and successfully treated populations of refugees from Southeast Asia and other developing regions with high prevalence rates of helminth infections—especially hookworm infection, filarial infections, and strongyloidiasis

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Seybolt1" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>—tuberculosis, and hepatitis B 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Barnett1" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>. Beginning in 2000, the immigration of refugees from sub-Saharan Africa markedly increased 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-FrancoParedes1" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>, and today the US settles an estimated 70,000 refugees annually, including 25,000 refugees from Africa 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Posey1" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>. Notable among the refugees are the “Lost Boys and Girls of Sudan,” raised initially in poor Ethiopian refugee camps before relocating to Kenya 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-FrancoParedes1" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>. Since 2000, almost 4,000 Lost Boys and Girls have been settled in the US. By serologic testing it was determined that almost one-half of these special immigrants are seropositive for both schistosomiasis (mostly 
 <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> infection) and strongyloidiasis 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Posey1" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>. In addition, an estimated 8,000 Somali Bantu have been relocated to the US, with up to three-fourths of them seropositive for schistosomiasis (most likely 
 <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> infection) and one-fourth positive for strongyloidiasis 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Posey1" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>. It is generally accepted that seropositivity for these two parasitic infections is a result of chronic and persistent untreated infections 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-FrancoParedes1" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>. Therefore, of the roughly 4,000 Sudanese immigrants and 8,000 Somali immigrants there are approximately 8,000 cases of schistosomiasis and 3,000 cases of strongyloidiasis (
