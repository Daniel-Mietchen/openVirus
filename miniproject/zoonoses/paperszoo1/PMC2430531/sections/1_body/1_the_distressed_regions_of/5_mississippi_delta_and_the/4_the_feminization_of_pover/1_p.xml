<p>The term “feminization of poverty” refers to the observation that in the US and elsewhere women often have fewer economic resources than do men and are more likely to be heads of single-parent families 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Starrels1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Poverty is particularly feminized among black women 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Starrels1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000256-t001">Table 1</xref>, almost one-half of black female heads of single-parent households live below the poverty level, and black mothers are twice as likely to have premature or low birth weight infants or to have infants that die in infancy than white mothers 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Braveman1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Congenital infections, typically the result of primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, toxoplasmosis, or syphilis during pregnancy, are important factors underlying these high rates of poor birth outcome. These congenital infections cause devastating long-term neurological dysfunction including cognitive impairments, intellectual retardation, and hearing and vision loss

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Centers3" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. In this way, the major congenital infections are also important poverty-promoting factors causing billions of dollars in economic losses 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Prober1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. In the US, black children and their mothers bear a disproportionate congenital disease burden 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Staras1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. With respect to congenital CMV, black women exhibit a 4-fold increase in primary infection during pregnancy compared to white women, and when stratified for women between the ages of 12 and 19 there is almost a 50-fold increase 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Colugnati1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Of the estimated 27,002 primary CMV infections in pregnancy in the US estimated to occur annually, 6,652 of them occur in black women (

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Colugnati1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Similarly, almost 55% of the cases of congenital syphilis occur among blacks 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Centers3" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, and blacks suffer from higher rates of toxoplasmosis than do whites (

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Jones2" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. In addition to primary infections during pregnancy and congenital infections, black women also exhibit an approximately 10-fold higher prevalence of trichomoniasis (13.3%) than white (1.3%) women 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Sutton1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. Based on Murray's estimate that 13.3 million blacks live either in America 7 (rural South) and in America 8 (high-risk urban environments 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>), I estimate that approximately 880,000 black women in the US are infected with the protozoan parasite
