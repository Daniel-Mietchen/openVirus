<p>Following the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, prolonged flooding combined with poverty to create conditions that could promote the emergence of additional neglected infections, including vector-borne viral diseases such as dengue fever

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Diaz1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Chagas disease is of particular concern, because of the noted rise in domestic triatomines, especially

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Dorn1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Diaz1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. In Louisiana, almost 30% of the armadillos and 38% of the opossums are infected with 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, and a case of Chagas disease was recently reported in post-Katrina New Orleans 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Dorn1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Therefore, many of the requirements for autochthonous Chagas disease transmission are in place in Louisiana 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Diaz1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, with an established case already present. In the coming decade, global warming and increased flooding in the region could combine to promote dengue and Chagas disease epidemics among the poor in Louisiana
