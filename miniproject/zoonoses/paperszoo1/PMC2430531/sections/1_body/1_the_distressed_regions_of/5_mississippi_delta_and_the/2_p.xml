<p>In the first half of the twentieth century as many as 42% of black schoolchildren in the Delta had splenomegaly indicative of active malaria infection, and almost twice as many blacks died from malaria as whites 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Humphreys1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The high rates of malaria among blacks were attributed to exposure to 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes as a result of crowding and inadequate housing located next to swampy land, and diminished host resistance because of malnourishment and overwork 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Humphreys1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Throughout the American South during the early twentieth century, malaria combined with hookworm infection and pellagra to produce a generation of anemic, weak, and unproductive children and adults

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Bleakley1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. By the 1960s these infections were no longer endemic in the Delta, but the health status (as measured by cancer and heart disease mortality rates and infant mortality rates) of the eight states that make up the this region still consistently ranks at the bottom among all the United States 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Felix1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Tuberculosis rates among southern blacks are also considerably higher than whites

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Centers2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, as incarceration and other involuntary social forces also account for high rates of tuberculosis and some sexually transmitted infections

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Thomas2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. For the blacks living in the Delta and elsewhere in the American South, several parasitic and congenital infections rank among the most important neglected infections of poverty, especially in post-Katrina Louisiana.
