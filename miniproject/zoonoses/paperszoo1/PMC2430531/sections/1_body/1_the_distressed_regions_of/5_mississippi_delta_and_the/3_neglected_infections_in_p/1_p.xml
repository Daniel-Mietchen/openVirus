<p>Despite the apparent eradication of malaria and hookworm infection from the American South 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Humphreys1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>,

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Martin2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, other important parasitic infections remain, particularly in Louisiana. Even before Hurricane Katrina, the Delta region of Louisiana exhibited some of the highest poverty rates in the nation—in 2000, approximately 36% of blacks lived below the poverty level in this area 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Glasmeier1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. It was previously determined that, outside of Appalachia, Louisiana exhibited some of the highest rates of ascariasis in the US 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Otto1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, and during the 1970s and 1980s considerable numbers of the rural residents of Louisiana and elsewhere in the American South were infected

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Schultz1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Some children exhibited parasite intensities high enough to produce acute intestinal obstruction

 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Blumenthal2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Although 
 <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> infections were highest in rural Louisiana, they were also prevalent among kindergarten children living in New Orleans 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Hubbard1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. In addition, during the 1970s and 1980s Louisiana children were at risk for infection with the dog roundworm, 
 <italic>Toxocara canis</italic>
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, and up to 30% of rural black children, mostly in the South, were seropositive for this infection (toxocariasis will be discussed in the section on inner cities) 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000256-Herrmann1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Unfortunately, no surveys for either ascariasis or toxocariasis in Louisiana have been published since the 1980s.
