<p>The influenza virus, known to be a circulating pathogen in the human population since the 16th century, is notable for its unique ability to cause recurrent epidemics and global pandemics. The ability of this virus to undergo genetic reassortments causes unpredictable changes in its antigens and the consequent immune response leads to recurrent epidemics of febrile respiratory disease every 1–3 years. In the 20th, three influenza pandemics occurred and killed tens of millions of people, with each of these pandemics being caused by the appearance of a new 
 <underline>strain</underline> of the virus in humans

 <underline>swine flu</underline>’ and also known as 
 <underline>influenza A/H1N1</underline>, emerged in Mexico, the United States, and several other nations. The
