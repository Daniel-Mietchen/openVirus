<p>Presently, two classes of antiviral drugs have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in treating or preventing influenza virus infections: M2 ion channel blockers and neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs). The M2 blockers, amantidine and rimantidine, are effective against influenza A viruses, but not influenza B viruses, which lack the M2 protein. However, use of the M2 blockers has been associated with the rapid emergence of drug-resistance mutations of the M2 protein among human influenza A viruses of H3N2 subtype and H1N1 subtypes circulating in certain geographic areas

The NAIs target the active site of the NA protein, inhibiting its sialidase activity that is essential for virus release. Most of the influenza virus strains are sensitive to oseltamivir. However, it has been thought that the development of drug resistance may limit the clinical utility of the drug in the future
