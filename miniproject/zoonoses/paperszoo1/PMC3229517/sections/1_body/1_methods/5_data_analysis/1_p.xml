<p>Data were summarized using relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for binary outcomes or mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Revman 5.0.17 software was used for data analyses. Meta-analysis was used if the trials had a good homogeneity on study design, participants, interventions, control, and outcome measures, which assessed by examining I
 <sup>2</sup> (a quantity that describes approximately the proportion of variation in point estimates due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error). Publication bias would explored by funnel plot analysis if sufficient studies were found. If we had identified a sufficient number of randomized trials, we had planned to perform sensitivity analyses to explore the influence of trial quality on effect estimates. The quality components of methodology included adequacy of generation of allocation sequence, concealment of allocation, double blinding, and the use of intention -to -treat (yes or no).
