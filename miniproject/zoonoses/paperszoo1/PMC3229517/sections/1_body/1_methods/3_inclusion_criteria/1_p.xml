<p>Parallel randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Chinese herbs compared with no treatment, symptomatic treatment, placebo, or antivirus for H1N1 patients were included. Combined therapy of Chinese herbs and other interventions compared with other interventions in RCTs was also included. Chinese herbs included herbal products extracted from natural herbs, Chinese patent medicine, or individually prescribed herbal formula. The primary outcome measures were duration of fever (the average time for fever to clear), duration of flu-like symptoms (the average time for flu-like symptoms to disappear), and global effectiveness rate (defined as a three-class measurement including ‘cure’, ‘effective’, and ‘ineffective’ according to the degree of overall symptom improvement). The secondary outcome measures were hospital stay (number of days in hospital), viral shedding, and adverse events. Multiple publications reporting the same groups of participants were excluded. There was no limitation on language and publication type.</p>
