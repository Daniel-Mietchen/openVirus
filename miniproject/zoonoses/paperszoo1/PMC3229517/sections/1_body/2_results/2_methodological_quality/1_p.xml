<p>The majority of the included trials were assessed to be of general poor methodological quality according to the predefined quality assessment criteria. The randomized allocation of participants was mentioned in all trials; however, only 6 trials stated the methods for sequence generation including random number table

However, as the testing Chinese herbs and controlled drug were in different forms (liquid versus tablet), neither the participants nor the investigators were likely to be blinded. Only two trials reported drop-out or withdraw

 <xref rid="pone.0028093-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, however the trial did not intend to analyze the cause, and no trials used intention-to-treat analysis. Only one trial 
 <xref rid="pone.0028093-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> had a pre-trial estimation of sample size, which indicated the lack of statistical power to ensure appropriate estimation of the therapeutic effect. Selective reporting was generally unclear in the RCTs due to the inaccessibility to the trial protocol.
