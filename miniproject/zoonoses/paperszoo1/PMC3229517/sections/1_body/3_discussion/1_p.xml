<p>In this review, several Chinese herbal medicines demonstrated potential positive effect for 2009 type A H1N1 influenza on fever resolution, relief of flu-like symptoms, and global effectiveness rate. However, due to the lack of placebo controlled trial and lack of repeated test, we could not make confirmative conclusions on the therapeutic effect of Chinese herbs for H1N1 influenza. In addition, we found out that few Chinese herbs recommended in the ‘Guidelines for Management of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Influenza’ issued by the Ministry of Health of China were supported in this review, which revealed the lack of evidence for clinical use and policy making in China.</p>
