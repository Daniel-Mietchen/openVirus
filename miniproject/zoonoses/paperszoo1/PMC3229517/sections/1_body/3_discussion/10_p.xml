<p>In summary, the reported beneficial effect from Chinese herbs for H1N1 influenza can not be taken as confirmative conclusion. To ensure evidence-based clinical practice, further rigorous placebo-controlled, randomized trials are warranted. The following methodological issues should be addressed: (i) methods used to generate allocation sequence and allocation concealment; (ii) double blinding with the use of adequate placebo; (iii) clear descriptions of withdrawal/dropout during the trial and use of intention-to-treat analysis; and (iv) reporting trials according to the CONSORT Statement (

 <xref rid="pone.0028093-Moher1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. In the literature searching, we identified several registered trials of Chinese herbs for H1N1 influenza. We hope with the publication of these ongoing trials in the future, new high-qualified evidence will arise to provide clinical evidence for the use of Chinese herbs for the H1N1 influenza.
