<p>Secondly, there was lack of knowledge for placebo control in the included trials. Two trials

 <xref rid="pone.0028093-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> claimed that they used placebo control. However, in these trials the placebo is for oseltamivir, not for Chinese herbs. It is not an appropriate control for the estimation of the effect of Chinese herbs. Because of the lack of placebo controls, the interpretation of the positive findings of treatment with Chinese herbs should be made with caution. In addition, the potential positive placebo effect of an injection should also be highlighted. In the review a total of three Chinese herbal injections were used, that is, Tanreqing Injection

 <xref rid="pone.0028093-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, Xiyanping Injection 
 <xref rid="pone.0028093-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and Reduning Injection 
 <xref rid="pone.0028093-Ye1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>; and all demonstrated positive results in terms of defervescence and global symptoms improvement. However, no adequate placebo control was used to offset the effect of injection alone. It is known that an injection alone has a strong potential placebo effect, therefore the overall effect of Chinese herbal injection could not rule out the effect that the injection itself produced. These positive effects should also be interpreted conservatively.
