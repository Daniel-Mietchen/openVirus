<p>The funnel plot analysis showed asymmetry which suggests the possibility of publication bias of Chinese herbs for H1N1 influenza. Almost all the trials claimed positive effect of Chinese herbs though some of them turned out to be negative when analyzed by standard statistical techniques using risk ratios or mean differences. We undertook extensive searches for unpublished material, but found no unpublished ‘negative’ studies as in previous study 
 <xref rid="pone.0028093-Vickers1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. We thought this might be attributed to the lack of awareness to register clinical trials in China, the rejection of journal editors to negative trials, and the inaccessibility to unpublished data. We hope that with increasing awareness of prospective registration of clinical trials, publication of clinical trial protocol and reporting of negative clinical trials, the picture may change in the future.
