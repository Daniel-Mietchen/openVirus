<p>Finally, there existed great heterogeneity in the Chinese herbs investigated in the review. A total of 27 different Chinese herbs were investigated in the 26 trials. As a result, it is impossible to conduct meaningful meta-analysis for a specific Chinese herb, or difficult to undertake subgroup analyses to explore specific factors that may have an impact on the effects of the treatment regimen. What is more interesting is that although diversified Chinese herbs were investigated, most of them were not the authoritatively recommended Chinese herbs for the H1N1 influenza. In October 2009, the Ministry of Health of China issued ‘Guidelines for Management of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Influenza A’ and recommended series of Chinese herbs for the treatment of H1N1 influenza A

These Chinese herbs included herbal products extracted from natural herbs, Chinese patent medicines (including herbal injection), and principles for prescribing individually herbal decoction. However, only three Chinese patent medicines (Lianhuaqingwen Capsule

World Health Organization (WHO) calls for evidence-based practice of TCM, that is, any medical decision-making of TCM should be based on clinical research evidence. In the era of evidence-based medicine (EBM), TCM is facing a big challenge because of the lack of a rigorous research evidence base. Our review revealed the lack of evidence for clinical use and policy making of Chinese herbs for H1N1 influenza in China. There is still a long way to go for evidence-based practice of TCM.
