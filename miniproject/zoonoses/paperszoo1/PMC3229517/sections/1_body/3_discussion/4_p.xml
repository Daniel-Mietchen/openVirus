In the practice of TCM, herbal preparations should match the type of syndrome differentiation, that is, ‘bianzheng’, a specific diagnosis in TCM.

Chinese medicine practitioners believed that treating patients without syndrome differentiation will impair the advantages of Chinese herbs, and this might be another reason for the unsatisfactory therapeutic effect of Chinese herbs for H1N1 influenza in the review. Emphasis should be paid to encourage authors to explain each ‘Bianzheng’ by using common medical terms in the future trials, therefore making it understandable by physicians and consumers.</p>
