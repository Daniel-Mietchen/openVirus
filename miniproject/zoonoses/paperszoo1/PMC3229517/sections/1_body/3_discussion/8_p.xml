<p>The mechanism of Chinese herbs in the treatment of influenza is complex. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), H1N1 influenza belongs to the scope of ‘cold’. In TCM, cold is differentiated into two types: Wind-cold Syndrome and Wind-heat Syndrome. The principles behind treating these two types were different. Generally speaking, the principles behind treating wind-cold syndrome are to: relieve external symptoms with drugs which are pungent in flavour and warm in property; ventilate the lungs and expel the pathogenic cold. The principles behind treating wind-heat syndrome are to: relieve external symptoms with drugs which are pungent in flavour and cool in property and promote the dispersing function of the lungs and clear up pathogenic wind heat
