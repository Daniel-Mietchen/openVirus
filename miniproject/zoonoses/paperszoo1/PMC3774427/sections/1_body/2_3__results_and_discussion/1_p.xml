<p>We investigated 5,178 horse sera from eight different federal states of Germany (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-10-03112-f001">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-10-03112-t001">Table 1</xref>) with some serological methods. Equine sera mostly collected from horse carcasses were well suitable for testing in a commercial competitive ELISA, without producing high background reaction, which is a frequently observed phenomenon, although in some cases sample quality was quite poor.
