<p>Only few TBEV cases in horses have been described to date, although infections seem to be more common. In Germany 
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, a TBEV-related disease in a horse has been reported recently [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22-ijerph-10-03112">22</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24-ijerph-10-03112">24</xref>]. Müller 
 <italic>et al.</italic> investigated a population of 240 horses in the endemic region of Marburg-Biedenkopf and identified 2.9% horses with TBEV neutralizing antibodies. Klaus 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22-ijerph-10-03112">22</xref>] described a TBEV infected horse from Bavaria with clinical signs, which was detected in routine examination. Consequently, TBEV infection should be considered as differential diagnosis for WNV infections in horses in TBEV endemic areas. Our results are in accordance with a similar study in Austria, where an unexpectedly high infection rate with TBEV was identified in a large herd of horses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19-ijerph-10-03112">19</xref>]. The eight horses from Rhineland-Palatinate originated from defined TBE risk areas, which might explain the positive WNV-ELISA and TBEV-VNT results. The positive results in seven horses from Hesse were in accordance with the epidemiological TBEV situation in this area [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25-ijerph-10-03112">25</xref>]. The districts Lahn-Dill, Kassel, Frankfurt and Gießen have a well-known TBEV-history with the occurrence of human cases (Lahn-Dill-Kreis n = 3; Kassel n = 1; Frankfurt n = 4; Gießen n = 1) between 2002 and 2012. Furthermore, the TBEV endemic region of Marburg-Biedenkopf, which was described by Müller 
 <italic>et al.</italic> 2006, directly abuts on these districts. Of the TBEV positive equine sera from Lower Saxony (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-10-03112-t003">Table 3</xref>), three sera originated from horses coming from areas where also human cases had been reported in the past. One horse originated from Neustadt am Rübenberge, a city in the vicinity of Hannover, and two others from Uetze, a community in the Hannover region, where three indigenous human TBEV cases each occurred in 2009 and 2011, one human case was observed in 2010 and four human cases in 2012 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25-ijerph-10-03112">25</xref>]. The remaining seropositive horse was a recently imported animal from Poland, for which a TBEV exposition at its origin cannot ultimately be excluded. Interestingly, all TBEV antibody positive animals showed no clinical signs of encephalitis or relevant symptoms.
