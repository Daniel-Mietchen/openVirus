<p>TBEV infections in equines are usually asymptomatic, but rare exceptions occur. Waldvogel 
 <italic>et al.</italic> first described tick-borne encephalitis in a horse in Switzerland which showed signs of central nervous symptoms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-ijerph-10-03112">21</xref>]. Recently, such TBEV infected horses have also been detected in a routine examination of 130 horse sera from 13 herds in Thuringia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22-ijerph-10-03112">22</xref>]. One horse, which originated from a holding in Bavaria, also developed clinical signs that may have been caused by a tick-borne encephalitis virus infection. Hence, covert TBEV infections in horses can play a role in the serological investigation of antibodies against flaviviruses. As WNF in horses is a notifiable disease in Germany, cross-reacting antibodies causing false positive ELISA results may lead to unjustified consequences. Therefore a strategy to discriminate serological cross reactions of WNV with other members of the 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> group is essential.
