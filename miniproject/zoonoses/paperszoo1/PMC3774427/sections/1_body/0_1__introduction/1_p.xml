<p>West Nile virus (WNV) is considered to be the most widespread flavivirus in the World and has been reported from all continents, except for Antarctica [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-ijerph-10-03112">4</xref>]. WNV is an arbovirus that is transmitted in an enzootic cycle between ornithophilic mosquitoes and certain wild bird species. WNV infections have been described in a wide variety of vertebrates, and the virus has been found in more than 150 species of wild and domestic birds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-ijerph-10-03112">5</xref>]. The composition of bird and mosquito species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-ijerph-10-03112">6</xref>] differs between the geographical regions where WNV occurs. Most of the susceptible vertebrates do not develop sufficient viremia levels to support virus transmission and are therefore considered as dead-end hosts [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-ijerph-10-03112">8</xref>]. Infection is usually asymptomatic and especially humans and horses can develop disease as a cause of WNV infection, ranging from a mild febrile illness (West Nile fever) to encephalitis with fatal outcome [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-ijerph-10-03112">11</xref>]. In Europe, a variety of WNV strains of diverse virulence, belonging either to lineage 1 or to lineage 2, has been isolated to date. Many WNV outbreaks occurred during the past decade, and since 2008 the virus is heavily spreading throughout central and south-eastern Europe, constituting a serious veterinary and public health problem [
