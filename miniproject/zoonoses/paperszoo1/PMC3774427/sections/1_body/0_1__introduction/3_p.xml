<p>A major problem in WNV serology is the cross-reactivity between the various members of the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> which can strongly affect serological testing and definite diagnosis of WNV infections. It is well-known that the commercial WNV ELISA used in our study shows a high degree of cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19-ijerph-10-03112">19</xref>]. There are not only serological cross-reactions amongst the members of the Japanese encephalitis virus serogroup, but also cross-reactions to viruses of other groups, such as the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) serogroup. TBEV occurs in natural foci, and is endemic to many countries in Europe and parts of central and eastern Asia [
