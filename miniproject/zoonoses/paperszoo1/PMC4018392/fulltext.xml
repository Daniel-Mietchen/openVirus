Its transmission mainly occurs by the bite of an infected tick. However, consuming milk products from infected livestock animals caused TBEV cases. To better understand TBEV transmission via the alimentary route, we studied viral infection of human intestinal epithelial cells. Caco-2 cells were used to investigate pathological effects of TBEV infection. TBEV-infected Caco-2 monolayers showed morphological changes including cytoskeleton rearrangements and cytoplasmic vacuolization. Ultrastructural analysis revealed dilatation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and further enlargement to TBEV containing caverns. Caco-2 monolayers maintained an intact epithelial barrier with stable transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) during early stage of infection. Concomitantly, viruses were detected in the basolateral medium, implying a transcytosis pathway. When Caco-2 cells were pre-treated with inhibitors of cellular pathways of endocytosis TBEV cell entry was efficiently blocked, suggesting that actin filaments (Cytochalasin) and microtubules (Nocodazole) are important for PI3K-dependent (LY294002) virus endocytosis. Moreover, experimental fluid uptake assay showed increased intracellular accumulation of FITC-dextran containing vesicles. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed co-localization of TBEV with early endosome antigen-1 (EEA1) as well as with sorting nexin-5 (SNX5), pointing to macropinocytosis as trafficking mechanism. In the late phase of infection, further evidence was found for translocation of virus via the paracellular pathway. Five days after infection TER was slightly decreased. Epithelial barrier integrity was impaired due to increased epithelial apoptosis, leading to passive viral translocation. These findings illuminate pathomechanisms in TBEV infection of human intestinal epithelial cells and viral transmission via the alimentary route.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG Schu 559/11).

An infection with TBEV mostly causes flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache, nausea, vomiting and fatigue but can also result in a variety of neurological diseases including meningoencephalitis. Severity of the clinical outcome is strain-dependent and case fatality rates are ranging from less than 2% for the European strains to up to 20%&#x02013;40% for some strains from Russia and the Far East <xref rid="pone.0096957-Lindquist1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096957-Gritsun1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

However, alimentary transmission of the virus by consumption of raw milk products from infected animals (mainly goats, sheep and cows) is also described <xref rid="pone.0096957-Caini1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096957-Hudopisk1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In 1951/52, the first reported milk-borne TBE outbreak took place in the Roznava district of Slovakia with at least 660 TBE cases. Since then milk-borne epidemics or single cases where reported not only from Eastern Europe but also from Austria and Germany. The number of TBE cases caused by consuming non-pasteurized milk or dairy products decreased until the early 1980s but in recent years the number of reports has increased again <xref rid="pone.0096957-Suss2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>In Hungary, twenty-nine cases with typical TBE symptoms after consuming raw milk products and four identified TBE cases of alimentary infections were reported between 2007 and 2011 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Caini1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096957-Balogh1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Similar cases were observed in Austria, where six humans were infected with TBEV by eating infected goat cheese <xref rid="pone.0096957-Holzmann1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. These outbreaks indicate that more attention has to be put on TBEV infections via the alimentary route.</p><p>While the infection route via tick bite has been elucidated in great detail, little is known about the alimentary route of infection. First experiments concerning the alimentary route were performed in the late 1950s and early 1960s in Russia and Austria. It turned out that experimental infected goats excrete TBEV up to 8 days post infection and when orally infected develop a TBEV infection with the virus detectable in the small intestine <xref rid="pone.0096957-Balogh1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096957-Pogodina1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096957-VanTongeren1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that TBEV even though it is an enveloped RNA virus, retains its infectivity in gastric juice and can pass the stomach towards the intestine <xref rid="pone.0096957-Pogodina2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Therefore, Balogh et al. <xref rid="pone.0096957-Balogh2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> postulated that TBEV probably enters the organism via small intestinal M cells of the Peyer's patches which then transport the viral particles to the intestinal lymphoid tissue, but experimental evidence is missing. In another study on the tick-borne encephalitis virus group, Kenyon et al. <xref rid="pone.0096957-Kenyon1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> demonstrated Kyasanur Forest disease virus antigen in epithelia cells of the gut mucosa in bonnet macaques.</p><p>Other viruses, which enter their host by the alimentary route, replicate in epithelial enterocytes (coronaviruses, rotaviruses and norovirus) or can cross the mucosal barrier (poliovirus) <xref rid="pone.0096957-Iwasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096957-Cencic1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Recently, cellular entry by macropinocytosis has been described for various viruses such as influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus, or vaccinia virus <xref rid="pone.0096957-deVries1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0096957-Mercer1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Moreover, echovirus 1 is internalizing into Caco-2 cell by this mechanism, which displays many features characteristic for macropinocytosis <xref rid="pone.0096957-Krieger1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Thus, we hypothesized that TBEV might also use macropinocytosis to enter intestinal epithelia cells. In our study, we used Caco-2 cells as a model of human intestinal epithelium, in order to analyze, whether or not TBEV can replicate in the human intestinal cells and also to unveil the cellular uptake mechanism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell culture and viruses</title><p>Caco-2 cells (ATCC HTB-37) were grown at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in ambient air and maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% mixture of penicillin and streptomycin.

However, the details of TBEV transmission by the alimentary route are not well known. Therefore, we used Caco-2 cells as an in vitro model to display the interaction between TBEV and human intestinal epithelial cells.</p><p>We found that TBEV infected and replicated efficiently in human intestinal epithelial cells. The Caco-2 cell model, if grown for 3 weeks, is a suitable infection model for the small intestine, because it develops small intestine-like properties e.g. low transepithelial electrical resistances or expression of SGLT-1 sugar transporters <xref rid="pone.0096957-Engle1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096957-Bissonnette1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. In our experiments TBEV replicates rapidly and after 2 days p.i. nearly all cells were infected although infectious dose was relatively low (MOI 0.1). In the early phase of infection up to 48 h the cell monolayers' integrity remained stable as indicated by an unchanged TER, no induction of epithelial apoptosis and no obvious tight junction changes in IF stainings (data not shown). This is in contrast to other viruses causing gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms e.g. experimental rotavirus infection in Caco-2 monolayers caused a rapid decrease of TER and a massive tight junction dysregulation within the first 24 h <xref rid="pone.0096957-Dickman1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>The second important finding of this study was that macropinocytosis is an endocytic pathway in TBEV infection. Virus trafficking via macropinosomes was recently described for a growing number of viruses from other families such as echovirus <xref rid="pone.0096957-Krieger2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, lentiviral HIV <xref rid="pone.0096957-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, or as reviewed for Vaccinia virus, Adenovirus 3, Coxsackievirus B, and Herpes simplex virus 1 etc. <xref rid="pone.0096957-Mercer2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Several lines of evidence indicate that the TBEV internalization by Caco-2 cells is associated with macropinocytosis: (i) TBEV was detected in mid-sized vesicles of approximately 200 to 500 nm by EM in Caco-2 cells. These observations also revealed the virus particles probably assemble in the rER <xref rid="pone.0096957-Lorenz1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. (ii) Intracellular trafficking of TBEV containing vesicles was mediated by e.g. SNX5 signaling, which regulates the formation and maturation of macropinosomes <xref rid="pone.0096957-Goddette1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Also EEA1 presented evidence for early endosomes in co-localization with TBEV. (iii) Inhibition of actin- or microtubule-dependent cytoskeleton polarization blocked virus particle trafficking and the inhibition of PI3K signaling also blocked virus uptake. (iv) Inhibition experiments with EIPA and fluid uptake assays of infected Caco-2 cells provide further evidence for a macropinocytosis mechanism. All these findings support the hypothesis that uptake of viral particles is mediated by the process of macropinocysis. Since the reduction in virus endocytosis in these experiment was partial, the evaluation of e.g. clathrin-mediated endocytosis by other specific inhibitors is up to further investigations.</p><p>In our study we showed how the flavivirus TBEV infect intestinal Caco-2 cells. We now postulate that TBEV transmission and translocation into the organism can occur via the small intestine, but this remains to be experimentally confirmed by an animal infection model. Although some cases of TBEV infection of lab workers by aerosols were described, when cell culture flask containing high amounts of virus were broken in the incubator <xref rid="pone.0096957-AvsicZupanc1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, TBEV transmission via the respiratory tract or oropharyngeal epithelial cells needs to be further investigated. In addition, oral experimental infection of animals resulted in a TBEV infection after an incubation time of several days <xref rid="pone.0096957-Pogodina1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096957-VanTongeren1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. TBEV can resist to gastric juice that showed the possibility of alimentary TBEV infection <xref rid="pone.0096957-Pogodina2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Furthermore, other viruses such as HIV and EBV can induce persistent infections after oral transmission in animal models <xref rid="pone.0096957-Moghaddam1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096957-Ruprecht1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Therefore, it is reasonable that virus translocation via the small intestine is a possible route when humans consume unpasteurized milk products. Milk-borne infections and translocation across tight human epithelial barriers were also reported for other virus, as e.g. Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1) <xref rid="pone.0096957-MartinLatil1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Furthermore, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission from maternal milk was shown <xref rid="pone.0096957-Read1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Milk as a vehicle for pathogen transmission is often observed and milk or its products protect pathogens to survive in the gastric acidic environment in order to get access to enterocytes. As the buffer capacity of milk and milk products is quite high, antibacterial or antiviral activity of the gastric juice is lowered when consuming milk, especially in young children or person with low gastric secretion <xref rid="pone.0096957-Bcker1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Therefore, the gastric passage of pathogens (even in case of the gastric pathogen <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>) depends on the susceptibility of the hosts as well as on the type of the diet <xref rid="pone.0096957-Bcker1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p><p>In our experimental infection model, the beginning structural changes of the cytoskeleton and vacuolization in the early phase lead to further developed pathological changes in the late phase of infection. Although we cannot completely exclude virus translocation e.g. via apoptotic leaks, we found indications that the epithelium was not hampered in its integrity up to 48 h p.i. Thus, we conclude that virus particles were released via exocytosis. However, after prolonged incubation time up to 5 days p.i. apoptosis ratio was massively increased in infected cell monolayers. Concomitantly, TER decreases after 4 days and was lowered to the half of the initial value at day 5. Therefore, paracellular virus translocation through the epithelial barrier may occur in the late phase of infection in the leaky epithelium. The induction of apoptosis by cytokine production, as shown for cytokine-containing supernatants of HIV-infected cells may also contribute to the barrier defect <xref rid="pone.0096957-Schmitz1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Moreover, we found additional pathological changes in late TBEV infection like the subcellular distribution of tight junction proteins in single areas of infected Caco-2 monolayers that can promote virus translocation via the paracellular pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0096957.s002">Figure S2</xref>). These kind of focal barrier defects were prominently observed in infection models of bacterial enteric pathogens e.g. <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic>

The drop in TER by TBEV can be assigned to the massive induction of apoptosis in the late phase of infection, but also re-distribution of barrier-forming tight junction proteins may contribute to the epithelial barrier defect. The lowered epithelial barrier function together with apoptosis induction were induced by the virus directly and/or by the host response to the infection (e.g. cytokine induction) likewise shown for infection of the small intestine by other viruses, e.g. astrovirus or HIV <xref rid="pone.0096957-Schmitz1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096957-Moser1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.

Thus, a passive uptake mechanism into the organism for virus translocation and on the other hand the loss of solutes and water (diarrhea) is supposedly a further pathogenic features of TBEV infection. Similarly, the pathogenic mechanisms in the human small intestine during norovirus infection could be described by epithelial apoptosis induction and tight junction dysregulation <xref rid="pone.0096957-Troeger1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Moreover, the norovirus p20 protein showed interference with epithelial restitution mechanisms when stably transfected into HT-29/B6 colon cells <xref rid="pone.0096957-Hillenbrand1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Likewise tight junction disruption caused by the capsid of the West Nile virus was found in Caco-2 monolayers <xref rid="pone.0096957-Medigeshi1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. From HIV infection it is known that the enteric immune cells were the site of virus progeny and that the HIV causes GI symptoms per se in the acute phase of infection (HIV enteropathy), thereby both apoptosis induction and tight junction changes contribute to the diarrhea <xref rid="pone.0096957-Epple1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Thus, it is supposable that the GI tract may also serve as the site for TBEV propagation and dissemination.</p><p>As TBEV can translocate via the transcellular as well as the paracellular pathway, the entry of the virus into the organism may lead to a systemic infection and subsequently infection of the nervous system.

These studies, together with our findings, indicated that both transcellular as well as paracellular translocation of the virus can occur during infection. The mechanisms by which the viruses perturb the intestinal epithelial barrier by transcytosis and paracellular translocation (e.g. over apoptotic leaks) is also supposable for virus translocation through the endothelial blood-brain barrier. The tight junction can be involved in virus endocytosis and replication. For example the Hepatitis C virus exploits the tight junction proteins occludin and claudin-1 as receptors for cell entry into liver cells <xref rid="pone.0096957-Ploss1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. In our cell model we did not find any co-localization of TBEV and tight junction or other apical membrane compartments such as lipid-rafts (data not shown), thus a cellular receptor for TBEV entry remains unknown. As Melik and co-workers reported that PDZ-domains might be important for TBEV replication and assembly <xref rid="pone.0096957-Melik1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, it is supposable that PDZ-motives of tight junction proteins (e.g. occludin) would be used by the virus and thereby tight junctional dysregulation may be induced. However, tight junction dysregulation by the virus has to be determined separately from apoptosis induction, which can facilitate tight junction changes alone. For further research, the cellular defense mechanisms (clearance of virus particles) in low-dose TEBV-infected epithelial cells are worthwhile to proceed. In preliminary experiments low infectious doses did not affect epithelial integrity nor resulted in high replication rates as seen with MOI above 0.1 (data not shown). Therefore, a possible transmission of TBEV between the cells via actin filament rearrangement should be considered for upcoming observations which seem to play an important role in TBEV infection <xref rid="pone.0096957-Burckhardt1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Taken together, TBEV is able to translocate through the intestinal epithelial barrier providing evidence that virus infection can occur via the alimentary route. In Caco-2 cell monolayers, TBEV entry into intestinal epithelial cells is mediated by macropincytosis and replication of virus leads to high virus titers in apical and basal compartments. Future studies should confirm the findings on barrier breaking properties of TBEV infection on epithelial and endothelial borders in animal models and clinical observations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0096957.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
