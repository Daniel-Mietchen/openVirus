  <title>Vacuolization induced by TBEV infection.</title>
  <p>Caco-2 cells were infected with TBEV K23 virus. Cellular morphological changes and vacuolization were monitored by light microscopy. Caco-2 cells were infected with TBEV strain K23 and fixed at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. Cells were observed with the 40× objective (400× total magnification). Details of cytoplasmic vacuolization are visualized by immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy. 3 representative vacuoles are indicated by white asterisks in each sub-image. Samples were incubated with anti-TBEV E antibody and then stained with secondary anti-mouse antibody conjugated to FITC (green). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue).</p>
