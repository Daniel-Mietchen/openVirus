   <bold>.</bold> Cellular apoptosis induced by TBEV infection. TUNEL assay in TBEV infected Caco-2 cells. Cells were infected with TBEV and apoptosis was detected by TUNEL (red) at 48 h and 120 h post infection. Cells were observed with the 20× objective (200× total magnification). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Micrographs were taken by fluorescence microscopy.
