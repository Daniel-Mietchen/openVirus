  <title>Cytoskeletal integrity is important for TBEV infection in Caco-2 cells.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) Actin re-arrangements following TBEV infection. Cells infected with TBEV strain K23 were fixed at 24 h. Samples were stained for actin microfilament and the apical cell-domain (perijunctional cytoskeleton) was visualized by fluorescence microscopy with Acti-stain 488 phalloidin. Non-infected cells were used as controls. White arrows indicate representative areas of more condensed actin filaments in the right image. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Inhibition of TBEV cell entry by blocking microfilaments. Caco-2 cells were treated with cytochalasin D (Cyt D), nocodazole (Noc) or LY294002 (LY) for 30 min. DMSO treated Caco-2 cells were used as control. After treatment with inhibitors, cells were incubated with TBEV strain K23 for 1 h. Virus entry was monitored by RT-qPCR, n = 3; **
