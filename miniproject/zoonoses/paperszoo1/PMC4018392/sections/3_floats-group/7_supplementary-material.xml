   <bold>The effects of TBEV on tight junction changes may also contribute the drop in TER.</bold> Representative tight junction protein ZO-1 distribution and F-actin as cytoskeletal marker were stained in TBEV-infected and non-infected Caco-2 cells to display structural correlates to the electrophysiological findings. (A) ZO-1 and F-actin were disrupted by TBEV infection. Cells were fixed and stained for ZO-1 with primary antibodies and secondary anti-Rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (red), TBEV E monoclonal antibody and anti- mouse conjugated with FITC (green). F-actin (white) stained with Atto-Phalloidin 647N (Sigma-Aldrich). Nuclei stained with DAPI (blue). Micrographs were taken by confocal microscopy. (B) Corresponding image of (A) as Z-stack in XY-plane.
