<p>While the infection route via tick bite has been elucidated in great detail, little is known about the alimentary route of infection. First experiments concerning the alimentary route were performed in the late 1950s and early 1960s in Russia and Austria. It turned out that experimental infected goats excrete TBEV up to 8 days post infection and when orally infected develop a TBEV infection with the virus detectable in the small intestine

 <xref rid="pone.0096957-VanTongeren1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that TBEV even though it is an enveloped RNA virus, retains its infectivity in gastric juice and can pass the stomach towards the intestine

 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Balogh2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> postulated that TBEV probably enters the organism via small intestinal M cells of the Peyer's patches which then transport the viral particles to the intestinal lymphoid tissue, but experimental evidence is missing. In another study on the tick-borne encephalitis virus group, Kenyon et al.
