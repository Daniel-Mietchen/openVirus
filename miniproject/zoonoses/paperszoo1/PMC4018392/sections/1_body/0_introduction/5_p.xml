<p>Other viruses, which enter their host by the alimentary route, replicate in epithelial enterocytes (coronaviruses, rotaviruses and norovirus) or can cross the mucosal barrier (poliovirus)

 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Mercer1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Moreover, echovirus 1 is internalizing into Caco-2 cell by this mechanism, which displays many features characteristic for macropinocytosis 
 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Krieger1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Thus, we hypothesized that TBEV might also use macropinocytosis to enter intestinal epithelia cells. In our study, we used Caco-2 cells as a model of human intestinal epithelium, in order to analyze, whether or not TBEV can replicate in the human intestinal cells and also to unveil the cellular uptake mechanism.
