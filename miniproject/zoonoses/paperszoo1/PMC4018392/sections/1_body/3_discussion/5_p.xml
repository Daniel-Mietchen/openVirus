<p>In our experimental infection model, the beginning structural changes of the cytoskeleton and vacuolization in the early phase lead to further developed pathological changes in the late phase of infection. Although we cannot completely exclude virus translocation e.g. via apoptotic leaks, we found indications that the epithelium was not hampered in its integrity up to 48 h p.i. Thus, we conclude that virus particles were released via exocytosis. However, after prolonged incubation time up to 5 days p.i. apoptosis ratio was massively increased in infected cell monolayers. Concomitantly, TER decreases after 4 days and was lowered to the half of the initial value at day 5. Therefore, paracellular virus translocation through the epithelial barrier may occur in the late phase of infection in the leaky epithelium. The induction of apoptosis by cytokine production, as shown for cytokine-containing supernatants of HIV-infected cells may also contribute to the barrier defect

Moreover, we found additional pathological changes in late TBEV infection like the subcellular distribution of tight junction proteins in single areas of infected Caco-2 monolayers that can promote virus translocation via the paracellular pathway (

 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 536 
 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Bcker2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. The drop in TER by TBEV can be assigned to the massive induction of apoptosis in the late phase of infection, but also re-distribution of barrier-forming tight junction proteins may contribute to the epithelial barrier defect. The lowered epithelial barrier function together with apoptosis induction were induced by the virus directly and/or by the host response to the infection (e.g. cytokine induction) likewise shown for infection of the small intestine by other viruses, e.g. astrovirus or HIV

 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Moser1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Pathological apoptosis induction can influence TER and increase permeability of the epithelium for macromolecules up to 4 kDa

 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Bojarski1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Thus, a passive uptake mechanism into the organism for virus translocation and on the other hand the loss of solutes and water (diarrhea) is supposedly a further pathogenic features of TBEV infection. Similarly, the pathogenic mechanisms in the human small intestine during norovirus infection could be described by epithelial apoptosis induction and tight junction dysregulation 
 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Troeger1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Moreover, the norovirus p20 protein showed interference with epithelial restitution mechanisms when stably transfected into HT-29/B6 colon cells 
 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Hillenbrand1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Likewise tight junction disruption caused by the capsid of the West Nile virus was found in Caco-2 monolayers 
 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Medigeshi1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. From HIV infection it is known that the enteric immune cells were the site of virus progeny and that the HIV causes GI symptoms per se in the acute phase of infection (HIV enteropathy), thereby both apoptosis induction and tight junction changes contribute to the diarrhea 
 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Epple1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Thus, it is supposable that the GI tract may also serve as the site for TBEV propagation and dissemination.
