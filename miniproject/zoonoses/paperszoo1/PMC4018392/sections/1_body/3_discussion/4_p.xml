<p>In our study we showed how the flavivirus TBEV infect intestinal Caco-2 cells. We now postulate that TBEV transmission and translocation into the organism can occur via the small intestine, but this remains to be experimentally confirmed by an animal infection model. Although some cases of TBEV infection of lab workers by aerosols were described, when cell culture flask containing high amounts of virus were broken in the incubator 
 <xref rid="pone.0096957-AvsicZupanc1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, TBEV transmission via the respiratory tract or oropharyngeal epithelial cells needs to be further investigated. In addition, oral experimental infection of animals resulted in a TBEV infection after an incubation time of several days

Therefore, it is reasonable that virus translocation via the small intestine is a possible route when humans consume unpasteurized milk products. Milk-borne infections and translocation across tight human epithelial barriers were also reported for other virus, as e.g. Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1)

 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Read1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Milk as a vehicle for pathogen transmission is often observed and milk or its products protect pathogens to survive in the gastric acidic environment in order to get access to enterocytes. As the buffer capacity of milk and milk products is quite high, antibacterial or antiviral activity of the gastric juice is lowered when consuming milk, especially in young children or person with low gastric secretion 
 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Bcker1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Therefore, the gastric passage of pathogens (even in case of the gastric pathogen 
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>) depends on the susceptibility of the hosts as well as on the type of the diet
