<p>As TBEV can translocate via the transcellular as well as the paracellular pathway, the entry of the virus into the organism may lead to a systemic infection and subsequently infection of the nervous system. It was demonstrated that TBEV lead to breakdown of the blood-brain barrier in experimental infected mice 
 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Ruzek2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Moreover, another report showed that TBEV infection of rat astrocytes did not influence their cell viability 
 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Potokar1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. These studies, together with our findings, indicated that both transcellular as well as paracellular translocation of the virus can occur during infection. The mechanisms by which the viruses perturb the intestinal epithelial barrier by transcytosis and paracellular translocation (e.g. over apoptotic leaks) is also supposable for virus translocation through the endothelial blood-brain barrier. The tight junction can be involved in virus endocytosis and replication. For example the Hepatitis C virus exploits the tight junction proteins occludin and claudin-1 as receptors for cell entry into liver cells 
 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Ploss1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. In our cell model we did not find any co-localization of TBEV and tight junction or other apical membrane compartments such as lipid-rafts (data not shown), thus a cellular receptor for TBEV entry remains unknown. As Melik and co-workers reported that PDZ-domains might be important for TBEV replication and assembly 
 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Melik1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, it is supposable that PDZ-motives of tight junction proteins (e.g. occludin) would be used by the virus and thereby tight junctional dysregulation may be induced. However, tight junction dysregulation by the virus has to be determined separately from apoptosis induction, which can facilitate tight junction changes alone. For further research, the cellular defense mechanisms (clearance of virus particles) in low-dose TEBV-infected epithelial cells are worthwhile to proceed. In preliminary experiments low infectious doses did not affect epithelial integrity nor resulted in high replication rates as seen with MOI above 0.1 (data not shown). Therefore, a possible transmission of TBEV between the cells via actin filament rearrangement should be considered for upcoming observations which seem to play an important role in TBEV infection 
 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Burckhardt1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Taken together, TBEV is able to translocate through the intestinal epithelial barrier providing evidence that virus infection can occur via the alimentary route. In Caco-2 cell monolayers, TBEV entry into intestinal epithelial cells is mediated by macropincytosis and replication of virus leads to high virus titers in apical and basal compartments. Future studies should confirm the findings on barrier breaking properties of TBEV infection on epithelial and endothelial borders in animal models and clinical observations.
