<p>We found that TBEV infected and replicated efficiently in human intestinal epithelial cells. The Caco-2 cell model, if grown for 3 weeks, is a suitable infection model for the small intestine, because it develops small intestine-like properties e.g. low transepithelial electrical resistances or expression of SGLT-1 sugar transporters

In our experiments TBEV replicates rapidly and after 2 days p.i. nearly all cells were infected although infectious dose was relatively low (MOI 0.1). In the early phase of infection up to 48 h the cell monolayers' integrity remained stable as indicated by an unchanged TER, no induction of epithelial apoptosis and no obvious tight junction changes in IF stainings (data not shown). This is in contrast to other viruses causing gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms e.g. experimental rotavirus infection in Caco-2 monolayers caused a rapid decrease of TER and a massive tight junction dysregulation within the first 24 h
