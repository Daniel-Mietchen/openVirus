<p>The second important finding of this study was that macropinocytosis is an endocytic pathway in TBEV infection. Virus trafficking via macropinosomes was recently described for a growing number of viruses from other families such as echovirus

 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, or as reviewed for Vaccinia virus, Adenovirus 3, Coxsackievirus B, and Herpes simplex virus 1 etc. 
 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Mercer2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Several lines of evidence indicate that the TBEV internalization by Caco-2 cells is associated with macropinocytosis: (i) TBEV was detected in mid-sized vesicles of approximately 200 to 500 nm by EM in Caco-2 cells. These observations also revealed the virus particles probably assemble in the rER 
 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Lorenz1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. (ii) Intracellular trafficking of TBEV containing vesicles was mediated by e.g. SNX5 signaling, which regulates the formation and maturation of macropinosomes 
 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Goddette1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Also EEA1 presented evidence for early endosomes in co-localization with TBEV. (iii) Inhibition of actin- or microtubule-dependent cytoskeleton polarization blocked virus particle trafficking and the inhibition of PI3K signaling also blocked virus uptake. (iv) Inhibition experiments with EIPA and fluid uptake assays of infected Caco-2 cells provide further evidence for a macropinocytosis mechanism. All these findings support the hypothesis that uptake of viral particles is mediated by the process of macropinocysis. Since the reduction in virus endocytosis in these experiment was partial, the evaluation of e.g. clathrin-mediated endocytosis by other specific inhibitors is up to further investigations.
