<p>For infection studies, Caco-2 cells were cultured in a 24 well plate and inoculated with one of the three TBEV strains (MOI of 0.1). After 1 h incubation at 37°C, unbound virus was washed off by PBS and the plate was returned to the incubator at 37°C. Cellular viral RNA was collected and viral titers in the supernatants were determined at different time points by means of quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) and plaque assay as described below.</p>
