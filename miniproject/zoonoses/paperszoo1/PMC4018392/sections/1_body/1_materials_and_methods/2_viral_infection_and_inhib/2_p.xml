<p>For viral inhibition assays, the pharmacological inhibitors cytochalasin D (Cyt D), nocodazole (Noc) and LY294002 (LY) were diluted in DMSO and working concentrations were as follows: Cyt D at 2 µM, Noc at 10 µg/ml and LY at 10 µM. For blockage of the cytoskeleton Cyt D was used as actin depolymerization agent 
 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Goddette1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and Noc was used as a specific inhibitor of microtubules 
 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Vasquez1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. LY was used as inhibitor of Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) activation 
 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. DMSO treatment (0.1% DMSO in medium) without any inhibitor was used as control. 5-(N-Ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA) was diluted in DMSO and concentrations used for the experiments were 0 µM, 25 µM and 50 µM, respectively. All products were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). To analyze the effects of the inhibitors on TBEV entry, Caco-2 cells were pre-treated with the different inhibitors for 30 min. The cells were infected with TBEV strain K23 either in the presence or absence of the appropriate inhibitor at 37°C. After 1 h incubation the cells were washed 3 times with PBS to remove unbound viruses. To analyze virus entry, the cells were harvested for extracting total RNA followed by translation into cDNA. Thus, viral RNA was detected by RT-qPCR as described below.
