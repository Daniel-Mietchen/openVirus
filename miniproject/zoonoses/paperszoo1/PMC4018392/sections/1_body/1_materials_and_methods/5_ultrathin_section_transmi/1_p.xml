<p>For ultrathin section transmission electron microscopy, TBEV-infected Caco-2 cells were processed as descried previously 
 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Laue1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Sections of epon-embedded samples were post-stained with uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate. Samples were observed using a Jeol transmission electron microscope (JEM-2100) operated at 200 kV. Photographs were taken with a CCD camera at a resolution of 2k√ó2k pixel (Veleta, Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions).
