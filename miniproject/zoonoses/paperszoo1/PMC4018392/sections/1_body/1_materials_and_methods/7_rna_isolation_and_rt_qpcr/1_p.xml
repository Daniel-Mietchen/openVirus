<p>Total RNA from Caco-2 cells was prepared according to Manufacturer's instructions using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For cDNA synthesis, the same amount of RNA was added in a final reaction volume of 20 µl using the Superscript II kit (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). The mixture was pre-treated for 10 min at 65°C and cooled down on ice for 5 min. Then the reverse transcription reaction was performed on a thermoblock cycler for 60 min at 37°C and 10 min at 93°C. 2 µl cDNA was detected by quantitative RT-PCR as described previously
