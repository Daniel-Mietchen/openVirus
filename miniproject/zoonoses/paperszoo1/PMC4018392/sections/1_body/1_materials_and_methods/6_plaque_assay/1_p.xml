<p>A549 cells were seeded in a 24 well plate and were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> overnight. 10-fold serial dilutions of the three viral suspensions were added to different wells. After 1 h incubation each well was filled with 500 µl carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) overlay medium (1.6% CMC in DMEM). The plates were continually maintained in the CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator at 37°C. After 4 days, each well was fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 1 h, and then the cells were stained with Naphthalene Black (1 g of naphthol blue black, 13.6 g of sodium acetate, 60 ml of glacial acetic acid and up to 1000 ml with bi-destillated H
 <sub>2</sub>O). Plaques were counted and expressed as plaque-forming units/ml (PFU/ml). The viral titers were calculated by the equation:
