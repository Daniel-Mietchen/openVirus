<p>TUNEL assay (deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) was used to analyze apoptosis induction by TBEV infection. Coverslips with infected Caco-2 cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde at 48 h or 120 h post infection. After washing with PBS, the samples were permeabilized using TritonX buffer (0.1% Triton-X100 in PBS) for 10 min and washed with PBS 3 times. The TUNEL assay was performed following the manufacturer's recommendations. Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. All samples were examined under fluorescence microscope (Keyence Corp.) in low-power fields.</p>
