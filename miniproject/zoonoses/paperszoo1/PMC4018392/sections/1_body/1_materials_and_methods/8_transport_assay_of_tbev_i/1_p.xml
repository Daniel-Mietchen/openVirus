<p>Caco-2 cells were seeded in permeable PCF-filter cell culture inserts with an area of 0.33 cm
 <sup>2</sup> and with a pore size of 0.4 µm (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) and were grown for three weeks. Media was replaced every 2 days. Experiments were performed with cells showing a transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) above 300 Ω·cm
 <sup>2</sup>. After treatment of Caco-2 monolayers with the TBEV (MOI of 1) for 1 h, fresh culture medium was replaced and TER of each transwell was determined every 24 h using an epithelial volt ohmmeter with a pair of chopstick electrodes (EVOM, World Precision Instruments, FL, USA). Untreated monolayers were used as negative controls. In the course of virus infection, the same aliquots of medium were collected from the lower chambers at different time points as indicated. TBEV in the medium were detected using the RT-qPCR method as described above.
