<p>For detecting the envelope protein of the TBEV (E protein), samples were incubated with anti-TBEV E antibody MAB 1367 (1∶1,000) 
 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Niedrig1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and then stained with FITC-labeled anti-mouse (1∶500, Caltag Laboratories, Hamburg, Germany) or Alexa 594-labeled anti-mouse antibody (1∶200) (Invitrogen) as the secondary antibody. Cell nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Cells were observed and imaged using a fluorescence microscope (Keyence Corp, Japan).
