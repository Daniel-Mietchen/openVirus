<p>For analyzing the actin filament re-arrangement induced by TBEV infection, Caco-2 cells were stained with fluorescent phalloidin (Acti-stain 488 phalloidin, Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, USA) at 24 h post infection. For detecting co-localization of TBEV E protein with the endosomal marker proteins EEA1 or SNX5 in infected Caco-2 cells, cells were stained with the anti-TBEV E protein antibody MAB 1367 (1∶500) and with Alexa 594-labeled anti-mouse antibody (1∶200) (Invitrogen) as the secondary antibody. EEA1 or SNX5 were stained with anti EEA1 (BD Bioscience, CA, USA) or SNX5 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) and FITC-labeled anti-rabbit antibody as the secondary antibody (1∶500, Caltag Laboratories). Nuclei were stained with DAPI and samples were visualized by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (Zeiss LSM510, Jena, Germany).</p>
