<p>MTT assay was used to analyze cell viability. Caco-2 cells were cultured into a 96 well culture plate for 2 days. After removal of the cell culture medium, cells were infected with TBEV (MOI of 1). Virus free cells were used as control. At 48 h or 120 h post infection, medium was replaced with 20 µl of 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) (5 mg/ml) solution and cells were further incubated at 37°C for 4 h. Then the MTT solution was removed and 200 µl of DMSO was added and gently swirled. After formazan crystals were dissolved, the colorimetric reaction was measured at 570 nm using a spectrophotometer (Tecan Group Ltd., Maennedorf, Switzerland).</p>
