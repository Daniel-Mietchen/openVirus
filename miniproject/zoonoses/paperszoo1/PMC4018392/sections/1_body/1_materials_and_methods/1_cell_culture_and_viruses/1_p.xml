<p>Caco-2 cells (ATCC HTB-37) were grown at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in ambient air and maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% mixture of penicillin and streptomycin. Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) and A549 (ATTC CCL-185) cells were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in ambient air in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine, 1% penicillin and 1% streptomycin. Three different TBEV strains K23, Aina and Sofjin were propagated in Vero E6 cells as published previously 
 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Achazi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Viral titration was performed in A549 cells using plaque assay as described below. TBEV strain K23 was selected as a prototype for all three TBEV strains and used with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for infection experiments unless otherwise indicated.
