<p>Caco-2 cells were seeded on glass coverslips in a 24 well plate until getting confluent and infected with TBEV for 4 h. Then Caco-2 cells were incubated with FITC-dextran (Molecular Weight 70 000 Da, Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in the absence or presence of TBEV. After 30 min cells were washed 3 times with PBS and subsequently fixed. Simultaneous acquisition of FITC fluorescence emission and transmitted light from all samples was done by confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Vesicle count was done by ImageJ particle analysis tool with fluorescence intensity threshold of Caco-2 monolayers where no Fdx was added.</p>
