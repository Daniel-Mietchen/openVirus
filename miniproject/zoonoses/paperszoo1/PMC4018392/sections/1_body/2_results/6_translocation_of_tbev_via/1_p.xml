<p>During the transmission of TBEV by the oral route, virus may be released into the circulation after crossing the intestinal epithelium. To test this hypothesis, viruses were added to polarized Caco-2 cell monolayers that were grown on permeable filter supports for 3 weeks. Virus incubation was performed for 1 h. Virus release into the basal medium was determined by measuring viral RNA copies over 5 days. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096957-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, the amount of TBEV RNA copies in basal medium persistently increased in the course of infection, although TBEV was not detectable in the basal medium at 0 h post infection. Simultaneously, TER was recorded, in order to determine, whether or not TBEV affects epithelial barrier function. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096957-g006">Figure 6B</xref> shows that TER remained stable for 72 h and decreased 4 days after infection.
