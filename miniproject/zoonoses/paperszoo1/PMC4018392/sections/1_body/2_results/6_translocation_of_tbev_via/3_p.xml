<p>To corroborate these findings, TUNEL assays were performed to assess the apoptosis ratio in TBEV infected Caco-2 cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0096957.s001">Figure S1</xref>). 2 days p.i. the percentage of apoptotic cells was close to 0 and not different from untreated controls, but 5 days p.i. around 5% apoptotic cells were found (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096957-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). These results suggest that TBEV significantly accelerated apoptosis in Caco-2 cells in the late phase of infection. Thus, in the early phase of infection (up to 2 days p.i.) no evidence for apoptosis induction was obtained and TER of the Caco-2 monolayers remained unaffected indicating an intact epithelial barrier. Therefore, virus translocation in the early phase of infection points to virus transcytosis. Whereas the decline in the integrity of the monolayer after 4 days p.i., as measured by a reduction in TER (
