<p>The use of amiloride (data not shown) and its more potent derivative EIPA (5-(N-Ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride) block the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) as well as dose-dependently several other Na

 <sup>+</sup> antiporters. EIPA has often been used as a hallmark inhibitor that specifically inhibits endocytosis via the macropinocytic pathway

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096957-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, TBEV entry into Caco-2 cells is inhibited by EIPA treatment in a dose-dependent manner. One characteristic of macropinocytosis is the nonselective uptake of large amounts of extracellular solutes 
 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Mercer2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. To further investigate the involvement of macropinocytosis in TBEV entry, the uptake of soluble FITC-labeled dextran (Fdx) into Caco-2 cells was monitored. Fdx has often been applied as a morphological marker for macropinosomes and is used in fluid uptake assays. We found that TBEV infection slightly increased the uptake of Fdx into Caco-2 cells from 166±79 vesicles and a total particle area of 5±2 µm
 <sup>2</sup> in mock control versus 1138±101 vesicles with a total particle area of 60±4 µm
 <sup>2</sup> (p&lt;0.01 and P&lt;0.001 respectively; n = 3) in a high-power field of 135 µm
 <sup>2</sup> in TBEV infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096957-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The average particle size of 0.04±0.01 µm
 <sup>2</sup> in control was not different from Fdx vesicles in TBEV-infected Caco-2 monolayers with 0.06±0.01 µm
 <sup>2</sup> particle size (n = 3,

 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. For this reason we analyzed co-localization of TBEV with endogenous EEA1 or SNX5 in Caco-2 cells. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096957-g005">Figure 5D and E</xref> show a co-localization of TBEV E protein 24h p.i. with EEA1 or SNX5, respectively (See also Z-stack
