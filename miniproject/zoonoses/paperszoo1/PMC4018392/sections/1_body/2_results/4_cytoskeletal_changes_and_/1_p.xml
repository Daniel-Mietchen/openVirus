<p>Initial cytoskeletal changes were observed 24 h p.i. The actin cytoskeleton showed a general re-arrangement and more condensed microfilaments were observed than in non-infected controls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096957-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). To test the response of the cytoskeleton to virus entry, we conducted inhibition experiments with inhibitors of cytoskeletal actin (cytochalasin D), microtubules (nocodazole) or autophagy/endocytosis via PI3-Kinase (LY294002). All inhibitors induced a reduction in intracellular virus entry (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096957-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Since actin is required for the formation of plasma membrane ruffles in macropinosome formation as well as for trafficking of macropinosomes into the cell 
 <xref rid="pone.0096957-Mercer2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, we hypothesized that TBEV entry is mediated by a macropinocytosis-like mechanism.
