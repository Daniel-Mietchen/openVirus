<p>We analyzed the ultrastructural changes induced by TBEV infection in Caco-2 cells using ultrathin section transmission electron microscopy. A dilatation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) and presence of virus particles in rER cisternae were the first ultrastructural signatures of virus replication. At later stages large membrane-bound caverns in the cytoplasm contain most of the observed virions. The cavern membrane was coated with ribosomes indicating that it derived from the rER (
