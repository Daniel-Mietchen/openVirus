<p>Caco-2 cells were challenged with TBEV strain K23, Sojin, or Aina at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. Intracellular viral RNA was analyzed by RT-qPCR. Viral copy numbers of the three strains increased at the first day of infection, peaked at day 2 post infection (p.i.) and persisted in high amounts in the cells up to day 5 p.i. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096957-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The amount of released TBEV particles in cell culture supernatant was highest on day 2 p.i. for all 3 TBEV strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096957-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The virus titer in the apical cell supernatant increased by 3 log numbers between day 1 and 2. We further monitored TBEV infection in Caco-2 cells with TBEV strain K23 by immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096957-g001">Figure 1C</xref> nearly 100% of the cells were found TBEV-positive at 48 h p.i., while only few cells were positive at 24 h p.i. This rapid virus spread between cells confirmed that TBEV replication is efficient in human intestinal Caco-2 monolayers and that the cells in general are susceptible to TBEV infection. Beside the apical infection of confluent Caco-2 monolayers we detected an efficient replication also of subconfluent Caco-2 cells (data not shown).
