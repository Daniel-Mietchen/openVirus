<p>The genus 
 <italic>Orthopoxvirus</italic> of the family 
 <italic>Poxviridae</italic> comprises the species variola (smallpox) virus (VARV), with human as its only sensitive host; zoonotic species monkeypox virus (MPXV), cowpox virus (CPXV), vaccinia virus (VACV), and camelpox virus (CMLV); and several others. These orthopoxviruses are immunologically cross-reactive and cross-protective, so that infection with any member of this genus provides protection against infection with any other member of the genus

 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Shchelkunov1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Traditionally, the species of the 
 <italic>Orthopoxvirus</italic> genus have been named primarily according to the host animal from which they were isolated and identified based on a range of biological characteristics 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Fenner1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Most frequently, zoonotic orthopoxviruses have been initially isolated from animals immediately close to humans being incidental hosts for the virus, the natural carriers of which are, as a rule, wild animals. Correspondingly, the name of an orthopoxvirus species does not reflect the actual animal that is its natural reservoir.
