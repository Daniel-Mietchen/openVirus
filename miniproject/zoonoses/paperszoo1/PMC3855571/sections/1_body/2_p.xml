<p>VARV, the most pathogenic species for humans, has the smallest genome of all the orthopoxviruses

 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Shchelkunov6" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. This suggests a potential possibility for emergence of a VARV-like variant from the currently existing zoonotic orthopoxviruses with longer genomes in the course of natural evolution. It is known that although mutational changes are rather a rare event for the poxvirus DNA 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Shchelkunov8" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, characteristic of these viruses is the possibility of intermolecular and intramolecular recombinations, as well as genomic insertions and deletions

 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Coulson1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. It has been recently found that duplication/amplification of genomic segments is typical of poxviruses, and in the case of a certain selective pressure (for example, host antiviral defenses), certain genes are able to relatively rapidly accumulate mutations that would provide the virus adaptation to new conditions, including a new host
