<p>The most intricate case is the origin of VACV. For many decades, VACV has been used for vaccinating humans against smallpox, and it was considered that this virus, 
 <italic>variolae vaccinae</italic>, originates from zoonotic CPXV, introduced to immunization practice by Jenner as early as 1796

 <sup>th</sup> century was it found out that the orthopoxvirus strains used for smallpox vaccination significantly differ in their properties from both the natural CPXV isolates recovered from cows and the other orthopoxvirus species examined by that time
