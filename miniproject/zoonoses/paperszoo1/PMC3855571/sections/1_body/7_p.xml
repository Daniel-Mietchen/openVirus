<p>Since the 1960s, VACVs have been repeatedly isolated in Brazil 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Trindade1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The first VACV isolates were recovered from wild rodents (sentinel mice and rice rat) 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-daFonseca1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Since 1999, an ever-increasing number of exanthematous outbreaks affecting dairy cows and their handlers have been recorded 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Damaso1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Megid1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, supplemented recently with outbreaks among horses 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Campos1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Cargnelutti1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Several VACV strains have been isolated during these outbreaks from cows, horses, humans, and rodents 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Trindade1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Megid1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Campos1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Abraho1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-DAnunciao1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The questions that arise are when and how VACV entered Brazil and the wild nature of the American continent. The more widespread point of view is that VACV strains could be transmitted from vaccinated humans to domestic animals and further to wild ones with subsequent adaptation to the rural environment 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Trindade1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. My standpoint implies that HSPV/VACV could have been repeatedly accidentally imported from Europe to South America with the infected horses or rodents to be further introduced into wildlife. Possibly, the latter hypothesis more adequately reflects the actual pathway of VACV transmission to the Brazilian environment, since recent phylogenetic studies have suggested an independent origin for South American VACV isolates, distinct from the vaccine strains used on this continent during the WHO smallpox eradication campaign 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Trindade1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Drumond1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Presumably, genome-wide sequencing of the viruses will give a more precise answer to the origin of VACV variants isolated in Brazil.
