<p>In the past, the outbreaks of buffalopox had occurred frequently in various states of India as well as in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Egypt, and other countries 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Lal1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The causative agent, buffalopox virus (BPXV), is closely related to VACV and affiliated with the species

 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Bera1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The buffalopox outbreaks recorded in different distant regions of India are likely to suggest the presence of an abundant natural BPXV reservoir represented by wild animals, most probably rodents. Correspondingly, it is of the paramount importance to perform a large-scale study of the presence of orthopoxviruses in wild animals of India.
