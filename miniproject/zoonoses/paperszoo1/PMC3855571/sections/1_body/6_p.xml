<p>The issue of VACV origin was somewhat clarified after sequencing the complete genome of horsepox virus (HSPV) 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Tulman1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, which appeared to be closely related to the sequenced VACV strains. Only after this was attention paid to the fact that Jenner specified the origin of his vaccine from an infection of the heels of horses (“grease”) and indicated that the vaccine became more suitable for human use after passage through the cow 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Baxby1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. This suggests that VACV may originate from a zoonotic HSPV, which naturally persisted concurrently with CPXV. Some facts suggest that the infectious materials not only from cow lesions but also from horse lesions were used for smallpox vaccination in the 19
 <sup>th</sup> century. The vaccine lymph from the horse gave the most satisfactory results in inducing an anti-smallpox immunity as well as less side reactions 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Fenner1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. By all accounts, they gradually commenced using HSPV isolates for smallpox vaccination, the future generations of which recovered decades later were ascribed to the separate species 
 <italic>Vaccinia virus</italic>
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Downie2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, rather than CPXV for smallpox vaccination everywhere.
