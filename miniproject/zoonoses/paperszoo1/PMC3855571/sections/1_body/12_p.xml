<p>In its biological properties and according to the data of phylogenetic analysis of the complete virus genomic sequence, CMLV is closest to VARV, the causative agent of smallpox, as compared with the other orthopoxvirus species 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Fenner1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Gubser1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Camelpox is recognized as one of the most important viral diseases in camels. This infection was first described in India in 1909. Subsequently, camelpox outbreaks have been reported in many countries of the Middle East, Asia, and Africa

 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Duraffour1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Until recently, it has been commonly accepted that the host range of CMLV is confined to one animal species, camels

 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Duraffour1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. However, the first human cases of camelpox have been recently confirmed in India 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Bera2" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. This suggests that camelpox could be a zoonotic disease. Since camelpox outbreaks occur irregularly in distant regions of the world and the viruses isolated during these outbreaks display different degrees of virulence 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Duraffour1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, it is possible to postulate the presence of a wildlife animal reservoir of CMLV other than camels. Since the camelpox outbreaks are usually associated with the rainy season of the year, when rodents are actively reproducing, it is likely that rodents could be the natural carriers of CMLV.
