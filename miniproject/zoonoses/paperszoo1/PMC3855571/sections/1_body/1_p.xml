<p>With accumulation of the data on complete genome nucleotide sequences for various strains of orthopoxvirus species, it has been found that an interesting feature of the orthopoxvirus genomes is the presence of genes that are intact in one species but fragmented or deleted in another 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Shchelkunov2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Gubser1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. These data confirm the concept of a reductive evolution of orthopoxviruses, according to which the gene loss plays an important role in the evolutionary adaptation of progenitor virus to a particular environmental niche (host) and emergence of new virus species 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Hendrickson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. CPXV has the largest genome of all the modern representatives of the genus 
 <italic>Orthopoxvirus</italic>, and this genome contains all the genes found in the other species of this genus

 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Shchelkunov3" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,

 <xref rid="ppat.1003756-Shchelkunov7" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Therefore, 
 <italic>Cowpox virus</italic> was proposed as the closest of all the modern species to the progenitor virus for the genus 
 <italic>Orthopoxvirus</italic>, while the remaining species, 
 <italic>Variola virus</italic> included, had appeared as a result of multistage reductive evolution
