<p>The potential impacts of climate change on working populations extend far beyond the more overt risks associated with direct exposure to greater extremes of heat. These non-heat-related impacts of climate change on working populations are many and varied with substantial impacts at all economic levels. Adverse impacts may be observed in both developed and developing countries, although it is likely that the latter will bear more of the burden due to endemic poverty and disadvantage. These impacts of climate change on working populations will vary greatly by location. Increases in vector-borne diseases may be significant in one location, while another population experiences food shortages and malnutrition. Elsewhere, some populations may be adversely affected by multiple non-heat-related challenges to worker health. Non-heat-related impacts of climate change are wide-ranging and will often have serious health and economic consequences. They should be taken into account in the future planning of adaptive strategies in working populations.</p>
