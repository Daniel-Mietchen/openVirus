<p>Climate change is predicted to increase weather variability, thereby bringing more frequent and more intense extreme weather events such as floods and hurricanes (cyclones). During extreme weather events there are dramatic surges in demand on various sectors, especially in the medical, emergency response, and essential services sectors. These workers are expected to work harder, for extended periods, in difficult (and often dangerous) circumstances, and with limited resources.
