<p>In addition to emergency responses, it is expected that a more variable climate will bring more frequent and larger surges in ‘non-emergency/normal’ demands such as the amplification of patterns in weather-related diseases and injuries, including dehydration and heatstroke in summer, or broken bones after slipping on ice in winter. Shifts in the geographic ranges of vector-borne diseases and zoonoses and the re-emergence of previously eradicated (or well-controlled) diseases may also challenge staff unfamiliar with those diseases. Increased clinical workloads may also reduce disease surveillance activities so that new diseases or outbreaks are not detected as quickly. The identification of West Nile disease in the United States in 1999 was initially hampered by a lack of capacity (
