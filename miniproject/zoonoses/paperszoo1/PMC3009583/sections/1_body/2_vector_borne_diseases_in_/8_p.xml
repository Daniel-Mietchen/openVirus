<p>Malaria provides a major and instructive example. This ancient vector-borne disease is endemic to much of Africa and has had a profound impact on local social and economic development. Studies in sub-Saharan Africa have shown that, in addition to high mortality rates (of around 20%), childhood malaria is also associated with long-term neurological and cognitive impairments in around 25% of those who survive (

Physical handicaps reduce a person's ability to contribute to domestic tasks such as cooking, cleaning and planting crops, whilst increasing the burden on caretakers, and minor cognitive deficits may become increasingly profound as children mature and the tasks required of them become more complex and demanding (
