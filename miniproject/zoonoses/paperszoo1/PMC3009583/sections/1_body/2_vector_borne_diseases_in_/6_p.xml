<p>Vector-borne diseases are already responsible for considerable losses in economic productivity every year, primarily in those regions where a vector-borne disease is endemic such as malaria in Africa. The impacts of endemic vector-borne disease begin with a workforce that is less healthy and less physically capable of working, increasing the number of work days lost to ill health. This reduces primary economic productivity, with flow-on effects on other important economic sectors such as tourism and trade at local, regional, and national scales. Endemic vector-borne disease has been associated with substantial negative impacts on long-term economic development in many regions in Africa and Asia, with macroeconomic studies estimating the growth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP) in malaria-endemic regions to be 0.25â€“1.3% per year lower than regions without malaria. Over 25 years this can amount to almost half of the per capita GDP in poor countries (
