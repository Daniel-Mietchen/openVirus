<p>In adults, chronic malaria results in anaemia, which markedly reduces worker productivity and output (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">22</xref>). Various mining, agriculture, and manufacturing industries have been seriously impaired by worker populations with a high disease burden. In addition, companies are wary of investing and working in areas where malaria is endemic (for fear of catching the disease) and when imported workers from malaria-free areas have no acquired immunity to the more severe effects of malaria (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">22</xref>). Beyond these immediate impacts (including medical costs, lost incomes, and decreased productivity), malaria imposes economic effects via two other broad mechanisms. First, the social costs include high childhood mortality rates (which leads to changes in the population-age structure), lower education levels (including deficits in cognitive function), decreased personal accumulation of capital, and the potential for population migration. Second, at the macroeconomic scale, malaria indirectly imposes substantial losses through decreased trade, tourism, and foreign investment. In turn, the health of the workforce at large is influenced by both of these impact pathways and, thus, the potential spread of malaria (and other vector-borne diseases) under future climate change poses a substantial threat to many developing nations around the globe.
