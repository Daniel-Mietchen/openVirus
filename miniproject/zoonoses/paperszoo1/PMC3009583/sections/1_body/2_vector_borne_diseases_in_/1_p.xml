<p>Most microbial pathogens, their vectors and host ‘reservoir’ species are sensitive to climatic conditions, which impose limits on the geographic range, seasonality, and transmission efficiency of infectious disease. Climate thus determines where and when a particular infectious disease 
 <italic>could</italic> occur; but a diversity of other, often localised, factors – environmental, social, cultural, and technological factors, along with public health practices – determine where the infectious disease 
 <italic>will</italic> actually occur. Outdoor workers are especially at risk of vector-borne disease and, as the global climate changes, they may be exposed to vector-borne diseases in areas and at times where transmission was previously not possible. In addition, changes in daily work activities due to increased heat, such as longer rest periods in the middle of the day and increased work at dawn and dusk, may coincide with the times when insect vectors are most active thus increasing the likelihood of disease transmission (
