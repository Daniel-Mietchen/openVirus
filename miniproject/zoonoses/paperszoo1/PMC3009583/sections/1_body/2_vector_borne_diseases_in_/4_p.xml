<p>Local environmental conditions are important determinants of vector-borne disease distribution through their action on the host species, intermediate vertebrate hosts (where applicable), and vector organisms, especially mosquitoes. As temperature rises, pathogens such as the malaria plasmodium and dengue virus mature more quickly within the mosquito, while the mosquitoes themselves breed more prolifically and feed more often, thus increasing the likelihood and speed of transmission to humans. Vectorial capacity (a measure of how fast an outbreak can spread) also increases exponentially throughout the transmission season. Therefore, a small change in temperature that brings forward the beginning of the transmission season or lengthening of the rainy season (which is the breeding period for mosquitoes) could have a great effect on mosquito numbers and, therefore, on the resultant risk of disease occurrence (
