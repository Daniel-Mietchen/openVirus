<p>Changes in the geographic ranges and seasonality of vector-borne infectious diseases will thus have important health and productivity consequences for many working populations. Outdoor workers are already at a higher risk of vector-borne infections than most other workers because of their proximity to vector species and their habitats. The risk of transmission will also increase under climate change as the number of vectors increases and transmission becomes more efficient.</p>
