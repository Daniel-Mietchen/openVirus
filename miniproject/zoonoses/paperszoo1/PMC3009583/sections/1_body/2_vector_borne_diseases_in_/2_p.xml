<p>There is already suggestive scientific evidence that the geographic range and prevalence of some vector-borne diseases are changing in response to regional changes in climate, especially rises in temperature and changes in rainfall. In China, schistosomiasis – long a scourge of rural communities and farm-workers – has recently re-emerged in areas where it was previously eradicated, thought to be associated with the spread of suitable habitats for the intermediate host snail 
 <italic>Oncomelania hupensis</italic> in response to regional warming (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>). Schistosomiasis is predicted to spread northwards into currently non-endemic areas as the 0–1°C isotherm moves further north due to climate change and, thus, expands the potential habitat range of the intermediate host snail (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>). Domestic water buffalo and cattle are an important reservoir host for schistosomiasis and are commonly used for ploughing and carrying loads by farmers in China. The animals often forage freely in areas where schistosomiasis is endemic, so re-infection commonly occurs in treated animals, which then excrete the parasite back into the water for uptake by the snails. In most endemic areas, over 70% of the environmental contamination can be traced back to bovine defecation (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>). Farmers, therefore, have an increased risk of exposure to schistosomiasis, via the parasite life-stage released by the snails in the water and soil of their paddocks, which is amplified by contamination of drinking water and irrigation supplies by their livestock.
