<p>In Japan, the distribution of 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> (the mosquito species that transmits dengue fever) has been advancing northwards over recent decades, thought to be associated with higher autumn mean temperatures that promote larvae development and warmer annual mean temperatures that encourage expansion of adult mosquitoes during summer (

 <italic>Cryptococcus gattii</italic>, in the temperate Pacific Northwest region of North America – a fungus that causes meningitis, pneumonia, and tumour-like lesions in humans with a reported case-fatality rate of 9%. Analyses indicate that this was a case of emergence in a totally new geographic range for the fungus, suggesting that a warming climate may have created suitable conditions in a previously unsuitable habitat that have allowed the spores to persist and propagate (
