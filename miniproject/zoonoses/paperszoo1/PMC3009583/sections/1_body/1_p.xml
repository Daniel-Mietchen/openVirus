<p>The ramifications of climate change for working populations are not restricted to increases in heat exposure. This paper explores some of the other likely, non-heat-related health problems that climate change will have on working populations around the globe, now and in the future. The risks include exposures to various infectious diseases (vector-borne, zoonotic, and person-to-person), extreme weather events, stress and mental health issues, and malnutrition.</p>
