<p>Many existing and emerging zoonotic diseases can be traced back to human-induced ecological disturbances. In particular, deforestation (for crop and livestock farming), road construction, water control systems (dams, irrigation systems, and reservoirs), and human settlements disrupt the ecological niches of infectious agents, their hosts, and vector species (

Workers involved in these industries are particularly at risk of novel zoonotic infection as they are literally ‘on the front line’ where contact, and conflict, between humans and wild animal species is most likely to occur. Emerging zoonotic infections are also more likely in poor and refugee populations who may turn to bushmeat hunting for food and income (
