<p>Projected increases in the frequency and severity of quasi-cyclical climatic events such as the El Ni√±o (ENSO) oscillation under future climate change conditions, with the associated changes in habitats and food supplies for animal species, may increase the risk of displaced animal populations coming into contact with human activities. Livestock workers in regions close to wild animal habitats may be particularly at risk due to close contact with domestic animal hosts and contact with wild animal reservoir species. For example, wild elk and bison in Yellowstone National Park (USA) are reservoirs of Brucellosis (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0041">41</xref>), a highly contagious zoonotic infection that is transmitted through contact with, or consumption of, unsterilised milk and meat from infected animals. These wild animal populations are considered a potential threat to domestic cattle (and their handlers), which are grazed at the park boundaries (
