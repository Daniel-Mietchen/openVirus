<p>The emergence of new influenza strains has already been accelerated by battery-fed production of poultry alongside intensified interspecies contacts in many Asian backyards, villages, and local markets. Initially, these new disease strains appeared in the workers and owners who had close contact with infected animals. Influenza strain H5N1 (‘Avian’ flu) likely evolved from flocks of chickens in Hong Kong, with the first human infections in 1997. It has now spread to infect other poultry flocks as well as wild bird populations throughout Southeast Asia and human-to-human transmission has been documented in Thailand (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0042">42</xref>). These outbreaks resulted in the substantial loss of work days due to sickness, loss of income due to quarantined products, and severe restrictions on future production due to the culling of livestock (to help stop the outbreaks). The rapid spread of these influenza strains beyond the livestock workers into the general population was enabled by high density human settlements with poor public sanitation and hygiene and the global interconnectedness created by air travel soon spread the diseases internationally.
