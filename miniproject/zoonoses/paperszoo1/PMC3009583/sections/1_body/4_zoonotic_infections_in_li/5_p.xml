<p>Climate change may, in the future, influence some other categories of infectious disease risks in working populations in ways that, currently, seem marginal or uncertain. With changes in temperatures, wind patterns, water, and vegetation, the local flight paths and longer-distance migratory routes of birds and bats may alter. This could have implications for a range of viral diseases including influenza and various bat-borne viral zoonoses.</p>
