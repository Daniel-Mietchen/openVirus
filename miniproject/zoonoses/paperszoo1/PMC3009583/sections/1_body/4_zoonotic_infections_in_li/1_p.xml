<p>Infectious diseases intermittently emerge from animal species and spill over into human populations. It is estimated that 60–80% of emerging pathogens are zoonotic in origin (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">34</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0037">37</xref>). The incidence of these events is often influenced by climate-related changes in the density and movement of reservoir animal species due to habitat disruption and population displacement. Ongoing climate change may be accompanied by more frequent zoonotic infections as well as the emergence and spread of new zoonotic infections.
