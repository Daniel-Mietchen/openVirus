<p>Climate change is likely to affect the replication, survival, persistence, and transmission of various microorganisms that cause diarrhoeal disease. Cholera, shigella, salmonella, campylobacter, noroviruses, enteroviruses, rotaviruses, cryptosporidium, and giardia often show seasonal infection patterns that strongly suggest underlying environmental influences that include rising temperatures, changing rainfall, and movements in the geographic ranges of host or reservoir species (

In addition, extreme weather events enhanced by climate change, such as widespread flooding, substantially increase the risks of drinking water and food crops being contaminated with human faecal matter. These circumstances are likely to pose risks particularly to working populations in low-income settings with minimal hygiene facilities.
