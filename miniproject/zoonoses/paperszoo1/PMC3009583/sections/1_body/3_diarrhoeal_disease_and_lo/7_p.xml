<p>The potential threat from diarrhoeal diseases in developed countries (with, currently, clean water supplies, good public hygiene, and sanitation infrastructure) is also likely to be increased by future climate change. In particular, extreme weather events may be enhanced in frequency and/or severity by climate change, leading to the overload of municipal stormwater and sewage systems and to reduced public hygiene â€“ via, for example, the overflow of effluent into drinking supplies and recreational facilities such as pools, lakes, and rivers (

Emergency response workers, especially those connected with sanitation and water infrastructure, are particularly at risk of infection due to their close proximity to the source and their immediate response to the emergency before testing for the presence of microbes is conducted. The removal of emergency response personnel from the workforce in emergency situations may have strong detrimental effects on the health and well-being of all residents and also increase the demand on public health sectors at a critical time.
