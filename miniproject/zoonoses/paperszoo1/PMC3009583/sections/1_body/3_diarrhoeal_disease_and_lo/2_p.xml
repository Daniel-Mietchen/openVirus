Diarrhoeal diseases are strongly linked to poor hygiene and sanitation practices, and lack of infrastructure, especially the contamination of food and water supplies through unregulated disposal of human excreta. Direct contact with an infected person is also an important disease transmission route. Environmental transmission is less common as many of these microorganisms are not robust enough to survive for long outside the host (
