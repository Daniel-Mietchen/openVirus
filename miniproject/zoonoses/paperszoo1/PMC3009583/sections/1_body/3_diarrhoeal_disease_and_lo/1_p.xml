<p>Climatic conditions also affect the patterns of occurrence of many non-vector-borne infectious diseases. Campylobacter infections, derivied from animal species and often then transmitted via contaminated water, show seasonal differences in transmission rates, with warmer winters advancing the spring transmission peak to earlier in the year (

Climate-induced changes in water quality, availability, and salinity, as well as local temperature and humidity are also closely linked to the spatial and temporal patterns of vector-borne and water-borne diseases, and environmental changes may be reflected in changing epidemics and outbreaks of endemic diseases, such as cholera in India and Bangladesh (
