<p>Outdoor workers will be strongly affected by current and future malnutrition as the physical demands of their jobs increase, but entire populations may be at risk if there are major food shortages as well as endemic malnutrition. Climate change will also increase the already heavy workload of women in developing countries who tend to bear the burden of high fertility rates, childcare, and household tasks (such as cooking), as well as contributing to farming activities. Cultural influences may exacerbate the effects of climate change on women's workloads, such as in the Sahel and Horn of Africa, where men often migrate during droughts and leave women alone at home to continue raising the children, working the fields, tending to livestock, and managing the home.
