<p>Scenario-based modelling consistently indicates that global food yields may be severely impaired by rising temperatures and drought conditions associated with climate change. It is projected that climate change will have a negative overall impact on global cereal grain yields. However, those impacts will occur unevenly. Countries in the tropics and subtropics, where both warming and reduced rainfall are likely to occur, are at greatest risk. Many studies indicate that South Asia is particularly vulnerable and likely to experience declines in cereal grain yields of the order of 10â€“20% by later this century (
