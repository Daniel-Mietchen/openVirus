<p>Farming communities are often overlooked by government policies in response to climate change, which tend to focus on the preservation and enhancement of urban centres and their associated infrastructure. Yet the products of agricultural industries such as food crops and building materials underpin many economies, and the implications of declining agricultural populations and productivity may have critical impacts on global food supplies and the nutrition status of billions of people. The impacts of declining agricultural activity may also be exacerbated by the looming threat of increasing livestock and crop diseases, many of which are linked to environmental changes and climate-sensitive vectors and pathogens (

In addition to the detrimental impacts on food production, nutrition and potential livestock-to-human disease transmission, a substantial threat to worker health from agricultural diseases may come from the increased use of pesticides and other agricultural chemicals in response to disease outbreaks. As such, ongoing climate change will pose a continuing – and growing – threat to the health of workers in the agricultural industry.
