 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0056">56</xref>). In the face of long periods with little or no farm income, financial debt escalates (causing further emotional distress), and many are forced to seek employment off the farm to provide some income. This burden tends to fall on the women, who are generally already most responsible for managing the farm finances, running the home, and raising children. Off-farm employment that is close to home also becomes harder to obtain as the rural infrastructure declines due to population loss and economic stress (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0061">61</xref>). The resultant loss of people, property, services, livelihoods, and history (especially for those whose ancestors farmed the same land for generations before) can trigger powerful feelings of chronic loss and fatigue, hopelessness, helplessness, despair, and generalised anxiety in those who remain and in those who are displaced.
