<p>More recently, there have been marked increases in suicide rates in East Kenya after farmers were hit with unusual weather. A prolonged drought reduced crop yields and unseasonal rains during harvest led to widespread contamination of crops with a fungal toxin released by the wet grain. The toxin also remains in the soil afterwards, thus threatening future production as well. Again, these factors combined to exacerbate debt levels, producing extreme psychological stress, and suicide rates in the last year have soared to around 2,000 deaths/year (compared to the average rate of roughly 300 suicides/year) (
