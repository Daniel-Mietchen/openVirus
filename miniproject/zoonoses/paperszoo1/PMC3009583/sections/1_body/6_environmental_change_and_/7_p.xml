<p>Climate change will also affect seasonal and transient farm workers such as fruit pickers and sheep shearers. Increasingly stressful environmental conditions when working outdoors and increasingly unpredictable crop yields will have major impacts on their livelihoods, especially if they are paid according to productivity. As farms cease production or change their crops, the availability of work will decrease. Low farm incomes may also reduce hiring of short-term workers during busy periods in the farm cycle. Many transient farm workers base their livelihoods around the synchronicity of different crops, moving from one crop to the next as each matures at different points in the season. Climate change may seriously disrupt this synchronicity, with workers no longer able to sustain employment across the growing season.</p>
