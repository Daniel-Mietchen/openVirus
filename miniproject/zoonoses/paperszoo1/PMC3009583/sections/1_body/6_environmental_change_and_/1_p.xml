<p>Farming is an inherently stressful occupation, given the perennial need to cope with unpredictable environmental conditions (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0049">49</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0052">52</xref>). Agriculture is especially vulnerable to climate change, with significant risks of both short-term crop failures and long-term declines in productivity. In many agricultural regions, especially in mid-latitude (subtropical) regions, climate change will entail less rainfall and drying trends that are exacerbated by greater evaporation at higher temperatures. In many locations, the seasonal patterns of rainfall will change and rainfall events will often intensify. These changes will have significant effects not only on the success of the crops themselves (and the implications for food supplies from those crops) but on the ability to make a living on the land. This applies to both large-scale, modernised agricultural industries, as well as small-scale subsistence farmers with both micro- and macroeconomic ramifications.
