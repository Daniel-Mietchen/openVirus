<p>Climate change most obviously entails rising temperatures and heat exposure, and working populations (especially outdoor workers) are likely to be at particular risk from heat stress (

As the ambient temperature reaches—and then exceeds—the human core temperature of 37°C, there are well-documented physiological effects on the human body, with increasing heat exposure posing risks to some organ systems and also making it progressively harder to work productively (physically and cognitively) (
