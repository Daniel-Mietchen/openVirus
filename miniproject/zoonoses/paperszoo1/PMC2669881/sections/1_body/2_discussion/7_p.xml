<p>A young age for SIV contrasts with other ancient retroviruses. The simian foamy virus appears to be at least 30 million years old, based on congruence between the viral and primate host phylogenies 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Switzer1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Furthermore, lentiviruses, the viral group to which SIV belongs, are also millions of years old, based on the presence of defective endongenous lentiviruses in rabbits and lemurs

 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-vanderLoo1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. None of these findings, however, preclude the possibility that SIV is a much younger lentiviral clade.
