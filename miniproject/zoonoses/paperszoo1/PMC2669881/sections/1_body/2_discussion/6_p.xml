<p>Given the ages of the SIV clades presented here, it seems unlikely that SIV evolved apathogenicity over millions of years of coevolution and codivergence with its primate host species. It is still possible that SIV evolved avirulence in its natural hosts. If SIV were highly pathogenic when it first infected sooty mangabeys and chimpanzees, then it might have decreased in virulence over a remarkably short period of time, possibly on the order of hundreds of years. There remains the distinct possibility, however, that SIV was rarely pathogenic in its natural hosts and the low level of disease associated with SIV infection is actually the ancestral phenotype. The theory of ancient coevolution towards apathogenicity appears less plausible, given the recent discovery that SIVcpz is pathogenic in wild populations of the eastern chimpanzee subspecies (Rudicell RS, Jones JH, Pusey AE, Terio KA, Estes JD, Raphael J, Lonsdorf EV, Wilson ML, Keele BF, and Hahn BH. (2009) SIVcpz is pathogenic in its natural host. Oral Abstract. 16
 <sup>th</sup> Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections). Future work distinguishing between these two alternative theories on SIV apathogencity is needed.
