<p>The findings presented in this study indicate that the tMRCA of SIV in sooty mangabeys and chimpanzees is 1809 (1729–1875) and 1492 (1266–1685), respectively, assuming the relaxed molecular clock is unbiased. In addition, our results suggest that the time between the MRCA of SIVsm and SIVcpz and the MRCA of the human-to-human transmissible HIV lineages may be only hundreds of years. We present the tMRCA for all five of these HIV lineages, though we note that previous age estimates for HIV-1 groups M and O were based on larger datasets

We estimate the tMRCA for HIV-2 group A to be 1932 (1906–1955) and HIV-2 group B to be 1935 (1907–1961); these estimates were generated by incorporating a more biologically plausible model of rate variation among lineages, compared with the strict molecular clock used to obtain the previous HIV-2 tMRCA estimates
