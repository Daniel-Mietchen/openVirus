<p>SIV is not the only virus once thought to be ancient whose phylogeny may be better explained by the preferential host switching model. Hantaviruses infect a wide array of rodent and insectivore species. Their phylogeny was thought to be the result of an ancient infection followed by codivergence, but recent evidence suggests that the virus and host phylogenies are too dissimilar to suggest codivergence

Furthermore, it has been proposed that feline immunodeficiency virus, a lentivirus whose lack of associated disease in natural feline hosts was thought to be the result of an ancient infection, codiverged and coevolved with its feline hosts

 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Troyer1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>; however, in light of the possible young age of SIV, it may be worth taking a more detailed look at the relationship between the feline immunodeficiency virus and feline phylogenies.
