<p>The young ages of SIVsm and SIVcpz suggest that the entire SIV phylogeny may be relatively young (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000377-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Even if SIV was present in sooty mangabeys and chimpanzees prior to the coalescence of their current diversity, we have identified divergence events deep in the SIV phylogeny that are on the order of hundreds of years old. The case of SIVsm is particularly compelling in this context since SIVsm sequences alone returned such a young date. It is difficult to reconcile these ages with an SIV phylogeny that is millions of years old. It seems more reasonable that the SIV phylogeny is on the order of thousands or tens of thousands of years old. While it had previously been suggested that a young-looking phylogeny could actually be the result of codivergence over millions of years, this argument was partly predicated on the assumption that SIV did not have a reliable clock-like signal 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Sharp1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In light of our findings, this argument is no longer tenable. What is still needed, however, is a reliable estimate of the age of the entire SIV phylogeny.
