<p>In addition, we present the first date, to our knowledge, for the tMRCA of HIV-1 group N at 1963 (1948â€“1977). This date suggests that HIV-1 group N is the youngest transmissible HIV lineage and the only lineage to have originated in the second half of the twentieth century (though the possibility of a deeper history cannot be excluded given the sparse sampling). Taken together with the previous tMRCA estimates for HIV-1 groups M and O (circa 1900s and 1920s, respectively) and our updated HIV-2 group A and B dates (circa 1930s), it appears that SIV has given rise to transmissible HIV lineages throughout the twentieth century. The dispersed timing of these transmissions to humans implies that no single external factor is needed to explain the cross-species transmission of HIV. This observation is consistent with both of the two prevailing views of the origin of the HIV epidemics. The first is the bushmeat hypothesis 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Peeters1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, whereby SIV is transmitted to humans during the slaughter or butchering of infected primates. The second is that the growth of sub-Saharan African cities allowed for these nascent lineages to gain a foothold 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Worobey1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Lemey2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. According to the second hypothesis, SIV may have been jumping into humans since it first infected chimpanzees and sooty mangabeys. A change in human ecology then may have altered the evolutionary dynamics, whereby a virus that historically may have only infected a few individuals and then died out now has the potential to become an epidemic lineage. It does not seem farfetched to venture that SIV will continue to be transmitted to humans well into the twenty-first century.
