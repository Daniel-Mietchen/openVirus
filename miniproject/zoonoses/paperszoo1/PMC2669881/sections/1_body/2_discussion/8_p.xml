<p>Finally, it is possible that SIV itself is much older than the tMRCA of the extant lineages. Dating the tMRCA of influenza A viruses infecting avian hosts suggested that deep viral lineages were constantly lost, which resulted in younger than expected tMRCA estimates for subtypes 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. A similar process of lineage birth and death may have occurred among SIV, in which SIVs infecting particular primate species would occasionally go extinct and later be replaced by a new species-specific SIV. This process would involve the loss of deep SIV lineages with replacement by younger ones. This extinction and reinfection would be analogous to the loss of deep branches due to the coalescent. If such a phenomenon operated across the entire SIV tree, it could mask the ancient age of the virus. Combined with a preferential host switching mechanism, a macro-evolutionary process such as this could account for a young tMRCA for an ancient virus whose phylogeny is similar to that of its host.
