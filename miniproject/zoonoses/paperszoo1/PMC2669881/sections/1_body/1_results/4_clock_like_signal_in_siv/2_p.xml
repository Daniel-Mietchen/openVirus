<p>BMCMC analysis of an alignment containing only SIVcpz did not provide meaningful date estimates, as the tMRCA estimates from these runs were indistinguishable from the prior distribution of tMRCA estimates. Therefore, the tMRCA date we inferred for SIVcpz may have incorporated HIV-1 rates that could be biasing this estimate. However, our previous analysis of SIVsm/HIV-2 suggested that HIV-2 rates did not appreciably affect SIVsm tMRCA estimates.</p>
