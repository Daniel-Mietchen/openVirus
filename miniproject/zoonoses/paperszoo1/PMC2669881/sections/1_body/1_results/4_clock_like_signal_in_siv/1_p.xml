<p>We next sought to determine if the dates we obtained were the result of clock-like signal within SIVsm or whether SIVsm had no clock-signal and we were inadvertently extrapolating HIV-2 rates across the entire tree. We compared the date estimates from 
 <italic>gag</italic>, 
 <italic>pol</italic>, and 
 <italic>env</italic> to analyses where all non-SIVsm sequences were excluded. For all three genes, there were no significant differences in the tMRCAs between the full and SIVsm-only datasets in any of the clades measured, including all SIVsm (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000377-t002">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the SIVsm 
 <italic>gag</italic> substitution rate we estimated of 1.38×10
 <sup>−3</sup> (1.03×10
 <sup>−3</sup>–1.73×10
 <sup>−3</sup>) substitutions/site/year and the HIV-2 group A substitution rate of 1.22×10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site/year estimated by Lemey 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Lemey2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. This similarity indicates that SIVsm does indeed have sufficient clock-like signal to date tMRCAs, and it does not appear to evolve at a different rate than HIV-2 group A, despite differences in host biology and pathogenicity.
