<p>In a population of constant size, the most basal lineages are consistently lost due to normal coalescent processes; the age of the root is expected to be approximately two times the effective population size 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Hudson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, if the population is expanding exponentially, the basal lineages will be maintained until a carrying capacity is reached. The BMCMC method used here provides a convenient framework in which to test whether a constant size or exponential growth model better describes the dynamics of a population: If the 95% HPD of the exponential growth rate excludes zero, then a constant population size can be strongly rejected. To determine if exponential growth explains the SIVsm population dynamics better than a constant population size, we looked at the exponential growth rate in alignments containing only SIVsm sequences.
