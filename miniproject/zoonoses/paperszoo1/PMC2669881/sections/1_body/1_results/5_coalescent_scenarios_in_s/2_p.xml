<p>Exponential growth rate 95% HPDs from 
 <italic>gag</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic> in the SIVsm analysis excluded zero; however, the growth rate 95% HPD from 
 <italic>pol</italic> did not exclude zero. Nevertheless, the exponential growth rate 95% HPD estimated in partition analysis (combining demographic signal from all three loci) rejected a constant population size. Thus, it seems probable that 
 <italic>pol</italic> failed to reject a constant population size because it simply lacked sufficient demographic signal. Therefore, it is likely that SIVsm has not been evolving at a constant population size for the past 200 years.
