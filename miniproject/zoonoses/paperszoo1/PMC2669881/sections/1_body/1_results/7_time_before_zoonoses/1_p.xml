<p>We determined the number of years between the SIVsm and SIVcpz tMRCAs and those of the five transmissible HIV lineages (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000377-t004">Table 4</xref>). If the SIVsm and SIVcpz tMRCAs represent the time SIV has been infecting each host, then this estimate would tell us the number of years that SIV was present in sooty mangabeys and chimpanzees before jumping into humans and giving rise to the transmissible lineages of HIV. We note, however, that a tMRCA estimate will tend to post-date the actual introduction of viral lineages into a new host if genetic diversity has since been lost or is not fully sampled. We believe such comparisons still provide useful information as long as this caveat is recognized. The times between the root of the SIVsm/HIV-2 tree and the base of the HIV-2 group A clade and the group B clade were 122.8 (57.2–199.9) and 126.2 (59.2–203.7) years, respectively. The time between the SIVcpz root and the HIV-1 lineages was 402.8 (231.0–601.4) years for HIV-1 group M, 471.6 (291.6–693.2) years for HIV-1 group N, and 413.5 (247.1–621.3) years for HIV-1 group O. These estimates are from the 
 <italic>gag</italic> locus for SIVsm/HIV-2 and from the 
 <italic>env</italic> locus for SIVcpz/HIV-1; partition analyses indicated that these genes were the most reliable for each clade. Ninety-five percent HPD intervals are larger for these estimates than for other single clades because the age estimates for any two clades are not perfectly correlated.
