<p>We inferred phylogenies for SIVsm/HIV-2 
 <italic>gag</italic>,

 <italic>env</italic> loci under a relaxed molecular clock in a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) framework (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000377-g001">Figure 1Aâ€“C</xref>). In each tree there was very high posterior support for monophyly in HIV-2 group A, HIV-2 group B, and the major SIVsm clades identified by Apetrei 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Apetrei1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The position of the root, determined by the BMCMC analysis, was also highly supported in each of the three trees. Phylogenetic inference using the three loci produces different topologies, which was expected given the observation of recombination by Apetrei 
 <italic>et al.</italic> in their initial analysis of these loci in SIVsm
