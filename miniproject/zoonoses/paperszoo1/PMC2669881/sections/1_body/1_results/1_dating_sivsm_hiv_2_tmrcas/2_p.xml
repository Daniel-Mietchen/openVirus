<p>The tMRCA estimates for the root of the SIVsm/HIV-2 trees differed as well (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000377-t001">Table 1</xref>). The 
 <italic>pol</italic> locus had the oldest root, putting the tMRCA of SIVsm/HIV-2 at 1686 (1525–1811). Estimates from 
 <italic>gag</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic> were significantly younger, placing the SIVsm/HIV-2 tMRCA at 1809 (1798–1875) and 1861 (1788–1915), respectively. Although 
 <italic>gag</italic> was older than 
 <italic>env</italic>, this difference was not significant. The 
 <italic>pol</italic> results also indicated older dates than 
 <italic>gag</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic> for the tMRCA of HIV-2 groups A and B, although these differences were not significant. With the exception of the 
 <italic>env</italic> tMRCA estimate for HIV-2 group A, all three genes suggested a slightly older origin of both HIV-2 groups A and B than previously reported by Lemey 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Lemey2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. There were no discernable differences in the tMRCA estimates of these three genes for the major SIVsm clades (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000377-t002">Table 2</xref>), although there were significant differences in the age of deeper SIVsm coalescent events among SIVsm groups 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 [P(
 <italic>gag</italic>&lt;
 <italic>pol</italic>) = 0.003; P(
 <italic>env</italic>&lt;
 <italic>pol</italic>)&lt;0.001)].
