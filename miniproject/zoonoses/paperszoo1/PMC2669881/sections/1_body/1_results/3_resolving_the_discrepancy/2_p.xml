<p>We then explored the possibility that some of these analyses were biased. That this discrepancy among tMRCA estimates was most pronounced in the older nodes indicated a loss of signal due to this bias deeper in the phylogeny. We examined the demographic parameters (e.g. population size or growth rate) from the three loci in the SIVsm/HIV-2 and SIVcpz/HIV-1 analyses. There were significant differences in these parameter estimates from 
 <italic>gag</italic> to 
 <italic>pol</italic> and from 
 <italic>env</italic> to 
 <italic>pol</italic> (P&lt;0.05). Even though these genes evolved along different topologies, their demographic history, and therefore the demographic parameters inferred from them, should be the same. We hypothesized that some genes lack sufficient demographic signal to draw accurate inference about tMRCAs and that allowing the three loci to combine their demographic signal might homogenize their tMRCA estimates.
