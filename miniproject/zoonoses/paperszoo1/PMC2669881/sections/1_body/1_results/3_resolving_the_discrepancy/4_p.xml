<p>Given the different selective regimes that these loci experienced, it is unlikely that the differences in the tMRCA estimates among the three loci were due entirely to variable demographic signal. Nevertheless, accounting for this variation in demographic signal appears to have resolved the majority of the discrepancy among the tMRCA estimates. In addition, even if the differences among the tMRCA estimates were real, and due to recombination, all three loci suggest root ages that are of the same order of magnitude. Therefore, although we discuss these results with reference to what appear to be the most robust loci (
 <italic>gag</italic> for SIVsm/HIV-2 and 
 <italic>env</italic> for SIVcpz/HIV-1), we would be able to draw the same general conclusions from any of the three loci. Finally, we emphasize that although the tMRCA estimates presented include the mean of the posterior distribution, this mean estimate is meaningful only in context of the 95% highest probability density (HPD).
