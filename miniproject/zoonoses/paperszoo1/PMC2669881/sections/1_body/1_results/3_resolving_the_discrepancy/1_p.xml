<p>There were significant discrepancies among the tMRCA estimates from 
 <italic>gag</italic>, 
 <italic>pol</italic>, and 
 <italic>env</italic> in both the SIVsm/HIV-2 and SIVcpz/HIV-1 analyses. We initially thought that this discordance was due to recombination among the loci. If recombination were responsible, the different tMRCA estimates would actually represent different times of coalescence. When examining the phylogenies, however, we found very little evidence for this scenario. There were highly similar patterns of diversity in the SIVsm clades and in the HIV-1 group M sub-types among the three loci. An explanation of recombination would necessitate selective sweeps in 
 <italic>gag</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic>, which would then go on to recreate the ancestral diversity seen in the 
 <italic>pol</italic> phylogeny. For example, HIV-1 group M would have a mean tMRCA around 1795, and, approximately 100 years later, part of the genome would have experienced a selective sweep that gave rise to the same pattern of sub-type diversity (
