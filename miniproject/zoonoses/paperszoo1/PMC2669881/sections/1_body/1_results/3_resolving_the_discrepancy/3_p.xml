<p>To test this hypothesis, we compared a partition analysis where the concatenated genes shared a single demographic scenario to analyses where that scenario was inferred for each gene independently. This analysis was performed separately for SIVsm/HIV-2 and SIVcpz/HIV-1 under two different coalescent scenarios: constant population size and exponential growth. In all cases, allowing the three loci to share demographic information homogenized the tMRCA estimates such that there were no longer significant differences in the age of the root among the phylogenies. Among the SIVsm/HIV-2 loci, 
 <italic>gag</italic> tMRCA estimates change the least between the partition analysis and the analyses where demographic parameters were inferred for each gene independently (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000377-t003">Table 3</xref>). Since tMRCA estimates from g
 <italic>ag</italic> are the most robust to combining demographic parameters, these dates should be taken as the best estimates. Among the SIVcpz/HIV-1 loci, 
 <italic>env</italic> produced the most stable tMRCA estimates, changing as little as 0.01% under the exponential growth model (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000377-t003">Table 3</xref>). This finding suggests that 
 <italic>env</italic> provided the best tMRCA estimates for SIVcpz/HIV-1.
