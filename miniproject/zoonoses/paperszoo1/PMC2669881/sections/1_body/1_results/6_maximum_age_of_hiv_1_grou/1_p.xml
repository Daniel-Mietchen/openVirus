<p>As a result of the discovery of SIVcpz lineages that are very closely related to HIV-1 groups M and N 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Keele1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, we were able to investigate when HIV-1 groups M and N shared a most recent common ancestor (MRCA) with an SIVcpz lineage. Prior to our study, there existed one estimate of this date for HIV-1 group M and SIVcpz at 1675 (1590–1761) 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Salemi1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>; however, this date was obtained using only two SIVcpz sequences, neither of which lies directly basal to HIV-1 group M. Our 
 <italic>env</italic> analysis suggested that HIV-1 group M and the SIVcpz sequence that lies immediately basal to it shared an MRCA in 1853 (1799–1904), and HIV-1 group N and its sister SIVcpz shared a MRCA in 1921 (1885–1955). These dates represent the maximum age for the introduction of HIV-1 groups M and N into humans.
