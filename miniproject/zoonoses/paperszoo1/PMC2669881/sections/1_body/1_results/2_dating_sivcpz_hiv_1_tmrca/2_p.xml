<p>Like in the previous SIVsm/HIV-2 analyses, the three loci produced variable tMRCA estimates for the root and the major HIV-1 lineages (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000377-t001">Table 1</xref>). Again, 
 <italic>pol</italic> had the oldest dates, with the SIVcpz/HIV-1 tMRCA at 1265 (658–1679). In contrast, 
 <italic>gag</italic> had the youngest date at 1618 (1471–1746), and 
 <italic>env</italic> produced an intermediate date at 1492 (1266–1685). tMRCA estimates from 
 <italic>gag</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic> for both HIV-1 group M and HIV-1 group O agreed with previous estimates from Worobey 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Worobey1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and Lemey 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Lemey1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, although the 
 <italic>pol</italic> tMRCA dates were nearly twice as old. There was good agreement between 
 <italic>gag</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic> when dating HIV-1 group N, placing the tMRCAs at 1966 (1953–1977) and 1963 (1948–1977), respectively. We also performed additional phylogenetic inference to ensure that we captured the deepest available HIV-1 group N lineages in our analyses (
