 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000377-g001">Figure 1Dâ€“F</xref>). There was very high posterior support for monophyly in each of the three HIV-1 lineages as well as for the position of the root. The three loci produced different topologies, which is not surprising given the recombinant history of HIV-1 group N
