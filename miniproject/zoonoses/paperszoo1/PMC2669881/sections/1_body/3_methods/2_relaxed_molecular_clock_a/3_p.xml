<p>To determine which locus's tMRCA estimates may be affected by a lack of demographic signal, we performed partition analyses. First, we pruned the SIVsm/HIV-2 dataset to contain only those sequences that were found in all three genes from the same individual and sampling year. In BEAST, we analyzed these reduced datasets assuming constant population size and exponential growth. We then concatenated all 
 <italic>gag</italic>, 
 <italic>pol</italic>, and 
 <italic>env</italic> alignments, and each locus was partitioned to allow it to have its own tree topology, substitution model, relaxed clock model, and tMRCA estimates; they shared only the coalescent demographic parameter(s). This analysis was performed assuming constant population size or exponential growth. Partitioning was not possible for Bayesian skyline plot, as this model's demographic estimates are topology-dependant. The same protocol was used with the SIVcpz/HIV-1 dataset.
