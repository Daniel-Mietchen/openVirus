<p>To infer the tMRCA for the major SIVsm/HIV-2 and SIVcpz/HIV-1 lineages, we employed a BMCMC approach implemented in BEAST v1.4.7 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Drummond1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Drummond2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Initially, each of the three loci for both SIVsm/HIV-2 and SIVcpz/HIV-1 datasets was analyzed independently. Uninformative priors (i.e., tree priors) were placed on all internal nodes whose tMRCAs were estimated. We tested the appropriateness of GTR+Γ
 <sub>4</sub> and SRD06 models; the latter allows for different Κ and Γ values for the third codon position 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Shapiro1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Three different coalescent tree priors were investigated: constant population size, exponential growth, and Bayesian skyline plot. We compared the six different model combinations for each locus using Bayes factor in Tracer v1.4 (

 <sub>4</sub> (Bayes factor&gt;20), but there was not support for one coalescent scenario over any of the others. For SIVcpz, an exponential coalescent model produced substantially younger ages; this observation is not surprising given that a single exponential growth rate for SIVcpz and the HIV-1 group M pandemic lineage would likely underestimate the age of SIVcpz. The date estimates from the Bayesian skyline plot runs were used for both SIVsm and SIVcpz analyses because this model places the fewest constraints on the data
