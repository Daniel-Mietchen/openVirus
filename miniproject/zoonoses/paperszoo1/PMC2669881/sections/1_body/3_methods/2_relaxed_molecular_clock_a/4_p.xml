<p>All date estimates provided are mean values with 95% HPD. Comparisons of tMRCA estimates among BMCMC runs (e.g., among loci and SIV/HIV versus SIV-only) were performed by asking how many times the estimate from one run was greater than the estimate from another run. This value was taken as the probability (P) that the two runs were different.</p>
