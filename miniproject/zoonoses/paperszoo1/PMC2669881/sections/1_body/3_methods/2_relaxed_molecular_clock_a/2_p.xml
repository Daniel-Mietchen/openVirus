<p>Two BMCMC runs of 50 million generations were performed for each analysis to ensure convergence of parameter estimates. Tracer was used to check for convergence and mixing (estimated sample size&gt;200). Trees were annotated using the maximum clade credibility tree. All analyses were performed using an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Drummond1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Each analysis was also run without data to better appreciate how the prior may be affecting the tMRCA estimates. The complete SIV/HIV phylogeny was constructed using a heuristic search in a maximum likelihood framework using a GTR+Î“
 <sub>4</sub> model in PAUP* v4.1 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Swofford1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Topological support was assessed using non-parametric bootstrapping (100 replicates using a heuristic search in a maximum likelihood framework). We used 
 <italic>env</italic> instead of the entire SIV genome because many SIV lineages are of recombinant origin
