 <italic>gag</italic>, 
 <italic>pol</italic>, and 
 <italic>env</italic> sequences) and SIVcpz/HIV-1 (non-recombinant full-length genome sequences) with sampling dates were obtained from the Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV sequence database (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000377-t005">Table 5</xref>). The majority of the SIVsm sequences (&gt;85%) were sampled from infected sooty mangabeys in US primate centers between 1975 and 2005 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Apetrei1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Apetrei2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Dated sequences from macaques infected with SIV from sooty mangabeys were also included. We excluded HIV-1 group M subtype G, as this lineage is likely of recombinant origin 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Abecasis1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. To prevent sampling bias from HIV-1 group M lineages, only two sequences, selected randomly, of each subtype from each year were included in the alignment. Sections of the SIVcpz/HIV-1 genomes that correspond to the 
 <italic>gag</italic>, 
 <italic>pol</italic>, and 
 <italic>env</italic> regions used for the SIVsm/HIV-2 analyses were designated (
