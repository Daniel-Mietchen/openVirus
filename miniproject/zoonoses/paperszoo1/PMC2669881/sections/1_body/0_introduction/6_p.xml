<p>Here, we use relaxed molecular clock phylogenetic inference to determine the tMRCA of SIVsm/HIV-2 and SIVcpz/HIV-1. We also provide, to our knowledge, the first estimate of the age of HIV-1 group N. Taken together, these dates suggest that SIV may indeed be a relatively young viral clade and that its transmission into humans is a natural process.</p>
