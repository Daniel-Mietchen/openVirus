<p>Despite these findings, an important question about the origins of SIV/HIV remains unanswered: How long have these primate hosts been infected with SIV? Answering this question would help determine the length of time SIV was in sooty mangabeys and chimpanzees before giving rise to the transmissible HIV lineages. It might also shed light on the tMRCA of the dozens of other SIV lineages.</p>
