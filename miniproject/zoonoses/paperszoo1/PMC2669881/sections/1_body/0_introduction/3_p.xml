<p>There has also been success in locating the populations of chimpanzees and sooty mangabeys whose SIVs are the direct ancestors of the transmissible HIV lineages (i.e., the SIVs that lie basal to HIV-1 and HIV-2 on the SIV/HIV phylogeny). Extensive non-invasive fecal sampling of wild chimpanzees pointed to the origin of HIV-1 group M in southeastern Cameroon and HIV-1 group N in south central Cameroon
