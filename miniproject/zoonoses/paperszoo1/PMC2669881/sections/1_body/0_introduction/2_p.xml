<p>Determining when the virus jumped into humans has been a priority for HIV researchers. By analyzing viral sequences obtained over several decades and calibrating a molecular clock based on observed nucleotide changes, a reliable rate of sequence evolution can be inferred. Korber 
 <italic>et al.</italic> used this method to estimate the time of most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) for HIV-1 group M at 1931 (1915–1941) 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Korber1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>; this estimate has recently been pushed back slightly to 1908 (1884–1924) 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Worobey1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The tMRCA of HIV-1 group O was estimated to be 1920 (1890–1940) 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Lemey1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Both HIV-1 group M and O dates were inferred using a relaxed molecular clock, which allows the rate of evolution to vary along different branches of the tree. HIV-2 group A and B tMRCAs were estimated to be 1940 (1924–1956) and 1945 (1931–1959), respectively 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1000377-Lemey2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. These dates were estimated using a strict molecular clock, (i.e., a single, constant evolutionary rate along all branches). No estimate currently exists for the tMRCA of HIV-1 group N.
