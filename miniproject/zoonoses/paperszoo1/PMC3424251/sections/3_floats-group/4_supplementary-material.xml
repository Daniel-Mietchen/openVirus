   <bold>Representation of the Ngorongoro rabies transmission over time.</bold> Black nodes represent rabies cases in dogs, gray nodes represent cases in livestock, and red nodes represent cases in other animals. The vertical axis corresponds to the longitude at which the case was recorded. Black edges correspond to transmission events confirmed during data collection. Solid gray edges represent transmission events identified by construction of the most likely epidemic tree. Dashed gray lines represent other possible transmission events identified through iterated tree construction.
