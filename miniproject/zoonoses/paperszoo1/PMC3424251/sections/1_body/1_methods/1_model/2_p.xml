 </disp-formula>where

 <xref rid="pntd.0001796-Diekmann1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, defined for a single-host disease system as the average number of new infections caused by one typical infection in a completely susceptible population. In this multi-host context, we focus instead on the type-reproduction number 
 <italic>T
  <sub>1</sub>
 </italic>, which denotes the expected cumulative number of infected dogs in the chain of transmission that begins with a single rabid dog, disallowing the reproduction of secondary infections in dogs

 </disp-formula>where the first term captures direct transmission from the initial dog to other dogs, and the second term captures infection of dogs by wildlife as the outbreak spreads among wildlife. Equally targeting all host types, the minimum vaccination fraction that will prevent a disease outbreak (p
 <sub>c</sub>) is 1−1/
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>. However, in practice, rabies vaccination campaigns commonly target dogs exclusively. In this case, T
 <sub>1</sub> replaces 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> in the calculation of p
 <sub>c</sub>, and 1−1/T
 <sub>1</sub> yields the minimum vaccination fraction for domestic dogs that should prevent an epidemic in the wider host population
