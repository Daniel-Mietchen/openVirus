<p>We modeled rabies transmission in our system using the next-generation matrix approach 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001796-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, for which we defined two host types: (1) domestic dogs and (2) other carnivores, including domestic cats and a variety of wildlife species. Dogs are considered as a separate host type because they are the target of vaccination campaigns in Tanzania. The number of transmission events from wildlife into the dog population plays a role in determining how much vaccination will be required in dogs, but the species from which transmission occurs does not. Thus, we combined wildlife species together as a second host type. In this context, the term “generation” refers to reproduction of the infection rather than reproduction of the host.
