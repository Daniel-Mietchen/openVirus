<p>Information regarding 107 suspect rabies cases in domestic dogs was recorded for Ngorongoro. Of these, 20 infectious dogs were restrained or killed (19%). Data for 24 suspect cases in other species were recorded. In Serengeti, there was information for 778 suspect cases in domestic dogs, of which 127 dogs were restrained or killed (16%). Data for 92 suspect cases in other species were recorded including cases in domestic cats, civets, genets, hyenas, honey badgers, jackals, leopards, white-tailed mongooses, and wildebeest. To facilitate our analysis of these systems without intervention, cases in which the rabid dog was killed or restrained were removed from parameter estimation, although not from the construction of epidemic trees (see below).</p>
