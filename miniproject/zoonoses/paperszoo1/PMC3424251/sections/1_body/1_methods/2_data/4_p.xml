<p>Contact tracing generated detailed spatiotemporal data on the timing and location of cases and in many instances identified whom transmitted to whom. A previously described tree-building algorithm

 <xref rid="pntd.0001796-Lembo2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> was used to probabilistically infer transmission links between identified cases based on the geographic distance and timing between cases and the spatial infection kernel and generation interval distribution from these natural infections (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001796.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This algorithm was used to address concerns about underreporting of transmission involving wild animals, for which we were unable to identify ancestor-descendant relationships. We constructed 1000 probabilistic epidemic trees using the spatiotemporal data to infer connections for each identified case. The log-likelihood of every tree fell within twice the value of the log-likelihood of the most likely tree, so all trees were accepted as valid possible representations of the true epidemic.
