Briefly, every incident reported either as an animal-bite injury to a hospital or dispensary or a suspect rabid animal through a livestock office or community-based surveillance study was investigated by the research team. To determine the source of exposure and subsequent contacts, villagers were interviewed by veterinary officers, local leaders, and livestock field officers in attendance to facilitate the development of an active surveillance network. The location of the incident was recorded, as well as whether the animal disappeared, was killed, was restrained, or died “naturally” of rabies. Cases were diagnosed through both epidemiological and clinical criteria. Brain samples were collected whenever possible, but the majority of cases were suspected rather than confirmed. When tested, more than 75% of samples led to confirmed rabies diagnoses, indicating the robustness of the clinical and epidemiological criteria 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001796-Lembo2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. As a result of the identification of these initial rabies cases, the subsequent exhaustive tracing of linked suspect cases, and the resulting active surveillance network, many more cases were detected than would be reported through traditional surveillance channels. Although we are unable to determine exactly what proportion of rabies cases were detected using this method, we assume a high probability of detection given the consistency between various population and individual-level epidemiological parameters previously estimated from this data
