<p>The likelihood of a particular λ, l
 <sub>λ</sub>, is estimated through the summation of the probability of that λ value given the number of secondary infections resulting from a single rabid animal, n
 <sub>i</sub>, and the vaccination coverage level associated with that event, p
 <sub>i</sub>, over all rabies events in the dataset 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001796-Ross1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The calculation for this likelihood is given by

 </disp-formula>The time interval for the process during which secondary infections are accumulated is considered to be a single infectious period, or 1.
