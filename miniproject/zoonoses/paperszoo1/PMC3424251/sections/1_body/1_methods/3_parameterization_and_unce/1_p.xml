<p>We categorized each transmission event into one of the types described by the four 
 <italic>k
  <sub>ij</sub>
 </italic> elements in the matrix 
 <bold>K</bold>. Additionally, the prevalence of vaccinated domestic dogs within the surrounding community at the time of each transmission event was modeled using an exponential decay function that incorporated the number of dogs that had been vaccinated during the most recent campaign in that village, the elapsed time since that campaign, and domestic dog vital rates as reported in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001796-Hampson2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The value of 
 <italic>k
  <sub>ij</sub>
 </italic> was estimated by modeling the number of secondary infections (of type i) as a Poisson process at rate λ. The expected number of secondary infections (of type 
 <italic>i</italic>) is then equal to λ. To account for the reduced number of transmission events per rabid animal in a population where some dogs are vaccinated, and to standardize all cases to the population without vaccination, we modulated the Poisson process by the probability p that the bitten dog was susceptible. The estimated vaccination coverage in the domestic dog population at the time of the case was then 1-p.
