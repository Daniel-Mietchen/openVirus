 <xref rid="pntd.0001796-Cleaveland1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> have conducted annual vaccination campaigns. Accordingly we estimated the coverage level that would need to be achieved during a single annual campaign, p

 <sub>c</sub> until the following year. With an adult dog annual death rate of d = 0.45 for both districts and respective annual growth rates of r = 0.102 and 0.09 for Ngorongoro and Serengeti

 </disp-formula>We used

 <italic>p
  <sub>a</sub>
 </italic> value for each 
 <italic>p
  <sub>c</sub>
 </italic> value in our distribution. The percentiles of the distribution of p
 <sub>a</sub> indicate the level of confidence that a policy maker should have that an annual vaccination campaign will be successful in controlling rabies. Annual campaign targets that were adequate in fewer than 50% of the samples were not considered viable strategies.
