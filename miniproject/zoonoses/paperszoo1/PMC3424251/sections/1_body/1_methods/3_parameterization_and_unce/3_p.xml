<p>To find the most likely 
 <italic>k
  <sub>ij</sub>
 </italic> values, we first chose a single random tree and assessed the likelihood of its data given values of λ between 0.01 and 2, at increments of 0.0001, in a case wherein vaccine coverage was not considered (i.e., 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1). Then, initializing λ at the value which had maximized the likelihood, we used a Markov chain Monte-Carlo random walk algorithm to find the most likely values of λ, corresponding to 
 <italic>k
  <sub>ij</sub>
 </italic>, given both our case information and our estimated vaccination coverage levels. We initiated a jump of random size and direction (from a triangular distribution with a range of −1 to 1) from our starting λ to a new potential λ value. Additionally, we randomly chose a new epidemic tree to provide the data for assessing the likelihood at each jump step. When the newly chosen value for λ yielded a greater likelihood than the starting point, it was accepted as a data point and the new starting place. When this value yielded a lower likelihood, it was accepted with a probability equal to the ratio of the two likelihoods

 <italic>k
  <sub>ij</sub>
 </italic> parameters fell between 0.15 and 0.41. The recorded points are likely values for each k
 <sub>ij</sub>. We report the median of the distribution as our point estimate of each parameter.
