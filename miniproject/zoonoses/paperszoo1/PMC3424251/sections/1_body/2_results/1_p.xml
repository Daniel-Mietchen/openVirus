<p>In our model without human intervention, the maximum likelihood estimate for the expected number of secondary domestic dog infections from a single infected domestic dog was similar for both districts, at 1.16 for Ngorongoro and 1.09 for Serengeti, and was the highest host type-to-host type transmission rate in each district (

The lowest estimated transmission rate was from infected domestic dogs to other host species, again similar in both districts at 0.13 for Ngorongoro and 0.09 for Serengeti. The maximum likelihood estimate for transmission from infected alternative hosts to domestic dogs in Serengeti was nearly double that for Ngorongoro, at 0.95 and 0.49, respectively (p&lt;0.05). Conversely, the maximum likelihood estimate for transmission within alternative host species in Ngorongoro was estimated to be 70% higher than that in Serengeti, at 0.39 compared to 0.23. There is considerably larger sample variance in all Ngorongoro parameters than in the Serengeti counterparts, due primarily to the much lower number of cases in Ngorongoro. Both distributions of transmission rates among wildlife fall below one. Thus, based on current data, transmission within wildlife is not self-sustaining in either district.
