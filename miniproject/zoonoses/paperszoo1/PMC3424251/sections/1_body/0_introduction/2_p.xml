<p>Domestic dogs account for more than 95% of human exposures. Consequently, canine vaccination has the potential to concomitantly prevent disease in humans

Nonetheless, there remains skepticism regarding the degree to which large-scale dog vaccination campaigns can control or eliminate dog rabies in the presence of abundant wildlife host species, and concern that coverage levels which have historically been sufficient for rabies control elsewhere might be insufficient in these settings
