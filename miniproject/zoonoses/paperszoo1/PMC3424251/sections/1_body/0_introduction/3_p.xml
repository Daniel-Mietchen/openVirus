<p>Previous theoretical models of rabies transmission have contributed predictions of disease dynamics and control. Notably, a general model of rabies in dog populations predicted that a constantly maintained canine vaccination coverage of 70% should control the disease 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001796-Coleman1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, while a model parameterized for Kenya recommended 70% coverage targets for annual campaigns 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001796-Kitala1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Other models have considered alternate strategies to specifically control rabies in wildlife populations, such as the use of oral vaccination baits or culling

 <xref rid="pntd.0001796-Vial1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, none of these models have explicitly evaluated how transmission in hosts other than domestic dogs might impact the success of mass canine vaccination, or how it might affect the necessary vaccine coverage level.
