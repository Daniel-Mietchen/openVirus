<p>We evaluate the feasibility of rabies control in regions with abundant wildlife populations, using a next-generation model that incorporates rabies contact tracing data from Ngorongoro and Serengeti Districts in Northern Tanzania. Traditionally, calculations to find the proportion of a population that must be vaccinated to control rabies assume that vaccination is uniformly applied across all hosts, and do not account for control effort targeted at a subset of host types. To estimate the required coverage level for a successful rabies vaccination campaign directed at domestic dogs in the presence of other host species, we adapted a multi-host transmission model proposed by Roberts and Heesterbeek 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001796-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Our results indicate that canine vaccination is indeed a feasible strategy to control rabies in a multi-host system. Additionally, we provide estimates for the confidence of program success at a range of vaccination coverage levels for both Tanzanian districts.
