<p>For simplicity, we used the minimum distinct host-types necessary to describe our system: dogs in one class, and other terrestrial carnivores in another. Further stratification would have been possible, with each species treated as its own class of host. However, vaccination campaigns in Tanzania are directed at dogs alone, and the creation of such distinctions between any other hosts has no impact on the recommended vaccination coverage level in dogs. Additionally, the low sample size for most species in our data sets produces such large uncertainty in our model as to obscure any potentially useful conclusions that a closer examination of wildlife species might bring.</p>
