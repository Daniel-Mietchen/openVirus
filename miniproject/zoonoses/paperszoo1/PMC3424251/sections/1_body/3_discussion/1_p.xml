<p>We have shown that annual canine vaccination campaigns achieving 67% coverage in Ngorongoro and 42% coverage in Serengeti should be sufficient to control rabies outbreaks with 95% confidence. These coverage levels are lower than the WHO-recommended annual target of 70% 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001796-WHO2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. We focused on annual coverage targets, since rabies vaccination in Tanzania is conducted through annual campaigns and since the WHO target is specified as such. However, we also calculated that 39% and 25% coverage consistently maintained in Ngorongoro and Serengeti, respectively, will control rabies outbreaks with 95% confidence. These estimates of required coverage are much lower than previous recommendations of 70% coverage on a consistent basis 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001796-Coleman1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The difference is possibly due to fact that the parameters of the previous study were drawn from Asia and the Americas, whereas our model considers rabies dynamics in sub-Saharan Africa 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001796-Hampson2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Our conclusions also suggest that lower coverage levels may be effective than those predicted to be necessary for annual campaigns in Kenya

 <sub>0</sub> value (2.44) found in the Kenyan study. These differences may reflect regional differences in rabies transmission, a conclusion supported by the different transmission dynamics found between our two districts. These differences may also reflect the high dog density in the Kenyan study sites, which could provide increased opportunities for disease transmission

 <sub>0</sub> (1.72, CIs: 1.34–2.18) 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001796-Hampson2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> while the primary: secondary case ratio was based on relatively limited data (44 cases) compared to those from Tanzania (1001 cases) and is likely subject to more stochastic variability. Various methods have been used to provide estimates of

 <sub>0</sub> values have been reported between 1.05–1.32 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001796-Hampson2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Worldwide, most estimates of

 <sub>0</sub> fall below 1.7 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001796-Hampson2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, further indicating that the original estimates from Kenya may be anomalously high. None of these aforementioned studies, however, incorporated transmission in species other than dogs, leaving open the question of whether such transmission might make control by canine vaccination either more difficult or impractical. We have demonstrated that canine vaccination at the levels recommended by the WHO will be more than sufficient to control rabies even in the multi-host setting of northwest Tanzania. In addition, we have shown that control of rabies in canine hosts has the indirect benefit of controlling rabies in wildlife.
