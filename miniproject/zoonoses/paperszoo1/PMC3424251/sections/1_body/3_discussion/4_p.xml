<p>Although this model has demonstrated that relatively low levels of vaccination coverage should be sufficient to control rabies in these populations, we must emphasize the need for annual revaccination of the dog population. Elimination is an unlikely possibility without concerted regional control efforts, as reintroduction events from neighboring endemic areas commonly occur 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001796-Beyer1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. We also caution against direct extrapolation of these estimates into policy recommendations for target vaccination coverage any lower than 70%, as human health benefits will undoubtedly accrue as outbreaks from these reintroductions are controlled more swiftly. Further study into the costs and benefits to humans of canine vaccination is warranted to clarify this point.
