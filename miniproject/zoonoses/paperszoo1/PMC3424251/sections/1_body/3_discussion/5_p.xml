<p>In summary, we have analyzed contact tracing data to demonstrate that a program of canine vaccination has the ability to control rabies in the Ngorongoro and Serengeti districts of Tanzania, even in the presence of transmission within and among other species. We parameterized transmission rates, accounting for sampling uncertainty for rabies in northwest Tanzania. Our analysis provides a framework for accounting for uncertainty in disease transmission among multiple types of hosts, evaluating the effectiveness of rabies control strategies, and guiding policy makers in their control efforts against this devastating disease.</p>
