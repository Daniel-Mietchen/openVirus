<p>Although rabies transmission in wildlife is not self-sustaining, it does increase overall transmission in the system and causes differences in the transmission dynamics between the two districts. Transmission rates within alternative host species were much higher in Ngorongoro than in Serengeti. Presumably, the higher density of wildlife in Ngorongoro provided a greater abundance of susceptible alternative hosts for transmission events from the typical rabid wild animal. In contrast, wildlife were much more likely to transmit rabies to domestic dogs in Serengeti, probably due to the higher density of domestic dogs in this district. In turn, rabid dogs may be transmitting the disease to new hosts in proportions based more on their socialization than on relative species abundance in the area, resulting in similar rates for transmission from dogs to dogs and from dogs to wildlife in the two districts.</p>
