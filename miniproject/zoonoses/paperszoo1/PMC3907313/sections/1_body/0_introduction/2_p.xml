<p>Various aspects need to be considered when estimating disease burden: collective versus individual burden, the cost of preventive versus curative measures, morbidity and mortality versus financial burden, acute versus chronic disease, human versus animal disease, etc. With the exception of some data on Japanese encephalitis virus, very few prevalence, incidence, cost-ascertainment or clinical follow-up studies seem available on most identified encephalitides circulating in countries of the Mekong region. We reviewed published Medline-referenced resources on encephalitis and meningoencephalitis and used these to complete an overview of the epidemiological situation in this dynamic region of the world.</p>
