<p>An additional 47 (14.8%) children were positive at IPC both for JEV and Dengue virus (DENV) IgM, for which the causative pathogen could be either flavivirus (15 July 2013 email exchanges with Philippe Buchy, personal communication). This illustrates the additional difficulty of diagnosing JEV encephalitis when CSF may contain undetectable amounts of pathogen or genetic material, when patients arrive late in the course of the disease at hospitals with diagnostic capability, when CSF samples are not routinely taken in countries such as Cambodia, and when attempting diagnosis in countries where other cross-reactive flaviviruses such as dengue are endemoepidemic.</p>
