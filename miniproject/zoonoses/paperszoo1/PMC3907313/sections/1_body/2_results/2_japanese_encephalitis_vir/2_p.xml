<p>There is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the present situation. Only 4,633 cases (200 deaths) were reported to WHO in 2008 from the Western Pacific region 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002533-WHOWPRO1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, due to some high-endemicity countries having introduced JEV vaccination 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002533-DitInVS1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002533-WHOSEARO1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> but certainly also to clinical misdiagnosis 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002533-Solomon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, underdiagnosis, and/or underreporting. There are very few geographical locations in the Mekong countries with JEV epidemiological data with vast swathes of encephalitis terra incognita 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002533-Acestor1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Authors have tried to ascertain the size of the at-risk population and the estimated annual number of JEV cases using modelling techniques 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002533-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002533-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0002533-Erlanger1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. These modelling techniques far underestimate the observed number of cases in a country like Cambodia, where vaccination is not available countrywide and where the surface used for cultivating rice paddy—harbouring competent vectors—has increased by 39% between 2004 and 2011 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002533-FAO1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Recently, Campbell et al. 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002533-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> revisited and complemented Tsai's method, concluding that 67,897 JEV cases occurred per year worldwide. For Cambodia, however, these estimates are based only on published sentinel surveillance data 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002533-Touch1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, which probably provides an incomplete picture and will lead to severe underestimation. Using Campbell's method, we arrive at an estimated 8,200 cases of symptomatic infection annually for the Mekong region and 563 for Cambodia alone (not shown). In 2012, the number of meningoencephalitis patients documented by the Kantha Bopha Foundation hospitals alone in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap were 2,090 and 1,521, respectively (2013 phone call with D. Laurent, personal communication). The Institut Pasteur du Cambodge (IPC) tested samples from 317 of these patients as part of a research study, finding JEV IgM in patients' cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or serum in 51 (16.1%). Extrapolated to the 3,611 meningoencephalitis cases, this conservative estimate yields a total number of 581 JEV cases at Kantha Bopha hospitals alone. Meningoencephalitis cases are managed throughout Cambodia, whether in public sector or third-tier Foundation hospitals. Another project at Angkor Hospital for Children (Siem Reap) found 15 (15%) JEV positivity among a series of 100 meningoencephalitis cases (blood and/or CSF, 24 July 2013 email exchanges with V. Kumar, personal communication).
