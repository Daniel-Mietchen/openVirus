<p>Probabilistic encephalitis management protocol based on sound clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory-based research would benefit patients in settings with limited access to diagnostic capacities. State-of-the-art medical and scientific collaborations dedicated to encephalitides in the Mekong region are urgently needed. These may be organized around three main axes: (i) reinforced microbiological and immunological etiological investigations, (ii) improved clinical and therapeutic management, and (iii) assessment of ecoepidemiological and social determinants to identify environmental and behavioural risk factors for acquiring disease 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002533-Paireau1" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>. Well-designed frontline diagnostic strategies using modern biomolecular tools with high sensitivity complemented by highly specific testing by second- or third-line, highly competent research laboratories would provide timely diagnosis of immediately treatable aetiologies, to the patients' direct benefit. Microbiological and biomolecular approaches would help describe the distribution of pathogens and open possibilities for improved diagnosis and treatment. Encephalitis, however, is about individuals, families, and communities. Epidemiologists would make the irreplaceable laboratory findings more accurate, representative, and interpretable through rigorous selection and documentation of patients. They would also add further value to these findings by helping identify hotspots, investigate trends and outbreaks, assess sequelae or associated risk factors, and generate a database and map documenting which pathogen was identified where. Finally, ecoepidemiological investigations of what are often zoonotic pathogens using a one-health approach would provide insights on pathogens' circulation and prevention on a larger scale.
