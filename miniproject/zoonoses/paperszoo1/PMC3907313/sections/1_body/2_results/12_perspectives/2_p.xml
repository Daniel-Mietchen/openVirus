<p>Whatever the nature and scope of the encephalitis burden in Southeast Asia and the criterion used to assess it—morbidity, mortality, handicap, impact on families' budget, or livelihood—that burden is borne principally by the same rural, economically fragile populations with limited access to prevention and health care. The identification of etiological agents is useful for estimating burden and to guide research, but first and foremost to urgently rule out treatable or preventable causes. Overall, surveillance and diagnostic capabilities for encephalitis remain poor in most areas of the Mekong region and beyond
