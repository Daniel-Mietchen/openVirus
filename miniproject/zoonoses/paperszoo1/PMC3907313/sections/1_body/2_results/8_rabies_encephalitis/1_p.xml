 <bold>Rabies</bold> is widely enzootic throughout Southeast Asia. Canine rabies is neglected and has re-emerged in China since 1990

 <xref rid="pntd.0002533-ProMEDmail1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>), causing high morbidity (as rabid dogs bite more frequently 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002533-Cleaveland1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>) and economic burden and mortality (human rabies deaths) throughout the region. With an estimated annual incidence of 5.8/100,000 population (95% CI 2.8â€“11.5) in Cambodia, rabies has been estimated to cause over 800 deaths a year for a population of 14 million 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002533-Ly1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, an incidence comparable to or higher than that of road-related deaths in developed countries 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002533-International1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. As with JEV, vaccination is available in the region but generally not readily accessible for populations at risk.
