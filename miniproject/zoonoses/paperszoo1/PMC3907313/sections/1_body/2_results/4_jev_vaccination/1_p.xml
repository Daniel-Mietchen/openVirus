<p>Effective JEV vaccination was first developed in 1941 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002533-WHOSEARO1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and is now readily available. Laboratory and clinical surveillance data have shown its effectiveness as a public health measure in countries like Japan or South Korea 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002533-DitInVS1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Data from Thailand and Vietnam show that vaccination has transformed the epidemiology of JEV in those countries, vastly reducing the incidence of JEV since it was introduced or expanded in the 1990s

 <xref rid="pntd.0002533-WHOSEARO1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The vaccine has recently been introduced in Laos but remains to be introduced or rolled out in the routine immunization programs of Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar. The vaccination of pigs for JEV could be cost-effective from a public health point of view by decreasing the level of circulation in the amplifying host and consecutively the incidence in humans

 <xref rid="pntd.0002533-Sasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The impact of mass JEV vaccination of swine on human health has been studied in Japan 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002533-Igarashi1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, showing a reduction of JEV transmission to humans. Unfortunately the high turnover of animals and the cost of vaccine make such options cost-ineffective. Implementing swine vaccination in countries like Cambodia or Laos where 70% of all pigs are raised in small-scale farms 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002533-Huynh1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> would be a serious challenge. Although large-scale vaccination of domestic pigs may not be feasible, the use of pigs as sentinel animals appears efficient at least in the early detection of human outbreaks
