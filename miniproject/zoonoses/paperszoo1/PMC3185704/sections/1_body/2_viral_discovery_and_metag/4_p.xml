<p>The paucity of information about viral diversity within a host poses problems for research progress. It is difficult to understand viral pathogenesis and transmission without completely understanding the dynamics of co-infections. Indeed, it is currently difficult to ascribe a host’s symptoms to an individual virus with any certainty because a virus’ actions, and even its ability to infect the host, could be a function of another (possibly undetected) co-habitant of the host. Evidence of interactions between co-infecting species has been clearly demonstrated [

Broadening our understanding of the diversity of pathogens that exist in human and animal hosts through wildlife and domestic animal surveillance will significantly improve our ability to recognize novel zoonotic agents in the context of a disease outbreak. Phylogenetic information obtained from comparative sequence analyses can improve our understanding of the impact of sequence mutation on virulence, as well as inform decisions about vaccine development. A final noteworthy benefit of viral discovery efforts is that these techniques should be important for identifying candidates for future vaccines as a virus’s most worthy competitor is often another virus.
