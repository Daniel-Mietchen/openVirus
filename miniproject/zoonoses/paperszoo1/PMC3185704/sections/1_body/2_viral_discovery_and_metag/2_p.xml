<p>A major hurdle for both virologists and ecologists is defining the biodiversity of life. At present, scientists do not know the actual number of mammal species, much less the diversity of viruses they harbor [

 <italic>Mus musculus</italic>), a staple in biomedical research, is not yet completely known. Recent advances in genetic sequencing, including high-throughput sequencing and other “next-generation sequencing” techniques, as well as MassTag PCR and microarray multiplex assays [
