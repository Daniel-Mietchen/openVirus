Metagenomics has also been used to screen human and animal clinical samples in order to determine etiologic agents of disease or to describe the microbial flora normally present in a vertebrate host—in many cases the result has been the discovery both of novel pathogens and novel associations between clinical disease and agent [

As technology becomes more affordable, and thus accessible, there will be increasing opportunities to ask large-scale questions such as: How does the virosphere vary across space and time? How does it vary across species? Can we use this to define risk of cross-species transmission or to inform conservation efforts? And how might co-infections with these undiscovered viruses influence the dynamics of the more well known viruses?
