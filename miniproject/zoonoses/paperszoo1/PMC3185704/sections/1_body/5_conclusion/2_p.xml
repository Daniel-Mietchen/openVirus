<p>We are experiencing a global increase in the rate of emerging viral zoonoses, which are primarily driven by anthropogenic activities such as land-use change, agricultural intensification, and driven by global travel and trade [

In order to adequately understand, predict and ultimately interrupt the processes by which zoonoses cross the species barrier from their natural reservoirs to humans, and then become established as human pathogens, comprehensive scientific studies that use the tools of ecology, virology, microbiology, and epidemiology are needed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b113-viruses-03-00379">113</xref>]. The study of disease ecology has become an established discipline with advances in both the formulation of new theory as well as the integration of molecular virological techniques that provide important information about epidemiology, ecology and viral evolution, all of which has been applied to both health and conservation [

Because ecological systems are rife with heterogeneities and often have non-intuitive processes underlying their dynamics, it is critically important for scientists to use a comprehensive approach to understanding the population processes of an ecosystem before successful intervention strategies can be developed or implemented. Admittedly this is a daunting task and it is often the case that scientists need to operate with less than complete information. Where this is the case, a modeling approach is necessary to identify key processes that allow successful interventions.
