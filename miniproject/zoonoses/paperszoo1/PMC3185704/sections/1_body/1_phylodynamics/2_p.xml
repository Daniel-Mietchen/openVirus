<p>The phylodynamic paradigm, established in 2004 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-viruses-03-00379">37</xref>], exemplifies the power of a multidisciplinary approach. It unites the ecological and evolutionary study of viruses and builds upon advances in sequencing technologies and 
 <bold>coalescent theory</bold>, by which gene genealogies are reconstructed backward in time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-viruses-03-00379">38</xref>]. The analysis of phylogenetic trees enables researchers to address many of the primary questions posed by disease ecologists (

 <bold>basic reproductive number</bold> (R
 <sub>0</sub>), which is a measure of parasite fitness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-viruses-03-00379">39</xref>]. Phylodynamics has far-reaching applications for the control of viruses in both human and animal populations, in addition to being vital to our understanding of the interconnectedness between them.
