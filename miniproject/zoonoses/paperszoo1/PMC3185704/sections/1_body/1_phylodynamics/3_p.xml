<p>Phylodynamic studies can be used to identify reservoir species as well as defining the spatial and temporal origin of emerging infectious diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-viruses-03-00379">37</xref>]. They can also help to elucidate how these viruses spread following their emergence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-viruses-03-00379">39</xref>]. Firstly, chains of viral transmission can be extrapolated from the branching topology of phylogenetic trees. One example of the utility of this approach is with rabies virus. Rabies causes thousands of human deaths a year in Africa and has been implicated in the decline and local extinction of several populations of African wild dog (
 <italic>Lycaon pictus</italic>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-viruses-03-00379">40</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-viruses-03-00379">41</xref>]. Lembo 
 <italic>et al.</italic> analyzed sequences of rabies virus from the Serengeti, revealing that domestic dogs were the reservoir of the virus and that they had transmitted it to other resident carnivore populations on repeated occasions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-viruses-03-00379">42</xref>]. This work has applicability in that it can be used to design efficient and effective vaccination strategies, both to alleviate current distress and prevent future outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-viruses-03-00379">40</xref>]. Secondly, by mapping the geographical origin of each sequence onto the nodes of phylogenetic trees, the geographical origin of a virus might be identified. Wallace 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2007) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-viruses-03-00379">43</xref>] used this phylogeographic approach to identify Guangdong province, China as the most parsimonious origin of highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian influenza and to delineate the most likely pathways of viral spread [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-viruses-03-00379">43</xref>]. However, a recent Bayesian analysis of this data did not support the conclusion that H5N1 had dispersed from Guangdong to Indonesia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-viruses-03-00379">44</xref>]. Instead, the Bayesian analysis suggested it had spread to Indonesia from Guangxi or Hunan in China. This example demonstrates that different statistical techniques may yield different conclusions. As yet, neither the Bayesian nor the frequentist method is universally considered to be superior and there is much room for improvement as statistical 
 <bold>phylogeography</bold> develops as a field. Phylogeographic tools have also been applied by Walsh 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2005) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-viruses-03-00379">45</xref>] to locate the putative origin of the Zaire strain of Ebola virus. In an attempt to resolve the controversy over the time of emergence and spreading trajectory of Ebola in the Congo Basin, they then used spatial data and two different tests for the impact of selection on the virus genome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-viruses-03-00379">45</xref>]. Where a virus is expanding in range, as the Zaire strain of Ebola virus appears to be, using a ‘landscape genetics’ approach may help identify geographical barriers to viral spread and help identify vulnerable human or wildlife populations lying in the path of infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-viruses-03-00379">46</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-viruses-03-00379">47</xref>].
