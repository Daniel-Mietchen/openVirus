<p>It is surprising that viruses have not been used more for the inference of host population biology since some of their characteristics make them ideal for doing so. Most viruses have large population sizes and short generation times, and many replicate using a highly error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, causing them to accumulate many more mutations (nucleotide changes) per unit time than the host genomes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62-viruses-03-00379">62</xref>]. Consequently, viruses may provide information about host demographics on a shorter timescale than molecular markers of the host. One of the signature tools of phylodynamics, the 
 <bold>Bayesian skyline plot</bold>, might also be utilized to infer changes in historical population size of the host. These plots incorporate the use of a molecular clock and coalescent theory to infer historical changes in virus population sizes without assuming a predefined demographic model [
