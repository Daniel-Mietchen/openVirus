<p>There is great potential for the further use of this technique by conservation biologists and ecologists, and for it to complement existing methods which utilize host genetic data. Host genetic markers are used to define management units for conservation purposes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65-viruses-03-00379">65</xref>], a feature that correlates with both extinction risk in certain regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66-viruses-03-00379">66</xref>] and difficulty in reconstructing recent demographic history from molecular markers. Because of the latter, the use of viral genetics to define management units may be an important avenue of exploration. In addition to aiding the definition of management units, viral data could be used to analyze the consequences of management activities and other environmental changes on target species. Where viral genetic diversity exists in a spatially heterogeneous distribution, viral movement patterns could be used to study the migratory behavior of animals (as macroparasites have been [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71-viruses-03-00379">71</xref>]), the above objectives could be achieved in a cost effective manner with minimal disturbance of the study species. Viruses with specific transmission routes may also serve as proxies for behaviors related to transmission (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, sexually transmitted diseases). Similarly, where cross-species transmission occurs, viruses might be indicative of types of sustained, direct contact between different, sympatric taxa which facilitate such transmission, for example predator-prey interactions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72-viruses-03-00379">72</xref>]. At the broader ecosystem level, inferences about long-term evolutionary processes might also be made by examining the phylogeographic structure of numerous host and virus populations of a region (see [
