<p>Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is known for high host specificity and is, thus far, the only virus to have been used to elucidate changes in host population structure and size. From a phylogenetic analysis of FIVpco, the FIV type specific to the cougar (
 <italic>Puma concolor</italic>), Biek, Drummond, and Poss (2006) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61-viruses-03-00379">61</xref>] inferred that the North American population of cougars became subdivided during the last century but subsequently expanded in both size and range. Subsequently, Antunes 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2008) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60-viruses-03-00379">60</xref>] used the distribution of FIV
 <sub>Ple</sub> subtypes in the Serengeti to infer that recent 
 <bold>admixture</bold> has occurred between the regionâ€™s lion (
 <italic>Panthera leo)</italic> populations. These recent changes in felid population size and structure could not have been inferred from host genetic data.
