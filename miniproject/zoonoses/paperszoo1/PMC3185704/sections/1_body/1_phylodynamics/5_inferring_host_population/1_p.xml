<p>The utility of phylodynamics is not limited to questions of interest to virologists and disease ecologists. This approach may also inform investigations of host population biology and, in so doing, aid in the development of conservation policy. Host molecular markers (e.g., microsatellites, mitochondrial DNA) are used by conservation biologists and ecologists to infer population structure, historical
