<p>Unfortunately, the very characteristics that make viruses useful for estimating host population structure and demography may also impede the analyses. Multiple substitutions can occur quickly in the viral genome and this will obscure the host population’s actual evolutionary history. Meanwhile, variations in the transmission mechanisms of viruses (vertical 
 <italic>vs.</italic> horizontal) can alter the ability to accurately infer a virus’ relationship to a host population. Cross-species transmission is also problematic in that it can cause pathogen phylogenies to inaccurately reflect the history of their hosts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62-viruses-03-00379">62</xref>]. Therefore, before the genetic information contained within a virus population can be used to infer the population structure and demography of the host, it is critical to test for congruence in the evolutionary history of the host and virus populations. This is accomplished by statistically comparing the respective phylogenies within the relevant timescale. Viruses with high host specificity have a greater likelihood of exhibiting such congruence.
