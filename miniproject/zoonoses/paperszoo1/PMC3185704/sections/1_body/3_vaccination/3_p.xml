<p>Vaccines take several forms including live-attenuated viruses; inactivated whole viruses; inactivated toxins and viral protein subunits, and these are often delivered in combination. While live-attenuated vaccines have been predominant, a new generation of techniques including gene delivery and nano-technologies are being used to develop highly-efficacious and safer vaccines, that have less risk of
