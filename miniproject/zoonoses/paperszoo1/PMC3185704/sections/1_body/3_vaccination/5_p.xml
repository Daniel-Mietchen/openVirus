<p>The possibility of inadvertent viral strain selection highlights the importance of understanding the long-term evolutionary and ecological consequences of vaccination. Indeed, where threatened or endangered animals are concerned, mishaps may prove disastrous. Attenuated canine distemper vaccines did not provide immunity to critically endangered black-footed ferrets, while the use of a live canine distemper virus vaccine resulted in clinical distemper arising in one of the few remaining populations [

In contrast to the ferret experience, efforts with the endangered Ethiopian wolf serve as an example of a successful vaccination program. Wolf populations were suffering severe mortality due to rabies and distemper acquired from the wild dogs that shared their home range [
