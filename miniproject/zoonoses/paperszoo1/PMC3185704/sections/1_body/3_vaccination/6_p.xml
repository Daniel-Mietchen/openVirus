Targeted vaccination of this single species could potentially result in herd immunity and reduce the risk of human infection as well as decreasing wildlife mortality. These works exemplify how ecological knowledge can be used to identify and exploit some of the heterogeneities which so often dominate the dynamics of pathogens.
