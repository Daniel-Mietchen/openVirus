<p>The problems entailed by the sheer number of viruses, viral resistance, the explosive potential for spread, and the economic burden, make it clear that currently available vaccination methods do not provide a sustainable solution for either human or animal disease. The unambiguous indication is that researchers need to work towards the goal of developing a predictive framework where risk can be defined for different scenarios and not only to rank pathogens, and species, but also, places and times of year that can be identified as more or less precarious for global health. Pending questions include: Which geographic areas will experience more disease and conservation problems? Which areas pose the highest risk for pandemic spread of pathogens? What characteristics of hosts and viruses make them more or less likely to be involved in cross-species transmission events? And what are the relative roles of genetic relatedness and contact rate for transmission? Some modeling work and reviews of historic data have been informative [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b105-viruses-03-00379">105</xref>], but novel uses of phylogenies of both viruses and hosts (as discussed above) provide promise for progress to this end, especially when coupled with high quality surveillance data. Once we have this information, scientists will be able to design “smart surveillance” strategies whereby valuable vaccine resources can be efficiently targeted and efficiently distributed.
