<p>Parallel to this progress, the field of virology, particularly the subfields of molecular virology and viral evolution, have also been burgeoning, largely due to advances in technology that have made molecular assays and genetic sequencing more accessible to a greater number of scientists. The development of high-throughput sequencing has greatly increased our ability to efficiently detect known viruses as well as to discover new types of viruses, thereby improving our understanding of viral diversity, pathology and evolution. This increased capacity has spawned the development of new fields of study. For example, phylodynamics allows researchers to determine the origin of circulating viruses in space and time. Mutations among viral strains can be used to investigate interactions among host species as well as long-range host movement via corridors and flyways. Phylodynamic analyses can also inform livestock management practices, as was the case with Foot and Mouth disease in the United Kingdom [
