Understanding viral ecology in wildlife reservoirs and identifying high-risk human-wildlife interfaces is especially critical in the context of ever increasing globalization, whereby transportation networks facilitate rapid spread of pathogens well beyond bounds where traditional epidemiological methods can be effective [
