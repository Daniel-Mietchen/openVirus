<p>The roots of ecology date back to Theophrastus in the 4th century B.C. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-viruses-03-00379">14</xref>]. The concept of food chains originated in the 17th century and Darwin and Wallace put forth the theory of evolution in the 18th century [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-viruses-03-00379">15</xref>], but ecology did not become a prominent field until 1927 when two key advances transformed the study into a proper discipline. In this year, Charles Elton published his 
 <italic>Animal Ecology</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-viruses-03-00379">16</xref>] and Kirmack and McKendrick (1927) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-viruses-03-00379">17</xref>] formulated a model to describe the progress of an epidemic in a homogenous population [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-viruses-03-00379">17</xref>]. In the 1960s, Rachael Carsonâ€™s 
 <italic>Silent Spring</italic> generated concern for the environment and thrust ecologists into a new political field where preserving the integrity of our global ecosystems was the priority [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-viruses-03-00379">18</xref>]. Even so, the Society for Conservation Biology was not established until 1985 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-viruses-03-00379">19</xref>]. As a part of this transition, ecology shifted from a descriptive science to one of prediction, reflecting the hope that ecologists might mitigate changes which can have negative impacts upon the ecosystem. Ecologists have branched out into the study of parasites and disease as it has become increasingly apparent that parasites are inextricably linked to the ecology of their hosts and environments, to the point where they have been a driving force in the evolution of sexual reproduction and in the shaping of biodiversity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-viruses-03-00379">20</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-viruses-03-00379">21</xref>]. Over the past 30 years, disease ecologists have developed the study of parasites and pathogens in the wild. This knowledge has been synthesized into mathematical models which describe the dynamic properties of ecosystems and predict how parasites and pathogens flow through them. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-viruses-03-00379">22</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-viruses-03-00379">23</xref>]. These models are becoming more commonly integrated into epidemiological studies that seek to predict outbreaks or periods of time when cross-species spillover risk is highest.
