<p>Our planet is currently experiencing the sixth mass extinction event in history [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-viruses-03-00379">1</xref>]. Although there are problems with estimating the total number of extant animal species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-viruses-03-00379">2</xref>], recent extinction rates are thought to be 100- to 1000-times greater than past rates determined from the fossil record. It is estimated that as many as 140,000 species are perishing each year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-viruses-03-00379">3</xref>]. Although habitat loss and fragmentation are the main drivers of this high extinction rate, infectious disease also contributes to animal population declines either independently, by reducing population size, or through interactions with other processes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-viruses-03-00379">4</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-viruses-03-00379">5</xref>].
