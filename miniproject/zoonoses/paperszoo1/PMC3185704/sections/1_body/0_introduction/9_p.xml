<p>Globalization, host ecology, host-virus dynamics, climate change, and anthropogenic landscape changes all contribute to the complexity of zoonotic viral emergence and disease, and create significant conservation and public health challenges. Comprehensive and collaborative scientific approaches that transcend disciplinary boundaries are necessary to address these challenges. It is the goal of this paper to review new methods for understanding viral dynamics and illustrate how and when these techniques can be used by not only public health officials, but also disease ecologists and conservation biologists.</p>
