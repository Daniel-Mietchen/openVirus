<p>The negative impacts of emerging infectious diseases are not limited to humans. Indeed, wildlife conservationists have documented several mass mortality events in other animal species. Western lowland gorillas (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-viruses-03-00379">33</xref>] and an especially virulent calicivirus, rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, spread through both domestic and wild rabbit populations, resulting in tens of millions of deaths [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-viruses-03-00379">34</xref>]. In some instances the viruses have 
 <bold>attenuated</bold>, while in others the animal populations have been brought to the brink of extinction. Importantly, the risk from disease to humans and animals should not be separated. The global transportation network facilitated the introduction of infected vectors (e.g., mosquitoes) into New York and WNV caused both avian and human mortality, and this virus has subsequently spread across the United States [
