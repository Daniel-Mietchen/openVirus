<p>Ecological studies can effectively inform conservation as well as public health policy. Gaining knowledge of reservoir host ecology can be critical for the development of eradication strategies. Most viral disease systems are dominated by heterogeneities and identifying and understanding these can be crucially important when trying to interrupt the chain of events that leads to persistence. Ecological studies of WNV have shown how forest fragmentation and decreased biodiversity can alter transmission among avian hosts as well as to humans [

Increased pathogen surveillance and ecosystem process monitoring may provide the insight necessary to mitigate problems before they become serious human health or conservation concerns. This is especially the case for zoonotic viral pathogens where the reservoir hosts are known and a targeted approach is feasible.
