<p>Rodents rank as the number one reservoir of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-viruses-03-00379">9</xref>]. Conveniently, these small mammals also present a manageable system for studying disease dynamics [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b111-viruses-03-00379">111</xref>]. Individuals can be marked and sampled individually through time. Their locations as well as their contacts with other individuals can be measured. As such, wild populations of rodents can be valuable as model disease systems to address relevant questions like: Are there key hosts for transmission? How does prevalence vary seasonally or over time? What is the contact rate between the reservoir and humans? How do these pathogens flow through populations? The answers are of critical importance because they provide an indication of when and where there is increased risk of a zoonotic event whereby a human becomes infected, or when a species becomes at genuine risk of extinction. By monitoring and manipulating wild populations, one might also be able to identify factors that may increase a pathogens chance of emerging. For instance, what characteristics of hosts and viruses make them more or less likely to be involved in cross-species transmission? And what are the relative roles of genetic relatedness and contact rate for transmission? Long-term monitoring and surveillance in reservoirs will also enlighten us to the kind of 
 <bold>aggregations</bold> and other heterogeneities that exist through time and that and can be exploited with efficient vaccination campaigns.
