    <td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Demography is the statistical study of populations. In the field of ecology, demography encompasses the study of the size, structure and distribution of populations, and spatial and/or temporal changes in them in response to birth, migration, aging and death. However, here we use a more rigid definition of demography—as the pattern and rate of population growth.</td>

The analogue of Ne for viruses, the ‘effective number of infections’ is related to the number of infected host individuals and to the number of new transmission events [

    <td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">The molecular clock is derived from the hypothesis that sequence evolution, while random, occurs at stable rate such that the time since the divergence of two or more sequences can be estimated. Recent ‘relaxed molecular clock’ analysis can account for variation in the rate of sequence evolution through time or between lineages.</td>

    <td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Population Structure</td>
    <td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">In the field of population genetics, population structure is defined as the absence of random mating within a population. This is the definition used here. In ecology, population structure is defined by several key parameters including number of individuals in a population, age distribution of individuals, probabilities of survival (or mortality), and rates of fecundity.</td>

    <td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reassortment</td>
    <td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A process that occurs in segmented viruses by which one or more segments ‘swap’ to create a new viral genome. This drives the process of antigenic shift in Influenza A viruses.</td>

    <td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Recombination</td>
    <td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">The process by which new genotypes are created by the combination of distinct lineages. In sexual organisms it occurs during meiotic division, by the exchange of DNA between different chromosomes or ‘crossing-over’. Viral recombination occurs during viral replication and is an important factor in viral evolution (for more details see Worobey and Holmes, 1999 [

The macroparasites in a host population are often best described by the negative binomial distribution such that a minority of hosts possess the majority of the parasites.</td>

     <sub>0</sub> is the average number of secondary infections which an infection produces. As such it is a measure of parasite fitness.
