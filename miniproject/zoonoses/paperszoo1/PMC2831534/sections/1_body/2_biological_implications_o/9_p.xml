<p>Interestingly, despite the obvious impact of recombination for viral evolution [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>], some negative-strand RNA viruses do not seem to display an active recombination, at least among standard infectious genomes. These viruses show, however, an extremely high adaptive potential comparable to that of other RNA viruses that display an active recombination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>]. This suggests that the viruses that have survived to the present time, and probably also their ancestors, have redundant adaptive mechanisms to respond to the multiple selective constraints that their hosts have evolved to limit their replication. All mechanisms of genetic variation of viruses exert a key influence in viral disease emergence, as discussed next.
