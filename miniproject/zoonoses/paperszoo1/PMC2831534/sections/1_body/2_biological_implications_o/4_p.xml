<p>DNA viruses with large genomes (poxviruses, iridoviruses, adenoviruses) encode DNA polymerases endowed with a proofreading 3′-5′ exonuclease activity, similar to those found in cellular, replicative DNA-dependent DNA polymerases (DdDp). Therefore, such DNA viruses are not expected to display the general high mutation rates typical of RNA viruses. However, it would be important to measure mutation rates for DNA viruses in order to compare the values with those available for RNA viruses. Relevant factors that can influence the mutation rates displayed by DNA viruses are whether the viral genome DNA is replicated by a high or low fidelity DNA polymerase, and whether post-replicative repair pathways reach the viral replication sites, and can cope with the correction of errors that may occur in many nascent DNA genomes in viral replication complexes where viral DNA accumulates. These questions have not been solved [
