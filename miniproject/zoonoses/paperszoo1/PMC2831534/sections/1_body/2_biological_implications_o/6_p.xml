<p>Recombination occurs both with RNA and DNA viruses, but it is infrequent with most negative-strand RNA viruses. Recombination has been divided in replicative and non-replicative, according to whether viral genome replication is required or not [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. From the point of view of evolution, recombination has been viewed as a means to rescue fit viral genomes from low fitness parents (a force to eliminate deleterious mutations) or a means to produce highly divergent genomes that provide an opportunity to explore the adaptative potential of rare genomic combinations (a force for large evolutionary transitions). There is good evidence that recombination and reassortment events, followed by fitness adjustments through mutation, have played a role in the emergence and re-emergence of new viral pathogens. In fact, most (but not all) emergences and re-emergences of human viral diseases, that have amounted to about one per year during the last decades, have been associated with RNA viruses that display active recombination or reassortment. As examples, several recent poliomyelitis outbreaks have been related to viruses generated by recombination between attenuated vaccine polioviruses and other circulating enteroviruses [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. Also, the alphavirus Western equine encephalitis virus probably resulted from an ancient recombination between a Sindbis-like and a Easter-equine encephalitis-like virus (reviewed in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>]). The emergence of the SARS coronavirus around 2002 probably involved the transfer of the virus from a bat to a carnivore (probably a civet cat); contact with civets may have facilitated the human outbreak. The human ACE2 receptor-binding sequences used by the human SARS coronavirus may have been acquired by recombination with a preexisting group 1 human coronavirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. In this, and in the other cases in which recombination played a role in the generation of a new pathogen, selection of virus variants for a more efficient replication in the new host (for receptor use or other) probably took place [
