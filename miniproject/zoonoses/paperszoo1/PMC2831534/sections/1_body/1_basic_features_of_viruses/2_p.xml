<p>Viral disease emergence is a major concern in public health, and the events behind their occurrence have been extensively analyzed [

Although in most published accounts on viral disease emergence the role of genetic variation of viruses has been considered, the majority of studies have examined factors that affect viral traffic, and have described many examples of inter-species transmissions. Few treatments have dissected intra-host genetic variation of viruses as a key element in virus adaptability and, therefore, in virus disease emergence.
