<p>What are the molecular mechanisms underlying fitness changes in viral populations? Many studies with human, animal and plant viruses suggest that fitness variations are associated with genetic change, mediated by mutation, recombination and genome segment reassortment during viral replication (Fig. 1). Mutation is a universal mechanism of genetic variation that affects all viruses, while recombination appears to vary greatly in frequency among different viruses. Segment reassortment is obviously restricted to viruses with segmented genomes. It must be emphasized that fitness values, as well as the fitness effects of genetic variation, are dependent on the sequence context of a viral genome and on the physical and biological environments in which the virus replication capacity is tested. Next I discuss how genetic change underlies fitness variations and how such variations unpredictably affect the adaptation of viruses to new environments.</p>
