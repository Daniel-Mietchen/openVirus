<p>The number of infectious particles shed by each infected individual is critical not only because the amount of virus that is shed affects the probability of encountering a susceptible host, but also because the larger the number of infectious particles the broader the spectrum of mutants that will reach the recipient host individuals (Fig. 2). Viral population numbers can be largely amplified in immunocompromised individuals, that have been termed “super-shedders” or “super-spreaders”, and constitute large reservoirs of variant viruses [
