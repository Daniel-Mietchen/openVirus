<p>Despite difficulties of implementation, it would be important to survey those viruses that have manifested a potential for emergence in the human population (human and animal influenza viruses, animal coronaviruses, primate lentiviruses, animal picornaviruses, etc.) not only by sampling consensus sequences but also by ultra deep sequencing. However, for obvious reasons covered in this and other articles of this special issue, it is not possible to anticipate which viruses from the multiple animal reservoirs are going to emerge as new human pathogens and when. Survey of the circulating zoonotic viruses, with effective communications networks, the development of new vaccines and antiviral agents, and an increasing understanding of viral population dynamics all should contribute to either delaying viral emergences or reducing their impact once they occur.</p>
