 <p>
  <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is one of the most invasive and aggressive disease vectors in the world. The range of this species is currently still expanding, particularly into highly dense human population centers in temperate areas in the USA and Europe, raising the public health threat of emerging and re-emerging diseases such as chikungunya and dengue. The prominence of 
  <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> as a major vector was exposed during the global pandemic of chikungunya virus, primarily because of a virus adaptation which enhanced the transmission efficiency by this mosquito species and also because of the first locally-transmitted cases of chikungunya virus in temperate Europe. Blood feeding patterns by mosquitoes are a critical component of virus proliferation and determine the degree and intensity of disease epidemics, particularly in newly invaded areas. We examined the blood meal sources of invasive 
  <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in the northernmost boundary of their range in temperate North America and found that the species fed exclusively on mammalian hosts, with over 90% of their blood meals derived from humans and their associated pets (cats and dogs). The high mammalian affinity of 
  <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> suggests that this species may be an efficient vector of mammal-driven zoonoses and human-driven anthroponoses such as dengue and chikungunya viruses in this region.
