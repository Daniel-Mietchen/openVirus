<p>Human- and cat-derived blood meals in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were detected every month of our studies, while dog-derived blood meals were absent during May (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003037-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Only 2.08% of all human-derived blood meals were detected in May, while the vast majority was detected during the month of August (38.54%). Four contiguous months (July, August, September, and October) accounted for over 87% of all blood meal collections (
