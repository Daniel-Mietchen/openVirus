 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> fed exclusively on mammalian hosts in Mercer and Monmouth Counties, with over 84% of all identified blood meals stemming from humans (52.12%), cats (20.61%), or dogs (11.52%) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003037-t002">Table 2</xref>). Blood meals were also detected from opossums (4.24%), gray squirrels (3.64%), cottontail rabbits (1.21%), and a white-footed mouse (0.61%). A small percentage (6.06%) of double blood meals (from two different host species) were detected in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (4.65% of total in Mercer and 7.60% of total in Monmouth), and all included human blood (human+dog, n = 5; human+cat, n = 4; human+deer, n = 1). The number of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> feeding on humans was significantly higher in suburban Monmouth (62%) than in urban Mercer (43%) County locations (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 8.151; df = 1; p = 0.004), but significantly more 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> fed on cats in Mercer than in Monmouth County (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 5.256; df = 1; p = 0.022). No significant difference was observed in the number of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> feeding on dogs between the two counties. No avian-derived blood meals were detected in any of the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> specimens tested.
