<p>Our BGS trap surveillance during the active mosquito seasons of 2008–2011 collected 73,828 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> females in Mercer and Monmouth Counties (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003037.s001">Table S1</xref>). A total of 33,392 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were collected in Mercer County, 187 (0.56%) of which were visually determined to contain blood (blood fed or black blooded, hereafter “blooded”); while 40,436 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were collected in Monmouth County, with 219 (0.54%) containing blood. In Mercer County, the number and proportion of blooded 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> collected during each month was as follows: May (n = 1, 1.25% of monthly total), June (13, 0.82%), July (23, 0.42%), August (70, 0.57%), September (61, 0.57%), and October (19, 0.60%). Blooded 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in Monmouth County were collected during May (n = 4, 1.24% of monthly total), June (25, 1.11%), July (65, 0.99%), August (72, 0.45%), September (37, 0.33%), and October (16 (0.56%). We also captured 14,989 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes (
 <italic>Cx. p. pipiens</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx. restuans</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cx.</italic> spp.) from both counties (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003037.s002">Table S2</xref>). The BGS trap is highly specific for capturing host seeking 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> females, as apparent by the nearly 74,000 specimens of this species that were captured versus the 15,000 specimens of 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003037.s002">S2</xref>). Interestingly, BGS traps were also capable of capturing blooded 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes, as evidenced by the collection of over 406 blooded 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and 745 blooded 
 <italic>Culex</italic> (
