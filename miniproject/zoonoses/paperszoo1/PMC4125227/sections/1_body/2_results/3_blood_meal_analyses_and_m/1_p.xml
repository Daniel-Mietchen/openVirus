<p>We collected 745 blooded 
 <italic>Culex</italic> (349 
 <italic>Cx. p. pipiens</italic>, 181 
 <italic>Cx. restuans</italic>, 215 
 <italic>Cx.</italic> spp.) mosquitoes during 2008–2011, and tested a subsample of 198 individuals identified as 
 <italic>Cx. p. pipiens</italic> or 
 <italic>Cx. restuans</italic> for blood meal source determination (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003037-t003">Table 3</xref>). We selected 198 specimens to approximate the number of blood meals identified from 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and chose specimens from the same dates and traps as feasible. We were able to identify the blood meal source of 159 (80.30%) samples. Blooded 
 <italic>Cx. p. pipiens</italic> were collected during April (n = 1, 0.79%), May (19, 15.08%), June (37, 29.37%), July (26 (20.63%), August (19, 15.08%), September (21, 16.67%), and October (3, 2.38%). Blooded 
 <italic>Cx. restuans</italic> were collected during May (n = 10, 30.30%), June (12, 36.36%), July (6, 18.18%), August (2, 6.06%), September (2, 6.06%), and October (1, 3.03%). In Mercer County, specimens were tested from 2009–2011 and resulted in successful host determination from 61 
 <italic>Cx. p. pipiens</italic> (n = 74, 82.43%) and 7 
 <italic>Cx. restuans</italic> (n = 7, 100%). In Monmouth County, the blood meal hosts of 65 
 <italic>Cx. p. pipiens</italic> (n = 80, 81.25%) and 26 
 <italic>Cx. restuans</italic> (n = 37, 70.27%) were determined from 2008 and 2011 (
