<p>Abdomens of blooded 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were dissected over a chill table and then extracted using a Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen Sciences, Germantown, MD, USA). Specimens with very small blood remnants or those deemed poorly preserved (desiccated), were not utilized for DNA extraction because those samples rarely yield useful data 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Egizi1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. To avoid contamination, forceps were flamed between extractions. To save time and reagents, we used a strategy that allows rapid identification of human-derived blood meals and mixes between human and non-human mammals 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Egizi1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. This technique identifies human-derived blood meals based on the size of the PCR product on a gel without the need for extensive sequencing, thus drastically reducing costs. A mix between human and non-human blood is detected as two bands, and only the non-human band must be excised from the gel and purified with a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) prior to sequencing 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Egizi1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Samples that did not amplify with the above assay were also tested with previously established primers designed for birds 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Cicero1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, reptiles/amphibians 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Cupp1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, and an additional primer set for mammals 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Ngo1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Approximately half of the specimens were tested with all bloodmeal identification methods above to legitimize the use of the rapid-assay 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Egizi1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. To test for contamination, negative controls were employed in all reactions. The negative controls consisted of the PCR master mix with sterile water. Except for the short human-only band obtained with the Egizi et al. assay 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Egizi1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, and when the non-human band was excised from the agarose gel (see above), all PCR products were cleaned with Exo-Sap-IT (USB Products, Cleveland, OH, USA), cycle-sequenced with the forward primer of each pair, and run on capillary automated sequencers. Sequences were BLASTed in GenBank (

Only matches of &gt;98% similarity were identified as the source of the blood meal
