<p>Mosquitoes were sampled on a weekly basis during 2008–2011 using a network of Biogents Sentinel (BGS) traps (Biogents AG, Regensburg, Germany). Specific details of surveillance protocols are outlined elsewhere

 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Crepeau2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>; but briefly, trap locations were chosen by overlaying a grid of specific distance intervals. We used a 175–200 m distance between BGS traps for each site in Mercer County and 200–400 m distances in Monmouth County because of the larger site areas and limiting number of traps in inventory. These distances were based on current knowledge of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> flight range 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-EstradaFranco1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and the available resources within each county. A total of 36 to 51 BGS traps, depending on the year, were deployed weekly in Mercer County, while 55 to 57 traps were deployed in Monmouth County. Each BGS trap was placed in residential backyards (near vegetation or shade) of each parcel selected, and was operated for 24 hours prior to collection. Each week, traps were placed in the same location within the backyards. The BGS trap was used with a solid BG-lure (Biogents AG, Regensburg, Germany) containing ammonia, lactic acid and fatty acids, components known to be attractive to

 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Farajollahi2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Although the BGS trap was designed to capture host seeking (unfed) 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> (
 <italic>Stegomyia</italic>) mosquitoes 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Kroeckel1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, the trap also captures other species such as 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes

 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Unlu2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> in addition to occasionally collecting female mosquitoes in varying gonotrophic stages (unengorged, blood fed, black blooded, and gravid). An unengorged or unfed mosquito does not contain visible evidence of blood in the abdomen, while a blood fed mosquito displays a distended abdomen with reddish blood clearly visible. A black blooded specimen has digested most of the blood meal and retains only a small portion of dark red or black blood visible near the ventral anterior of the abdomen, corresponding with Sella stage VI 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Detinova1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Gravid specimens have completely digested blood meals and contain visible eggs ready for oviposition.
