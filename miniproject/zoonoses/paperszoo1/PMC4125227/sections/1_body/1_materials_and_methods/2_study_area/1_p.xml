<p>All collections were conducted within two counties (Mercer and Monmouth) located in central New Jersey, USA. Mercer County (40°13′N, 74°44′W) is highly urban, with 364,883 residents 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-US1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> and a population density of 630.2 inhabitants per square kilometer. Mercer County and the low-income City of Trenton, where the studies were conducted, have a population density of 4,286.5/km
 <sup>2</sup> (USCB 2009a). The City of Trenton contains typical dense inner city housing, often built as adjoining row homes or duplexes 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Farajollahi3" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Monmouth County (40°44′N, 74°17′W) is defined as primarily suburban and is located in east-central New Jersey with a population of 630,380 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-US2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. The boroughs on the Raritan Bayshore, within Monmouth County, where the studies were conducted, have an average population of 1,907.4/km
 <sup>2</sup>
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-US2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. The Raritan Bayshore primarily contains middle income coastal suburban homes which are often interspersed with forest and green space remnants 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Unlu2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Within each county, three predefined ∼1,000-parcel sites (a parcel is a combination of a house and its associated yard space), ranging in area from 1 km
 <sup>2</sup> (Mercer) to 2 km
 <sup>2</sup> (Monmouth) were chosen for our investigations. Although individual parcel sizes within the study sites in Mercer County were smaller (199.5±18.3 m
 <sup>2</sup>) than those in Monmouth County (571.1±31.2 m
 <sup>2</sup>), the number of residents within Mercer sites (19,494) were larger than within Monmouth sites (12,743). Every site, within each county, was previously selected to contain similar socioeconomic parameters, geography, human population density, and mosquito abundance.
