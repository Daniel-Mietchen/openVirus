<p>A large number of blooded 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes, consisting primarily of 
 <italic>Culex pipiens pipiens</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Culex restuans</italic> Theobald, were also collected by the BGS traps. Because of the difficulty in accurate morphological identification of field-collected specimens due to age or damage 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Farajollahi4" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref> these specimens are often pooled as 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. After using a molecular assay to identify all 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes to species 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Crabtree1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, we tested blood fed 
 <italic>Culex</italic> specimens from both counties collected in the same traps, locations, and dates as 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. 
 <italic>Culex p. pipiens</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. restuans</italic> were the only 
 <italic>Culex</italic> species collected in the BGS traps, and were assayed from Mercer County during 2009–2011 and from Monmouth County during 2008 and 2011. Blooded 
 <italic>Culex</italic> specimens were extracted as described above for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, amplified with the BM primer pair 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Kocher1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, then cleaned, sequenced, and identified as above. The BM primer pair targets a wide range of species, including mammals, birds, and reptiles, but it inadvertently amplifies in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Egizi1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> and therefore cannot be used to identify blood meals in that species.
