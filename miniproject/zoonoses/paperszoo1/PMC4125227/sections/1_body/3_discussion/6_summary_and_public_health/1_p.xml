<p>Recent decades have witnessed a dramatic global expansion of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> into temperate areas and an increase in locally acquired autochthonous cases of tropical diseases such as DENV and CHIKV

 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Lambrechts1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Gould1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. Because of the increasing abundance of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and the escalating diagnoses of exotic pathogens in travelers returning from endemic or epidemic areas 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Gibney1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, the risk of a tropical disease outbreak in a new area is no longer speculative. We have shown that in urban and suburban areas of temperate northeastern USA, invasive populations of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> fed exclusively on mammalian hosts and that a large proportion (50â€“60%) fed on human hosts. Although we did not detect any avian-derived blood meals from 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> during our investigations, the species has been traditionally classified as an opportunistic feeder whose host preference is greatly dependent on the abundance of available local hosts

 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-EstradaFranco1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Our studies indicate that 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> may play a greater role in anthroponoses disease cycles, such as DENV and CHIKV, and a lesser role in zoonoses involving an avian animal reservoir. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> may occasionally act as a bridge vector for endemic pathogens such as St. Louis encephalitis virus and WNV by feeding on infected hosts when their abundance is great. Nonetheless, the large and growing populations of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in major metropolitan urban and suburban centers, make a large autochthonous outbreak of an arbovirus such as CHIKV or DENV a clear and present danger. This may be particularly imminent in the case of CHIKV, as the virus is explosively spreading in the Caribbean region of the western hemisphere for the first time 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Enserink2" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Given the difficulty in successful suppression of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in areas where it has become firmly established 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Rochlin1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Fonseca1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, we strongly recommend further ecological investigations on this species and caution public health practitioners and policy makers to install proactive measures for the imminent mitigation of an exotic pathogen outbreak.
