<p>Large proportions of human-derived blood meals have been documented previously in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and a few studies have reported that field populations feed exclusively on humans (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003037-t001">Table 1</xref>), but the use of aspirators and human bait may bias these estimates. Additionally, recent investigations in temperate Italy have shown that 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> feeding patterns differ between urban and rural habitats, with 90% of blood meals in urban areas from humans and only 20% being human-derived in rural habitats 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Valerio1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Our results report a significantly higher proportion of human blood meals in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> from suburban areas, rather than the densely populated urban areas. This was surprising, because of the higher (&gt;2 times) human population density in urban Mercer County. However, suburban dwellers often spend more time outdoors gardening or undertaking leisure activities in backyards during daylight hours which will increase exposure. In addition, proportions of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> feeding on cats and dogs was higher in urban than suburban sites, likely reflecting large populations of feral cats in urban low income areas 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Gehrt1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref> and the fact that often dogs are kept in outside cages or yards for homeowner protection 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Unlu1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In contrast, suburban residents primarily keep their pets indoors and availability of these hosts for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> may be reduced. The significantly greater anthropophagic behavior of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in more affluent suburban versus low-income urban habitats of northeastern USAindicates that a larger public health concern may exist within suburban landscapes, despite lower human population densities. Higher proportions of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> feeding on cats and dogs within urban environs may help fuel local mosquito populations but it may also afford zooprophylaxis protection for humans during epidemic outbreaks of anthroponoses such as DENV or CHIKV, because it will divert vector feeding to non-susceptible dead-end hosts.
