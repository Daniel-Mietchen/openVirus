<p>Another concern regarding the vectorial capacity of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> stems from detection of multiple blood meals from field populations. Previous studies have documented vertebrate blood from more than one host in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> throughout its endemic and invasive range (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003037-t001">Table 1</xref>). Our studies detected double blood meals in 6% of the field-collected 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> specimens, consistent with the 6% to 10% double blood meal proportion rates reported by others

 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Ponlawat1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Richards1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Sawabe1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Valerio1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The capacity for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> to acquire multiple blood meals, particularly from human and other host species, increases the vector potential of this mosquito because of greater exposure to infected hosts during multiple feedings.
