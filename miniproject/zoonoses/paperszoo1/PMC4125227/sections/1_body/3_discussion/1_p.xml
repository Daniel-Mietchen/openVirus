<p>Our investigations provide insight into the host associations of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in the northernmost boundary of their established populations in eastern USA. Currently, about one-third of the human population of 55 million in this region reside in urban areas where 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is pervasive. This number is predicted to double under forthcoming climate change scenarios, encompassing all major urban centers and placing over 30 million people under the threat of dense 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> infestations and potential public health threats from associated emerging mosquito-borne diseases 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Rochlin1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Our analyses on the blood feeding behavior of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> demonstrate that this species is primarily mammalophagic in peridomestic environments of northeastern USA, and in some locations over 60% of their blood meals are derived from humans.
