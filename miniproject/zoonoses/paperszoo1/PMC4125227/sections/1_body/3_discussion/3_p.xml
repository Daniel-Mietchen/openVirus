<p>Our investigations are consistent with previous studies that have shown a high mammalian affinity by invasive 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in temperate areas of USA and Europe

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> samples despite extensive testing with avian-specific primers. Our findings cannot be attributed to the method of collection, blood meal identification methodology, host availability, or spatial/temporal factors, since the 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes collected in the same traps at the same time, were found to feed predominately on birds within our study sites as expected

 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Molaei2" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. The lack of blood meals obtained from birds by 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> suggest that this species may have limited exposure to endemic avian arboviruses, such as West Nile virus (WNV), which is supported by the lack of WNV isolations in over 34,500 specimens assayed in a complementary study 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Armstrong1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. However, the high mammalian affinity of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> suggests that this species may be an efficient vector of mammal-driven zoonoses such as La Crosse virus, and human-driven anthroponoses such as DENV and CHIKV.
