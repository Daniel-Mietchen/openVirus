<p>Understanding the blood feeding patterns of mosquitoes is of paramount importance in determining their vector status in the maintenance and epidemic transmission of arboviruses. Blood feeding patterns of mosquito vectors provide insight into the ecological transmission cycles of pathogens and lead to more efficient disease and vector control measures for the benefit of animal and human health. For invasive mosquitoes with expanding geographic ranges, such as 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> (Skuse), the specific blood-hosts impact endemic diseases and can lead to the epidemic transmission of exotic pathogens.
