<p>Although historically not an important vector of CHIKV, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> has become the principal driver of recent epidemics in Asia and islands in the Indian Ocean because of a mutation in the virus envelope protein enhanced transmission efficiency by this species

 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-deLamballerie1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Autochthonous transmission of CHIKV has also been recorded in temperate regions of Italy and France 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Grandadam1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Rezza1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> where invasive 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> have become abundant 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Schaffner1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> was also the sole vector in local epidemics of dengue in Hawai'i and other regions

 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Lambrechts1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and is a competent laboratory vector for at least 22 arboviruses 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Gratz1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Due to the widespread and increasing distribution of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in temperate regions and the escalating diagnoses of exotic pathogens in travelers returning from endemic or epidemic areas 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Beltrame1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Gibney1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, the risk of an outbreak in a new area is no longer hypothetical. Furthermore, because this species thrives in artificial containers found in close association with human peridomestic environments, it is essential to fully investigate the host feeding patterns of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in order to completely understand its role in disease ecology and public health significance.
