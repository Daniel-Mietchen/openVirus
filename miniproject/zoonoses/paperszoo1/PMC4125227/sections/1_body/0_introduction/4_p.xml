<p>Surprisingly, given the vector potential and medical importance of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, few studies have been conducted to investigate the host feeding patterns of this species in its native and expanding geographic range. This is likely because adult 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> are a difficult species to collect efficiently in traps, and blood fed specimens are especially rare. From the few studies that have been conducted, the precise host feeding preferences of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> seem to vary considerably (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003037-t001">Table 1</xref>). The species has been generally reported to feed on a wide range of mammals including humans, but will also feed on avian hosts at various proportions, and has even been incriminated to feed on amphibians and reptiles

 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Tuten1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. It has thus been considered an opportunistic feeder and a classic bridge vector candidate between zoonotic arboviruses and humans. However, caution should be taken in labeling 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> as an efficient bridge vector because the large variation in the feeding plasticity of this species questions the exact role that it may play as an enzootic or epidemic vector of arboviruses. For example, in its native tropical range, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> feeds exclusively on humans in Indonesia 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Jumali1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, whereas in Singapore it feeds on humans, oxen, and dogs 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Colless1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Additionally, studies conducted in Thailand 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Sullivan1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> have reported that 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> feed on humans, swine, buffalo, dogs, and chickens, while more recent investigations 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Ponlawat1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> report that 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> feeds only on humans, with a few (&lt;6%) double-host blood meals between humans and swine/cat/dog. In temperate Japan, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> primarily feed on mammals, with a high propensity for humans, but also on birds and amphibians/reptiles
