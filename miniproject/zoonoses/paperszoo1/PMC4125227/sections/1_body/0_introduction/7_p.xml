<p>We investigated the host feeding patterns of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in temperate North America, near the northernmost boundary of established populations in the eastern United States

 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Rochlin1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. We used an extensive network of BGS traps, which enhance 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> capture counts, to conduct a multi-year collection of blooded mosquitoes (2008â€“2011) in urban and suburban sites as part of a larger area-wide project aimed at managing the Asian tiger mosquito

 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Fonseca1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Additionally, we assayed blood meals from 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes collected in the same traps, locations, and dates as 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> to determine the diversity of different blood meal sources obtained from the two vectors. We discuss the implications of our results on established and expanding populations of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and the imminent outbreaks of exotic diseases such as chikungunya or dengue fevers in North America.
