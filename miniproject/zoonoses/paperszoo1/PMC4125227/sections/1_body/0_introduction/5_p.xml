<p>In temperate locations of the expanding range of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, the host preference of this species is also variable. Studies conducted at a tire dump in Missouri, USA, reported that 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> will feed on birds (17%) but prefer mammals (64%), with 8.2% of those mammalian feedings obtained from humans 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Savage1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. A follow up study conducted in other tire yards and surrounding vegetation of rural and urban habitats in Missouri, Florida, Indiana, Illinois, and Louisiana, USA, concluded that 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> showed a strong preference for mammals (&gt;94%), with up to 8% human-derived blood meals, while also detecting avian (1%) and reptilian (5%) blood meals

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> feeds predominately on mammalian hosts (83%), but also on birds (7%), amphibians (2%), and reptiles (2%) 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003037-Richards1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In Europe, Italian populations of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> rarely feed on birds in urban settings, while 99% of specimens have been reported to feed on mammals, with 90% of those mammalian blood meals being derived from humans

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> had fed on avian species, while the vast majority of the blood meals were mammalian-derived (95%), with 43% containing human blood
