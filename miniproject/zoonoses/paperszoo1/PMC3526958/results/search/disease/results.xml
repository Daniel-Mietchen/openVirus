 <result pre="LANDSCAPE LEVEL EFFECTS ON RABIES DYNAMICS Since the transmission of" exact="rabies" post="is entirely dependent on host movements initiating contact between"/>

 <result pre="(1) host movements: natural versus human-mediated; (2) landscape attributes influencing" exact="rabies" post="spread; and (3) population level effects. The role of"/>
 <result pre="animals has repeatedly led to the emergence and spread of" exact="rabies" post="in susceptible populations, either through deliberate translocation (e.g. the"/>
