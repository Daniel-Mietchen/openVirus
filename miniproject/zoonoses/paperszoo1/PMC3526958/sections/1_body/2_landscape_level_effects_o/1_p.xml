<p>Since the transmission of rabies is entirely dependent on host movements initiating contact between infectious and susceptible individuals, the landscape that they occupy and disperse within heavily influences the ability of the virus to infect new hosts. Indeed, wildlife rabies epidemics tend to spread as irregular waves that differ in velocity according to heterogeneities in the landscape (Russell 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">2006</xref>). These ‘heterogeneities’ include natural features such as mountain ranges, water bodies and deserts, but also anthropogenic features including roads and vaccine corridors. The influence of spatial heterogeneity on rabies spread can be broken down into three aspects, each of which are discussed in detail in the following sections: (1) host movements: natural versus human-mediated; (2) landscape attributes influencing rabies spread; and (3) population level effects.
