 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref77">2010</xref>) used spatial simulations to show that the observed patterns of spread in North Africa could only be explained by the inclusion of long-distance translocation events as opposed to natural dog movements alone. The wave-like patterns that are a signature of wildlife rabies and determined by natural host movements are less evident in domestic dog rabies, and it is unknown to what extent natural dog movements vs. human-mediated movements determine the observed phylogeographic patterns. A recent study in a Kenyan rangeland found that healthy domestic dogs rarely moved more than 50 metres from their home bases, and the maximum distance recorded was 3·2 km (Woodroffe and Donnelly, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref85">2011</xref>). In contrast, dispersal distances in wildlife hosts tend to be at least an order of magnitude higher (Cullingham 
 <italic>et al.</italic>

However, rabies infection leads to behavioural changes, which may alter movement patterns; in northern Tanzania, most contacts with rabid dogs occurred within a kilometre of an animal's homestead (mean ∼0·88 km), but a small proportion of rabid dogs ran over 15 km while infectious (Hampson 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">2009</xref>). Dog movements also vary depending on the societal context and livelihoods of the communities to which they belong (Woodroffe and Donnelly, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref85">2011</xref>). For their dispersal simulations, Talbi 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref77">2010</xref>) used measures of natural dog movements based on a specific locality in Tanzania (Hampson 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">2009</xref>) but it remains unclear whether such data are transferrable among different geographic localities. Research on domestic dog ecology and movement is lacking and detailed, location-specific data are required in order to reliably test hypotheses for alternative drivers of viral diffusion.
