<p>As a parasite transmitted through direct host-to-host contact, spatially-defined genetic discontinuities in RABV populations may indicate a barrier to host contact (Biek and Real, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">2010</xref>). We consider a ‘dispersal barrier’ to be any spatial feature of the landscape that impedes the gene flow of a pathogen. Spatially explicit models incorporating landscape features can help uncover barriers to gene flow based on slower progression than expected over a homogeneous area. However, the interpretation of genetic discontinuities requires caution as phylogeographic patterns may arise as a result of historical colonisation events and irrespective of physical barriers (Real and Biek,
