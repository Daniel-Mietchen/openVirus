<p>Political borders are another potential form of barrier that may play a role in the containment of dog rabies, but have no evident impact on wildlife rabies dispersal. For example, distinct and almost monophyletic RABV groups associated with North African countries indicate restricted movement across geopolitical boundaries (Talbi 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref77">2010</xref>). This well-defined population structure at a regional scale contrasts with a relatively fluid dissemination within countries. On the one hand, this suggests that country level vaccination programmes should have a good chance of eliminating dog rabies even in contiguous landscapes. However, these findings are not generalisable, with epidemiological analyses of RABV in Ghana highlighting frequent cross-border incursions (Hayman 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">2011</xref>). In addition, time-series analyses indicate large-scale synchronous dynamics of rabies across multiple countries in eastern and southern Africa, possibly due to a combination of human or wildlife-mediated long-distance dispersal and a lack of sustained control programmes (Hampson 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">2007</xref>). Understanding the circumstances whereby political boundaries act as dispersal barriers should provide guidance for whether control programmes require regional co-operation or can be sustained at a national level with appropriate border controls. As a first step, it would be useful to compare phylogeographic structure of dog RABV among different parts of the world and across hierarchical spatial scales. Objective measures for such a comparison can be obtained by quantifying the degree to which sequences cluster on a phylogeny according to their geographic location. Several statistics are available for this (Parker 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">2008</xref>), of which the association index (AI) (Wang 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref80">2001</xref>) has been found to be of particular utility. This measure of phylogeny-trait correlation may provide an initial descriptive analysis of consistency or variability in the hierarchical genetic structure of dog rabies between continents or countries that could determine the generalisation of results across different systems. For example, we might hypothesise that regions with large population densities and a high level of transport infrastructure, e.g. parts of Asia, show less distinctive phylogeographic patterns (a low AI value) compared to more sparsely populated and less developed landscapes like those in sub-Saharan Africa (high AI value).
