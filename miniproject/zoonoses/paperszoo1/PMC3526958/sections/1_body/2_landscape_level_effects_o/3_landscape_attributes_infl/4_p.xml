<p>Quantifying barrier effects, to predict the likelihood of incursions or to exploit them for control programmes, is an important area yet to be tackled for dog rabies. The impact of anthropogenic landscape features on spread, at least in a qualitative sense, has been noted in several countries. For example, Tenzin 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref78">2010</xref>) mapped the spread of rabies in Bhutan showing a strong visual pattern alongside road networks and towns with high dog-to-human ratios; and phylogeographic patterns in north Mexico and Thailand match the distribution of major migration routes (de Mattos 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">1999</xref>; Denduangboripant 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">2005</xref>). It can be hypothesised that features important to wildlife rabies become less significant to dog rabies as anthropogenic features take over the landscape and mediate the effect of barriers, i.e. bridges, roads and transportation make it possible for dogs to circumvent natural barriers and support a relatively fluid dissemination of rabies across naturally heterogeneous landscapes. These hypotheses remain largely untested and thus present a fruitful area for landscape genetics investigations.
