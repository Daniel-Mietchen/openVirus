<p>Smith 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71">2002</xref>) demonstrated a seven-fold reduction in rates of raccoon rabies spread in North America due to the presence of rivers and forest cover. Similarly, the Vistula River separated distinct clusters of a red fox variant and raccoon dog/fox variant in Europe (Bourhy 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">1999</xref>). Clearly, large water bodies impede host movement, but have differential success as barriers according to additional factors such as habitat suitability (Smith 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref72">2005</xref>; Cullingham

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">2009</xref>), physical geography (Rees

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">2009</xref>), and width and flow rates (Bourhy 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">1999</xref>). In an attempt to assess the differential permeability of barriers, Rees 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">2008</xref>) used genetic simulation modelling to assess the effect of the Niagara River on rabies spread from New York State to Ontario. Comparing genetic population structure derived from field data, with simulated population expansion scenarios they ascertained a 50% barrier effect. In contrast, homogeneous landscapes that lack environmental barriers are particularly vulnerable to the rapid expansion of an introduced pathogen, as demonstrated by the increased speed with which raccoon rabies is predicted to cross central Ohio, which lacks major natural barriers, compared to neighbouring states (Russell 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref68">2005</xref>). With the exception of major landscape features inferred as barriers to dog rabies on a global scale (Bourhy 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">2008</xref>), we know relatively little about barrier effects at smaller scales. Determining whether natural barriers prevent the dissemination of dog RABV or if ties to human ecology negate their effect is an important research question with significant implications for control.
