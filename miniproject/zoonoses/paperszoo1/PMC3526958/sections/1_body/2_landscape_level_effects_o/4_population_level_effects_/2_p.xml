<p>Local within-patch dynamics are potentially a key component contributing to the persistence and maintenance of disease at larger scales. Therefore, it is important to quantify the relative contribution of different patches to overall disease persistence in a system. This might involve characterizing patches based on dog density, turnover and growth rates, levels of ownership and vaccination, alongside measures of connectivity. For example, dog turnover rates can be extremely high e.g. the Machakos region in Kenya has a dog population estimated to grow by 9% per annum, making rabies control difficult in this area (Kitala
