<p>Host movement rates and connectivity between sub-populations are crucial predictors of disease invasion (Cross

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">2011</xref>). Epidemiological data available at a localised scale, e.g. the incidence of dog bites, can provide a simple spatio-temporal measure for metapopulation analysis, as shown by Beyer 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">2011</xref>). Patch-occupancy models identified two metrics of connectivity, the distance between neighbouring villages and the size of villages receiving infection, as significant factors facilitating the transmission of disease. From a population genetics perspective, coalescent analysis of sequence data could provide the means to identify metapopulation dynamics that may not be discernable using epidemiological data alone. Such techniques have been successfully applied, for example, to understand the persistence of influenza A virus, with molecular clock-based estimates of divergence times of 
 <italic>most recent common ancestors</italic> (MRCA) and demonstrating persistence due to dynamic migration patterns rather than source-sink dynamics (Russell 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
