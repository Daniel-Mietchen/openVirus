<p>Elucidating how heterogeneity at the host level contributes to dynamics at the patch level is an important aspect of understanding the mechanisms underlying rabies persistence and spread. Differential within-patch dynamics resulting from individual heterogeneity including variation in biting frequency, host population size, the structure of a settlement, may confer properties that promote the effectiveness of a patch as a source of infection. Tracing transmission pathways may provide a further means of elucidating source populations that initiate chains of infection, particularly at very fine-scale resolution. Lembo

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab01">Table 1</xref>) used parsimonious transmission networks to infer reservoir host dynamics and patterns of interspecific transmission, but this technique could also be used more generally to uncover dispersal patterns, e.g. if a particular patch repeatedly acts as a source of infection. The construction of transmission trees from epidemiological data on the timing and locality of rabies cases is another useful approach for identifying transmission pathways and can be supplemented by contact tracing data (Lembo 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">2008</xref>). Contact tracing of rabies is aided by the memorable nature of rabies bites and therefore presents a unique situation where the collection of contact data is achievable. However, building transmission trees in this way becomes increasingly unreliable as larger numbers of missing links are inferred, and these models may also simplistically predict unlikely transmission events if knowledge of the landscape is not incorporated into algorithms e.g. predictions of transmission across major landscape barriers. Genetic data could be used to quantify mutation rates and build independent time-scaled transmission networks against which epidemiologically constructed transmission trees could be calibrated. Ultimately, transmission trees will be most effectively constructed with the combined use of genetic and epidemiological data, and appropriate datasets are increasingly becoming available for rabies, but further computational and statistical advances are required.
