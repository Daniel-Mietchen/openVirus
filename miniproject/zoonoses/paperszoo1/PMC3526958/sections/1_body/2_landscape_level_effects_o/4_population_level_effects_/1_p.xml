<p>Infectious disease dynamics are often described in terms of a 
 <italic>metapopulation</italic>, with host populations divided into smaller, spatially structured sub-populations that exist with different inter- and intra-patch dynamics (Grenfell and Harwood, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">1997</xref>). Heterogeneities in the spatial configuration of host populations are critical to understanding the persistence of endemic pathogens (Hagenaars 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">2004</xref>) and incorporating this social/spatial structure is particularly important for developing mechanistic models of acute-acting infections like rabies (Cross 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">2005</xref>). In the case of dog rabies, human settlements (village/town/city) can be considered habitat patches that vary in host density and connectivity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). For example, rural areas typically exist as an array of villages connected to larger towns and cities by major roads. Fragmentation and low connectivity, i.e. long distances between settlements, natural barriers and lack of transportation networks, likely restrict the ability of a dog to move across a landscape and hence limit rabies spread. Hypothetically, limited contact between dog populations and correspondingly strong spatial structure of rabies would be expected in the least developed regions where travel is most limited.
