<p>A potentially useful tool for quantifying how rabies dynamics differ among local patches is the 
 <italic>basic reproductive number</italic>, R
 <sub>0</sub>. Theory would suggest that for directly transmitted diseases such as rabies, R
 <sub>0</sub> should increase with host density. However, empirical evidence for density-dependent dynamics is equivocal, with no detectable differences in R
 <sub>0</sub> among dog populations with varying densities around the world (Hampson 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">2009</xref>). While it is unclear why R
 <sub>0</sub> is so insensitive to differences in dog density, e.g. Mexico (∼100 dogs/km
 <sup>2</sup> (Eng 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">1993</xref>)) versus rural Africa (∼10 dogs/km
 <sup>2</sup> (Lembo 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">2008</xref>)), this finding is more consistent with a frequency-dependent mode of rabies transmission. For both density- and frequency-dependent disease dynamics stochastic extinctions are expected once density drops below a certain level, meaning that low-density patches may act as barriers to spread. Indeed, rabies has been observed to spread but appears less able to persist in low density dog populations, e.g. Ngorongoro in Tanzania (average of 4·2 dogs/km
 <sup>2</sup> (Lembo 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">2008</xref>)), suggesting that neighbouring source populations are required for rabies maintenance. Cross 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">2007</xref>) discuss the incorporation of heterogeneities in population structure by expanding on the utility of R
 <sub>0</sub> as a measure of disease transmission. R
 <sub>0</sub> assumes that the population is evenly mixed, but the hierarchical nature of disease invasion requires stochastic models that incorporate both within-patch transmission (R
 <sub>0</sub>) and the factors contributing to persistence, i.e. between patch transmission – namely the recruitment of susceptibles, group size and the infectious period. These questions of potential metapopulation structure, patch variability and source-sink dynamics (Pulliam, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">1988</xref>) represent a particularly pertinent and rich area for future studies of RABV which has yet to be explored using genetic approaches and are vital to inform efficient control strategies.
