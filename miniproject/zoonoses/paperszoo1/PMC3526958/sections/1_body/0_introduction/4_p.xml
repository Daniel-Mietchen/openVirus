<p>In this review, we focus on rabies virus (RABV), which presents an excellent model system to illustrate the challenges and prospects of such an approach. RABV is a single stranded, negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the 
 <italic>Lyssavirus</italic> genus (Family: Rhabdoviridae) (Dietzschold 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">2005</xref>). It is globally distributed and has the ability to infect all mammals, but typically exists in endemic foci as a reservoir host-specific variant with occasional spillover to other species (Rupprecht 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">2002</xref>). Domestic dogs, 
 <italic>Canis familiaris</italic>, are the principal reservoir of RABV, responsible for 99% of the estimated 55,000 human deaths due to rabies that occur mainly in Asia and Africa every year (Knobel 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">2005</xref>).
