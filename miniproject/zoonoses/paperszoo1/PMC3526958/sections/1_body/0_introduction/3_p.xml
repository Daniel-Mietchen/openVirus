<p>Modern sequence analysis has the power to reveal the historical emergence of pathogen variants, distribution patterns, spillover events, interspecies transmission and changing selection pressures (Archie

Advances in sequencing technologies have paved the way for a new generation of approaches to the study of disease dynamics, and next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques are being continually refined, improving their resolution, throughput potential, affordability and accessibility (Holmes and Grenfell, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">2009</xref>; Metzker, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">2010</xref>). We envision a paradigm shift to whole genome sequencing as the standard technique for characterizing RNA viral evolution on small spatio-temporal scales, providing greater discrimination between genotypes and finer resolution in population structure (Holmes and Grenfell, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">2009</xref>). Given the progress in sequencing technology and parallel advances in spatial analytical tools, it is an exciting time to study the landscape epidemiology of RNA viruses from a population genetic perspective.
