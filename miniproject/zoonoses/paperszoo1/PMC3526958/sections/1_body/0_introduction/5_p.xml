<p>Rabies has proven a remarkably valuable system for exploring the effect of landscape processes on host/pathogen interactions. However, most studies have focused on wildlife rabies due to the higher quality of surveillance data and availability of resources in areas with major endemic wildlife foci, e.g. raccoon rabies in eastern North America or fox rabies in Western Europe (Bourhy
