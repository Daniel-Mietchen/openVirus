<p>RNA viruses represent an ideal group for exploring landscape influences on evolutionary trajectories due to their characteristically high mutation rates and short generation times, which means that epidemiological and population genetic processes occur on a similar timescale (Drummond 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">2003</xref>). The accumulation of mutations over time and space imprints on the structure of viral genomes in a population and can be visualised in data collected over months or years, providing a valuable resource for the elucidation of ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Despite this, the processes that govern 
 <italic>phylogeographic</italic> patterns in viruses are still poorly understood (Holmes and Grenfell, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">2009</xref>), pointing to the need for more detailed study into the effect of spatial heterogeneity on viral transmission.
