   <p>Key research questions for dog rabies at the landscape scale</p>

     <p>
      <bold>To what degree do the demography and ecology of dogs, as compared to humans, determine the dynamics of rabies transmission?</bold>
     </p>
     <p>As dogs are inherently tied to humans, we might expect the patterns dictated by local dog movements to be confounded by human-mediated long-distance movements or anthropogenic features that facilitate connection of sub-populations.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
     <label>2.</label>
     <p>
      <bold>Which aspects of human geography best predict landscape permeability to dog rabies? Are these predictors consistent across different areas and continents?</bold>
     </p>
     <p>Although evidence suggests the influence of human geography on dog rabies dispersal, we have yet to uncover the best predictors of this form of spread. Specifically, a quantifiable method of characterizing these landscape features would assist with the creation of guidelines for using dispersal barriers to aid control.</p>

     <label>3.</label>
     <p>
      <bold>How does endemic rabies compare to epidemic spread?</bold>
     </p>
     <p>Most studies have focused on outbreak situations in wildlife, but it is not clear how rabies dynamics change in systems where the pathogen has been circulating for centuries, as is the case for dog rabies. How long is phylogeographic structure maintained over time and do initial invasion pathways predict connectivity in the endemic state?</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
     <label>4.</label>
     <p>
      <bold>Does dog rabies persist in metapopulations?</bold>
     </p>
     <p>Dog rabies may best be described as a series of sub-populations with varying inter- and intra-patch dynamics. Exploring the concept of a metapopulation dynamic for dog rabies presents a relatively unexplored area for future research and may uncover the mechanisms that allow pathogen persistence at a local scale.</p>

     <label>5.</label>
     <p>
      <bold>How can information about landscape heterogeneity and genetic structure be incorporated into more efficient control programmes?</bold>
     </p>
     <p>Information gathered from spatially explicit landscape models will allow targeted control measures using resources cost-effectively. Moreover, the implementation of vaccine barriers and other forms of control change the complexity of the landscape, potentially altering disease dynamics. Powerful genetic techniques may elucidate the effect of these new landscape heterogeneities, facilitating adaptive management.</p>
