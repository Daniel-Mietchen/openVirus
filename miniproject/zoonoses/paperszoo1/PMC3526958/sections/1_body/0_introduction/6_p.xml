<p>Domestic dogs are inherently tied to human populations, and various aspects of human ecology, including distribution, habitation and movement patterns, or cultural practices, will directly influence rabies spread in dog populations. Settlements can be considered dog ‘habitat’, and dog densities have been predicted on the basis of human demographics and human geography (Butler, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">2000</xref>; Knobel 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">2008</xref>). A seemingly ubiquitous feature of countries with persistent dog rabies foci is the free-roaming nature of these populations, often referred to as ‘neighbourhood’ dogs. Dogs in Africa, Asia and parts of Latin America, where canine rabies is endemic, are rarely restricted by leashing or enclosures and their role as domestic animals varies e.g. watch dogs, trade, companion animals. The free movement of dogs would thus be expected to contribute to local rabies transmission, potentially resembling the known features of wildlife rabies and illustrating the complex interplay between anthropogenic and natural drivers of disease spread in this system. A key challenge is to uncover the extent to which natural constraints to rabies flux hold in a host-pathogen system with greater human-mediated dispersal; and what affect this has on phylogeographic signatures.
