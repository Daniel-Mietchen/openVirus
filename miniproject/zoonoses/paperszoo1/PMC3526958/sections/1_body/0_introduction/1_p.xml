<p>Landscape epidemiology is the study of the causes and consequences of spatial variation in disease incidence or risk across heterogeneous landscapes (Ostfeld 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">2005</xref>). Landscape structure affects the distribution, abundance and movements of host, vector and pathogen populations and therefore inherently influences localised interactions between infectious and susceptible individuals (Ostfeld 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">2005</xref>; McCallum, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">2008</xref>). Revealing the landscape factors underlying these interactions calls for an interdisciplinary approach that draws on a range of techniques across different spatial scales (Manel 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">2003</xref>; Ostfeld 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">2005</xref>). Molecular markers provide a basis for this by genetically tracking spatial and temporal dynamics in pathogen and host populations (Biek and Real, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">2010</xref>). A landscape genetics approach to infectious disease therefore encompasses a range of analytical tools, including geographic information systems, remote sensing, population genetics, phylogenetics and statistical and mathematical modelling techniques (Manel 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">2003</xref>).
