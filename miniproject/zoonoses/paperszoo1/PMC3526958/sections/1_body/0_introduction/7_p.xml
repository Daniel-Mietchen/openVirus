<p>This review aims to synthesise our current understanding of rabies landscape epidemiology derived from genetic data across different spatio-temporal scales (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab01">Table 1</xref> for a list of relevant studies and associated analytical methods). Using the extensive work on wildlife rabies as a backdrop, we seek to identify commonalities as well as fundamental differences characterizing the dynamics of RABV in domestic dog populations. We will argue that the specific ‘landscape’ supporting the sustained transmission of the virus in dogs is determined by a complex mixture of physical and human geography and that a quantitative understanding of these landscapes will be essential for rabies control and eradication. In addition, control activities are themselves predicted to change molecular epidemiological trajectories, creating interesting opportunities for adaptive management in rabies. Throughout the review we highlight how novel tools and technologies are being used to tackle these problems and identify key areas in which such approaches have future potential.
