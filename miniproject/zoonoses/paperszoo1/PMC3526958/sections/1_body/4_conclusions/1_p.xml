<p>There is evidently a wide scope for the use of landscape genetics to explore and understand the dynamics of pathogen spread and persistence. Dogs are the principal reservoir of rabies, responsible for the majority of human rabies cases, yet we know little about the dynamics of the pathogen in this host. In order to reduce the many thousands of human rabies deaths that occur annually due to contact with rabid dogs, it is crucial that we uncover the mechanisms governing viral dispersal across the landscape so as to direct successful control interventions. The foundation of knowledge from studies in wildlife populations provides a starting point but aspects of host behaviour, the inherent influence of humans, and the long-term endemic nature of dog rabies foci requires a modified approach be taken for dog rabies. There lies great potential for advancing the effectiveness of control campaigns in areas burdened with disease; specifically landscape genetics has most to contribute to improving surveillance and modifying control strategies based on information gleaned from surveillance. This includes the design and placement of

Given the availability of powerful new genetic and spatial techniques, efforts now need to push towards real-world application of landscape genetics to rabies control and elimination.
