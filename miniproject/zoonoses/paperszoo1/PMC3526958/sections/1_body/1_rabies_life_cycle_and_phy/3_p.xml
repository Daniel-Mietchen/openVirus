<p>The strong phylogeographic structure exhibited by most dog rabies clades is mirrored in wildlife rabies, where the same pattern is evident even at relatively small spatial scales (Biek 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">2007</xref>) and may be explained by a ‘
 <italic>surfing mutation’</italic> model (Excoffier and Ray, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">2008</xref>). According to this model, new lineages arising during initial colonisation are able to reach high frequencies driven by an epidemic wave, whereas subsequent lineages do not benefit from such conditions and fail to infiltrate the dominating lineage clusters. Initial invasion events can therefore markedly influence the phylogeographic structure of rabies and, at least in wildlife, this structure can remain intact for decades (Biek 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">2007</xref>; Szanto 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75">2011</xref>). However, with ongoing movement of infected individuals and the immigration of new lineages into an area, this structure would be expected to erode over time. How environmental variation affects these processes of emergence and subsequent erosion of phylogeographic structure are questions central to defining the landscape epidemiology of RABV and we will return to them throughout this review.
