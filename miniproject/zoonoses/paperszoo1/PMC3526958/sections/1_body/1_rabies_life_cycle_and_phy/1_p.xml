<p>Transmission of rabies virus occurs predominantly through the bite of an infected animal, which inoculates virus-laden saliva into the subcutaneous and muscle tissue of a susceptible host (Dietzschold 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">2005</xref>). Once inoculated, the virus enters neurons and migrates to the central nervous system, before spreading to other organs, including the salivary glands where large amounts of infectious virions are shed into the saliva for further transmission (Dietzschold 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">2005</xref>). The incubation period is highly variable with a mean of 22 days in naturally infected dogs (Hampson 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">2009</xref>), but may extend to months or years due in part to localised replication (Hanlon 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">2007</xref>). In contrast, the infectious period is very short, around 3 days, and very rarely exceeds 10 days. The short infectious period severely restricts the spatial scale over which an infectious individual can transmit the virus, while the longer and more variable incubation time may permit the active or passive movement of infected individuals over larger distances, which, as detailed below, helps to explain phylogeographic patterns.
