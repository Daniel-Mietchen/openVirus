<p>On a global scale, dog RABV forms six major genetic clades, five of which are associated with particular geographic regions: Africa 2, Africa 3, Arctic-related, Asian, and the Indian subcontinent (Bourhy 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">2008</xref>). Grouping of these clades largely reflects major barriers such as oceans, large mountain ranges and deserts, or historical colonisation events. The Arctic-related viruses are relatively well distributed, reflecting the lack of barriers in the far north, and a sixth clade has a cosmopolitan distribution, reflecting historical waves of human migrations and colonisations (Smith 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">1992</xref>; Bourhy 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">2008</xref>). Such efficient dissemination is likely to be a result of the virus's relatively long and variable incubation period occasionally facilitating long-distance transport of infected dogs.
