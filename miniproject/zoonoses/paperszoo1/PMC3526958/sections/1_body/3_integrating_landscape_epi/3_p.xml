<p>Vaccination is widely deemed the most effective means of rabies control with demonstrated successes in reducing incidence and eliminating disease even in areas with limited resources (Cleaveland

Molecular genetics has demonstrated that domestic dogs are critical reservoirs for canine rabies, even in parts of Africa with abundant wildlife populations, and therefore indicate that controlling dog rabies through vaccination should eliminate infection from all other species (Lembo

By changing the susceptibility of populations, mass vaccinations change the landscape in which rabies circulates, and at sufficiently high levels of vaccination coverage, transmission can be interrupted. There are two mechanisms by which vaccination alters the landscape to control rabies. The first is that vaccination itself creates a barrier of susceptible individuals that block the dispersal of the pathogen across the landscape, and the second is via the reinforcement of existing barriers with vaccination. Using landscape genetics to explore the potential impacts of these aspects of landscape control is a logical next step.
