<p>Environmental or anthropogenic barriers to natural transmission of rabies offer the opportunity to strengthen and smarten vaccination initiatives. Vaccination can be viewed as a form of barrier that impedes rabies spread, and therefore many of the techniques used to draw insights on the permeability of barriers could equally be applied to vaccination programmes. 
 <italic>Oral Rabies Vaccination</italic> (ORV) campaigns for wildlife, including bait distribution in proximity to a pre-existing natural barrier (the Appalachian Mountains), and utilising existing environmental features to reinforce control campaigns (Wandeler 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref79">1988</xref>) have successfully contained wildlife rabies. Past experience has shown vulnerability to breaches associated with the differential permeability of barriers and emphasizes the need for ongoing and targeted surveillance to enable early detection and swift responses to incursions (Russell 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref68">2005</xref>). Yet despite this, few studies have quantified the utility of barriers within a landscape, and there are no guidelines available for the design and implementation of effective 
 <italic>cordons sanitaires</italic> for dog rabies.
