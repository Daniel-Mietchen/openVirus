<p>Ongoing surveillance is crucial to the long-term success of rabies control, and considerable value can be added to surveillance initiatives through the incorporation of landscape genetics, with the potential to determine the source of incursions and reveal transmission pathways. Epidemiological surveillance may facilitate active case detection and identification of circulating strains, helping to identify areas missed by vaccination. Using a molecular genetics approach during the 2007 FMD outbreak in the UK, allowed swift and effective containment of the outbreak by directing interventions to the critical areas (Cottam

For countries with limited resources, surveillance in areas with ongoing control programmes and retrospective analysis may be useful for identifying remaining foci of infection to be targeted by vaccination, sources of incursions, or spillover events into or from wildlife. In addition, metapopulation models may be utilized to predict the direction of spread of rabies in naïve populations (Beyer 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">2011</xref>), directing the location of sentinel points and control measures to ‘hotspots’ of infection (Haydon 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">2006</xref>) and putative transmission networks based on sampled cases should indicate how well current levels of surveillance are capturing rabies incidence based on inferred missing links between sampled cases.
