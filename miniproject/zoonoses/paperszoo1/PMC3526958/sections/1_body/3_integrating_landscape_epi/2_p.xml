<p>Considerable progress has been made in the development of blueprints and operational toolkits for rabies control (see “Blueprint for rabies prevention and control,” August 2010, 
 <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.rabiesblueprint.com/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.rabiesblueprint.com/</uri>, and Lembo

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">2011</xref>). The rabies blueprint presents a major step in the global fight against rabies, providing guidelines and economically feasible strategies to aid policy makers and local communities seeking to embark on rabies intervention and control measures. Landscape genetics research constitutes an important resource within this multidisciplinary approach to help advise and sustain successful control initiatives.
