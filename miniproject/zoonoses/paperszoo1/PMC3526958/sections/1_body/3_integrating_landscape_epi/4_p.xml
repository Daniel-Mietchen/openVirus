<p>Recurrent rabies epidemics occur across large areas where vaccination programmes are patchy and unsustained (Hampson 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">2007</xref>), suggesting that a proactive long-term vaccination programme coordinated across political boundaries is required for success. Indeed, the effectiveness of such a programme has been proven by the intensive vaccinations coordinated by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) in Latin America over the past few decades: dog rabies has been eliminated in a large portion of the southern continent, and reported cases from other countries are highly localised due to restrictions on transmission pathways from vaccination barriers (Schneider 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref69">2007</xref>). Crucially, cases of human rabies have dropped in these areas, reinforcing the importance of effective dog rabies control strategies. Strategically placing a vaccine barrier could maintain freedom from rabies resulting from successful interventions in otherwise landlocked areas.
