<p>Rabies containment and control will require ongoing surveillance and sustained control efforts. In time, when rabies incidence is reduced to low levels (the period when control measures often lapse), genetics can provide a means of directing resources to where they are most needed, maintaining a cost-effective approach. Given the small genome of RABV (12Kb), and advances in NGS sequencing, future exploration of phylogeographic patterns utilizing whole genome sequencing is a realistic prospect. This promises to provide appropriately fine genetic resolution for samples collected on small spatio-temporal scales that might otherwise be uninformative. Application of novel techniques in landscape genetics to other RNA viruses such as FMD and Influenza highlights interesting possibilities for uncovering disease dynamics and aiding control directives (Cottam
