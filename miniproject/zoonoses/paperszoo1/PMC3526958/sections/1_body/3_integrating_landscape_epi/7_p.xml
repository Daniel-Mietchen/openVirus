<p>Large-scale interventions are expensive, and adaptive management is often required alongside intervention. Refinements in resource management will ultimately rely on a combination of knowledge from genetics, landscape and host ecology as part of a reactive programme. Specific landscape elements affecting dog rabies spread are generally not known 
 <italic>a priori</italic>, so exploration of phylogeographic patterns may identify genetically distinct viral or host populations in areas, which could be targeted for vaccination. However, experience from wildlife rabies suggests that caution is warranted when taking such an approach. Firstly, apparent boundaries between areas dominated by different genetic lineages may have emerged during the initial invasion process and thus do not necessarily reflect areas of low permeability for the virus (Real 
 <italic>et al.</italic>

  <italic>b</italic>
 </xref>; Biek and Real, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">2010</xref>). Secondly, while the stability of these phylogeographic domains indicates a lack of mixing between them, this simply suggests that immigrating viruses find it difficult to invade areas with an already established focus, but does not signify the absence of viral immigration 
 <italic>per se</italic>. Such areas with putatively self-contained endemic foci could therefore experience a high risk of rabies re-emergence following successful eradication, unless vaccination effort remains high. Whether the second consideration equally applies to dog rabies is currently not clear as pertinent empirical studies are lacking. As with many research problems in landscape genetics, these types of question may be very productively studied using simulation tools (Epperson 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">2010</xref>). Simulations may indicate the most effective location for vaccine corridors/barriers e.g. vaccination on the far side of a natural barrier (Russell 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">2006</xref>), whereas metapopulation models may elucidate areas with high connectivity that could be the source of persistence in endemic areas. Quantifying the degree of connectivity between sub-populations is of critical importance to understanding how rabies is maintained across landscapes, and is an integral part of designing effective control interventions and 
 <italic>cordons sanitaires</italic> that limit and contain the virus.
