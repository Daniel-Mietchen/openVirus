<p>In addition to barrier studies, modern application of spatial data is allowing us to make increasingly accurate measurements of epidemiological parameters that may affect disease dynamics. For example, Bharti

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">2011</xref>) demonstrate the use of remote sensing to test for human predictors of disease. They used anthropogenic light from satellite imagery as a measure of seasonal fluctuations of human populations. The observed fluctuation in light intensity (as a measure of population density) correlated to measles distribution and spread in cities in Niger, and provided an accurate, near real-time representation of short-term population fluctuations that may drive pathogen transmission. This approach demonstrates the use of relatively simple proxies for quantifying migration patterns in poorly resourced regions, often the same regions carrying the highest disease burden from dog rabies.
