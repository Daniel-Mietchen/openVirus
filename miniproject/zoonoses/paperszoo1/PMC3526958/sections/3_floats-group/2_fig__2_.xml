  <p>Dispersal of bites from superspreading dogs resulting in rabies transmission in an area of the Serengeti District in Tanzania. Roads and rivers are shown to highlight the potential influence of landscape features on the dispersal of rabies- tentative observations indicate that superspreader progeny appear to cluster alongside roads and movement may be restricted by the presence of rivers (but other landscape features not shown may also be responsible for influencing dispersal patterns). Two potential types of superspreader are also highlighted in the map: A) a spatial superspreader, which transmits over a large spatial area, potentially connecting sub-populations and may be important from an epidemiological perspective; and B) a superspreader with a limited dispersal range that infects a large number of progeny but remains within a small spatial radius. Inset map shows the location of the Serengeti District within Tanzania.</p>
