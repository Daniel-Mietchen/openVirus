<p>Red squirrels with squirrelpox show typical signs associated with poxvirus infections, with the formation of multifocal extensive ulcerative lesions around the mouth and eyelids 
 <xref rid="pone.0096439-McInnes2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Squirrelpox lesions contain high concentrations of virus which can be shed to the environment, possibly helping to sustain infection. Diseased individuals rarely survive infection and this has had a profoundly negative impact on the distribution of red squirrels in Great Britain

 <xref rid="pone.0096439-Tompkins1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Red squirrels only become infected where they are sympatric with the introduced North American grey squirrels which are considered to be the reservoir host of the virus. Although most grey squirrels in England and Wales appear to be serologically positive for antibodies to the virus, they rarely show signs of disease and indeed currently there are no known negative consequences of SQPV infection in grey squirrels
