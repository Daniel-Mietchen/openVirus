<p>It had been postulated that competition for habitat and resources partially explains the replacement of reds by greys 
 <xref rid="pone.0096439-Wauters1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, however epidemiological modelling of squirrelpox suggests that grey squirrels replace red squirrel populations up to 25 times faster when the grey squirrel populations carry the poxvirus infection 
 <xref rid="pone.0096439-Rushton1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Current estimates put the remaining UK population of red squirrels at approximately 160,000 with 75% of those being in Scotland, predominantly in areas where there are either no grey squirrels or where reds are sympatric with grey squirrels which are serologically negative for SQPV. It has been suggested that the red squirrels will die out within 15â€“20 years if nothing is done to protect them from SQPV.
