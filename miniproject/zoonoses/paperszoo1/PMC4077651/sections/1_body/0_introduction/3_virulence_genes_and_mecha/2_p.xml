<p>The interferon (IFN) response system is targeted in many ways by poxvirus-encoded factors acting before and after IFN production 
 <xref rid="pone.0096439-Buller1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Usually this involves binding and neutralization of IFN molecules [e.g. some poxviruses encode soluble IFN receptor homologues which prevent IFN action) or other proteins functioning in the IFN system 
 <xref rid="pone.0096439-Perdiguero1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Poxviruses also target specific enzymes in IFN-dependent pathways, such as protein kinase R [PKR). By targeting these enzymes the poxviruses help to prevent the shutdown of viral protein synthesis in the infected cell 
 <xref rid="pone.0096439-Garca1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Outside of the poxvirus family there are other viruses that encode transcription suppressors of the IFN system (the HHV-8 virus encodes an IRF homolog which suppresses transcription) and viruses that encode RNA binding proteins preventing activation of PKR and oligoadenylate synthetase OAS)/RNaseL
