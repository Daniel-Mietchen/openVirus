<p>Viruses often encode proteins related to the immune system of their host in order to circumvent host immunity and improve viral survival. Poxvirus-encoded virulence factors target many different aspects of host immunity. The majority act to block or subvert the host anti-viral responses, and include proteins that manipulate apoptosis of host cells, inhibit the activity of both natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T-cells and that bind and/or inhibit a multitude of host cytokines
