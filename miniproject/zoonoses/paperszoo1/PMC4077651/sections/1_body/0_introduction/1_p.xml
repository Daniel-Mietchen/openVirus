<p>Poxviruses cause disease in many different taxa and have been described in insects, birds, reptiles and mammals 
 <xref rid="pone.0096439-Moss1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The mammalian poxviruses are found both in terrestrial and marine environments with many restricted to one host species, but a number can cause disease in more than one species with some being zoonotic 
 <xref rid="pone.0096439-LewisJones1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Squirrelpox virus (SQPV) has emerged in Great Britain as the cause of high mortality in Eurasian red squirrel (
 <italic>Sciurus vulgaris</italic>) populations whilst apparently leaving sympatric North American grey squirrel (
 <italic>Sciurus carolinensis</italic>) populations unaffected. The underlying mechanisms responsible for the pathogenicity of SQPV are not understood and hence the reason for the different disease manifestation in the two species cannot be fully investigated. In this paper we document the complete sequence of the SQPV genome (excluding the inverted terminal repeats), confirming that it is a species in the family 
 <italic>Poxviridae</italic> and does not partition with any of the currently recognized genera.
