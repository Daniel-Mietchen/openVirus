<p>It is clear from these results that SQPV is both in a novel taxonomic position in the chordopoxviruse subfamily which indicates a possible new genus of poxvirus, and that this virus has a previously undescribed diversity of virulence genes encoded in its genome. It would seem that this virus has adapted to it's host niche using genes commonly associated with pox virulence (e.g. CD47, PKR), but has also acquired novel genes such as multiple MHC molecules, and a way of potentially inhibiting the 2-5A system of the host.</p>
