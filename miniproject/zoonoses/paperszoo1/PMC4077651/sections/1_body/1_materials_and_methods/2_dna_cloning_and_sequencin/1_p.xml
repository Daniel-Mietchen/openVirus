<p>Pox genomic DNA isolated directly from scabs from an infected squirrel 
 <xref rid="pone.0096439-McInnes1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> was cloned into SuperCos I cosmids (Stratgene, La Jolla, USA) 
 <xref rid="pone.0096439-McInnes1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Six cosmids with an average insert size of 35 kb were selected on the basis that they spanned the entire genome. DNA was prepared using the Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen, UK) and pooled in equimolar proportions before being made into a single fragment shotgun sequencing library. Sequencing was conducted on a Genome Sequencer FLX System (Roche Diagnostics, UK) and assembled using Newbler (Roche Diagnostics, UK).
