<p>Structural homologues were identified using predicted amino acid sequences of relevant ORFs submitted for analysis on the SWISS-MODEL database 
 <xref rid="pone.0096439-Arnold1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Estimated model reliability was calculated using QMEAN4 score (range 0–1, higher values indicate better fit). These data were displayed and manipulated in PYMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.3, Schrödinger, LLC).
