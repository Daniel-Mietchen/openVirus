<p>The 
 <italic>Poxviridae</italic> are dsDNA viruses with linear genomes that range in size from ca. 135 kb to 360 kb. The final assembly for the SQPV genome (containing only one of the inverted terminal repeat [ITR] sequences) was within this range at 148 kb (one contig) with a GC content of 66.69% (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0096439-t001">Table 1</xref>). The previously available genomic data for SQPV 
 <xref rid="pone.0096439-McInnes1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> covered 60 kb from the right and left ends of the genome (∼40% genome), but lacked the central region of the sequence thought mainly to contain genes conserved across all poxvirus genera. The partial sequence of one of the two inverted terminal (ITR) sequences at the left hand end is included in the final assembly. The right hand ITR has the same sequence and size as the left hand ITR (3383 bp), but could not be resolved separately due to its identical sequence. There is one gene (SQPV_001) predicted to span the ITR/unique sequence boundary at the left end of the genome, but none at the right end of the genome, justifying the inclusion of only one copy of the ITR in the final assembly. The genome is therefore complete for all protein coding regions in the unique region, but lacks predicted extreme left and right hand ends of the genome, including the covalently closed terminal loops. It was estimated previously that the ITR was approximately 5 kb in length 
 <xref rid="pone.0096439-McInnes1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and therefore the full genome size is predicted to be between 152–155 kb. The genome sequence has been submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases under the accession HE601899.
