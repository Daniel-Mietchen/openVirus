<p>The phylogenetic analysis of the virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096439-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) shows that squirrelpox virus is a member of the subfamily of chordopoxviruses. The tree topology and branch lengths suggest that SQPV shares a common ancestor with Molluscipoxvirus and the Parapoxviruses, but represents a distinct and novel genus. This was suggested previously 
 <xref rid="pone.0096439-McInnes1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> but this study provides a more robust phylogeny and is supported by multiple methods and individual gene trees (data not shown). The Phylogeny suggests a relatively close relationship with the 
 <italic>Parapoxvirinae</italic> and the 
 <italic>Molluscipoxvirinae</italic>, but the presence of the VACV-Cop F15 and D9 homologs in the SQPV genome, together with the positional conservation of the VACV-Cop F9 and F10 genes (cf. the parapoxviruses), differentiates SQPV from the parapoxviruses suggesting the viruses must have diverged before the gene rearrangements and losses occurred in the 
 <italic>Parapoxvirinae</italic>.
