<p>Double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase is a key component mediating the antiviral actions of IFN that restricts viral replication by phosphorylating eukaryotic initiation factor-2a-subunit, an initiator of protein synthesis, reducing levels of viral protein

 <xref rid="pone.0096439-Garca2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The SQPV_025 is homologous to VACV_Cop E3L (41% identity over 69 amino acids toward N terminus), a host range gene, which is required for VACV pathogenesis 
 <xref rid="pone.0096439-Brandt1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. SQPV_025, VACV_Cop E3L and other poxvirus homologs share a small region of similarity in their carboxy terminus to an N-terminal domain of PKR (
