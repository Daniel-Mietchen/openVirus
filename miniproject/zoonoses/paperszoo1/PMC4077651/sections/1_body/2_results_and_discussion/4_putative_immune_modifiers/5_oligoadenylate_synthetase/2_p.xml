<p>By

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096439-g003">Figure 3</xref>). A prediction of the tertiary structure based on the porcine OAS1 crystal structure (PDB ID:1px5) is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096439-g003">Figure 3b</xref> (QMEAN4 score 0.53). These observations suggested that SQPV-OAS1 protein should be capable of binding dsRNA, but is not expected to catalyse 2-5A synthesis. By doing so it may be that this viral protein is able to prevent or at least reduce the activation of RNase L.
