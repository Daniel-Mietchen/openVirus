<p>OAS proteins are activated by dsRNA binding, leading to the OAS-catalysed synthesis of 2′-5′oligoadenylates (ppp(A2′p)
 <italic>n</italic>5′A, abbreviated to 2-5A) from ATP. RNase L, a latent endoribonuclease, becomes activated through binding 2-5As and degrades both viral and cellular RNA, including cellular rRNA 
 <xref rid="pone.0096439-Hovanessian1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. This antiviral response results in inhibition of protein synthesis and in some cases apoptosis. Protein alignments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096439-g003">Figure 3</xref>) show that the SQPV-OAS1 (SQPV_085) has a similar sequence to mammalian OAS1 proteins (128 identities out of 348 (37%) to porcine OAS [NP_999468]). The primary characteristics of the mammalian enzymes are: 2-5A synthesis, dsRNA binding, binding of other OAS enzymes, binding of 2-5As and ATP.
