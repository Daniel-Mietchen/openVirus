<p>In mammals, CD47 is widely expressed and its function is complex. It has been implicated in a range of T-cell regulatory functions including both inhibiting

 <xref rid="pone.0096439-Pettersen1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> apoptosis, depending on its local molecular interactions. Deletion of the myxoma virus CD47 homolog (M128L) demonstrated that this gene is a virulence factor, necessary for lethal infections in susceptible rabbits, while it was fully dispensable for virus replication
