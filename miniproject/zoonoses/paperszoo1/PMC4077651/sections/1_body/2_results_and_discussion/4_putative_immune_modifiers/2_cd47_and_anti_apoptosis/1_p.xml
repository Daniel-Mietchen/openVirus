<p>The SQPV CD47 homolog shares 25â€“29% amino acid identity with a range of mammalian CD47 molecules and homology to the A38L protein found in Vaccinia virus (strain Copenhagen; VACV_Cop) and a range of other poxviruses. It shares strong sequence similarity to the immunoglobulin superfamily domain of CD47

Key cysteine residues associated with disulphide bond formation appear conserved whereas other residues critical for signal regulatory protein (SIRP) interaction are altered suggesting that SQPV CD47 may be structurally intact but fail to activate CD47 receptors.
