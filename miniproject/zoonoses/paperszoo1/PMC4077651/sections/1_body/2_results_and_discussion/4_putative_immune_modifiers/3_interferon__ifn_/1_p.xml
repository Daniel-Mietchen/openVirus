<p>The interferon system is activated in response to viral infection and plays an important role in the host defence system. Interferons released into the extracellular space bind interferon receptors on neighboring cells to induce an alert system. The receptors activate the JAK-STAT pathway and induce a range of interferon stimulated genes. Various poxviruses encode proteins that either bind (or are predicted to bind) interleukin-18 (IL-18), an inducer of type II IFN, or are mimics of both type I and type II IFN receptors

 <xref rid="pone.0096439-Haga1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> whilst it is thought that MOCV may be able to inhibit IFN-induced NF-κB activation 
 <xref rid="pone.0096439-Gil1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. SQPV does not seem to encode such genes but does encode a putative PKR inhibitor and, uniquely amongst the poxviruses, a 2′-5′ oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-like protein.
