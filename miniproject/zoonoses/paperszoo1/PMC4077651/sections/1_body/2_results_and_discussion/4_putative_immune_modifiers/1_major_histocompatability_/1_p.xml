<p>Many viruses have evolved ways to interfere with natural killer (NK) cell activation 
 <xref rid="pone.0096439-Orange1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> through encoding MHC Class I homologs. This allows the virus to 1) down-regulate host MHC expression and 2) avoid NK surveillance through surface expression of viral MHC homologs. Such viral MHC proteins are often encoded in herpesviruses, but rare in poxvirus genomes. The SQPV genome is unusual amongst poxviruses, encoding three putative MHC-like homologs (SQPV_004, SQPV_027 and SQPV_064), spread throughout the genome. SQPV_004 is most conserved with class I (127/291(44%) identity to human MHC class 1, AAA57146), whilst SQPV_027 and SQPV_064 are much less conserved (72/273 (26%) and 47/194 (24%) respectively) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0096439.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The three genes share little identity to each other (SQPV_004 to SQPV_027 – 24%: 65/271 aa. SQPV_004 to SQPV_064 – 20%: 11/55 aa. SQPV_027 to SQPV_064 – 22%: 15/68 aa), which may suggest they represent independent acquisition events or arose as the result of an ancient duplication before subsequent divergence. Both SQPV_004 and SQPV_027 are predicted to have similar transmembrane domains to class I molecules, but SQPV_064 appears to lack a C terminal hydrophobic domain, suggesting it could be secreted. The poxvirus 
 <italic>Molluscum contagiosum virus</italic> (MOCV) encodes one MHC class I homolog (MOCV080R gene product) 
 <xref rid="pone.0096439-Senkevich1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. This protein is largely sequestered in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, is capable of binding β2-microglobulin and is not detected on the cell surface. It's role in virulence and whether or not it is involved in host NK-cell avoidance is not understood. Further studies are needed on the cellular location of the SQPV MHC molecules and to clarify their possible role in avoiding NK-cell surveillance and immune evasion.
