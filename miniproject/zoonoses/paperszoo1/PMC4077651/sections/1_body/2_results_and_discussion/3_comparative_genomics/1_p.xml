<p>Chordopoxvirus genomes have a central core of conserved genes. This consists of a minimum (core) set of 88 genes which contains genes essential for virus viability and encode proteins involved in viral DNA replication, transcription and virion assembly 
 <xref rid="pone.0096439-Gubser1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. These are all present in the SQPV genome (See 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0096439.s003">Table S1</xref>) which also includes the extra two genes (VACV-Cop F15 and D9) that are reported to be found in all other chordopoxvirus genomes except the parapoxviruses 
 <xref rid="pone.0096439-Gubser1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In the central conserved core region of the SQPV genome there are an additional 15 genes, 10 of which appear to be unique to SQPV. These 10 genes include two MHC class I-like molecules, an orthologue of 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (see below) and a likely member of the viral A-type inclusion protein superfamily. The remaining six have no known or predicted function. Eighty-two percent [115/141) of the genes in the genome have homologs in another pox genome, (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0096439.s003">Table S1</xref>). Most of the conserved genes are located in the middle of the genome (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096439-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), whilst the more variable and novel genes that are likely to define host range and virulence (many of which have been shown by others to be non-essential for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> replication), are located at either end of the genome. Our data corrects mistaken annotation in the original description of these flanking regions
