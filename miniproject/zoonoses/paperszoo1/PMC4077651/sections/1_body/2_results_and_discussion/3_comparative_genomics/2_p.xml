<p>Unlike the parapoxviruses and the 
 <italic>molluscum contagiosum virus</italic>, SQPV contains a thymidine kinase (TK) gene in the central region of the genome similar to the majority of other poxviruses. The SQPV TK gene, however, is not positionally conserved, in comparison to other poxviruses, and BLAST database searching suggests its closest orthologue is from the rat (
 <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>) and other rodents. This might suggest that the SQPV TK gene is a relatively recent, independent, acquisition and further analysis of its sequence may help in determining some of the evolutionary history of the virus.
