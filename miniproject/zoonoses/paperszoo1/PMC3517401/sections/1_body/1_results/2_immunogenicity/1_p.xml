<p>Specific seroreactivity to crude total 
 <italic>L. infantum</italic> antigen (CTLA) was not detected before challenge in any vaccinated hamster. Seroreactivity against recombinant antigens could not be evaluated in groups immunized with 
 <italic>T. ni</italic> protein extracts –PROT, DNA-PROT, and control (C)– due to the non-specific responses induced against larva antigens. In the DNA group, specific responses were not detected against the recombinant antigens KMPII, TRYP, or PAPLE22, with only one hamster showing specific anti-rLACK antibodies.
