<p>Seroreactivity against recombinant antigens could not be evaluated in the PROT and DNA-PROT groups due to the antibody responses induced against larva proteins. In the DNA group, one hamster showed antibodies against rKMPII, rLACK, and rPAPLE22, and another one developed antibodies against rLACK. Seroreactivity against rTRYP was not detected.</p>
