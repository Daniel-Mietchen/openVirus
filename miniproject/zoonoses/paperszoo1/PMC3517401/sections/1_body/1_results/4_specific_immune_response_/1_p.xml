<p>Concentration of specific anti-
 <italic>L. infantum</italic> antibodies in hamsters from the DNA and PROT groups were not significantly different to those from the C group (Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic>; 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.050 for both comparisons). Conversely, the DNA-PROT group produced significantly lower anti-CTLA antibody concentrations than the C group (Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic>; 
 <italic>P = </italic>0.004). The results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051181-g003">Figure 3</xref>. The concentration of antibodies against CTLA significantly correlated with the parasite load both in blood (Spearman’s 
 <italic>ρ</italic>; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and spleen (Spearman’s 
 <italic>ρ</italic>; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).
