<p>For recombinant antigen-based ELISAs, each serum sample was tested against each raw protein larva extracts containing rKMPII, rTRYP, rLACK, rPAPLE22, and their corresponding control Ni antigen prepared at the same concentration in the same plate. For CTLA-ELISA, plates were coated with 2 µg of CTLA per well. Working dilutions for sera were 1∶10 (recombinant antigen-based ELISAs) or 1∶400 (CTLA-ELISA). Anti-hamster IgG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich®, St. Louis, MO, USA) diluted 1∶1000 was used as a secondary antibody. A known positive serum used as calibrator was included in all plates, and plates with interassay variations ≥ 10% were ruled out. The cut-off values for both types of ELISA were established on the basis of optical densities obtained from the NN group and calculated as the mean + 3 SD, resulting in 0.122 for CTLA, 0.266 for rKMPII, 0.050 for rTRYP, 0.284 for rLACK, and 0.376 for rPAPLE22.</p>
