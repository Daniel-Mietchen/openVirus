<p>Gene cloning was performed as previously described 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-RodriguezCortes1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The primers used to amplify the coding sequences of the 
 <italic>KMPII</italic>, 
 <italic>TRYP</italic>, and 
 <italic>LACK</italic> genes have been described elsewhere 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-RodriguezCortes1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and the coding region of 
 <italic>PAPLE22</italic> (GenBank accession number AF123892) was amplified using forward 
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′-GGCCACTTCTCTCTTCTCCA-3′</named-content> and reverse 
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′-CTTGCCACATACACCAATCG-3′</named-content> primers. The coding sequences of each gene were cloned separately into the pVAX1™ vector (Invitrogen™, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Large-scale plasmid preparations were performed using an EndoFree® Plasmid Giga Kit (Qiagen®, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
