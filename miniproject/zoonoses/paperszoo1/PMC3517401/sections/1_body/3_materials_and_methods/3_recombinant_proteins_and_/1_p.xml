<p>Recombinant proteins were obtained in baculovirus-infected 
 <italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic> larvae as described elsewhere 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Todoli1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Todoli2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Wild-type baculovirus was used to obtain the control raw protein extract (Ni antigen) for vaccination and ELISA. The concentrations of specific recombinant proteins in the raw 
 <italic>T. ni</italic> extracts were 1% for recombinant KMPII protein (rKMPII), 0.5% for rTRYP, 2% for rPAPLE22, and 5% for rLACK. Antigenic characterization of the recombinant proteins has been explained elsewhere
