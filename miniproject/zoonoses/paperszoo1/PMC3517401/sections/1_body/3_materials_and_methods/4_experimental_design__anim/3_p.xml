<p>The PROT group received 2 intraperitoneal doses of a mixture of raw larvae extracts containing 5 µg of each recombinant protein in 200 µL of sterile saline solution. The DNA group received 3 intramuscular doses of 100 µg of each plasmid construction in 100 µL of sterile saline solution (50 µL into each 
 <italic>tibialis cranialis</italic> muscle). The DNA-PROT group received 3 doses of DNA vaccine, followed by 2 doses of protein vaccine using the same protocols as for the DNA group and the PROT group. Finally, the C group received 3 doses of pVAX1
 <bold>™</bold> without insert (400 µg) in 100 µL of sterile saline solution, followed by 2 doses of Ni antigen, using the equivalent amount of total protein as in the DNA-PROT group. The interval between immunizations was 2 weeks. The safety of the vaccine prototypes was assessed at 1 h, 4 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after each vaccination by close observation and clinical examination of the animals. No adjuvants were used in order to not to interfere with the actual protective response of the different vaccination strategies and to allow comparisons.
