<p>Forty hamsters were randomly assigned to four equally sized experimental groups: protein vaccine (PROT), naked DNA vaccine (DNA), prime-boost vaccine (DNA-PROT), and control (C). One hamster from the DNA-PROT group died during the acclimatizing period and was not substituted. All groups were handled in parallel so that infection inoculum was the same and administered at the same time, as it was the case for vaccinations and euthanasia. Samples from four additional hamsters that were neither vaccinated nor infected (NN) were used as controls for the different techniques.</p>
