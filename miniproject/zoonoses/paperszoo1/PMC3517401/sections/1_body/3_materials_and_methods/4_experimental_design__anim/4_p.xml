<p>Valid surrogate markers of protection against human leishmaniasis and in clinical bio-models are still lacking. The most widely used measure of vaccine potential has been to monitor anti-
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> immune responses, either humoral or cellular, over time but nucleic acid detection is an established method for detection of 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasite in blood and other tissues 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Duthie1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. As explained by WHO guidelines 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-WHO2" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>, confirmation of infection by very sensitive methods such as PCR or culture represent a very early end-point of the development of the disease 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-PalatnikdeSousa1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. Thus, primary outcome measures were differences between groups in parasite load and in NO production, the main functional effector responsible for killing 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> and for controlling the infection 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Bogdan1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. Secondary outcomes were differences in specific humoral immune response, parasite killing, and histopathology.
