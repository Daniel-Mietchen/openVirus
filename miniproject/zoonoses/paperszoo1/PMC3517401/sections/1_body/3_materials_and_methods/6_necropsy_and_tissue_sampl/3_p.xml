<p>A sample of spleen tissue was collected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Spleen size was roughly estimated at necropsy as length × width (cm
 <sup>2</sup>). Normal spleen size range was estimated on the basis of the results from hamsters in the NN group and calculated as the mean area ± 3 SD. Spleens larger than 2.7 cm
 <sup>2</sup> were considered to be abnormally enlarged.
