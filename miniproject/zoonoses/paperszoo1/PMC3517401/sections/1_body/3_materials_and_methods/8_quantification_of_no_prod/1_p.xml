<p>Peritoneal macrophages were harvested at 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> per well in a 16-well glass Lab-Tek™-Chamber Slide™ System (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY, USA). 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> infection was performed with stationary-phase promastigotes of 
 <italic>L. infantum</italic> (MCAN/ES/92/BCN-83/MON-1) at a parasite:macrophage ratio of 7∶1 for 4 h at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Non-internalized parasites were removed by gentle washing with pre-warmed PBS, and infected macrophages were then cultured in Gibco DMEM without Phenol Red (Invitrogen™, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 5% (v/v) FCS for 72 h. Supernatants were then collected and stored at −80°C, and slides were Giemsa-stained.
