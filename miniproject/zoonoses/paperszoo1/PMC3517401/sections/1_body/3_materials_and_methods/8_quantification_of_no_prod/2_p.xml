<p>Culture supernatants were analyzed for their NO concentrations using the Griess reaction by measuring combined oxidation products of NO (NO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> and NO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>) after reduction with nitrate reductase in a Colorimetric Assay (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The number of amastigotes per 100 macrophages was determined by microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained slides.
