 <italic>L. infantum</italic> DNA was specifically detected and quantified as described elsewhere using the Taqman® real-time PCR (qPCR) (Applied Biosystems™, Foster City, CA, USA) targeting conserved DNA regions of the kinetoplast minicircle DNA, and the eukaryotic 18S RNA Pre-Developed TaqMan Assay Reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) as internal reference gene. For spleen, relative quantification was performed by the 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Livak1" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref> using as calibrator the sample showing the lowest ΔCt and results expressed as x-fold more DNA copies than this calibrator sample 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Alberola1" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>. For blood, quantification was performed by the 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Livak1" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref> using as calibrators spiked samples with a known number of parasites/well, thus allowing determining the number of parasites in any PCR sample, independently of the amount of DNA added or the presence of inhibitors, and results expressed as parasites/mL
