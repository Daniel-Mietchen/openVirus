<p>Two weeks after the last immunization, four hamsters from each vaccine group were euthanized to evaluate the immunogenicity of each vaccination schedule. The remaining hamsters were challenged with an intraperitoneal injection of 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> stationary promastigotes of 
 <italic>L. infantum</italic> (strain MCAN/ES/92/BCN-83/MON-1), clinically evaluated once a week for the presence of signs compatible with leishmaniasis, and euthanized 20 weeks after experimental infection. Parasites –kindly provided by Dr. M. Gállego, Grup de Parasitologia Clínica, Universitat de Barcelona, Spain– were obtained from a naturally infected dog that had not received any treatment and were passaged through hamsters in order to retain their full virulence.
