<p>Leishmaniases can serve as model for other parasitic diseases. Leishmaniases are diseases caused by species of the kinetoplastid parasite 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp. and transmitted by hematophagous sandflies. Leishmaniases represent a major, although grossly underestimated, health problem: over 350 million people are at risk, with a worldwide prevalence of more than12 million cases. The clinical presentation is dependent upon both the parasite species and the hostâ€™s immune response. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the most severe form of the disease with deadly epidemics that periodically flare up but go mostly unnoticed. VL has an estimated annual incidence of 500 000, a 90% mortality rate if left untreated, and accounting for around 70 000 deaths per year, thus ranking second only to malaria for mortality and fourth for morbidity amongst tropical parasitic diseases

 <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> causes anthroponotic VL, whereas 
 <italic>L. infantum</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>L. chagasi</italic>) is the causative agent of the zoonotic form, with the domestic dog as its main reservoir.
