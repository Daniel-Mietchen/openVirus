<p>In this study, we used four evolutionarily conserved 
 <italic>L. infantum</italic> antigens –KMPII (kinetoplastid membrane protein-11, formerly known as KMP-11), TRYP (tryparedoxin peroxidase, previously known as TSA), LACK (
 <italic>L. infantum</italic> homologue of receptors for activated C kinase), and PAPLE22 (potentially aggravating protein of 
 <italic>L. infantum</italic>)–, formerly shown to be potent B-cell and T-cell immunogens in 
 <italic>L. infantum</italic>-infected dogs 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Todoli1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, to simultaneously compare the protection induced using three vaccination strategies: naked plasmid DNA (DNA), raw insect-derived recombinant protein (PROT), and HPB with naked plasmid DNA followed by raw insect-derived recombinant protein (DNA-PROT). There are several mouse-based models for modeling the immunity against 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic>, however vaccine studies against VL are hampered by the lack of bio-models that accurately reflect the human disease, being the best the golden hamster when experimental infection is used, and the dog for natural infections 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Duthie1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Thus, we used the golden hamster model of 
 <italic>L. infantum</italic> infection, known to be the best mimicking the outcome of this disease, characterized by parasite visceralization, splenomegaly, cachexia, and progressive hypergammaglobulinemia 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Requena1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-RicaCapela1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Susceptibility of the hamster to VL is attributed to impaired macrophage effector function, as iNOS transcription is relatively unresponsive to IFN-γ, a finding also reported in humans 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Melby1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Perez1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Potential drawbacks of the model are that it uses outbred animals and suffers from lack of immunological reagents and assays needed for the dissection of immune responses
