<p>Several vaccination strategies against VL have been assayed 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Kaye2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Killed vaccines have generally been immunogenic yet ineffective. Recombinant protein-based vaccines have achieved moderate protection in mice and dogs, but they often need to be formulated with an adjuvant, which complicates the process for getting marketing authorization, particularly in human medicine. Naked DNA vaccines have also been tested reaching different degrees of protection in rodents, but they have often proved inadequate in providing protection in non-murine models 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Ulmer1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The only two naked DNA vaccines assayed against 
 <italic>L. infantum</italic> in dogs were not protective 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Ramiro1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-RodriguezCortes1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In order to enhance inmunogenicity, DNA vaccines can be improved by the heterologous prime-boost (HPB) strategy, which potentially allows for higher degrees of immunity and protection. This strategy selectively amplifies memory T cells specific for the vaccine antigen 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Woodland1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Prime-boost assays carried out against 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> with the antigen LACK achieved protection in mice 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Dondji1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, but was only moderate in dogs 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Ramiro1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Ramos1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Ramos2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In contrast, prime-boost vaccination using CPA and CPB antigens was highly protective in both mice 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Rafati1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and dogs 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Rafati2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. A cocktail of different evolutionary conserved antigens would probably provide the best protection against the parasite, as suggested elsewhere
