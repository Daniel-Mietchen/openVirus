<p>The control of the disease, as it is the case for most parasitic diseases, is almost confined to chemotherapy, but there are limited number of drugs available, requiring long periods of administration, inducing serious side effects, prone to resistance development, and not affordable for the poor

 <sup>+</sup> T-cell population producing IFN-γ, which in turns activates macrophages to produce NO, the underlying molecule responsible for the intracellular amastigote death

 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Kaye1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In fact, the European Medicines Agency has awarded marketing authorization for the prophylaxis and early treatment of CanL to domperidone (Leisguard®, Laboratorios del Dr. Esteve, Barcelona, Spain) 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-GomezOchoa1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, an antidopaminergic drug that can act as a proinflammatory cytokine able to skew immune response towards a Th1-like immune response, with cell-mediated immunity (CMI) inducing natural killer cell induction and macrophage activation. Thus, vaccines have been proposed as major cost-effective tools

However, no vaccine against human VL has been marketed to date. Two vaccines have granted marketing authorization against CanL in Brasil –Leishmune® (Pfizer Saúde Animal, São Paulo, Brasil) 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-BorjaCabrera1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and Leish-Tec® (Hertape Calier Saúde Animal, Juatuba, Brasil) 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Fernandes1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>– and another one has just get a European registration –CaniLeish® Virbac, Carros, France). However, the efficacy of these vaccines remains controversial, particularly when compared with those against viral and bacterial infections.
