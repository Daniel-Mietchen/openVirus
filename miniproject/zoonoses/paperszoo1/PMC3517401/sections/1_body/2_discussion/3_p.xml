<p>DNA vaccines have proven capable of stimulating antibody production, as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T CMI 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Huygen1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. In our study, the DNA vaccine induced antibodies against rLACK in one hamster, but antibodies against the other vaccine antigens were not detected, as it has been reported for other DNA candidates 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Ahmed1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Despite the lack of parasitological protection in blood, the significant parasitological protection in spleen –that achieved sterility in some animals– suggests that some degree of CMI response was induced, although not enough for significant NO production. DNA vaccine could have a deleterious effect on aberrant B-cell proliferation and antibody production associated with disease
