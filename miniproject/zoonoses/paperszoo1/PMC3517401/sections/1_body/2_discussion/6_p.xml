<p>To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first head-to-head simultaneous comparison between naked DNA, raw insect-derived recombinant protein, and HPB strategies performed using a reliable and robust clinical model of VL. Our results show that the HPB strategy with naked DNA and raw insect-derived recombinant proteins –rKMPII, rTRYP, rLACK, and rPAPLE22– elicitis a strong CMI response and parasitological protection against 
 <italic>L. infantum</italic>, better than that obtained with either the naked DNA or protein vaccines used alone. Last but not least, our results demonstrate that using naked DNA –the cheapest way of obtaining DNA vaccines– coupled with raw recombinant proteins produced in insect larvae biofactories –capable of producing large quantities of recombinant protein per biomass unit at low production costs and easy to scale-up 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Millan1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>– is a practical and cost-effective way for “off the shelf” supplying vaccine doses at a very low price for the protection against leishmaniases, and possibly against other parasitic diseases affecting the poorest of the poor.
