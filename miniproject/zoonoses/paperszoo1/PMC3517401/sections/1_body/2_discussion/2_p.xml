<p>In spite of the fact that vaccination with recombinant proteins has been described as moderately effective against 
 <italic>L. infantum</italic> infection in rodents 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Coler2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Goto1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, the immunization of hamsters with crude rKMPII, rTRYP, rLACK, and rPAPLE22 expressed in 
 <italic>T. ni</italic> larvae did not achieve parasitological protection, and we could not detect specific CMI. Raw protein extracts of larvae include remains of baculovirus and it has been shown to stimulate proinflamatory cytokines involved in the stimulation and maintenance of Th1 cellular immune responses 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Abe1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, including those against 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic>. This stimulation occurs through the MyD88-TLR9 pathway, being TLR9 the innate receptor for unmethylated CpG motifs –present in the baculoviral DNA–, that are considered pathogen-associated molecular patterns and responsible for the immunostimulatory Type I proproinflamatory response 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Abe2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In this way, the intrinsic immunostimulatory property of baculovirus may alleviate the requirement of traditional adjuvants added to the vaccine formulations 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-HervasStubbs1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Madhan1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Molinari1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. In our case this stimulation appears not to be enough, and the lack of traditional adjuvants might explain the failure to induce a Th1 response 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Coler1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. However, few adjuvants have been approved for human vaccines, and they currently appear inadequate to confer protection against other intracellular parasitic diseases 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Coler3" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. In contrast, other vaccines using raw insect-derived recombinant proteins yielded successful results against viral diseases 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Barderas2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, even in the absence of an adjuvant 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-PerezFilgueira2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> . This fact probably reflects the strong CMI required for protection against intracellular parasites, or a deleterious effect of some of the vaccine antigens used in our assay. KMPII 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-deCarvalho1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, LACK 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Carvalho1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, and PAPLE22 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Suffia1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref> elicit human production of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine capable of inhibiting synthesis of Th1-like cytokines, which has also been described in infected hamsters 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Melby2" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>.
