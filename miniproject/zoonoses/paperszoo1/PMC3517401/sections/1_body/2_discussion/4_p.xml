<p>HPB vaccination using raw insect-derived recombinant proteins after DNA achieved almost full parasitological protection in blood and spleen, reaching sterility in some individuals. This protection was associated with significant production of NO in the macrophages, indicative of effective T-cell mediated anti-
 <italic>L. infantum</italic> activity. Other studies have described an association between vaccine protection and levels of NO production

 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Gomes1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref> in hamster macrophages. Despite the relative unresponsiveness of iNOS transcription to IFNγ in the hamster

 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Bronte1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Moreover, a lower parasite-specific humoral response was observed in the DNA-PROT group in relation to the C group after challenge. This phenomenon –also described in hamsters vaccinated with 
 <italic>PAPLE22</italic> DNA 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Fragaki1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref> and in other protective vaccines against VL in hamsters 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Gomes1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref> and dogs 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Fernandes1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Ramos2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>– might be due to a redirection of the Th2-like response towards a Th1-like response and/or to the lower antigenic stimulation caused by lower parasite loads. In this sense, our results showed a positive correlation between parasite load in spleen and blood samples and the 
 <italic>L. infantum</italic>-specific humoral response, as previously described in hamsters 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-RicaCapela1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The DNA-PROT vaccine also prevented certain histopathological alterations in spleen and liver that have been attributed to leishmaniasis in hamsters and dogs
