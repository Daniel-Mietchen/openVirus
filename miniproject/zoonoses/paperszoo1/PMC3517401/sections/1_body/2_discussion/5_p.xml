<p>Attempts to enhance the protective immune responses against experimental murine leishmaniasis have been successful using HPB vaccination strategies based on successive administration of different DNA vector vaccines

 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Lange1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. A number of antigen candidates have been assayed on the murine model of VL in a HPB approach based on DNA followed by protein produced using traditional cell-culture technology, such as, ORFF 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Tewary1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, CPs 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Rafati1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and LACK 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Dondji1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Moreover, comparative vaccine potential of DNA, protein, and HPB vaccination was evaluated against leishmaniasis in the murine model

 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Mazumder1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. Unfortunately, experimental models often lack consistency with clinical settings 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Perel1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Robertson1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, thus being the major challenge the translation of results from animal bio-models to human disease and the transition from the laboratory to the field 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Kedzierski2" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. Because of the many analytical tools available, the murine model of VL is an excellent one to dissect the immunological bases but, when research is focused on the disease, it is a very poor model because in most situations they clear infection from both spleen and liver providing very little medical translational information. Conversely, the hamster model of VL has very little tools for studying immunity being an incomplete model for immunological studies, but it reproduces with high fidelity the clinical human disease 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Requena1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0051181-Melby3" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. Thus, when studying the disease, not their immunological bases –that very often do not translate directly into clinical disease–, the hamster model is very robust and, by far, better and preferable over the murine one, because of the added value of the high medical translational information obtained.
