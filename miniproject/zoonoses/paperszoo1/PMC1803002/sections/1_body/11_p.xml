<p>An interesting example of viruses identified in animals before being found in humans is provided by rotaviruses, the main cause of diarrhea in infants and children throughout the world and in the developing countries in particular [

 <xref rid="ppat-0030012-b037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The causal association between rotaviruses and diarrhea was made in calves well before it was realized for humans [

 <xref rid="ppat-0030012-b038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Mebus and colleagues demonstrated that diarrhea in calves was caused by rotaviruses [

 <xref rid="ppat-0030012-b040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and established a cell culture system to propagate them [
 <xref rid="ppat-0030012-b041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In addition, studies in both calves and lambs were key to realizing the importance of local immunity and colostrum-derived antibodies in the resistance to rotavirus infection [
 <xref rid="ppat-0030012-b042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat-0030012-b043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. All of these studies have had a profound impact in understanding and preventing human rotavirus infection.
