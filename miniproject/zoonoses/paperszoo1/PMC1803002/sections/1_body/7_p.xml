<p>Scrapie, another of the slow diseases of sheep, was the first disease described [
 <xref rid="ppat-0030012-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] within the group of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030012-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). The apparent lack of nucleic acids in the infectious material associated with scrapie and other TSEs has represented a wonderful biological puzzle, culminating in the award of the Nobel prize to Stanley Prusiner for the prion theory [
 <xref rid="ppat-0030012-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. TSEs have also been diagnosed in humans and include kuru, Gerstmann-Str√§ussler-Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and the new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Kuru, the first recognized human TSE, was originally described by Carleton Gajdusek and Vincent Zigas in members of the Fore tribe in the Papua New Guinea at the end of the 1950s. Interestingly, the first hint that kuru and scrapie might be similar diseases was made serendipitously by a veterinary pathologist, William Hadlow, who was attending an exhibit on kuru at the Wellcome Medical Museum in London [
 <xref rid="ppat-0030012-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The vacuolated neuronal cell bodies were unusual in human pathology but well characterized in sheep with scrapie. Seven years after this connection was made, Gajdusek and colleagues described the experimental transmission of kuru in chimpanzees inoculated with brain tissues from persons who had died of the disease [
