<p>The cross-protective effect induced by HA-13–263 proteins fused with or without Fd and/or Fc was further evaluated by detection of viral titers in the lung tissues of vaccinated mice challenged with H5N1 virus. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053568-g009">Fig. 9</xref>, a significantly lower level of virus titers was detected in the mice vaccinated with HA-13–263-Fdc, HA-13–263-Fc and HA-13–263-Fd-His proteins than those vaccinated with HA-13–263-His protein after challenge with both VN/1194 and SZ/406H viruses (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). However, virus titer in the PBS control group was still significantly higher than that of the HA-13–263-His vaccination group. These results suggested that the HA-13–263 proteins with suitable polymeric conformation after the addition of Fd and/or Fc can induce strong cross-protection against divergent H5N1 virus challenge.
