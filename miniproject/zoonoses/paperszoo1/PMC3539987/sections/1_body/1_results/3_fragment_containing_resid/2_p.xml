<p>Since the molecular weight shown in reducing SDS-PAGE would not represent the actual size of the tested proteins, we next sought to detect the conformation of these proteins using non-reducing N-PAGE by removing the reducing agents in both sample and running buffers. As indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053568-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, clear bands with high molecular weight were detected in HA-13–263-Fdc, HA-13–263-Fc and HA-13–263-Fd-His proteins, with HA-13–263-Fdc showing the highest molecular weight oligomer, while no clear band was shown in HA-13–263-His protein. Similarly, these bands were detected by a HA1-specific mAb in Western blot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053568-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>), indicating their high specificity to the HA1 protein. Comparison of the molecular weight from samples with and without cross-linker showed that the molecular weights of the cross-linker samples for HA-13–263 with Fd and/or Fc were about 1-, 2- or 3-fold higher than that of the corresponding without-cross-linker samples, but the molecular weight of the cross-linker HA-13–263-His was almost the same as that of the without-cross-linker HA-13–263-His (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053568-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). These results suggest that the identified neutralizing HA-13–263 fragment fused with Fd and/or Fc tags was able to form conformational structures of dimer, trimer, or oligomer.
