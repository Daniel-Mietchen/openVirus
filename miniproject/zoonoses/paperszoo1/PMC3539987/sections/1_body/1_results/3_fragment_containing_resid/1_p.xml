<p>Based on the identified HA-13–263 neutralizing region, we constructed three additional recombinants, respectively fused with Fc (HA-13–263-Fc), Fd-His (HA-13–263-Fd-His), or His (HA-13–263-His) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053568-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), and expressed these proteins in the culture supernatant of 293T cells, followed by characterizing the ability of this neutralizing HA fragment to form different conformational structures of HA. As shown in SDS-PAGE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053568-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), one clear band was observed in the non-boiled samples of HA-13–263-Fdc and HA-13–263-Fc with a molecular weight higher (almost 2-fold) than observed in the boiled samples (monomers), suggesting that HA-13–263 mainly form dimeric conformational structures. In addition, the top band from the non-boiled HA-13–263-Fd-His sample line had a molecular weight almost 3-fold greater than the boiled line (monomer), revealing that HA-13–263 fused with Fd mainly form trimeric conformational structure. In the line of HA-13–263-His protein, similar bands with almost identical molecular weight were detected in both boiled and non-boiled conditions, indicating that HA-13–263 fragment alone maintained a monomeric form. Accordingly, these particular bands shown in SDS-PAGE were further confirmed in Western blot analysis by a HA1-specific mAb developed in our laboratory (
