<p>Only slight body weight loss (less than 3%) was found on day 6–8 in the mice vaccinated with HA-13–263-Fdc after challenge with VN/1194 and SZ/406H viruses. Mice vaccinated with HA-13–263-Fc and HA-13–263-Fd-His proteins after challenge with SZ/406H were able to regain normal body weight. In addition, mice from the HA-13–263-Fc and HA-13–263-Fd-His vaccination groups showed a slightly higher level of body weight loss (around 6% on day 8 post-challenge) than those from HA-13–263-Fdc vaccination group after challenge with VN/1194 virus. In contrast, mice vaccinated with HA-13–263-His demonstrated a significant loss of body weight, particularly during day 6–12, after respectively challenge with VN/1194 and SZ/406H virus strains. However, all mice from the PBS control group indicated an obvious and continual decrease of body weight after day 2, all of which reaching &gt;25% severe weight loss by day 8–10 post-challenge (
