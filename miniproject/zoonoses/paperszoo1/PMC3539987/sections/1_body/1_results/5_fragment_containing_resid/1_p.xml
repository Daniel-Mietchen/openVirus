<p>To demonstrate the ability of HA-13–263 proteins with suitable polymeric conformation to promote greater cross-protection than protein monomer, mice vaccinated with the above fusion proteins were challenged with VN/1194 (clade 1) and SZ/406H (clade 2.3.4) H5N1 viruses 10 days post-last vaccination and observed daily for two weeks for survival and body weight change. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053568-g008">Fig. 8A and B</xref>, HA-13–263-Fdc protein completely cross-protected all vaccinated mice against VN/1194 and SZ/406H virus challenge. HA-13–263-Fc and HA-13–263-Fd-His protected all vaccinated mice against challenge of SZ/406H strain, and both proteins could protect 80% of the vaccinated mice against VN/1194 virus challenge. Compared with the HA-13–263 proteins fused with Fd and/or Fc, the protein HA-13–263-His provided much lower protection rate. No mice in the PBS control group survived the challenge of two virus strains after day 10.
