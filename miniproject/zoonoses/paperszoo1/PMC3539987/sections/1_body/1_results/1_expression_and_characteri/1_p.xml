<p>In this study, we constructed six recombinant proteins covering different lengths of HA1 of H5N1 virus, including full-length RBD (HA-112–263, HA-38–263, and HA-13–263), or partial-length RBD (HA-13–158 and HA-13–218) or no RBD (HA-13–90), and containing Fd and Fc at the C-termini (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053568-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). All six constructs were able to express soluble proteins in the culture supernatant of transfected 293T cells, maintaining high expression with strong purity, as shown in SDS-PAGE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053568-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The expressed proteins were shown as monomers in the boiled sample lines, but the molecular weight shown in the non-boiled proteins is around 2-fold higher than that of the boiled samples after addition of the sample buffer containing 2% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol reducing agent and migration of the gels in the presence of 0.1% SDS, indicating that all expressed proteins fused with Fd and Fc formed suitable conformational structures similar to dimers in the reducing SDS-PAGE (
