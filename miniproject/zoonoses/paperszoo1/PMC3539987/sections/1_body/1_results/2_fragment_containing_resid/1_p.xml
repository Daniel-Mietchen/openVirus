<p>All six truncated protein fragments were used to immunize mice, as described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, and sera were collected 10 days post-last vaccination to detect HA1-specific antibody responses and neutralizing activity against homologous H5N1 virus. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053568-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, all protein fragments induced high HA1-specific IgG antibodies in the vaccinated mice, with no significant differences being detected in the sera collected from any vaccinated group. An average endpoint antibody titer of 1 : 2.1 Ã— 10
 <sup>8</sup> was detected in the sera of mice vaccinated with all six proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053568-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), suggesting that these truncated HA1 protein fragments containing suitable conformation have high immunogenicity in eliciting potent antibody responses in the vaccinated mice.
