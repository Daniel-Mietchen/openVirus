<p>The neutralizing activity induced by these protein fragments was further evaluated in the collected mouse sera against homologous AH-HA strain of H5N1 pseudovirus. As indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053568-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, the HA-13–263-Fdc vaccinated group elicited very strong neutralizing antibody response against AH-HA H5N1 pseudovirus, reaching a titer of 1∶8.6 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>±5.7 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>, which is significantly higher (
 <italic>P&lt;</italic>0.05) than that induced by the groups vaccinated with the other five truncated protein fragments, including residues 112–263, 38–263, 13–90, 13–158, and 13–218 of HA1 region. These results suggest that the protein fragment containing residues 13–263 of HA1 is the CND in HA1 that could induce the strongest neutralizing antibody response and its fusion protein containing Fd and Fc (HA-13–263-Fdc) may be an ideal immunogen for inducing highly potent neutralizing responses against H5N1 virus infection.
