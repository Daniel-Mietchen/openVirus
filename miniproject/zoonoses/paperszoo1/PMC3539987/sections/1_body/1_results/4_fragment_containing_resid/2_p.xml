<p>Further evaluation of the neutralizing activity of these proteins in vaccinated mouse sera revealed that all HA-13–263 proteins with Fd and/or Fc were able to induce a significantly higher level of neutralizing antibodies than HA-13–263-His against homologous (AH-HA) and heterologous (HK-HA and 1194-HA) H5N1 pseudoviruses. Specifically, HA-13–263-Fdc and HA-13–263-His induced the highest and lowest neutralizing antibody responses, respectively, against all three H5N1 strains, while HA-13–263-Fc elicited a significantly higher level of neutralizing antibodies than HA-13–263-Fd-His. However, PBS control did not induce neutralizing antibodies against any tested pseudoviruses (
