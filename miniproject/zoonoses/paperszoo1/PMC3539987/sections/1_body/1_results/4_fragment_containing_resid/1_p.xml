<p>To evaluate the ability of conformational proteins in improving immune responses, we immunized mice using purified HA-13–263 proteins with or without Fd and/or Fc, and compared the IgG antibody response, subtypes and neutralizing antibodies in the collected mouse sera. The results, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053568-g006">Fig. 6A and B</xref>, demonstrated that HA-13–263-Fdc and HA-13–263-Fc induced higher titers of IgG antibodies against the HA protein than HA-13–263-Fd-His or HA-13–263-His. While HA-13–263-Fdc induced the highest titer of IgG antibodies, HA-13–263-His induced the lowest antibody responses against the HA protein. Detection of the IgG subtypes indicated that HA-13–263-Fdc and HA-13–263-Fc proteins induced similar higher levels of IgG1 and IgG2a than HA-13–263-Fd-His, while HA-13–263-His elicited the lowest level of IgG1 and IgG2a in the vaccinated mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053568-g006">Fig. 6C and D</xref>). However, PBS control only induced background level of IgG antibody responses and subtypes (
