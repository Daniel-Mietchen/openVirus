<p>The purified proteins were first analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot as previously described 
 <xref rid="pone.0053568-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0053568-Qi1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Briefly, the proteins were either non-boiled or boiled at 95°C for 5 min and separated by 10–20% Tricine gels (Invitrogen), which were then stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis. After blocking with 5% non-fat milk in PBST overnight at 4°C, the blots were incubated with a HA1-specific mAb (1∶500) developed in our laboratory for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes, the blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1∶5,000, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. Signals were visualized with ECL Western blot substrate reagents and Amersham Hyperfilm (GE Healthcare).
