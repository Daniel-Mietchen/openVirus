<p>Virus titers were detected as previously described

 <xref rid="pone.0053568-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Briefly, lung tissues from euthanized mice were aseptically removed and homogenized in minimal essential medium (MEM) plus antibiotics to achieve 10% (w/v) suspensions of lungs. In 96-well cell culture plates, ten-fold serial dilutions of samples were added to monolayers of MDCK cells in quadruplicate and allowed to absorb for 2 h at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Supernatants were then removed and replaced with MEM plus antibiotics, and MDCK cells were incubated as above for 72 h. Viral CPE was observed daily, and virus titer was determined by HA test. For the HA test, 50 µl of 0.5% turkey red blood cells (Lampire Biological Laboratories, Pipersville, PA) were added to 50 µl of cell culture supernatant and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Wells containing HA were scored as positive. The virus titer was calculated by the Reed and Muench method and expressed as Log
 <sub>10</sub>TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/g of lung tissues.
