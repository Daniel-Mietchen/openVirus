<p>Five groups of female BALB/c mice at 6–8-weeks were respectively s.c. vaccinated with 20 µg/mouse of recombinant proteins containing HA-13–263 of AH/1 fused with Fc (HA-13–263-Fc), Fd (HA-13–263-Fd), Fd plus Fc (HA-13–263-Fdc) or without Fd and Fc (HA-13–263-His), plus adjuvant, and boosted twice at 3-week intervals. Vaccinated mice were intranasally (i.n.) infected with 50% lethal dose (5 LD
 <sub>50</sub>) of VN/1194 (clade 1) or SZ/406H (clade 2.3.4) H5N1 virus, respectively, at 10 days post-last vaccination. Infected mice were observed daily for 14 days for the clinical signs, including body weight loss, and survival rate was accordingly calculated. Mice that lost greater than 25% of body weight were euthanized. Five mice per group were sacrificed on day 5 post-challenge, and lung samples were collected for virological analysis. All of the vaccination, infection, and euthanasia procedures were performed under anesthesia with isoflurane, and lung tissue harvest was performed only after the mice have been euthanized.
