<p>Collected mouse sera were analyzed for HA-specific antibody responses by ELISA as described previously 
 <xref rid="pone.0053568-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates were respectively precoated with truncated HA1 protein fragments or full-length HA protein (eEnzyme, Gaithersburg, MD) overnight at 4°C and blocked with 2% non-fat milk for 2 h at 37°C. Serially diluted mouse sera were added to the plates and incubated at 37°C for 1 h, followed by four washes. Bound antibodies were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1∶2,000, Invitrogen), anti-mouse IgG1 (1∶2,000, Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) or anti-mouse IgG2a (1∶2,000, Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37°C. The reaction was visualized by substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Invitrogen) and stopped by 1N H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>. The absorbance at 450 nm (A450) was measured by ELISA plate reader (Tecan, San Jose, CA).
