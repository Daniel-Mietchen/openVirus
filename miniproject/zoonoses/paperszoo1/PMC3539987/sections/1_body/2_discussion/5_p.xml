<p>It is believed that proteins capable of maintaining native trimeric or oligomeric structure of HA would likely induce stronger immune responses than monomers

 <xref rid="pone.0053568-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. To determine conformational structure covering the identified critical neutralizing region of HA1 in enhancing immune responses and cross-protective immunity, we first immunized mice using these fusion proteins and then compared antibody response and neutralizing antibodies in addition to the evaluation of cross-protection against two different strains of H5N1 virus in cell cultures 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in mouse models 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. It was found that HA-13–263-Fdc protein with the highest molecular weight oligomer induced the strongest neutralizing antibody responses and cross-protection against challenges by two tested H5N1 strains including clade 1 and clade 2.3.4, followed by lower molecular weight polymers HA-13–263-Fc (mainly dimer) and HA-13–263-Fd (mainly trimer). The monomeric HA-13–263-His protein induced much lower level of neutralizing antibody response and protection than the HA-13–263 proteins fused with Fd and/or Fc (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053568-g009">9</xref>). The above data indicate that while the trimeric HA-13–263-Fd-His protein may elicit stronger protection than the HA-13–263-His monomer, the oligomeric HA-13–263 with Fd and Fc promoted this protection. The Fc fragment in an immunogen can enhance its immunogenicity, possibly by prolonging half-life of the immunogen, or interacting with Fc receptor (FcR) on antigen presenting cells (APCs)

 <xref rid="pone.0053568-Martyn1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. The immunogen with both Fd and Fc can form an oligomer with higher molecular weight than the dimer formed by HA-13–263-Fc. Therefore, HA-13–263-Fdc may have even longer half-life than HA-13–263-Fc, thus demonstrating stronger effect on induction of immune responses. It is noted that neither Fc alone nor Fd alone is able to induce HA-specific antibody responses, and that none of the expressed HA proteins induced antibody responses against HAs of seasonal influenza A viruses including H1N1 and H3N2 (data not shown), further confirming the high specificity of our recombinant proteins to the HA of H5N1. Our results further demonstrated that influenza H5N1 HA-specific proteins with polymeric conformational structures may significantly enhance cross-protective immunity against divergent strains of H5N1 influenza virus infections
