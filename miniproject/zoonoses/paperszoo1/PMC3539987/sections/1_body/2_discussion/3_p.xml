<p>As a receptor binding and fusion protein, the HA of influenza virus plays an important role in initiating viral infection. The receptor-binding domain of H5N1 HA determines the species of sialic acid receptors in α(2,3) linkages

 <xref rid="pone.0053568-Yen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. HA, particularly its HA1 subunit, is the main region for the induction of neutralizing activity against influenza virus infection

 <xref rid="pone.0053568-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and can be used for development of subunit influenza vaccine. Indeed, we previously demonstrated that a recombinant protein containing the full-length HA1 of H5N1 could elicit neutralizing antibody responses in the immunized mice 
 <xref rid="pone.0053568-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, confirming that the HA1 subunit contains important neutralizing epitopes. However, recent study on the development of SARS vaccine has raised a serious concern about the safety of using the full-length S protein of SARS-CoV as a vaccine since the non-neutralizing regions in the S protein could induce harmful immune responses in the vaccinated animals 
 <xref rid="pone.0053568-Tseng1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Therefore, it is essential to identify the CND for designing an effective influenza vaccine containing the major neutralizing domain in HA1. We therefore constructed six truncated recombinant fragments covering partial or full-length RBD or other regions in HA1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053568-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) for immunization of mice. Although all six truncated protein fragments were able to induce strong HA1-specific antibodies in the vaccinated mice, only the one containing residues 13–263 covering full-length RBD induced a significantly higher level of neutralizing antibodies against pseudotyped H5N1 virus than other fragments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053568-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting that this fragment contains the CND in HA1. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the identified CND revealed high similarity among hundreds of H5N1 strains causing human and avian diseases (data not shown), suggesting that the identified CND has a high potential to be developed as a universal candidate vaccine particularly against H5N1.
