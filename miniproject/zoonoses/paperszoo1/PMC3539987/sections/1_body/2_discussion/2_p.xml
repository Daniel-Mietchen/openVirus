<p>Currently, a variety of vaccines have been developed specifically targeting H5N1 virus in the form of inactivated virus-, live virus-, DNA-, and viral vector-based vaccines, some of which have shown efficacy against virus infection in preclinical or clinical trials

 <xref rid="pone.0053568-Bodewes1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Reports have demonstrated that vaccination with drifted variants of avian H5 HA protein elicits a broadened antibody response that is protective against challenge with homologous or drifted live H5 influenza virus 
 <xref rid="pone.0053568-Santiago1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. A consensus-HA-based DNA vaccine is also seen to protect mice against divergent H5N1 influenza viruses 
 <xref rid="pone.0053568-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In addition, a live attenuated modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vector vaccine expressing influenza H5N1 HA induces substantial cross-clade protective immunity in vaccinated animals 
 <xref rid="pone.0053568-Hessel1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. A Vero cell-derived, whole virus clade 2 H5N1 influenza vaccine is now in phase I/II study for safety and immunogenicity testing in healthy adults in Hong Kong and Singapore, and shows high tolerance and immunogenicity after two vaccinations with induction of a cross-neutralizing antibody response 
 <xref rid="pone.0053568-Tambyah1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Nevertheless, because of the continual and frequent mutation of H5N1 virus, particularly the viral HA protein, currently available H5N1 vaccines are facing significant efficacy challenges against new virus strains, making it extremely important to identify critical neutralizing regions for utilization as targets to develop effective and safe vaccines against ever-changing divergent virus strains.
