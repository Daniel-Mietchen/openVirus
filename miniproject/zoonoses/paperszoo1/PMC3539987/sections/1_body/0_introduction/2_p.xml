<p>Among all influenza virus proteins, HA, a major antigen on the viral surface, serves as an important protein in inducing neutralizing antibodies and cross-protection 
 <xref rid="pone.0053568-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The HA-specific antibodies could neutralize infectivity of the HPAI N5N1 viruses by interacting with the receptor binding domain (RBD) or blocking conformational rearrangement associated with membrane fusion 
 <xref rid="pone.0053568-Han1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0053568-Ekiert1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. It has been reported that antibodies to virus HA protein mediate heterosubtype neutralizing responses to A/H5N1 viruses in healthy volunteers exposed to H5N1 
 <xref rid="pone.0053568-Garcia1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Animals vaccinated with HA DNA also show higher neutralizing antibody responses and/or better protection than NA, NP, or M2 DNA vaccines against challenges with homologous or heterologous H5N1 viruses 
 <xref rid="pone.0053568-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. A tri-clade DNA vaccine encoding HA of clade 0, 2.3.2.1 and 7.2 elicits broadly neutralizing antibody responses against H5 clades and subclades and protects mice against heterologous H5N1 challenge 
 <xref rid="pone.0053568-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Therefore, based on its strong ability to induce neutralizing antibodies and protection, HA is considered a primary target for designing effective vaccines against H5N1 virus infection.
