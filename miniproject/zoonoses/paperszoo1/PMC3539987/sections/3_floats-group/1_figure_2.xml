  <title>SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of expressed proteins containing truncated HA1 fragments.</title>
  <p>Protein samples were either boiled at 95°C for 5 min, or not boiled, followed by addition of 6× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining was then run (A), as well as Western blot (B) by using a HA1-specific mAb. The protein molecular weight marker (kDa) (Invitrogen) is indicated on the left.</p>
