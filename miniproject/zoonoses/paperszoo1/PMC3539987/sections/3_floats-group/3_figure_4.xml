  <title>Construction of protein fragments containing HA-13–263 with or without Fd or Fc and analysis of protein expression.</title>
  <p>(A) Proteins containing residues of HA-13–263 with Fc (HA-13–263-Fc), with Fd (HA-13–263-Fd-His), or without fusion with Fd and Fc (HA-13–263-His) were constructed. Purified proteins were either boiled at 95°C for 5 min, or not boiled, followed by detection of the expression by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (B), and Western blot (C) by using a HA1-specific mAb. The protein molecular weight marker (kDa) (Invitrogen) is indicated on the left.</p>
