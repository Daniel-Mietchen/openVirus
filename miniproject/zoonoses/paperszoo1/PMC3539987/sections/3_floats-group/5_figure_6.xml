  <title>Detection of IgG antibody responses and subtypes by ELISA in HA-13–263 protein-vaccinated mouse sera.</title>
  <p>PBS was used as the negative control. Ability of IgG binding to HA1 (HA-13–263-His) protein (A) and full-length HA protein (B) was detected using mouse sera from 10 days post-last vaccination. The data are presented as mean A450± SD of five mice per group at various dilution points. Ability of IgG1 (C) and IgG2a (D) antibodies to bind to HA-13–263-His protein was detected using sera from 10 days post-last vaccination. The data are presented as mean A450± SD of five mice per group at various dilution points.</p>
