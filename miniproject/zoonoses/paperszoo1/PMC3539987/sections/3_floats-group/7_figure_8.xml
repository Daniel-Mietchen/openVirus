  <title>Comparison of cross-protective activity of HA-13–263 proteins against lethal H5N1 virus challenge.</title>
  <p>PBS was used as the control. Survival rate (%) of mice vaccinated with HA-13–263 proteins challenged with lethal dose of H5N1 virus from VN/1194 (clade 1) (A) and SZ/406H (clade 2.3.4) (B). * indicates significant difference (
   <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05), respectively, between HA-13–263-Fdc and HA-13–263-His group, or PBS control, for VN/1194 virus, and between HA-13–263-Fdc, HA-13–263-Fc, or HA-13–263-Fd-His vaccination groups and HA-13–263-His group, or PBS control for SZ/406H virus. Percentage of body weight change (%) of HA-13–263-vaccianted mice after challenge with VN/1194 (C) and SZ/406H (D) H5N1 virus was shown.
