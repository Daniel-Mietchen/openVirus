  <title>Construction of recombinant truncated HA1 protein fragments fused with Fd and Fc.</title>
  <p>(A) Schematic structure of HA protein of A/Anhui/1/2005 (H5N1 HA). SP, signal peptide. FP, fusion peptide. HA1-Fdc protein was previously expressed covering HA residues +3–322 
   <xref rid="pone.0053568-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, corresponding to residues 13–325 of H5 numbering as described in the published literature 
   <xref rid="pone.0053568-Stevens1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, 
   <xref rid="pone.0053568-Sui1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, 
   <xref rid="pone.0053568-Weis1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. (B) Truncated HA fragments covering various lengths of HA1 were constructed by fusing HA1 fragments with Fd and Fc. Each fragment contains IL2ss signal peptide at the 5′ terminus for the purpose of leading expressed proteins to the culture supernatant. The predicted RBD region was indicated in black.
