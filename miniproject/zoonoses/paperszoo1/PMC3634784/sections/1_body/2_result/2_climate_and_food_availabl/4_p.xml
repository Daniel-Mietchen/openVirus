<p>We choose the ARIMAX(1,1,2) with TVDI because it has the lower fit RMSE. The biological meanings of the model is that the the current density of rodents depends on both past density of rodents and past three months of TVDI value. The fitted and predicted values of this model were plotted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061536-g004">Figure 4</xref>. The observed and predicted number of population density from the final model matched reasonably well for Changsha, as did the 1-year forecast. The MRPE of the model was 16.05% and the goodness-of-fit analyses showed no significant autocorrelation between residuals at different lags in the final model.
