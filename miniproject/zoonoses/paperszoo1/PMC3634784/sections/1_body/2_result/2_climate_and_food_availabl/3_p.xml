<p>We further fitted ARIMAX model with the lagged climate and land-surface variables as input series, and the results are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0061536-t002">Table 2</xref>. For these multivariate models, the best fit MRPE is obtained from ARIMAX(1,1,2) with TVDI as covariate and ARIMAX(1,1,2) model has the best AIC. Comparing the ARIMAX(1,1,2) with TVDI (lag-3) model with the baseline univariate model discussed previously (ARIMA(1,1,2)), we found that including the TVDI improve the fit RMSE by 14.36% and the prediction RMSE by 15.89% from the baseline model.
