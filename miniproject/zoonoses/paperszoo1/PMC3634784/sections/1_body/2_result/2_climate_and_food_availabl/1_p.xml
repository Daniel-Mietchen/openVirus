 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0061536-t001">Table 1</xref>, there was a positive correlation between monthly mean temperatures and monthly accumulative precipitation with population density of HFRS host, with the highest correlation coefficients having a lag of 5 and 1 months, respectively. NDVI was positively associated with density of HFRS host with a lag of 3 months. However, there was an inverse correlation between TVDI and rodent density.
