<p>Two indices that characterize habitat quality were extracted from monthly MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data from January 2004 to December 2011 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061536-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The MODIS data (MOD11A2 and MOD13A2) was acquired with a spatial resolution of 1000-m from the International Scientific Data Service Platform (

In this study, MODIS data for the study area were transformed to the UTM-WGS84 50N projection. The land use data are from the Second National Land Survey Data. NDVI and TVDI value for rice paddies were used to reflect the lushness of the vegetation, thus these indices are good indicators of the food available for rodent.
