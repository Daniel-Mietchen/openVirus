<p>The temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) has been widely used in soil moisture estimation 
 <xref rid="pone.0061536-Sandholt1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The TVDI is estimated using the following equation:

 </disp-formula>Where Ts is the observed LST at a given pixel, Ts
 <sub>min</sub> is the minimum land surface temperature (LST) for a given NDVI, defining the wet edge, a and b are parameters defining the dry edge, modeled as a linear fit to data (Ts
 <sub>max</sub> = a+bNDVI). The TVDI is higher for dry and lower for wet conditions and varies between 0 and 1.
