<p>The monthly rodents survey data was divided into two sets: one was used in the fitting process (parameter estimation), and another for prediction. We took the observations in the latest one year as the prediction period. Among the 96 observations in Changsha survey data, we used 84 points for fitting and 12 for prediction.
