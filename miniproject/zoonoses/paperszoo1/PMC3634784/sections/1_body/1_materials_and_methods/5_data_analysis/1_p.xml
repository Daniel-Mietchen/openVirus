<p>Time series analyses of monthly rodent data with climatic variables and food available were carried out using autocorrelation analysis and cross-correlation analysis to examine the seasonal and lagged effects in the data sets. The cross-correlation analysis was performed as follows: first, convert one of the series into white noise, and then the second series was filtered by the same filter before computation. The significance of the cross-correlations was assessed on the basis of its two standard error limits (significant at 0.05 level). Climatic variables that did not exhibit significant cross-correlations with the rodent data were excluded from further analysis.</p>
