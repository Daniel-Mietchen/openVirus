<p>In this study, which incorporates climatic input series is referred as ARIMAX 
 <xref rid="pone.0061536-Box1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, was used to examine the independent contribution of climatic variables and food available to HFRS host dynamics. SARIMA is the ARIMA model that incorporates seasonality, referred as SARIMA(p, d, q)(P, D, Q), where p indicates the AR order, d the differencing order and q the MA order. P, D and Q indicate the seasonal order of AR, differencing, and MA, respectively. Autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) were performed to analyze any random, stationary and seasonal effects on the time series data. The residuals were further inspected for autocorrelation through ACF and PACF. Goodness of fit was examined through calculated Akaikeâ€™s information criterion (AIC) and the mean relative prediction error (MRPE).
