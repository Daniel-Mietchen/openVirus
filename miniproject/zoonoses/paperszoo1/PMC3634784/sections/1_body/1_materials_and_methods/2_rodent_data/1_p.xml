<p>We conducted a density-of-rodents survey in the residential areas, industrial areas and fields where the rodents may haunt. Rodents of hantaviruses were trapped in Changsha every month from January 2004 to December 2011. There were 19 permanent trapping sites, and a total of 50, 376 traps were set from 2004 to 2011. At least 200 traps were placed at each trapping site each night and received in the morning, which is conducted over three consecutive nights: one trap every 5 meters in each row with 50 meters between rows. We used the “Relative rodent density” to describe the combined effect of rodent density:
