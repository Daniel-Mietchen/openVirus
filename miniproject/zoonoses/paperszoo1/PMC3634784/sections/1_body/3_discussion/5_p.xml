<p>In conclusion, this study suggest that antecedent patterns of food supply were the key determinants of the HFRS host population in Changsha, China. The forecasting model of this study provides an predictive capacity for potential HFRS epidemics, which can give health authorities sufficient time to formulate plans, disseminate warnings, and implement public health interventions. There is also an urgent need for monitoring and predicting HFRS incidence to reduce the substantial disease burden caused by HFRS.</p>
