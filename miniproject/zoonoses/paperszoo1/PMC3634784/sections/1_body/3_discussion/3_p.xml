<p>Temperature vegetation dryness index is a complex variable, which reflect the moisture condition, temperature, lushness of the vegetation. We thought it was a good indicator of food available for the rodent, whereas it was directly influenced by climatic forcing 
 <xref rid="pone.0061536-Stenseth1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The TVDI was negatively associated with the density of HFRS host, because higher TVDI value represents dry conditions lead to the low biomass and food shortage. The population of rodents thus decrease. When the opposite happens, rodent population increase. The results of the current study are helpful in defining significant exogenous factors on the population dynamics of HFRS host. ARIMAX model with TVDI may provide an expert tool to predict the population fluctuations of HFRS host by making use of remote sensing tools and climatological data. However, Changsha is located in the humid subtropical climate area, the laws between rodents and TVDI need to be further investigated in other areas.
