<p>The significant variables in the final ARIMAX model could offer a strong explanation for dynamics changes of HFRS host population. Climate variables were excluded from the final ARIMAX model, although climate series were significantly correlated with the host population. The question is then to identify the driving factors behind these fluctuations of rodent density, most rodent species responded directly to fluctuations in food available

 <xref rid="pone.0061536-Previtali1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, the densities of these rodent hosts were driven by changes in food resources 
 <xref rid="pone.0061536-Previtali2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The fluctuations of food availability can be linked to environmental influences, some of which can be related to climate change. Previous study found that food availability was closely associated with Southern Oscillation Index and NE winds 
 <xref rid="pone.0061536-Mills1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The food availability depended on the local climate, and then can decide carrying capacity in an area 
 <xref rid="pone.0061536-Amirpour1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Under optimal weather conditions, higher carrying capacity can afford bigger population size of rodent. The results indicated that weather may affect the rodent reservoir indirectly through its effect on the food available condition.
