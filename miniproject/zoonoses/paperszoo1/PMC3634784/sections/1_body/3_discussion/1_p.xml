<p>Through the use of ARIMA models, we first examined whether rodent density can be modeled as a univariate (S)ARIMA. The results indicated that the ARIMA was capable of forecasting 1-step ahead future rodent density relatively well. The best univariate model is ARIMA(1,1,2), where rodent density depends on density in previous one month. In the ARIMAX models, we found that TVDI for rice paddies is a significant predictor for rodent density in Changsha. A key finding from this study was that food supply is an important predictor of the rodent population dynamics of the host in central China. The results clearly demonstrated that host density of HFRS was well predicted by the climatic factors and food supply conditions and we found a consistent relationship between these factors with lags of 1â€“6 months and rodent density. The main natural reservoir of hantaviruses is rodent, human can be infected directly or indirectly through contact with rodents

 <xref rid="pone.0061536-Olsson2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Reservoir hosts are the potential indicator of hantavirus emergence 
 <xref rid="pone.0061536-Sauvage1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, increased rodent density increases the probability of human contact with rodents, and we can predict potential HFRS incident by monitoring rodent density. So this lead time is of particular importance in predicting the possible surge in host population and the following epidemics of HFRS.
