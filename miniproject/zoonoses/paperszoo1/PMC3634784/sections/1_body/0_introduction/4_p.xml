<p>The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of climatic variables and food available on the host density of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome using data from rodent host population dynamics, climatic variables and food available in Changsha. Firstly, time series analyses of monthly rodent data with climatic variables and food available were carried out using autocorrelation analysis and cross-correlation analysis. Secondly, built up Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to examine the independent contribution of climatic variables and food available to HFRS host dynamics. Finally, we forecasted the changed trend of the rodent population.</p>
