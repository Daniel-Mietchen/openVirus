<p>West Nile virus (WNV) was discovered originally in 1937 during a fever survey in the West Nile district of Uganda [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-viruses-05-02079">1</xref>] and has been classified immunologically within the Japanese encephalitis serocomplex in the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus,</italic> along with Japanese encephalitis in Asia, St. Louis encephalitis (SLEV) in the New World and Murray Valley in Australia. Historically, its distribution was limited to Africa and Asia, with occasional intrusions into southern Europe, possibly by migratory birds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-viruses-05-02079">2</xref>]. The subsequent arrival of this tropical African virus into the sophisticated concrete jungle of New York City (NYC) in 1999 was totally unexpected and immediately captured both media as well as scientific attention. The resulting public, veterinary and wildlife health impacts were unprecedented and brought together widely disparate groups such as the Nature Conservancy and the American Mosquito Control Association to discuss insecticide applications for intervention. New research and public health programs supported, in part, by Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity funding from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), expanded surveillance, testing and reporting programs that tracked the rapid invasion of the continental United States (

The resulting volume of research on WNV has been staggering and has exploited the recent proliferation of online health and other journals, as evidenced from a March 2013 search for PubMed titles containing ‘West Nile’ that returned 3033 results. This recent extensive data and associated literature has generated a series of excellent reviews that have summarized the virus in general [
