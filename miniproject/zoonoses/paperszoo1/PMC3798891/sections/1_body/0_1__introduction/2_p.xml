<p>The current review addresses aspects of the ecology and epidemiology of WNV that have received somewhat less attention, although redundancy of thought and content will be inevitable. The resulting synthesis benefited from discussions during recent meetings at the American Academy of Microbiology’s mini colloquium “FAQ: West Nile Virus” and at the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences meeting “Extreme Weather, Climate and Health: Putting Science into Practice”. My approach will focus first on how anthropogenic change in North America set the stage for the successful invasion and dispersal of WNV, and then on the importance of early season events including persistence and amplification for the onset of summer outbreaks. </p>
