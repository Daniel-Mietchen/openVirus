<p>Regardless of the causal mechanisms and projected rate of temperature change, the earth is becoming warmer, especially at northern latitudes, and these changes will facilitate vector-borne pathogen transmission. Epidemic transmission of WNV in the Canadian prairie provinces with the epicenter in Saskatchewan may serve to illustrate this scenario (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-05-02079-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Surveillance in Canada recorded epidemics during 2003 and 2007, years when the mean mid-summer temperature in Regina, Saskatchewan, averaged almost 10 °C above the previous 50 year average. This warming dramatically increased the duration of the transmission season when temperatures were above the 14.3 °C replicative threshold for WNV [

Although less dramatic, similar warming trends would be expected to elongate the transmission season and allow efficient transmission in cooler maritime habitats along the cool US West Coast or at higher elevations. In California, the infection of Steller’s Jays with WNV in the Lake Tahoe area at &gt;1900 m [
