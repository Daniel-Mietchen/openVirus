<p>At present, options for public health intervention appear limited to surveillance directed prevention or emergency responses by organized mosquito control agencies. Surveillance is needed to monitor WNV activity levels within the basic bird-
 <italic>Culex</italic> transmission cycle to anticipate when and where tangential transmission to humans is likely to occur. The ‘fiscal cliff’, the ‘sequester’ and related national financial problems have combined to seriously alter the US budget devoted to arbovirus surveillance at the national and state levels and thereby direct timely control. WNV has seriously impacted human, animal and wildlife health and cost the US hundreds of millions of dollars in medical costs and emergency intervention. The virus is now firmly established throughout the continental US, remains capable of widespread resurgence as seen in 2012, and most likely will continue to recrudesce whenever environmental conditions support efficient transmission. However, WNV will most assuredly not be the last invasive or re-emerging arbovirus that public and veterinary health agencies have to cope with. This is especially problematic, because most current surveillance systems target laboratory testing specifically for WNV. Although this allows for high throughput diagnostics useful for intervention decision support, these programs will not find what they are not looking for—
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, other viruses. As with WNV, the establishment of other exotic mosquito vectors, such as 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> in the Central Valley of California and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> throughout the Eastern USA and now Los Angeles elevate the risk for the successful introduction of associated viruses, such as dengue or chikungunya, that have resurged globally and have been repeatedly introduced by travelers within the US [
