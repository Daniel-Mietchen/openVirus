<p>West Nile virus is perhaps the widest distributed arbovirus globally, being now found on all the continents except Antarctica and from tropical to north temperate latitudes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-05-02079-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Like many microbial pathogens, the historical distribution and apparent dispersal of WNV may be confounded by resources and methods available for detection. However, since its initial isolation in Uganda, WNV seems to have spread and/or been initially reported from outbreaks throughout Africa in the 1950s and 1970s, India during the 1950s, the Mediterranean region and Eastern Europe during the 1990s [

In contrast, ‘virgin soil’ transmission such as seen in eastern Europe, Greece and the United States has produced clinically severe neuroinvasive disease in non-immune older age groups [
