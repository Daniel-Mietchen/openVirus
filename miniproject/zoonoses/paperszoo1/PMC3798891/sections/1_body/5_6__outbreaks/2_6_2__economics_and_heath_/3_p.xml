<p>Elsewhere in the USA, mosquito control programs frequently are a part of local health departments, and therefore focus and funding is often diverted by complex and changing health priorities. Here, outbreak response may be delayed, because skeletal surveillance may not recognize the intensity of amplification and limited resources are available for prompt intervention. Emergency control delayed until a marked increase in human disease incidence is recognized, typically is too late to protect much of the public as well as limit avian infection. The following season surveillance and control typically attracts more fiscal support, but with elevated avian immunity and enhanced control, repeat outbreaks rarely ensue [

Again, with waning transmission and health impact, resources become diverted and avian populations recover, setting the stage for subsequent outbreak transmission, similar to as observed in Dallas, TX, and elsewhere during 2012. Continued enzootic surveillance remains the only method of detecting amplification and directing timely intervention to protect the public health.
