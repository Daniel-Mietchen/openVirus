<p>The extent and type of mosquito control also may impact outbreak evolution and patterns. In California, most mosquito control districts employ surveillance directed larval treatments, thereby continually pressuring vector populations and reducing adult abundance. Although these methods and improved water management seemed to have eliminated WEEV and SLEV, WNV has remained a public health problem, since its introduction during 2003. Different agencies in different areas of the state respond to surveillance data differently, producing different patterns of virus recurrence and human infection (

In Los Angeles, for example, aerial adulticide applications are almost impossible, because of the number of large airports and complex air traffic control issues, and ground applications are complicated by traffic problems. Here, districts respond by public education and enhanced larvicide applications, but these activities seem to allow avian flock immunity to increase and perhaps preclude amplification during years immediately subsequent to outbreaks [

In contrast, in Sacramento, the mosquito control program responds rapidly to escalating risk by extending surveillance to delineate the spatial extent of transmission and then by focused aerial adulticide applications to interrupt transmission. These applications seem effective in reducing transmission to humans [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B157-viruses-05-02079">157</xref>] and perhaps to avian hosts as well, thereby precluding elevated flock immunity and allowing effective virus amplification during subsequent years. A similar pattern was observed in Bakersfield, but there the bifurcation of mosquito infection rates and human cases was related to rapid ground adulticide response to surveillance data as well as an intensive program to locate and treat unmaintained swimming pools. These activities seem to have lowered mosquito abundance and the probability of human infection, but have not altered mosquito infection rates.
