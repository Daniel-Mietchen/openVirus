<p>The mechanisms and exact timing of the onset of vernal transmission remain obscure, because transmission is inefficient and infrequent, amplification slow, and virus difficult to detect at these low levels. In California, for example, WNV can be detected in an occasional dead bird or mosquito pool in December or January, followed by a period of cessation until May or June [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B122-viruses-05-02079">122</xref>]. However, it cannot be certain if these occasional positive specimens represent the elongated end of the fall transmission season, winter persistence or transmission, or the onset of new vernal transmission events. For 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes that enter winter diapause, the transition in photoperiod after the winter solstice appears to stimulate juvenile hormone production and ovarian development to pre-hosting arrest at ovarian stage I-II, characterized by associated changes in ovarian morphometrics [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B139-viruses-05-02079">139</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B140-viruses-05-02079">140</xref>]. This transition from diapause to the arrest stage and the initiation of host-seeking appears to be temperature dependent, occurring shortly and abruptly after the winter solstice in late December at southern latitudes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B141-viruses-05-02079">141</xref>], but later and more gradually at more northern latitudes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B142-viruses-05-02079">142</xref>]. It is not clear, however, if diapause termination actually marks the onset of transmission, because vertically infected and overwintering mosquitoes typically contain minimal amounts of virus that is often difficult to isolate [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B118-viruses-05-02079">118</xref>], indicating that warming and considerable replication is necessary prior to transmission. Viral replication may be exceedingly slow at this time, because few hours/days exceed the 14.3 Â°C developmental threshold for WNV, resulting in minimal heat accrual until summer hot spells and the increase in nocturnal temperatures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B143-viruses-05-02079">143</xref>]. By comparison, 
 <italic>Culex</italic> quiescence is not constrained by photoperiod and winter blood feeding activity may be facilitated by warm periods. However, a concurrent autumnal/winter cessation and winter/vernal initiation of WNV transmission seems to occur at southern latitudes such as Los Angeles, where 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> is the primary vector [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B144-viruses-05-02079">144</xref>], because temperatures are too cold for efficient WNV transmission. In general, transmission in most of the USA seems constrained until the warm summer period, most likely due to the thermodynamics of transmission efficiency described above. Although the slopes of the amplification curve was generally similar [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-05-02079-f004">Figure 4</xref>], peak activity occurred a month earlier in the hot dry desert of Coachella Valley than in cool coastal Los Angeles.
