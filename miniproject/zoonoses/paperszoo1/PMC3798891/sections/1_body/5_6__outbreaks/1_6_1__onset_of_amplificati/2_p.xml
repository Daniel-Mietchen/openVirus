<p>Alternatively and coincidental with the initial detection of WNV during May/June, virus may persist in avian hosts and then recrudesce in association with the nesting season. Temperatures at this time are usually sufficient for virus replication in the mosquito host, thereby enabling the possibility of transmission and resulting amplification. However, as discussed previously, additional research is needed, because there are no data to indicate that infections in previously infected birds ever recrudesce and develop viremias sufficient to infect host-seeking
