<p>The level of virus activity during the previous transmission season seems to dictate the probability of viral amplification to outbreak levels. During the invasion phase of the on-going epidemic, WNV typically assumed a three year cycle, with quiet invasion during year one, explosive amplification to outbreak levels during year two, and subsidence during year three [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-viruses-05-02079">21</xref>]. The frequency with which this pattern has been repeated led some investigators to suspect that WNV was actually introduced into NYC in 1998, but was not recognized until 1999. Subsidence during year 3 actually may commence during outbreak year 2 due to the accrual of herd immunity in maintenance host populations such as House Finches and House Sparrows and the depopulation of amplification hosts such as American Crows [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B144-viruses-05-02079">144</xref>]. In Los Angeles, for example, the termination of the 2004 outbreak appeared to commence during September 2004, soon after antibody prevalence in peridomestic passerines collectively exceeded 25% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B144-viruses-05-02079">144</xref>]. Subsequent Los Angeles outbreaks during 2008 and 2011 followed periods when avian ‘flock’ (aka herd) immunity decreased to less than 10% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68-viruses-05-02079">68</xref>]. In agreement, the large almost nationwide resurgent WNV outbreak during 2012, with the epicenter in Dallas, TX, followed several years of minimal virus activity that undoubtedly allowed flock immunity to be diluted by recruitment and the natural turnover rate of immune birds. Using genetic methods, this subsidence period optimistically was heralded as the waning of the current epidemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B145-viruses-05-02079">145</xref>]. The size and immunity level within competent avian host populations is especially critical during early spring, because at this time 
 <italic>Culex</italic> feed almost exclusively on passerine birds [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B147-viruses-05-02079">147</xref>] that were potentially exposed to virus during the previous season. In addition, immune parental birds transfer immunity to nestlings through the egg further preventing or at least delaying transmission. So even though host selection favors feeding on competent hosts during the spring period, low flock immunity levels seem critical for efficient virus transmission and amplification [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68-viruses-05-02079">68</xref>]. Delay until naïve nestlings are available seems to retard amplification until summer thereby inhibiting large outbreak generation [
