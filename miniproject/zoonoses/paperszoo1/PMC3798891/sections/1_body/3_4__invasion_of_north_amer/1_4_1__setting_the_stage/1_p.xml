<p>The colonization of NA by Europeans greatly changed the landscape and markedly increased the size of the human population. Intensive agriculture and the need for construction supplies fragmented the deciduous forests. Points of trade by sailing ships produced cities along the eastern seaboard and then along major waterways. With a large number of humans and animals concentrated into permanent urban settings, waste disposal became a major problem and produced refuse dumps and highly eutrophic municipal water systems for waste and storm run-off. With urbanization came a reduction in avian species diversity [

In addition, House Sparrows, European Starlings and Rock Doves were intentionally released into Eastern NA and rapidly exploited the expanding urban environment throughout the continent. This reduction in urban avian diversity [
