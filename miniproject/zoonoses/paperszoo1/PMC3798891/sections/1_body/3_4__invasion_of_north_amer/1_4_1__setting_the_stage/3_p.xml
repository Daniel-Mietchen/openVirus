<p>This mixture of urban birds and peridomestic mosquitoes living in close proximity to humans created situations conducive for the transmission of arboviruses, especially SLEV. Although this virus is apparently endemic to the New World, it was not discovered until 1933, when there was a large outbreak of human disease associated with lower socio-economic housing, poor waste water management, large
