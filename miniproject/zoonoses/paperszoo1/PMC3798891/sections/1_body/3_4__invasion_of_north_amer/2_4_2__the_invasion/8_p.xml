<p>Landscape heterogeneity has had a marked impact on the distribution of vector and avian host populations and therefore WNV transmission. Epidemiologically, the greatest number of cases have been detected in urban areas where the most peoplereside, whereas the risk of infection as expressed by case incidence has been highest in rural areas with low human population density, such as the northcentral prairie states. Frequently, the distribution of urban human cases has been delineated spatially by high mortality rates among periurban or urban corvid populations, especially American Crows [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102-viruses-05-02079">102</xref>]. All corvids produce elevated viremias and frequently succumb from infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103-viruses-05-02079">103</xref>], and this provides a virus source for effective vector infection, especially when the birds are ill, less mobile and less defensive. In one case control study, residences with dead corvids reported on their property were 19.8 times more likely to also have infected mosquitoes than residences without dead corvids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104-viruses-05-02079">104</xref>]. When the number of dead American Crows around a large communal roost in Los Angeles was delimited spatially using SatScan statistics, the 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> minimum infection rate was 8.0 per 1000 within areas circumscribed by dead corvid clusters as opposed to 2.1 per 1000 outside of these clusters; also, only 41% of the human population resided within clusters of dead corvids, but 75% of the laboratory confirmed human cases were reported from within these clusters (incidence within = 5.9, without = 1.3 per 100,000 population, respectively) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B105-viruses-05-02079">105</xref>]. As pointed out previously, transmission within these urban areas with reduced avian species richness tends to be more efficient than in rural areas with high species richness, because more blood meals are taken from competent hosts. This was shown in recent surveys of 
 <italic>Culex</italic> blood meal host diversity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67-viruses-05-02079">67</xref>], where blood meal host species richness in urban Los Angeles was half that observed in rural wetlands near Sacramento, where almost every other blood meal came from a different host species, including many that were incompetent hosts for WNV.
