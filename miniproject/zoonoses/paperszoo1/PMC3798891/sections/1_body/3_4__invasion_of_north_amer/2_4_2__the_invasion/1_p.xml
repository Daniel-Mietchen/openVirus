<p>Prior to its discovery in NA, WNV had been a virus on the move, with small outbreaks recorded in the Mediterranean region and epidemics of neuroinvasive disease documented in Romania [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79-viruses-05-02079">79</xref>] and Russia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-viruses-05-02079">9</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80-viruses-05-02079">80</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81-viruses-05-02079">81</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82-viruses-05-02079">82</xref>]. In 1998 there was an outbreak of WNV in Israel, and this virus strain was similar genetically to that introduced into NYC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40-viruses-05-02079">40</xref>]. There is frequent air travel between NYC and Israel, and it was most likely that the virus was introduced by this frequent and repeated route of travel.
