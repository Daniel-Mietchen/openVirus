<p>Similar to the SLEV outbreak in 1933, multiple factors in NYC during 1999 set the stage for the successful invasion and outbreak of WNV. The decrease in endemic arbovirus activity in prior years resulted in the closing of arbovirus surveillance and most mosquito control programs in the NYC area, except for a small program on Long Island retained to control pestiferous salt marsh mosquitoes. The summer and especially July of 1999 was the hottest in NYC recorded history and was associated with below average rainfall. These weather conditions were conducive for the production of large numbers of

Warm weather typically speeds larval mosquito development, shortens population generation times and thereby accelerates growth of mosquito populations. In addition, the commensal avian population and most of the human population had no immunity against flaviviruses.
