<p>Despite a large scale adulticiding response, WNV managed to overwinter successfully and then spread slightly in the NE USA during the following summer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-05-02079-f002">Figure 2</xref>). During late summer/fall of 2000, the virus seemed to have been carried by southbound migrant birds along the Atlantic flyway, by-passing the midAtlantic states, and becoming established in the Southeast, especially Georgia and Florida, where it amplified during 2001, again in association with hot, dry conditions. However, the peak of the epidemic occurred following years after the virus invaded the west, with epicenters in Chicago and New Orleans in 2002, Colorado in 2003 and Los Angeles in 2004, where

 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus,</italic> respectively, were the likely vectors. A hallmark of all these urban epidemics were the huge numbers of American Crows and other bird species dying from infection [

Interestingly, like humans, most equine infections seemed to remain subclinical, resulting in high levels of acquired immunity [
