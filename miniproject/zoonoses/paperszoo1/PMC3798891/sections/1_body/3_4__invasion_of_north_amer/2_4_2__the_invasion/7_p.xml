<p>Climate variation has been an important factor historically driving SLEV and now WNV transmission to outbreak levels. Typically elevated transmission has been associated with hot, dry weather events [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92-viruses-05-02079">92</xref>]. In urban landscapes with a large percentage of impervious groundcover, high rainfall volumes result in rapid run-off that typically ‘flushes-out’ urban waste water systems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93-viruses-05-02079">93</xref>]. Conversely, drought conditions stimulate residence and park landscape irrigation that creates a low volume ‘curb drizzle’, daily refreshing underground systems and catch basins without flushing-out developing larval mosquito populations. In addition, drought conditions may force avian populations into suburban areas where water is more freely available, thereby bringing competent hosts into contact with competent urban vectors. Drought conditions typically are associated with elevated temperatures (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94-viruses-05-02079">94</xref>]. Because mosquitoes are poikilotherms, their body temperature approximates ambient conditions, although 
 <italic>Culex</italic> may behaviorally adjust their temperature by seeking daytime refugia and altering evening activity rhythms [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96-viruses-05-02079">96</xref>]. In general, warm temperatures increase the rate of larval development and reduce generation time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97-viruses-05-02079">97</xref>], thereby rapidly increasing mosquito population size, and reducing the duration of the gonotrophic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98-viruses-05-02079">98</xref>] and the extrinsic incubation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99-viruses-05-02079">99</xref>] periods. Therefore, during warm temperature anomalies, there frequently are more female mosquitoes, taking more frequent blood meals, thereby increasing host-vector contact and the probability of infection, and infected females are able to transmit virus earlier in adult reproductive life [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100-viruses-05-02079">100</xref>] than during cooler seasons. The dramatic shortening of the extrinsic incubation period by warming temperature also compensates for the concurrent decrease in adult survival with warming temperature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101-viruses-05-02079">101</xref>]. The impact of warm temperature has been most noticeable in the US prairie states where the incidence of human infection markedly increases during warm weather anomalies, such as experienced in 2012 (
