<p>During the summer of 1999, large numbers of American Crows were observed dead and dying in and around NYC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83-viruses-05-02079">83</xref>], and exotic birds from collections at the Bronx zoo were dying [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20-viruses-05-02079">20</xref>]. A virus isolated from a deceased Chilean flamingo grouped with lineage 1 of WNV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40-viruses-05-02079">40</xref>]. Interestingly, the NY99 virus strain, as well as multiple isolates from outbreaks in Europe, carried the T249P mutation in the NS3 region of the viral genome that was associated experimentally with elevated viremias and 100% mortality in American Crows [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57-viruses-05-02079">57</xref>], but not necessarily other corvids. Concurrently, a small cluster of neuroinvasive disease cases was recognized and diagnosed serologically, initially as SLEV, and then as WNV. Although the actual mechanism or date of WNV introduction probably will never be known, it seems likely that the virus was introduced by air traffic from Israel. Humans and equines (that also travel frequently by air) are considered to be ‘dead end’ hosts for the virus; however, some 
 <italic>Culex</italic> can infrequently become infected after feeding on fairly low doses of WNV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84-viruses-05-02079">84</xref>]. Alternatively, mosquitoes often are inadvertently transported on aircraft that are not routinely and thoroughly dis-insected. There also is a lucrative trade in smuggled pets, so multiple routes of introduction may have been potentially possible.
