<p>During 2002, WNV acquired another mutation, E159A in the envelope region of the genome, that rapidly replaced the invading NY99 genotype. This strain, known in the literature as WN02, appeared to enhance 
 <italic>Culex</italic> transmission by allowing the virus to invade the salivary glands sooner after infection than the NY99 strain, especially under warm temperatures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89-viruses-05-02079">89</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90-viruses-05-02079">90</xref>]. Therefore, the virus that invaded the western USA contained both the NS3 mutation causing high viremias and mortality in American Crows and the E mutation that may have enhanced 
 <italic>Culex</italic> transmission, as well as other genetic differences whose functions were not well understood [
