<p>The rapid dispersal of WNV throughout the New World from NYC to Los Angeles and from Saskatoon, Canada, to Buenos Aires, Argentina, was unexpected, demonstrated the inability of public health interventions to contain an invading vector-borne zoonoses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106-viruses-05-02079">106</xref>], and may have occurred even faster than recorded by surveillance programs, based on an analysis of genetic change in time and space among available isolates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27-viruses-05-02079">27</xref>]. Long distance movement of WNV initially was attributed to migratory birds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28-viruses-05-02079">28</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29-viruses-05-02079">29</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-viruses-05-02079">30</xref>], and in support, viremic migrants were collected repeatedly during southbound flights from temperate transmission foci [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55-viruses-05-02079">55</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58-viruses-05-02079">58</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107-viruses-05-02079">107</xref>]. In contrast, few infected birds were detected during northbound flights from the tropics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107-viruses-05-02079">107</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108-viruses-05-02079">108</xref>], thereby questioning this as a mechanism of rapid east to west movement. In addition, although evidence of WNV presence has been reported repeatedly in the Neotropics and Caribbean [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-viruses-05-02079">9</xref>], foci of human or equine disease have not been detected, indicating limited amplification to levels allowing tangential transmission, and therefore a limited source of virus to be inserted into northbound migrants. Subsequent modeling studies indicated that rapid east-west dispersal could result from post-nesting movement by resident birds and perhaps host-seeking by mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109-viruses-05-02079">109</xref>]. During 2004, for example, the movement of WNV from the Los Angeles Basin across the Tehachapi Mountains and into the Central Valley of California occurred after the arrival of Neotropical migrants, but concurrent with post-fledging dispersal by resident birds such as House Finches [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110-viruses-05-02079">110</xref>]. Mosquito movement by prevailing storm tracks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B111-viruses-05-02079">111</xref>] also would not seem important for east-west WNV dispersal, because weather fronts in NA typically move from west to east and opposite to the dispersal direction of WNV. An unknown was the possible role of commerce moving infected mosquitoes by ground or air transport. The infection of a Los Angeles International Airport employee with WNV in 2002 before the detection of WNV in California by the surveillance program in 2003 may have indicated the long distance transport by an infectious mosquito.
