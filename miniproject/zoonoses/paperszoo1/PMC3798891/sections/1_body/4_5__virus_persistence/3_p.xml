<p>WNV also has been shown to persist as long term infections in avian hosts that survive acute infection. Viral RNA initially was detected in kidney and spleen tissues from multiple species of experimentally infected passerines that were necropsied 6–8 weeks post infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B122-viruses-05-02079">122</xref>]. Subsequent studies showed that RNA could persist for up to 8 months in both experimentally and naturally infected birds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B123-viruses-05-02079">123</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B124-viruses-05-02079">124</xref>], and that these infections may explain the long term persistence of high titered neutralizing antibody [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B125-viruses-05-02079">125</xref>]. In agreement, WNV RNA was detected repeatedly in the sera of some birds up to 7 weeks post-infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B126-viruses-05-02079">126</xref>]. In contrast, birds experimentally infected with SLEV rarely established persistent infections and neutralizing antibody titers frequently declined rapidly over time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B127-viruses-05-02079">127</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B128-viruses-05-02079">128</xref>]. Based on the frequency distributions of qRT-PCR Ct scores from kidney tissues tested for WNV from dead birds submitted by the public, chronic infections with WNV seem to occur frequently in nature, especially among House Finches, House Sparrows and American Robins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B129-viruses-05-02079">129</xref>]. The significance of these findings remains uncertain, because virus bound with antibody was not able to infect mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84-viruses-05-02079">84</xref>]. However, variation in immune status could play an important role in recrudescence. For example, experimental infection of Rock Doves with WNV showed that some birds developed intermittent viremias over time and that antibody titers increased following detection of infectious virus in sera [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B130-viruses-05-02079">130</xref>]. In agreement, imperfectly antibody-bound WNV was able to infect a low proportion of susceptible mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84-viruses-05-02079">84</xref>], indicating that immunosuppression related to co-infection or the stress of territoriality and nesting during spring could allow some virus to ‘escape’ and infect blood feeding mosquitoes. Other avian pathogens transmitted by 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. such as 
 <italic>Plasmodium relictum,</italic> somehow detect seasons and utilize a vernal recrudescence to renew summer transmission [
