<p>WNV persistence was achieved most likely either by long-term mosquito and/or avian infections. 
 <italic>Culex pipiens,</italic> the vector of WNV in the NYC area, is capable of entering a facultative diapause [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36-viruses-05-02079">36</xref>] and was well-adapted to surviving winter conditions. Previous experiments had shown that the F1 progeny of infected 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> females may become infected vertically [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B114-viruses-05-02079">114</xref>], thereby providing a mechanism for inserting virus into the next generation without these F1 females taking a blood meal. If these vertically infected females enter diapause/quiescence in response to cool temperature and shortening day length during late summer/fall, then this could provide the mechanism for infecting female mosquitoes collected WNV positive during winter [

The following spring when the weather warms, WNV theoretically replicates and these infected mosquitoes become infectious, thereby renewing the transmission cycle. Proof of principal was provided by laboratory experiments, where the F1 progeny of field WNV-infected 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> females were induced to enter diapause, diapause ‘terminated’ the following ‘spring’, and these F1 female progeny fed on hamsters that became infected [
