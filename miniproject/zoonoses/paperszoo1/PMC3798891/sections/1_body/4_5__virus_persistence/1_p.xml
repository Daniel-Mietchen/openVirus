<p>Establishment of WNV and its subsequent dispersal throughout the New World was contingent upon virus survival over temperate winters, when transmission is interrupted and cold conditions drive the mosquito vectors into diapause or quiescence. Successful overwintering of a tropical African virus in the cold temperate NE USA was not expected, especially since evidence in temperate Europe indicated that the virus did not typically persist between seasons and required re-introduction [
