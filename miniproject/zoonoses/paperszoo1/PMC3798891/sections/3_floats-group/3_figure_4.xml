 <caption>
  <p>Seasonal activity of West Nile virus in (
   <bold>A</bold>) Coachella Valley and (
   <bold>B</bold>) Los Angeles, Southern California summarized from 2003â€“2011. Graphs plot the total number of mosquito pools tested and positive for WNV per month. Mosquitoes were collected host-seeking at CO
   <sub>2</sub> traps or attempting oviposition at gravid female traps and therefore were reproductively active. Red arrows show months when there were no WNV positive pools.
