<p>Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an acute vector-borne viral zoonotic disease affecting domestic animals and humans (Davies and Martin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2006</xref>). The disease is caused by the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a member of the genus Phlebovirus of the family Bunyaviridae (Elliott 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1997</xref>; Elliott 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1990</xref>). The transmission of RVFV in domestic animals is either through bites from different species of infected mosquitoes, mainly the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> genera or by direct contact with infected animal tissues, bodily fluids and fomites, particularly if associated with abortions (Davies and Martin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2006</xref>; Soti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2013</xref>). Transmission of the virus to humans is thought to occur by arthropod vectors, aerosols of blood or amniotic fluid, or other direct contact with infected animals (Woods et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2002</xref>). The relative importance of each mode of transmission varies according to the stage of the epizootic: in the first stage, the bites of infected mosquitoes are the predominant mode of transmission whereas direct contact of animals with infected tissues (foetal or otherwise) may become predominant during the amplification stage of the epizootic (Pepin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>). In East Africa species which have been tested positive for RVFV using RT-PCR are 
 <italic>Aedes mcintoshi/circumluteolus, Aedes ochraceus, Aedes vexans, Aedes pembaensis, Aedes Pembaensis, Culex poicilipes, Culex bitaeniorhynchus; Culex quinquefasciatus, Culex univittatus, Cx. univittatus, Cx. Bitaeniorhynchus, Anopheles squamosus, Mansonia uniformis;</italic> and 
 <italic>Mansonia africana</italic> (Logan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1991</xref>; Sang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2010</xref>). Mosquito species identified to transmit RVFV in other parts of Africa include 
 <italic>Aedes juppi, Ae. caballus,</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. Linneatopennis</italic> in South Africa (MÃ©tras et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2013</xref>), 
 <italic>Culex pipiens, Aedes vexans, Ae. Ochraceus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. Dalzieli</italic> in West Africa (Fontenille et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>; Zeller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1997</xref>). Even though the distribution of these vectors differ from one part of Africa to the other, they all use the same type of breeding sites and also feed on domestic ruminants.
