<p>The Rift Valley fever virus is thought to be maintained in nature at least in part by trans-ovarial transmission in flood water by Aedes mosquitoes during excess rainfall leading to floods referred to as '
 <italic>dambos</italic>’ (Dighe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2010</xref>; Jost et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>; LaBeaud et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2007</xref>). In turn, it results into an abundance of vector mosquito species (Breiman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2008</xref>). Elfadil et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2006</xref>) showed a positive association between RVF outbreaks and a dense mosquito population, high rainfall and the presence of lakes and/or ponds. Between epidemic waves, RVF virus circulates at very low incidence without noticeable clinical manifestation, neither in human nor in animals (FAO EMPRES WATCH 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007</xref>). Rift Valley fever epidemics have been observed at irregular intervals of about 5–20 years (FAO EMPRES WATCH 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007</xref>; Ibrahim et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2008</xref>). Early entomological field investigations of the virus or increased activity of virus in the vector population is one of the key element in controlling RVF (Hall et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2012</xref>). In East Africa, RVF outbreaks are known to be closely associated with heavy rainfall events (Soti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2012</xref>). Therefore, the prediction of RVF occurrence should be accompanied by satellite measurements of global and regional elevated sea surface temperatures, elevated rainfall, and satellite derived-normalized difference vegetation index data (Anyamba et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2010</xref>). Also the assumed importance of temporary ponds and rainfall temporal distribution especially during inter-epidemic periods needs to be investigated for effective control strategies of the vectors. Currently the inter-epidemic infection of RVFV in domestic animals is increasingly being reported in different parts of Africa which in most cases passes undetected (Heinrich et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2012</xref>; Sumaye et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2013</xref>).
