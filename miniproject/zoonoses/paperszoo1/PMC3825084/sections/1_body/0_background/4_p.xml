<p>RVF causes storm abortions in pregnant animals and a high mortality approaching 100% in young animals (FAO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2000</xref>; Ikegami and Makino 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2009</xref>). Sheep are more susceptible with more effect than in other ruminants (Elfadil et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2006</xref>). In humans, RVF causes a severe influenza-like illness characterized by fever (37.8–40°C), headache, muscular pain, vomiting and extreme weight loss (FAO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2000</xref>; Mohamed et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2010</xref>) with mortality rate less than 2% (LaBeaud et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2008</xref>). The effects of infections on human health are usually greatest on herdsmen and farm workers who live in close proximity to their animals, veterinarians, abattoir workers and butchers as an occupational hazard by direct handling of infected animals and their products (Isaäcson
