<p>During the 2006â€“07 RVF outbreaks, some farmers went on eating meat without inspection and proper cooking that led to more human cases especially in some parts of Dodoma. This was due to their socio-cultural behaviour of eating meat not inspected or from dead animals. This calls further educational intervention at community levels. The limited knowledge of pastoral communities on risk practices including eating raw meat, raw milk, touching and herding aborted animals and consuming products from animals predisposes them to zoonotic diseases (Anyangu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>). On the other hand in some communities it was observed that human and animals shared the same housing that also predisposed them to zoonotic diseases. This has also been observed and associated as one of the risk factor for transmitting zoonotic diseases (including RVF) to human (Jost et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>; Swai et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2010</xref>). Hence more education is needed and interventions that will enable the community live in separate houses from animals.
