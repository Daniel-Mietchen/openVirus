<p>During the outbreak, the quarantine was not executed properly as pastoralists could still move their animals from one village to another to search for pastures. Also farmers were still selling animals to nearby country (Kenya) via unauthorized routes. The movement of animals from Tanzania to Kenya either for search of good pasture or for sale has been reported (Diallo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2000</xref>) to facilitate further spread of the disease to unaffected areas during the 2006â€“07 RVF outbreak. It was observed that good pastures were found in the low land areas where mosquitoes were also found in large numbers and facilitated the disease transmission. However, the short difference in time of occurrence of disease in different regions of Tanzania is an indication that, those foci of outbreaks were caused by other factors other than animal movement as it was also highlighted by (FAO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2000</xref>). The results also indicated that few farmers used dipping tanks and the majority used spray pumps to control vector borne diseases. Since some of the farmers owned large number of animals, it was not possible to effectively spray all of them. According to (Peter et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2005</xref>) and (Davies and Martin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2006</xref>) effective use of dipping tanks also reduces the magnitude of mosquito borne diseases like RFV.
