<p>The ever-present pitfall however, is relating the occurrence of infectious diseases in general and hantavirus infections in particular to one particular trigger, e.g., food availability. Climate change, for instance, is a likely facilitator but climate change is an ancient and ongoing process (Ruddiman, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B133">2003</xref>) that we experience through a narrow window in time. The environment seems a vital intermediary factor when it concerns pathogen transmission between carrier and host; which points to the possibility that the transmission rate is not only determined by carrier abundance or pathogen prevalence, but also by rodent ecology, virus survival, local climatic conditions, and human behavior (Lambin et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">2010</xref>). We have for most of the regulating factors – unfortunately – hardly an idea where we come from and where we are going to in this matter. Relationships between abiotic and biotic parameters, rodents, humans, and hantavirus infections are first and foremost highly complex and highly intertwined but – should we be able to evaluate them accurately – can be valuable for predicting hantavirus epidemics.
