<p>The effect of sex on the prevalence of infection remains unclear, as in some French studies males are more often infected (Deter et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2008a</xref>) but in others, no significant difference is found (Augot et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2008</xref>). Nevertheless, the behavior between males and females differs. Female territories are smaller than those of males, especially during the reproductive season (Mazurkiewicz, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">1994</xref>), and males are much more tolerant for territorial overlap (Augot et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2008</xref>). Compared to females, when males leave the nest, they traverse greater distances and could introduce the virus in virus-free rodent populations (Augot et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2006</xref>). Behaviors and social features are critical for understanding the persistence and the spread of hantavirus among rodents populations.
