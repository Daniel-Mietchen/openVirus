<p>As is the case for Belgium, hantavirus epidemics in France can probably not solely be related to mast cycles as outbreaks appear to be localized in foci when mast events are supposed to occur over large areas (Heyman et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2009c</xref>). The prevalence of the infection in rodents seems also linked to the habitat (Escutenaire et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2002</xref>; Olsson et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B119">2005</xref>; Zeier et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B172">2005</xref>). Forest environments seem more favorable for rodent infection than fragmented, heterogeneous landscapes as hedge networks (Guivier et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2011</xref>). Different factors can explain this difference. First, hedges are usually considered of a lower quality for food resources than adjacent forests (Guivier et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2011</xref>). Besides, hedge networks are more exposed to important variations in temperature, humidity, and UV radiations, altering the survival of the virus in the environment and the efficiency of indirect transmission (Guivier et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2011</xref>). In addition, the helminth community of bank voles is linked to the environment and was shown to be associated with PUUV infection. In particular, bank voles infested by 
 <italic>Heligmosomum mixtum</italic> were more often PUUV positive (Salvador et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B136">2011</xref>).
