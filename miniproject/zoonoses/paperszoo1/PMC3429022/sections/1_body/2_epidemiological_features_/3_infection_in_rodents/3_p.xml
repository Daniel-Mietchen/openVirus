<p>Transmission among the rodent populations occurs via excreta, i.e., saliva, urine, and feces, directly or indirectly, probably through aerosols. The voles may become infected through the sniffing of contaminated excreta marks, even if they avoid direct encounters. The virus remains active outside the host, allowing indirect transmission, without physical contacts with infectious rodents. PUUV can survive and remain infectious for 15 days at room temperature, and probably much longer in cold and moist environments (Kallio et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">2006a</xref>). Vertical infection seems improbable (Deter et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2008b</xref>) as well as the contamination from mother to progeny. Indeed, juveniles are protected during 2 or 3 months because of the transfer of maternal antibodies (Bernshtein et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">1999</xref>) and the dispersal from the natal site starts before. However, in case of high densities, the dispersal of bank voles is delayed until next spring and juveniles can get infected from their contaminated mother, after the disappearance of the maternal antibodies (reviewed in Deter et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2008a</xref>).
