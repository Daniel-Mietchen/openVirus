<p>The fluctuations of PUUV prevalence in the bank vole populations have generated multiple hypotheses. Some authors consider prevalence is linked, sometimes with a delay, to the density of the rodent reservoir (Davis et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2005</xref>). Other authors found that the seroprevalence is not always linked to the density of rodents but usually, higher numbers of seropositive bank voles are captured when the populations decrease from a peak year (Kuenzi et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">1999</xref>; Augot et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2008</xref>). In other surveys, PUUV seroprevalence and abundance of rodents are weakly linked (Augot et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2008</xref>).
