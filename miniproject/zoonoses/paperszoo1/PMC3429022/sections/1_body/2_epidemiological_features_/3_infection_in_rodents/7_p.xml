<p>In France, as more generally in Atlantic and continental Western Europe, mast events seem to be linked to hantavirus epidemics (Heyman et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2011</xref>). Here in comparison with Belgium several studies have shown that masting in the previous autumn increases food resources and improve the winter survival of rodents which start to breed earlier and can have a second litter, bringing high densities of rodents early in summer (Sauvage et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B139">2002</xref>; Vapalahti et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B164">2003</xref>). It appears that animals from the first litter, born in late winter or early spring develop rapidly and become fertile the same year whereas animals from the second litter, born late spring or mid-summer, become fertile only next year. The seroprevalence was significantly higher in animals from the first litter (48%) when compared to the second litter (8%; Augot et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2006</xref>). The high proportion of susceptible animals could favor a high level of PUUV circulation and a massive shedding of virus in the environment, source of rodent, and human infections (Bernshtein et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">1999</xref>; Escutenaire et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2002</xref>). In fact, the amount of virus shed during the first month of infection is far higher than during the consecutive chronic phase (Bernshtein et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">1999</xref>; Sauvage et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B138">2007</xref>). More than the global density, the number of newly infected voles, still in the acute phase of the infection, appears critical to lead to exceptionally high virus concentrations in the environment and thus human exposure and epidemics. In more stable populations, the low incidence of newly infected individuals could explain a lower contamination of the environment. This assumption could explain the presence of only sporadic cases outside the endemic area for hantavirus in France, whereas 
 <italic>M. glareolus</italic> is distributed nearly in all the territory. In brief, epidemics could occur in areas where multi-annual fluctuations of bank vole populations induce at the same time a high number of infected rodents and high proportions of those rodents in the acute phase of the excretion.
