<p>The national reference laboratory for hemorrhagic fevers (CNR) is in charge of hantavirus infection surveillance in France. The serological diagnosis relies on indirect immunofluorescence since 1982. In 1993, a confirmation with the research of specific IgM antibodies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been added (Le Guenno et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">1994</xref>). When a positive or a doubtful serological diagnosis is made by another laboratory, which is possible since 2002, a confirmation is systematically performed by the CNR, making the centralization of the results and the surveillance possible. In case of a positive laboratory result, a questionnaire is sent to the clinician of the patient in order to identify the risk factors. Later the Institut de Veille Sanitaire (IVS) analyses these data and provides public health recommendations.
