<p>Most of the cases are diagnosed in the endemic area (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) but sporadic cases are reported elsewhere (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). An infection has been proven using RT-PCR on a Belgian citizen who had been camping near Perpignan, in the Pyrenean mountains, in southern France. After investigations, this patient had no other risk factors than this stay in France (Keyaerts et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">2004</xref>). In the area of Paris, a retrospective study identified 14 cases in 1999 and 2000 (Lautrette et al.,
