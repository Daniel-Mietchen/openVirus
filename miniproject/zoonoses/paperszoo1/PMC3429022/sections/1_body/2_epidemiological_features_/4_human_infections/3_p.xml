<p>The annual number of hantavirus infections reported in France from 1987 to July 2010 is shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>. If 60 cases in average are diagnosed every year, with an increase during the last decade, the incidence varies greatly and epidemic years (in red in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) occur every 2–4 years. The increased number of cases reported in epidemic years is not a consequence of a better physician awareness leading to a greater number of analyses. In Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, the curve shows that the proportion of positive results among all the analyses is not diminished during epidemic years. Neither, the improvement in the diagnostic tools can explain the increase in the reported cases.
