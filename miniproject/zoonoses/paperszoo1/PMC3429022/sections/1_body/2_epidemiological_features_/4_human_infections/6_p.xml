<p>As previously seen, the risk for human infection is correlated with the prevalence of PUUV in the populations of 
 <italic>M. glareolus</italic> (Salvador et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B136">2011</xref>). In the Ardennes, the prevalence was 39% in the epidemic year of 2003 while it was 26.5% in 2002 and 29.9% in 2001. In addition, the number of 
 <italic>M. glareolus</italic> trapped was between twice and three times more in 2003 when compared with 2002 and 2001 (Mailles et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">2005a</xref>). As for the contamination within rodent populations, the amount of virus in the environment, linked with the number of recently infected rodents, is critical.
