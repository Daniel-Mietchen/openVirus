<p>In France, most of the HFRS cases are reported in the northeastern quarter of the country (Augot et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2006</xref>; Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In this endemic area, foci of hot spots are well known, more particularly in the Ardennes department, near the Belgian border, which historically accounts for 30â€“40% of the total number of human cases in France (Sauvage et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B139">2002</xref>).
