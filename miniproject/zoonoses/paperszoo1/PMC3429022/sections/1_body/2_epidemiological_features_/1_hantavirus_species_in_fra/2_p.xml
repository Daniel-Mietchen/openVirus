<p>Seoul virus, another pathogenic hantavirus, was detected in 2003 in rats captured near Lyon (Heyman et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">2004</xref>). Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing, two wild 
 <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> were found infected with a SEOV strain, most closely related to an Indonesian and a Cambodian wild-type strain (Heyman et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">2004</xref>). Human sera positive for SEOV antibodies have been reported in Europe using highly cross-reactive immunofluorescence assays, but have never been confirmed by reliable methods such as neutralization. Nevertheless, as opposed to Belgium, SEOV-neutralizing antibodies have been detected in the convalescent serum of a French patient suffering from HFRS (Lundkvist, personal communication).
