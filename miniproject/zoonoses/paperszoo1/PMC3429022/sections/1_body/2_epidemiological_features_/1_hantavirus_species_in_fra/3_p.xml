<p>More recently, TULV has been identified using RT-PCR in one vole (
 <italic>M. arvalis</italic>) trapped in the Department of Jura, close to the Swiss border (Artois et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2007</xref>). This report was confirmed later, with 6.5% (11/170) of 
 <italic>M. arvalis</italic> found seropositive for TULV (Deter et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2008b</xref>). Based on partial sequence of the M segment, TULV strains circulating in France were found to form a distinct lineage, close to strains isolated in central and Eastern Europe (Plyusnina et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B126">2007</xref>). TULV has not definitely been linked to human disease (Heyman et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2011</xref>).
