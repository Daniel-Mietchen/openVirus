<p>In France, PUUV is the most prevalent hantavirus species (Artois et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2007</xref>). As already explained in the Belgium chapter, this virus is closely associated with its natural reservoir host, the bank vole 
 <italic>M. glareolus</italic>, but the transmission to other dead-end hosts (including humans) remains possible (Deter et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2008a</xref>). During a survey in France, PUUV seropositive wood mice (
 <italic>A. sylvaticus</italic>) were detected during the peak of prevalence in bank voles (Sauvage et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B139">2002</xref>). PUUV was also serologically found in 0.3% (9/263) of the montane water voles (
 <italic>Arvicola scherman</italic>) captured in the Jura region during 2002, 2003, and 2004 (Charbonnel et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2008</xref>). Genetic analysis of S and M segments of French PUUV strains revealed their proximity with strains circulating in Belgium and Germany and also in Slovakia (Plyusnina et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B126">2007</xref>).
