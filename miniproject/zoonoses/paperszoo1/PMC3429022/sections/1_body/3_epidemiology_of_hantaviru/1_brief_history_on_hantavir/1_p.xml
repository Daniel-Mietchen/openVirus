<p>In Germany human hantavirus infections are characterized by a mild HFRS and were first published in 1985 (Zeier et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B171">1986</xref>) followed by sporadic descriptions in the early nineties of the last century (Gärtner et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">1988</xref>; Zeier et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B173">1990</xref>; Mettang et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B111">1991</xref>; Pilaski et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B124">1991</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B125">1994</xref>). An accumulation of hantavirus infections speculating to local hantavirus outbreaks were already postulated for 1983, 1990, and 1993 in different regions in Germany, e.g., in the Swabian Alb, Baden-Württemberg, including also sites for military maneuvers around Ulm (Clement et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">1996</xref>). These human cases were defined by clinical signs of the disease and/or serological evidence for hantavirus antibodies. However, detailed knowledge on the etiological agent such as virus isolates or sequence data on German hantaviruses were not available (Kulzer et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">1992</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">1993</xref>; Clement et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">1994</xref>). It still took 10 years until hantaviruses were characterized on the molecular level in Germany, i.e., the PUUV strain Berkel from an HFRS-patient (Pilaski et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B125">1994</xref>) and strain Erft from a bank vole collected ~70 km away from the area in North-Rhine Westphalia where this patient was infected (Heiske et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">1999</xref>). Finally, in the year 2001 in Germany clinically apparent hantavirus infections became notifiable to official health authorities due to the German Infection Protection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG). By definition, a combination of any of the following symptoms is indicative for HFRS and considered as a case-definition according to the Robert-Koch-Institute (RKI): acute onset of disease with temperatures &gt;38.5°C, back- and/or abdominal pains, headache, proteinuria, and/or hematuria, elevation of serum creatinine levels, thrombocytopenia, and oliguria or polyuria, respectively. The suspected disease is confirmed either serologically or directly through molecular-biological methods. However, the infectious agent can only be detected within the first few days of the disease during the viremic phase using RT-PCR. Thus, a negative RT-PCR result does not necessarily exclude an infection with hantavirus
