<p>As described earlier the viability of a hantavirus outside the host may be dependent on climatic factors such as temperature and moisture. Yet, additional factors such as UV radiation may also have an impact on virus tenacity. In experimental studies for appropriate inactivation of Hantaan virus the virus was effectively inactivated through UV irradiation in cell cultures and supernatants (Kraus et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">2005</xref>). Photochemical inactivation of alpha- and poxviruses was demonstrated in another study. Effective inactivation of the viruses was dependent on the type of photochemical used (e.g., 5-iodonaphthyl 1 azide or amotosalen) in combination with UVA (Sagripanti et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B135">2011</xref>). In the environment, it could be postulated therefore that high values of solar radiation may have an influence on the stability or occurrence of PUUV. In Germany, in the Bavarian Forest National Park in Lower Bavaria, it was shown that after adjusting for confounding factors such as elevation high values of mean annual solar radiation were associated with a decreasing PUUV prevalence in bank voles (Thoma, personal communication). This finding has yet to be shown in other hantavirus hot spots in Germany.
