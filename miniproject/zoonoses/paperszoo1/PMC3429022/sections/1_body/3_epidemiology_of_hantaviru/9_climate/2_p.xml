<p>Mild winters and springs may positively influence rodent survival rates and early food supply and thus affect rodent population dynamics. The density of the rodent population may well drive the distribution and prevalence of disease/associated agents in the rodent host. For 
 <italic>M. arvalis</italic> populations in the Eastern Federal States of Germany the impact of weather parameters in winter and early spring was revealed to be of some importance for outbreaks in the autumn. Data was collected over almost four decades but also indicated that there may exist regional differences of the impact of weather and that winter and early spring records only may manipulate extremely high and low outbreak risks (Imholt et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">2011</xref>). These results again indicate the complexity of the system and that not only one group of parameters might stimulate rodent populations and therefore associated pathogens. Besides for PUUV carried by bank voles some efforts have been started in order to understand the impact of weather conditions or climate on the oscillations in Germany. Data from 2001 to 2007 from Baden-Wuerttemberg showed that in 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2007 winter temperatures were above long-term averages and in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2007 spring temperatures exceeded long-term averages. The maximum winter temperature deviation was recorded in 2007 when reported human hantavirus cases in Germany rose to over 1,500 cases. In marked contrast, in 2006 winter temperatures were lowest as were cases of NE reported in Baden-Wuerttemberg (
 <italic>n</italic> = 17). Interestingly, as compared to other years between 2001 and 2007, in 2005 there also seemed to be a beech crop failure (Piechotowski et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B123">2008</xref>; Schwarz et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B147">2009</xref>). Human hantavirus prevalences may further be driven by the fact that human contact with rodent host abundance is increased when humans shift their recreational activities to bank voles’ environments during mild weather conditions, preferably in early summer (Schwarz et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B147">2009</xref>). Fluctuations in common vole population densities and thus prevalence of hantavirus in the rodent host may also be correlated with December snowfall, January sunshine duration, and snow fall in April (Ulrich et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B161">2008</xref>). Interestingly, as opposed to findings in Baden-Wuerttemberg in Lower Bavaria no significant link between winter and spring temperatures and elevated hantavirus prevalences could be corroborated, which again highlights the complex nature of hantavirus disease transmission (Thoma, personal communication).
