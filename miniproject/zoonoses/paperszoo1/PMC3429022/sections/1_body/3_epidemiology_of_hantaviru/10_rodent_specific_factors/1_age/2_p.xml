<p>Male bank voles are believed to be of greater risk of acquiring and spreading PUUV and thus play an important role in the dynamics of PUUV epidemics (Bernshtein et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">1999</xref>; Olsson et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B118">2002</xref>; Deter et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2008a</xref>). 
 <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> and 
 <italic>Calomys musculinus</italic> show a similar pattern regarding transmission of SEOV and Junin virus, respectively (Mills and Childs, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B114">1998</xref>). Especially in the reproductive season male animals are very mobile and have close contacts with other members of their species. The effects of aggression and wounding due to sexual activity of male animals during mating season on the dissemination of disease have been discussed, which may be considered as a driving force for hantavirus epidemics (Bernshtein et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">1999</xref>; Olsson et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B118">2002</xref>; Deter et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2008a</xref>; Tersago et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B158">2011b</xref>). In contrast to this observation, in rodents investigated in the Bavarian Forest National Park in Lower Bavaria the PUUV prevalence levels in males were not significantly higher than in females (Bernshtein et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">1999</xref>; Olsson et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B118">2002</xref>; Deter et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2008a</xref>). These findings suggest that there is at least in that region no gender specific affinity to the virus. However, local genetic differences in the bank vole population in this region may produce subpopulations, which render differently and gender-independent with regard to susceptibility to the virus. Various patterns of PUUV infection and resistance (tolerance) depending on different genetic variants of the TNF-Î± locus were for example discussed for bank voles in France and Germany (Guivier et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">2010</xref>). With regard to other hot spot regions in Germany no reliable data on gender exist and has yet to be shown in further longitudinal studies. Again, these findings highlight the complex nature of driving factors for hantavirus transmission and host ecology.
