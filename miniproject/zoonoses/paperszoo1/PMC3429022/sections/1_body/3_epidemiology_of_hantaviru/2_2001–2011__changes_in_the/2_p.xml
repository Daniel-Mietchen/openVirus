<p>Changes in the epidemiology of clinically apparent hantavirus infections in Germany therefore are characterized by a tremendous rise of cases in years 2005, and most notably in 2007 and 2010 but also by an appearance in so far unrecognized regions or in new urban areas. As already discussed in general a changed risk for hantavirus infections for humans may also be inferred from a change in behavior as the working population tends to shift recreational activities to natural settings. In 2005 an unusual outbreak in the cities of Cologne, Aachen, and Osnabr√ºck were recognized (Abu Sin et al.,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2007</xref>). In Cologne human cases were found close to a wooded city recreation area, an adjacent tennis park, and football stadium. In the forest city park, PUUV was found in high prevalence in the bank vole population and therefore some risk for human infections persists in this area (Essbauer et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2007</xref>; Ulrich et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B161">2008</xref>). In 2010 in the urban district of Stuttgart even 166 cases were registered (RKI,
