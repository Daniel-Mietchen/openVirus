<p>Since the beginning of the mandatory notification, approximately 200 HFRS cases are counted in non-epidemic years with an average incidence of 0.25 per 100,000 inhabitants. Local outbreaks have been reported in 2004 in the federal state of Bavaria (Essbauer et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2006</xref>; Schilling et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B142">2007</xref>) and in 2005 (Mailles et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">2005b</xref>; Heyman et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">2007</xref>) affecting regions in Lower Saxony (Ulrich et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B161">2008</xref>), North-Rhine Westphalia (Essbauer et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2007</xref>), and Bavaria (Mertens et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110">2009</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109">2011c</xref>). In 2007 a large outbreak occurred with 1,688 registered cases affecting the federal states Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Lower Saxony, and North-Rhine Westphalia (Heyman et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">2007</xref>; Koch et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">2007</xref>; Hofmann et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">2008</xref>; RKI, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2012</xref>). Further, in the year 2010 a record number of 2,017 cases was reached with outbreaks in the same federal states as in 2007 including also parts of Hesse (Faber et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2010</xref>; Heyman et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2011</xref>; Ettinger et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2012</xref>; RKI, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2012</xref>). The summary of annual cases is shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>. As described for France there exist some hot spot regions in Germany, i.e., several parts of Baden-Württemberg including the Swabian Alb, in Bavaria the Main-Spessart region and Lower Bavaria, in Lower Saxony the administrative district of Osnabrück (see Figure
