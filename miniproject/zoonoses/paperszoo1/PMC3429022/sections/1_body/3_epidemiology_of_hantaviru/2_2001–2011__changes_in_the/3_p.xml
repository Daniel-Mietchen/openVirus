<p>What do we know about seasonal patterns of hantavirus infections in Middle Europe? In general, Germany and other western European countries usually (2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2010) see a summer peak in human PUUV cases. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13</xref> shows the seasonal oscillations of hantavirus infections in Belgium and Germany illustrating the high variability of seasonal peaks for these two neighboring countries. This is in contrast to Fennoscandia (Finland and Scandinavia) where autumn and winter peaks occur (Piechotowski et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B123">2008</xref>; Evander and Ahlm, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2009</xref>). However in Germany in 2006 (very few cases), 2008, and 2009 winter peaks were obtained. Further, in the years 2003 (roughly, very few cases) and 2011 winter and summer peak were observed. In 2010 health authorities were aware of the steep rise of human infections in the winter months and early spring in the year and it was hypothesized that bank voles might move closer to human housings in winters with extreme cold conditions (Faber et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2010</xref>). In summary, these data indicate a quite complex seasonal pattern of clinically apparent hantavirus infections for Germany that also might be regionally variable (see Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14</xref>).
