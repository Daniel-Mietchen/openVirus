<p>The picture of hantavirus species present in Germany seems to be more complex in comparison to Belgium and France or also Scandinavian countries. As indicated until the beginning of the century only few data on circulating strains were available (Pilaski et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B125">1994</xref>; Heiske et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">1999</xref>). Several species have been reported so far, yet PUUV found in human patients and bank vole populations in South and West Germany is the predominant virus. Since 2004 intense studies on hantaviruses in their natural reservoir the small mammals have been started in outbreak regions of human infections. Comparable to the French data shown in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, in Germany PUUV-prevalences in affected rodent populations might be quite high reaching 30 up to 60% prevalence in outbreaks (Essbauer et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2006</xref>; Ulrich et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B161">2008</xref>; Mertens et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107">2011a</xref>). Presently, at least eight geographic and phylogenetic distinct clusters predominate in Germany (Essbauer et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2007</xref>; Hofmann et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">2008</xref>; Ulrich et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B161">2008</xref>; Mertens et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109">2011c</xref>; Ettinger et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2012</xref>). Meanwhile, in order to understand the oscillation of human cases intense longitudinal investigations of rodents in several areas have been initiated (Ulrich et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B161">2008</xref>; Mertens et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109">2011c</xref>). Secondly, DOBV is present in Germany (Meisel et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B105">1998</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">2006</xref>; Klempa et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">2004</xref>; Schlegel et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B144">2009</xref>). Since 2001 approximately 30 human infections with DOBV were diagnosed in Northeast Germany (RKI, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2012</xref>). The usually 
 <italic>Apodemus agrarius</italic>-associated strain DOBV-Aa (“Saarema”) was found in 
 <italic>A. flavicollis</italic> in the Federal States of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower Saxony, Brandenburg, and also in Schleswig-Holstein (Schlegel et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B144">2009</xref>; RKI, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2012</xref>).
