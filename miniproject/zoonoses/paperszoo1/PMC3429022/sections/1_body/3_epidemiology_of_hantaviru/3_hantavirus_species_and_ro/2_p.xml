<p>Thirdly, mild human TULV infections were discussed but the definite role of this virus for human infections is quite unclear (Schultze et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B146">2002</xref>; Klempa et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">2003</xref>). As already mentioned for France multiple vole hosts such as 
 <italic>Microtus agrestis</italic>, 
 <italic>M. arvalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Arvicola amphibius</italic> were shown to be reservoirs (Schmidt-Chanasit et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B145">2010</xref>; Schlegel et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B143">2012</xref>). TULV was found to be present in several geographic regions in Germany, i.e., Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Bavaria, Lower Saxony, and Brandenburg (Mertens et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108">2011b</xref>). Its evolution seems to be not host-related but several different genetic geographic clusters were shown (Schmidt-Chanasit et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B145">2010</xref>; Schlegel et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B143">2012</xref>). Concisely, intense studies on hantaviruses in insectivores have been initiated without knowing the impact of these viruses on human health (Schlegel and Ulrich, personal communication).
