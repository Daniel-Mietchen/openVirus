<p>Mast already was defined in detail and critically discussed above in the overview on PUUV in Belgium. As described in detail for Belgium criteria for mast may be very versatile. The comparison of the seasonality of human hantavirus infections in Belgium and Germany (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13</xref>) also demonstrates that oscillations in these two countries are quite variable and therefore a general conclusion on mast, rodent populations, and hantavirus infections should be avoided. In Germany an annual report on the conditions of German forests (“Waldzustandsbericht”) is published from the Federal Governmental Ministry of Consumer Protection, Food, and Agriculture (e.g., for 2007

 </xref>). The report includes an overview of the status and also damages on different trees but does not include concrete data on mast. Additionally, in Germany certain officers responsible for forest and agriculture from each federal state meet once a year in order to exchange data on mast, rodent damages, and actual prognostic trappings. Despite the importance of this work in recent years, manpower, temporal, and financial possibilities have been reduced. In general, differences on results of mast of different trees, rodent populations, and also at the investigated sites are tremendous and therefore cannot be compared with the conditions in Scandinavia. The results of these meetings are embedded in the network rodent-borne diseases in order to combine the different expertise and to communicate the data also to health offices (Ulrich et al.,
