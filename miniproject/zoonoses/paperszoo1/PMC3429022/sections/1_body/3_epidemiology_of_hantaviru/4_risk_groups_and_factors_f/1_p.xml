<p>The data as hitherto describe clinically apparent hantavirus infections in humans and some aspects of viruses in rodents. However, the officially reported human cases only present the tip of an iceberg as many infections progress with unspecific symptoms and therefore might not be detected. Seroprevalence studies in the human population and different risk groups were started in the early 1980s in order to understand the “true” impact of hantavirus infections on humans. During these studies serological diagnostics started with classical immune fluorescence assays and were in recent years improved by implementing ELISAs and Western Blots with homologous antigens (Zöller et al.,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B174">1995</xref>; Razanskiene et al.,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110">2009</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108">2011b</xref>). The first detailed seroepidemiological investigation was performed on 13,358 human sera (Zöller et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B174">1995</xref>), and followed by further studies that showed a general seroprevalence in Germany of approximately 1–2% with higher prevalences (2%) found in South-West Germany (Martens, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">2000</xref>; Kimmig et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">2001</xref>; Mertens et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110">2009</xref>). In endemic regions the hantavirus seroprevalence may locally be quite variable and reach up to 5–10% as it was, e.g., shown in Baden-Württemberg (Zöller et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B174">1995</xref>; Kimmig et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">2001</xref>) and some communities in Lower Bavaria (Mertens et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110">2009</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109">2011c</xref>; Essbauer, personal communication). Due to their occupational exposure to small mammals and their excreta, several professions are at a higher risk for hantavirus infections, i.e., soldiers (Antoniadis et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">1985</xref>; Clement et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">1996</xref>; Mertens et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110">2009</xref>), construction workers (Abu Sin et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2007</xref>), muskrat hunters (Zöller et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B174">1995</xref>), workers at horse breeding farms (Zöller et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B174">1995</xref>), farmers (Rieger et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B130">2005</xref>), lumberjacks, and woodsman (Zöller et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B174">1995</xref>; Rieger et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B130">2005</xref>; Mertens et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108">2011b</xref>). The most recent seroepidemiological study in Brandenburg showed that forest workers there have higher TULV and DOBV seroprevalences concluding that both virus types might be predominant and possibly underdiagnosed in this region (Mertens et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108">2011b</xref>).
