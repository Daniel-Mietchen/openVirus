<p>In order to define further risk factors for the human populations as in Belgium and France some further epidemiological studies were performed in Germany. After the 2005 outbreak two case-control studies were initiated. In the area of Osnabruck for 30 eligible hantavirus patients registered between August 2004 and 2005 and a control-group of 43 persons it was shown that staying or living close to a forest, leisure activities in a forest such as camping, jogging, going on a mushroom foray are significant risk factors (Siffczyk et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B149">2006</xref>). In comparison, a German-wide case-control study was performed between May and August 2005 with 215 appropriate patients and 150 matched controls participating. Living close to forested areas, and noticing mice, but not leisure activities in a forest was found to be a risk for human PUUV infections (Abu Sin et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2007</xref>). A further study after the 2007 epidemics showed with 191 matched case-control pairs (April to June 2007) in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg that participants were more likely to have visited a forest and to have seen small rodents or their droppings. Besides, cleaning utility rooms such as sheds, attics, cellars, and garages, or visiting forest shelters in order to make a barbecue or to shelter from the rain were additional risk factors (Winter et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B169">2009</xref>). In summary, risk factors for Belgium, France, and Germany are defined by contact to nature and rodents but might to some degree depend on the study sites, the annual and local epidemic situation, and the questions asked in the survey.
