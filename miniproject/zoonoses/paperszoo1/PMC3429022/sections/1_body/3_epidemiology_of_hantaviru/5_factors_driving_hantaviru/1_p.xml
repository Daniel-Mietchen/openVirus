<p>So far the epidemiology and some risk settings for humans acquiring a hantavirus infection have been summarized for Germany. However, investigations of factors, which drive human hantavirus infectionsâ€™ oscillations such as the prevalences of the virus in rodent populations, the environmental, faunistic, floristic, weather (climatic), and other parameters are still at an early stage. This also includes factors that might have a direct impact on the virus stability in the environment. In general, Germany consists of a broad variety of landscapes formed by former glaciers. In the North these include the Islands of the North- and Baltic Sea, the North German Plain. In Central Germany uplands and numerous river valleys, e.g., Rhine are present. Southern Germany is characterized by several linear hills and high mountain ranges such as Swabian and Franconian Alb, Bohemian Forest, and the Alps. There are three main biogeographic regions, the Atlantic, the continental-middle European, and the alpine (Glaser et al.,

Hence, there exist a broad variety of habitats and biotopes for rodents and makes the situation for these animals and therefore associated diseases quite complex. In 2004 a network on rodent-associated pathogens with an intense focus on hantaviruses was established in order to bring scientist with different expertise together to investigate aforesaid issues (Ulrich et al.,
