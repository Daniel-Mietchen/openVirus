<p>In the following subchapter actual data on factors driving hantaviruses in Germany available from the literature are reviewed. In part, so far unpublished results from a 3-year-study in the German hantavirus hot spot region Bavarian Forest National Park in Lower Bavaria are presented (see marked in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>). Here from 2008 to 2010 small mammals and their associated pathogens (e.g., PUUV and

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B141">2011</xref>; Silaghi et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B151">2012</xref>) were analyzed along an altitude gradient together with environmental, i.e., vegetation and climatic data generated in the BIOKLIM project (Biodiversity and Climate Change Project; BÃ¤ssler et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2009</xref>). In brief, data from 661 small mammals including 275 bank voles trapped at 23 sites were used in order to analyze if rodent-associated factors, i.e., biometric, diversity, environmental, and climatic or weather conditions influence the prevalence of PUUV in lower Bavaria in order to reflect the risk of infections for the human population (Thoma, personal communication).
