<p>Hantaviruses (
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>) are carried by rodents, insectivores, and – as recently confirmed – by bats (Kim et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">1994</xref>; Weiss et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B166">2012</xref>) and transmitted to humans by inhalation of infected excreta (Heyman et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2009c</xref>). So far, only some rodent-borne hantaviruses have been found to be pathogenic to humans. The relationship between the rodent population density, the hantavirus prevalence in the rodent population, and the number of human hantavirus cases, including the hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) cases in Eurasia, has been suggested worldwide (Tersago et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B157">2011a</xref>). It is thus important to know whether or not hantavirus-carrier rodent populations are peaking or not. The factors that drive rodent population dynamics are of prime importance for predicting hantavirus epidemics (Linard et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">2007a</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">b</xref>; Jonsson et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">2010</xref>), but at the same time highly complex and largely unknown (Krebs, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">1999</xref>).
