<p>Ironically, while human pressure onto the environment had detrimental effects for the entire ecosystem, recent observed change for the better might – in collaboration with changes in human behavior and climate – increase the chances for infectious diseases transmission. Their reservoirs and vectors – ticks, fleas, insects, and mammals mostly – are in general not amongst the many species that appear on the IUCN red list

But although rodents – the reservoirs for hantaviruses – are generally not regarded as threatened mammals, there is ample historical evidence of the extinction of several rodent phylogenetic lineages. Rodent species represent about 50% of mammalian extinctions in the last 500 years (Amori and Gippoliti,
