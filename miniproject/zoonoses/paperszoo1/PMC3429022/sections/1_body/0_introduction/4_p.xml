<p>Urbanization was and still is a significant factor that is changing Europe’s biodiversity, mainly because of the inevitable rural to urban land-use change (Franklin, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">1993</xref>). Urban ecosystems are therefore almost never integrated into wider biodiversity considerations, in the past two decades the increasingly renewed contact of people with nature (de-urbanization) has been found to relieve urban stress and to help fight climate change through increased awareness, but it has also made people – through increased risk for contact with wildlife – more vulnerable for zoonotic pathogens (Franklin, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">1993</xref>). Adverse health effects need however not be exclusively related to infectious diseases. One of the most striking recent examples of detrimental health effects related to climate was the heat wave during the summer of the year 2003, which was probably the hottest summer in Europe for 500 years. Between 20,000 and 40,000 heat-related deaths occurred across Europe in August 2003 alone (Schär et al.,
