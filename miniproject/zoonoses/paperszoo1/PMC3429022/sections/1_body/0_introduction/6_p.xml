<p>As this paper aims to define factors that drive hantavirus epidemics, an important question is to what extent certain parameters influence hantavirus activity and whether these parameters occur solely in one region or on multi-country level. Perhaps the most difficult question is how factors that facilitate and those that inhibit the hantavirus transmission mechanism interact and what the net outcome of this equation is and will be in the future. The following chapters summarize the present knowledge on hantaviruses and disease transmission in Belgium, France, and Germany. These three countries were chosen as examples for discussing the epidemiology, and possible factors having an impact on changes in the oscillations of hantaviruses in Middle Europe.</p>
