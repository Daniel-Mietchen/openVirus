<p>The human impact on ecosystems is indeed immense; man-made agricultural ecosystems dominate much of Europeâ€™s landscape and, due to the intensification of agriculture and subsequent use of fertilizers and pesticides, biodiversity in particular has changed significantly in almost all agricultural areas (Sanchez et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B137">2011</xref>; Shochat and Ovadia, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B148">2011</xref>). The vast majority of farmland wildlife has suffered greatly and bird populations have decreased by 50% or more since the 1980s in Europe (Donald et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2006</xref>). Recently, the reduced use of both pesticides and fertilizers and environmental friendly farming (e.g., organic farming) mark positive changes that can be seen across Europe (Noyes et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B116">2009</xref>). Forest ecosystems in Europe have also experienced dramatic declines, deforestation has however been reversed or management has changed in the last two decades and in some areas forests have been expanded significantly (Bezirtzoglou et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2011</xref>). Moreover, the often overlooked mountain ecosystems possess a high diversity of habitats and species and are important for water supply and its regulation toward lower altitude areas, but are also especially vulnerable to impacts from changes in agriculture, infrastructure, tourism, and climate (DeGraaf et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">1992</xref>; Huitu et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">2003</xref>).
