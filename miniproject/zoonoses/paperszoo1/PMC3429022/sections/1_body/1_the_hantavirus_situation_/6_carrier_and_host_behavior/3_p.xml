<p>Although hantaviruses are RNA viruses that are considered to be vulnerable for various biotic and abiotic parameters once they are outside the carrier, studies have revealed that the virus can remain viable for an extended period of time (days to weeks) outside the carrier if conditions are favorable (Kallio et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">2006a</xref>). This implies that it is by no means necessary to actually see or encounter rodents in order to become infected. Again, the more common manipulation and use of wood in south Belgium may support this (Campioli et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2009</xref>). The observed change of the climatic conditions in Belgium with warmer winters and wetter summers (Tricot et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B160">2009</xref>) might favor the survival of the virus in the environment and contribute to the higher number of cases.
