<p>During the glacial events of the Quaternary in Europe, deciduous forests were generally confined to the Mediterranean peninsulas (Deffontaine et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2005</xref>). Temperate forest mammal species such as bank voles shifted their range according to their habitat, thus surviving the glacial maxima in the Mediterranean peninsulas (Taberlet et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B154">1998</xref>; Deffontaine et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2005</xref>). Interglacial and postglacial recolonizations of central and northern Europe, by plants and tree accompanied by – amongst others – rodents, therefore originated from these refuges (Taberlet et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B154">1998</xref>; Michaux et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B112">2005</xref>).
