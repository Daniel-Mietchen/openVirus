<p>Bank vole populations in Belgium indeed show cyclic population density changes (Heyman and Saegerman, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">2009</xref>). A 10-year (1999–2008) rodent surveillance project organized by the Belgian Ministry of Defense with rodent trapping on 15 different sites demonstrated that between 1999 and 2005 fluctuations in trapping success (and thus rodent population density) correlated with hantavirus prevalence (measured by detection of IgG antibodies) and with the relative number of human cases. From 2006 on, however, this relation is much less clear, i.e., rodent population densities remain high in the absence of a mast event – in this case beech and/or oak – and virus prevalence remains higher than expected (Figure
