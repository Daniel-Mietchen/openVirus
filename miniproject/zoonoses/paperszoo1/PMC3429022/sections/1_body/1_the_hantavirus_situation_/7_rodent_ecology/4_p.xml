<p>Although allegedly not critical for rodent cycles in the temperate deciduous forest zone, predation, or behavioral changes due to the presence of predators could also play a role in Belgium. Population densities of the various animals (mammalian and avian) that predate on 
 <italic>M. glareolus</italic> are not well known, but â€“ apart from population density increases of birds of prey species (Robinson and Sutherland, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B131">2002</xref>), Population densities of 
 <italic>Mustelidae</italic> (weasels) and foxes (
 <italic>Vulpes vulpes</italic>) are on the rise since the 1980s in accordance with bank vole population fluctuations (Vervaeke et al.,
