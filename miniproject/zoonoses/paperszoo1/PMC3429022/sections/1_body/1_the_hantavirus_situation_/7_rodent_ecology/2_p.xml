<p>Depending on food availability, predation and environmental characteristics, and stress, various endemic rodent species display more or less regular cyclic population changes. Whether population numbers and cycles of endemic rodents in Belgium have changed is not known but with the cutting of forests and the human population increase since Medieval times it seems reasonable to assume that nowadays rodent populations are a fraction of what once was. Rodents often were a serious economic and public health problem; one of the most striking examples were the consecutive plague events in Europe between the fourteenth century and the last occurrence in Marseille in 1720 (Duchene and Contrucci, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">1998</xref>) that killed in certain regions up to 30% of the population. A curious side effect of the significant human population decrease was that from about 1,350 on CO
 <sub>2</sub> levels in the atmosphere dropped due to reforestation as less wood was needed for building and heating for the decimated population (Ruddiman,
