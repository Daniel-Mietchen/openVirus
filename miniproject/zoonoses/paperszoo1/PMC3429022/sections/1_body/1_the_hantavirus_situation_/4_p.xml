<p>From the data collected by the Belgian reference laboratory we learn that there existed –from 1993 on – a 3-year epidemic cycle up until 1999, between 1999 and 2005 a 2-year cycle occurred and from 2005 on all years – i.e., seven in total – showed an increased hantavirus activity (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This unique hantavirus epidemiology pattern that only occurs in Belgium and not in the surrounding countries raises questions whether the parameters that drive hantavirus epidemiology apply only to Belgium or also to other European countries (Heyman et al.,
