<p>The Belgian Royal Meteorological Institute is monitoring the climatic parameters in Belgium since 1833 and is currently relying on a network of more than 250 daily reporting stations throughout the country. In its 2009 climate report, detailed information is made available concerning the tendencies of the Belgian climate in the past century (Tricot et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B160">2009</xref>). The average temperature has risen with about 2°C since 1833, but this happened in two rather abrupt stages (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>); the first significant increase took place around 1910 with primarily a rise in maximum temperature, the second around 1990 with a rise of both maximum and minimum temperatures. Both times the increase was about 1°C. The first frost day happened around the 30th of October from 1900 up until 1955, than an abrupt delay of – on average – 10 days occurred. The last frost day shifted from around the 22nd of April to 06th of April with – again – two abrupt changes in 1930 and 1980 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The number of days with at least 25°C and the number of days with temperatures of at least 15°C showed two warmer periods, i.e., from 1930 to 1950 and from 1983 until present. Although the number of days with &gt;25°C has increased, there is no evidence that the number of sunshine hours (related to UV index) has increased as this is associated with cloud cover which is difficult to measure. The UV index increase – important for inactivation of RNA viruses – is thus not established. Finally, the yearly rainfall of on average 770 mm increased around 1910 to 810 mm. The Belgian climate has changed during the twentieth century. Two sudden temperature increases – one in the first half of the century, the other during the 1980s – were noted, the heat wave frequency has increased in the 1990s, the frequency of cold waves decreased in the 1970s.
