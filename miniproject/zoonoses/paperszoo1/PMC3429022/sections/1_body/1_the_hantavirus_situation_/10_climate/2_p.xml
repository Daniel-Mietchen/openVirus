<p>The fourth IPCC report (The Core Writing Team, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B159">2007</xref>) stipulates that “warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level,” albeit that changes in temperature and rainfall are predicted to be more pronounced at higher latitudes and along the equator than in Western Europe.
