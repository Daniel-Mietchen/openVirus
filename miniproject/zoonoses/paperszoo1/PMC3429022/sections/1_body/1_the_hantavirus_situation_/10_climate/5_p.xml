<p>Thus, explaining the increase in the number of NE cases in the last decade (2001–2011) in Belgium just by climate change is difficult because the key years for changes in hantavirus activity were 1999 and 2005; if milder climatic conditions caused the increase in cases, these events should have been visible much earlier as the key years for climatic changes in Belgium occurred long before (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). If – even in the absence of the necessary diagnostic tools – hantavirus epidemics had taken place before the first reliably recorded outbreak of 1995–1996 (Heyman et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">1999</xref>) they would not have gone unnoticed given the sometimes severe clinical course of hantavirus disease, i.e., acute renal failure (ARF) and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In Russia for instance, hantavirus infections were already diagnosed based on clinical features as early as 1935 (Sirotin and Keiser,
