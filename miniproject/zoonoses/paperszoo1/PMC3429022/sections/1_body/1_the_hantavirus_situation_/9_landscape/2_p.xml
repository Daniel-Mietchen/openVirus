<p>Habitat fragmentation is also regarded as a possible triggering factor for biodiversity loss (Fahrig, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2003</xref>). The landscape fragmentation and absence of corridors can also be responsible for creating so-called islands where rodent populations display the typical Island syndrome features (differences in demography, reproduction, behavior, and morphology when compared to normal populations; Adler and Levins, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">1994</xref>; Eccard et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2011</xref>). Landscape changes may thus partially explain the success of the bank vole in virtually all habitats in Belgium and the increasing risk for hantavirus infections. Unfortunately, the intensive agriculture techniques applied in Belgium turned the landscape into a green desert, where wildlife or wild plant species have no place (Peeters et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B121">2006</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B120">2007</xref>). A significant disturbance of trophic interactions can occur and only generalist and invasive species may profit (Erhard, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2009</xref>; Jonsson et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">2010</xref>).
