<p>Endemic species are amongst the most affected if an original forest is converted into an anthropogenic habitat. The native vegetation is in most cases partially replaced by non-native or even invasive plant species by gardening activities. A matrix of altered habitats enclosing forest remnants in human dominated landscapes may be inhospitable for wildlife in general. Endemic species are in this case under increasing pressure from non-native or invasive species and both invasive species and generalist species tend to survive the changes (Umetsu and Pardini,
