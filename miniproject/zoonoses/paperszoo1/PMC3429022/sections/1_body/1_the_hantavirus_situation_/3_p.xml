<p>Puumala virus (PUUV), carried by the bank vole (
 <italic>Myodes glareolus</italic>) is the only hantaviral serotype that is known to infect humans in Belgium, it induces a mild form of HFRS called nephropathia epidemica (NE); on average 150 cases occur yearly. From 2005 on there is a definite increase in the yearly number of NE cases in Belgium (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A–D). Although increased awareness and improved diagnostic tools were originally argued for the increasing number of yearly cases, the RLVBD data (Heyman, personal communication) show that the total number of serology demands is more or less constant between the years but that the number of submitted samples that showed positivity for hantaviral antibodies increased from 25 to 56%. Thus, increased awareness and improved diagnostic tools do not seem to be responsible for the increase in cases, a more targeted diagnostic strategy applied by clinicians is however possible. Under-diagnosis is probably also important as only 5–10% of the infected individuals display clinical symptoms (Heyman et al.,
