<p>The connection between mast and hantavirus infections was – in Belgium – already suggested in 2001 (Heyman et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">2001</xref>) and re-examined recently (Tersago et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B156">2009</xref>; Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The scarcity of detailed mast data, regional mast data, the short time frame for which detailed data are available and the complete lack of data on other than oak and beech species that have a cyclic or yearly masting event limits the value of the observations. Only oak and beech mast were involved in the various studies but closer examination shows that – in the habitat of 
 <italic>M. glareolus</italic> – between 11 and 33 (November to February) and 95–1,292 (March to October) flowering plant species

  <sup>4</sup>
 </xref> are available as food source (Kollmann et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">1998</xref>). As beechnuts and acorns are only available between October and January and are also the staple food for large mammals like 
 <italic>Sus scrofa</italic> (wild boar) or 
 <italic>Capreolus capreolus</italic> (roe deer) and various bird species, it seems obvious that rodents need to rely on other food sources for most – if not the whole – of the year. Besides evidence for an animal-based food preference in spring (Eccard and Ylönen, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2006</xref>), it was also established that hard fruits only account for about 40% of the bank vole’s diet (Wereszcynska and Nowakowski, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B167">2004</xref>). Bank voles are generalists and omnivorous, they eat insects, leaves, and soft fruits as well as hard fruits (Kollmann et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">1998</xref>).
