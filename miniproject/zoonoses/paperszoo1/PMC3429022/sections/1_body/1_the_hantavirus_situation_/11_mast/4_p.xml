<p>As far as oak and beech mast is concerned, Belgian data show that hantavirus epidemics are to some extent related, but only for the period between 1995 and 2007 (Tersago et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B158">2011b</xref>). Not in favor of the role of beech and oak in hantavirus epidemics and probably the proverbial straw that breaks the camel’s back is the fact that both species only account for 9 and 17%, respectively, Norway spruce (
 <italic>Picea abies</italic>) represents more than 36% of the total tree stand composition (Campioli et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2009</xref>). Before 1995 mast did – to our best knowledge as reliable data are lacking – not correlate with hantavirus disease epidemics. After 2007, i.e., the last 3 years (2008, 2009, 2010) were no mast years but hantavirus activity was nevertheless high (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In fact, only the 1993, 1996, and 2005 epidemics correlate with a previous oak-beech mast event, 2001 should have been an epidemic year, after the oak-beech mast event of the year 2000, but was not. And finally, all years after 2005 – six in total – were epidemic years in the absence of oak-beech masting events (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). From Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> it can be concluded that any mast event can provide sufficient food for rodent populations to peak and induce a hantavirus epidemic in the next year. Thus, not only beech or oak trigger these events. Another observation that does not support the Belgian “mast theory” (Clement et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2011</xref>) is the fact that mast is considered to take place on a large scale, even on sub-continental level (Kelly et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">2008</xref>; Olsson et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B117">2010</xref>), the variation of epidemic years in neighboring countries however does not support this (Heyman et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2011</xref>). Even locally, i.e., in Belgium, masting is not present at the same time in all regions; the 2011 mast of oak-beech is present in the Flanders region, the North and South – but not in the middle part – of the Wallonia region, this does not mean however that other plant species did not display mast. One other intriguing fact is that although hantaviruses are supposed to co-evolve with their carriers for millions of years – clusters of hantavirus disease (NE, ARF) were not reported before the 1980s (van Ypersele de Strihou et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B163">1983</xref>). Even in the absence of diagnostic tools the syndrome caused by hantavirus infection should have been noticed and periodically, i.e., the year after a mast event, reported by clinicians.
