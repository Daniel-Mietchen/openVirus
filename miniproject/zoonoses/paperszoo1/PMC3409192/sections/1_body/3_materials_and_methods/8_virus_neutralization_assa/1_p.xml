<p>Sera were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 1 h, and then mixed with 100 TCID50 (tissue culture infectious dose) of the QH H5N1 influenza virus in serial 2-fold dilutions (starting dilution 1∶10). After 1 h incubation, the virus-sera mixtures were added to MDCK cells that were seeded in a 96-well plate for 1 h (duplicate in 6 wells for each sample dilution). The cells were then replaced with complete media. At 48 h post infection, medium was collected and analyzed for hemagglutination activity (HA). The virus-neutralizing titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that inhibited hemagglutination activity by medium from infected cells.</p>
