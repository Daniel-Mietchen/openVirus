<p>Influenza HA-specific antibodies were measured in individual mouse sera by an ELISA following established protocols (
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Wen1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Ge1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>). Recombinant influenza viruses containing the HA and NA of QH and SX H5N1 isolates and internal genes from PR8 influenza virus (6+2) were rescued by reverse genetics, which were grown in SPF chicken embryonated eggs, inactivated by formalin treatment, and purified by centrifugation. The purified inactivated virus was then used as coating antigens in ELISA for detection of HA specific antibodies. A standard curve was constructed by coating each ELISA plate with serial 2-fold dilutions of purified mouse IgG with known concentration. The concentrations of influenza HA-specific antibodies in serum samples were calculated using the obtained standard curves and expressed as the amount of HA-specific antibody in 1 ml of serum samples (ng/ml).
