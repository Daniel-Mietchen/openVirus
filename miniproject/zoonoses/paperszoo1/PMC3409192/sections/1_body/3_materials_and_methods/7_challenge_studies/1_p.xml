<p>Challenge of mice with H5N1 HPAIV was carried out in a biosafety-level 3 animal facility at the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute in China, and all challenged mice were housed in high-efficiency particulate air-filtered (HEPA-filtered) isolators. Groups of eight 6- to 8-week-old female BALB/c mice (Beijing Experimental Animal Center, Beijing) were immunized by different DNA vaccine regimens. The wild type QH H5N1 influenza virus (A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/3/2005) was grown in 10-day old SPF (special pathogen free) chicken embryonated eggs and stored in −80°C until use. Virus was titered in 10-day old SPF chicken embryonated eggs to determine EID50 (egg-infectious dose) and MLD50 (mouse Lethal Dose) was determined in 8-week old female Balb/c mice. At 4 weeks after the final immunization, mice were lightly anesthetized with CO
 <sub>2</sub> and inoculated intranasally with 100 MLD50 of QH H5N1 influenza virus (which is approximately 1000 EID50) in a volume of 50 µl and monitored daily for weight loss and mortality.
