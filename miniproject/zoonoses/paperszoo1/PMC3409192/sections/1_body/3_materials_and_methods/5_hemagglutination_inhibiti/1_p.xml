<p>The HAI assay was performed as described previously (

 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>). Briefly, mouse sera were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 1 h and then treated with receptor destroying enzyme (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) at 37°C overnight according to the manufacturer’s instruction. After treatment, 25-µl aliquots of 2-fold serially diluted serum samples were added to 25-µl PBS containing 4 HA units of purified inactivated recombinant influenza virus, After incubation at 37°C for 1 h, the serum-virus mixture was then incubated with 50 µl of 0.5% chicken red blood cells (LAMPIRE Biological Laboratories, Pipersville, PA) at 25°C for 45 min in a u-bottom 96-well plate. The HAI titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that inhibited hemagglutination.
