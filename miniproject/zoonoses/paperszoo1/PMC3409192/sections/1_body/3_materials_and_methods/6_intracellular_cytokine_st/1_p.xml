<p>Mice were sacrificed on day 14 after the final immunization to prepare splenocytes for analysis of T cell responses by intracellular cytokine staining coupled with flow cytometry following established protocols (
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Ye1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Bu1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>). Splenocytes were stimulated with a peptide corresponding to a CD8+ T cell epitope for the influenza virus HA (IYSTVASSL, synthesized at the Emory Microchemical Facility, Atlanta, GA) or an irrelevant peptide corresponding to a segment in the HIV Gag protein (AMQMLKETI, negative control) at 10 µg/ml for 6 h in presence of 10 µg/ml Brefeldin A (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and CD8+ T cell responses were determined by intracellular cytokine staining of IFN-gamma and analyzed by flow cytometry on a BD FACSCalibre with CELLQuest software (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). For detection of HA-specific CD4+ T cells, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) were prepared following established procedures (
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Wen1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>), incubated with influenza virus virus-like particles containing the HA of QH or SX (10 µg/ml) overnight, and then mixed with mouse splenocytes at 1∶5 ratio for 6 h in presence of 10 µg/ml Brefeldin A. The levels of CD4+ T cell responses were determined by intracellular cytokine staining of IFN-gamma and analyzed by flow cytometry on a BD FACSCalibre with CELLQuest software.
