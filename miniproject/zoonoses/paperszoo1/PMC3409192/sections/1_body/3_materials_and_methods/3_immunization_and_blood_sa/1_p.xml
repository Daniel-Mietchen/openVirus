<p>Female BALB/c mice (6–8 weeks old) were obtained from Charles River Laboratory (Charleston, SC) and housed at the Emory University animal facility in micro-isolator cages. For DNA immunization, 50 µg of HA DNA vaccines were dissolved in 100 µl PBS and then injected into both side mouse quadriceps (50 µl per side). At two weeks after each immunization, blood samples were collected by retro-orbital bleeding, heat-inactivated, and stored at −80°C until further analysis.</p>
