<p>The average value and standard deviation for the level of immune responses within each group were calculated for comparison and the significance of the differences between the results from different groups was determined by a 
 <italic>student t test</italic> using the Excel program (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). The statistical analysis of the survival curves were carried out using the GraphPad Prism (La Jolla, CA) software. The survival curves of different groups after challenge were built based on the Kaplan-Meier method and post-test comparison of the curves of two different groups was analyzed by the Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon method.
