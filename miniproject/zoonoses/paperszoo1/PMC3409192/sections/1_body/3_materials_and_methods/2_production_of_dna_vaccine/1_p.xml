<p>The genes for the HA of QH and SX H5N1 viruses were amplified by RT-PCR following established protocols and then cloned into the plasmid vector pCAGGS (kindly provided by Dr. Kowaoka) under the chicken beta-actin promoter. Plasmids were amplified in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α and purified with an Endo-Free Megaprep DNA purification kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s protocols. The plasmids were then resuspended at 1 µg/µl in sterile PBS and stored at –80°C until being used for immunizations. Expression of HA was characterized by transfection of HeLa cells using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using mouse immune sera against QH and SX HA.
