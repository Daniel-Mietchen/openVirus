<p>To further investigate the cross-reactivity of these two HA antigens, we also characterized the antibody responses induced in mice that received boosting immunizations with a heterologous HA DNA vaccine as outlined in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041332-g001">Figure 1</xref>. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041332-g003">Figure 3a, a</xref> single boosting immunization with the SX-HA DNA vaccine following two immunizations with the QH-HA DNA vaccine significantly augmented antibody responses against the QH virus (p&lt;0.05, QH/SX-3 vs. QH/SX-2 against QH virus), to a similar level as those induced by three homologous immunizations with the QH-HA DNA vaccine (comparing QH/SX-3 and QH-3). Conversely, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041332-g003">Figure 3b, a</xref> boosting immunization with the QH-HA DNA vaccine following two immunizations with the SX-HA DNA vaccine augmented antibody responses against the SX virus to a similar level as those induced by three immunizations with the SX-HA DNA vaccine (comparing SX/QH-3 and SX-3). Functional analysis of the antibody responses showed that the HAI activity of antibodies against the priming virus strain was also increased after a boosting immunization with the heterologous HA DNA vaccine (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041332-g003">Figure 3c and 3d</xref>). On the other hand, in mice that received two QH-HA DNA immunizations, boosting with the SX-HA DNA vaccine induced similar levels of antibody responses against the SX virus to those induced by a single immunization with the SX-HA DNA vaccine (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041332-g004">Figure 4a</xref>, comparing QH/SX-3 and SX-1). Similarly, in mice that received two SX-HA DNA immunizations, boosting with the QH-HA DNA vaccine induced similar levels of antibody responses against the QH virus to those induced by a single immunization with the QH-HA DNA vaccine (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041332-g004">Figure 4b</xref>, comparing SX/QH-3 and QH-1). These results show that boosting by a heterologous HA DNA vaccine effectively augmented antibody responses to the priming virus strain. However, such antibodies were not reactive to the boosting virus strain.
