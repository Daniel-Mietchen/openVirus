<p>To investigate the impact of pre-existing antibody responses to the HA of the priming virus strain on antibody induction to the HA of the boosting virus strain, we further analyzed antibody responses against HA of both priming and boosting virus strains after a second boosting immunization to the mice with the heterologous HA DNA vaccine. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041332-g005">Figures 5a and 5c</xref>, after the second heterologous boost with the QH HA DNA vaccine, antibody responses as well as HAI activity against the QH virus in Group SX/QH were boosted to similar levels as those induced by two immunizations with the QH HA DNA vaccine (comparing SX/QH-4 and QH-2 against the QH virus). On the other hand, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041332-g006">Figure 6a and 6c</xref>, antibody levels as well as HAI titer against the SX virus (the priming virus strain) dropped slightly after the second boosting immunization with the QH HA DNA vaccine (comparing SX/QH-4 and SX/QH-3 against the SX virus). Similarly, the second boost with the SX HA DNA vaccine augmented antibody responses and HAI activity against the SX virus in Group QH/SX to similar levels as those induced by two immunizations with the SX HA DNA vaccine (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041332-g005">Figures 5b and 5d</xref>. comparing QH/SX-4 and SX-2 against SX virus), while antibody responses against the QH virus (the priming virus strain) slightly dropped (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041332-g006">Figure 6b and 6d</xref>). These results show that the second boosting immunization with the heterologous HA DNA vaccine effectively augmented the antibody responses as well as the HAI activity against the boosting virus strain but not the priming virus strain.
