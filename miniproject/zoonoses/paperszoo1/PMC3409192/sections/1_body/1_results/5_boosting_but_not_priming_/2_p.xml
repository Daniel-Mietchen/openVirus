<p>The survival rates and weight changes of each group after challenge were shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041332-g008">Figure 8c</xref>. The survival curves of different groups after challenge were built based on the Kaplan-Meier method and then analyzed by the Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon method. All mice that received two immunizations with QH HA DNA vaccine (Group QH-QH) survived the challenge by QH virus while none of the mice in the control group survived the challenge. Mice that received one (Group SX) or two (Group SX-SX) immunizations with the SX HA DNA vaccine also all succumbed to challenge, similar to the control group mice. Mice that received only a single QH HA DNA immunization (Group QH) were partially protected from the challenge, which is significantly higher compared to the control group (p&lt;0.05). However, mice that received priming with QH HA DNA vaccine followed by boosting with SX HA DNA vaccine (Group QH-SX) were completely protected from lethal challenge by QH virus, which is significantly higher than mice that received a single immunization with QH HA DNA vaccine (p&lt;0.05, Group QH-SX vs. Group QH). In contrast, mice that received priming with SX HA DNA vaccine followed by boosting with QH HA DNA vaccine (Group SX-QH) were only partially protected from challenge by QH virus, similar as mice that received a single immunization with QH HA DNA vaccine (p&gt;0.05, Group SX-QH vs. Group QH). These results show that a heterologous boosting with the SX-HA DNA vaccine is as effective as two homologous QH-HA DNA immunizations for protection against a high lethal dose challenge by the QH H5N1 influenza virus, whereas a heterologous priming with the SX-HA DNA vaccine has no significant effect for protection against QH virus infection.
