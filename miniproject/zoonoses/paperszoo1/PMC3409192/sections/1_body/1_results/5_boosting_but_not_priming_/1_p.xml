<p>We further investigated the efficacy of different homologous and heterologous prime-boost immunization regimens for protection against challenge by the QH H5N1 HPAIV, which causes lethal infection in mice. Mice were immunized with different HA DNA vaccines as outlined in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041332-g008">Figure 8a</xref> and then challenged with 100 MLD50 of the QH H5N1 influenza virus. Blood samples were collected after the second immunization and analyzed antibody responses against the QH virus. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041332-g008">Figure 8b</xref>, priming with the QH HA DNA vaccine followed by boosting with the SX HA DNA vaccine induced similar levels of antibody responses against the QH virus as two immunizations with the QH HA DNA vaccine. On the other hand, priming with the SX HA DNA vaccine followed by boosting with the QH HA DNA vaccine induced similar levels of antibody responses against the QH virus as one immunization with the QH HA DNA vaccine. We further compared neutralizing activity of these sera against the QH virus. As also shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041332-g008">Figure 8b</xref>, sera from the QH-SX group exhibited similar neutralizing activity against the QH virus as sera from the QH-QH group. In comparison, sera from the SX-QH group exhibited only low level neutralizing activity against the QH virus as also detected for the PBS-QH group, whereas sera from the PBS-SX and SX-SX did not show detectable neutralizing activity against the QH virus. Similar results were also obtained for HAI activity against the QH virus. These results agree with the observation in above studies, demonstrating that a heterologous boosting but not priming with the SX-HA DNA vaccine augmented antibody response against the QH virus.
