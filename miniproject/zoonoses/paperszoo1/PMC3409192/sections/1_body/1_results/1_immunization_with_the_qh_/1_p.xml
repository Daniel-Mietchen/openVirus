<p>We constructed DNA vaccines expressing the HA of the QH and SX H5N1 influenza viruses and characterized their expression in HeLa cells by transfection and Western blot, which showed these two HA proteins were expressed at similar levels (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041332-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Blood samples were collected at two weeks after each immunization and analyzed for antibody responses against the QH and SX viruses, and a summary of the antibody responses after each immunization is provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0041332.s002">Table S1</xref>. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041332-g002">Figure 2a</xref>, immunization with the QH-HA DNA vaccine induced significant levels of antibody responses against the QH virus after two immunizations as compared to the control group (p&lt;0.05). The third immunization further boosted the antibody levels significantly, whereas the fourth immunization only moderately increased antibody levels against the QH virus. In contrast, even after the fourth immunization with the QH-HA DNA vaccine, no significant level of antibody response against the SX virus was induced as compared to the control group (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041332-g002">Figure 2a</xref>. SX-4 vs. C-4 against QH virus. p&gt;0.1). In agreement with the results from ELISA studies, antibodies induced by QH-HA DNA vaccine exhibit hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) activity against the QH virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041332-g002">Figure 2c</xref>) but not the SX virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041332-g002">Figure 2d</xref>), whereas antibodies induced by the SX-HA DNA vaccine exhibit HAI activity against the SX virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041332-g002">Figure 2d</xref>) but not the QH virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041332-g002">Figure 2c</xref>). These results show that, similar as observed in chickens, the QH and SX HA exhibit distinctive antigenic properties in mice.
