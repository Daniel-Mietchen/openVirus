<p>After characterization of antibody responses induced by different prime-boost immunization regimens, mice were sacrificed and splenocytes were prepared for analysis of T cell responses by intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry. Of note, the QH and SX HA proteins share a dominant CD8 T cell epitope for Balb/c mice (H2d), IYGRPYET (amino acid 533â€“541), which is also found in H1N1 human influenza A viruses. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041332-g007">Figure 7a</xref>, immunization with the QH-HA as well as SX-HA DNA vaccines induced similar levels of CD8 T cell responses against this epitiope. The level of CD4 T cell responses induced by HA DNA vaccines were compared by stimulating mouse bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) that have been pulsed overnight with QH, SX, PR8 (A/PR/8/34) influenza virus-like particles (VLP), or SIV-Gag VLPs. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041332-g007">Figure 7b</xref>, the levels of CD4 T cell responses against HA protein induced by immunization with HA DNA vaccines are similar in all four groups (QH, SX, QH/SX, and SX/QH) that received HA DNA vaccines. Further, the levels of IFN-gamma-producing CD4 T cells are also similar in each vaccinated group when the splenocytes were stimulated with QH or SX virus-like particle (VLP)-pulsed BMDCs. These results show that in contrast to antibody responses, the T cell responses are cross-reactive between the HA of these two H5N1 HPAIV isolates and were boosted by a heterologous HA DNA vaccine as effectively as by the homologous HA DNA vaccine. Of note, only background level of IFN-gamma-producing CD4 T cells were stimulated by BMDCs pulsed with the PR8 VLPs (A/PR/8/34) or with SIV-Gag VLPs, indicating that CD4 T cell responses induced by these H5N1 HPAIV HA DNA vaccines do not exhibit cross-reactivity to the HA of the influenza virus A/PR/8/34, which is a human influenza virus of the H1 subtype.
