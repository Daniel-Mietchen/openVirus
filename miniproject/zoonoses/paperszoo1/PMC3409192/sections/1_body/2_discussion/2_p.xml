<p>The rapid onset of the new H1N1 influenza virus pandemic suggests that once an influenza virus of zoonotic origin has acquired human transmissibility, it will be difficult control its spread due to the lack of herd immunity. Therefore, the preparation of a vaccine stockpile against potentially pandemic influenza viruses is of great importance. Of particular concern, outbreaks of H5N1 HPAIV over the last decade have caused over 800 human infections and different clades of H5N1 HPAIV are concurrently endemic and it is difficult to predict which strain will cause a pandemic

 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. While the Qinghai-like viruses have not been detected in poultry in China after 2005, they have been repeatedly detected in wild birds or domestic poultry in other countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia

 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In addition to their wide distribution, these viruses also bear known genetic markers that are critical for transmission in mammalian hosts and thus represent a clear pandemic potential

 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The CK/SX/2/06 (SX) virus was first detected in chickens from the Shanxi province in northern China 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Chen3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, which has since spread to several other provinces in northern China, including Ningxia, Henan, Shandong, and Liaoning provinces, and continues to be endemic in these regions. In addition, H5N1 HPAIV with an HA gene similar to that of CK/SX/2/06-like viruses has also been detected in chickens in Vietnam in 2008 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Nguyen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Moreover, viruses of both clades have been reported to cause human infections 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-AbdelGhafar1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Our results in this study showed that antibody responses induced by the HA of these two viruses not only failed to exert HAI activity but also exhibit almost no binding activity to each other. Further, immunization with the SX HA DNA vaccine alone conferred no protection against lethal challenge by the QH virus. The lack of cross reactivity of antibody responses between these two viruses underscores the need to prepare vaccine stockpiles for different H5N1 clades that are antigenically distinctive, to improve our preparedness against a potential H5N1 pandemic.
