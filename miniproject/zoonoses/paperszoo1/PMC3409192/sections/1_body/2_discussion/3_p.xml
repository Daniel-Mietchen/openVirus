<p>We further investigated whether these H5N1 HPAIV vaccines will interfere with induction of protective immune responses against an antigenically distinctive strain. Our results from this study showed that boosting immunization with a heterologous HA DNA vaccine effectively augmented antibody responses against the original vaccine strain, demonstrating the presence of OAS between these two H5N1 HPAIV strains. On the other hand, induction of antibody responses against the HA of the secondary virus strain was not affected by the immune response against the HA of the primary virus strain, differing from the OAS observed for H1N1 human influenza viruses 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The phenomenon of OAS was first discovered over 50 years ago from studies on human infection with different strains of H1N1 influenza A viruses

 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Francis1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, which was further confirmed by subsequent studies of influenza infection and vaccination in humans as well as in animal models

 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Yarchoan1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Generally stated, OAS refers to an observation that after immunization or infection with one antigen, subsequent boosting with a second, related but heterologous antigen leads to induction of antibodies that react primarily with the first antigen rather than with the second antigen 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Haaheim1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. However, the underlying mechanism for the observed OAS phenomenon remains unclear. It has been suggested that heterologous boosting immunization may selectively boost memory B cells that produce cross-reactive antibodies and thus increase the level of antibody responses against the original HA antigen. At the same time, the cross-reactive memory B cells will compete with naïve B cells for the second HA antigen and thus dampen the induction of antibodies against the second HA antigen 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In this study, we observed that a heterologous boost augmented antibody responses against the primary strain as effectively as a homologous boost, similar as reported previously. However, we observed that induction of antibody responses against the second virus was not affected. Further, if the OAS is a result of boosting cross–reactive memory B cells, then it is expected that the antibody levels against the primary strain will be further increased after a second heterologous boost. In contrast, our results showed that a second heterologous boost significantly augmented antibody responses against the second strain but did not further increase the levels of antibody responses against the primary strain. Therefore, our results suggest that a different mechanism may be in play for the observed OAS phenomenon between these two HPAIV isolates. It is likely that the OAS between the QH and SX HA proteins is a result of reduced activation threshold of memory B cells, which are more easily stimulated by related and yet antigenically distinctive antigens as reported in early studies 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Klinman1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Fish1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. However, when memory B cells for both HA antigens are present, activation of memory B cells for the homologous antigen exhibits a dominant effect as observed after the second heterologous boost. Taken together, these results indicate that manifestation of OAS may vary between different virus strains depending on their antigenic differences. Of note, the OAS between the QH and SX HA in this study was observed by immunization with DNA vaccines, which express the only HA antigens. In studies on H1N1 human influenza viruses, Kim et al. demonstrated OAS between influenza viruses PR8 and FM1 in both immunizations with HA DNA vaccines and sequential sublethal infections and also showed that the OAS between these two viruses is more pronounced in sequential sublethal infections 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Thus, it is possible that the OAS between the QH and SX H5N1 HPAIVs may also be more prominent in other vaccine platforms such as inactivated virus vaccines or virus-like particles, as these complex vaccines also share other common antigens in addition to the HA which may drive the induction of immune responses further towards the original antigen. The complexity of the OAS and its potential impact on vaccine efficacy warrant further investigation.
