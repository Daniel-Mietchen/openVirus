<p>Since its first recorded outbreak in domestic poultry and humans in Hong Kong in 1997, H5N1 HPAIV has spread worldwide except in the Americas. As a result, H5N1 HPAIV has evolved into different genotypes that are antigenically distinctive from each other 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, how the diversification in antigenicity of HPAIV isolates affects their immunogenicity for eliciting cross-reactive antibodies is still not clear. In this study, we characterized immune responses induced by DNA vaccines of the HA from two H5N1 HPAIV isolates, the QH and SX viruses respectively. Our results show that the antibody responses induced by this pair of HA DNA vaccines in mice are not cross-reactive, demonstrating that the HA of these two H5N1 HPAIV strains are antigenically distinctive. On the other hand, cross-reactive CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were readily induced by both HA DNA vaccines, indicating that epitopes for CD4 and CD8 T cell responses are conserved between the HA of these two viruses. Interestingly, in characterization of the antibody responses induced by a heterologous prime-boost immunization regimen, we observed that a subsequent immunization with a heterologous HA DNA vaccine selectively boosted the antibody responses against the primary virus strain but not the secondary virus strain of which the HA DNA vaccine was used in boosting immunizations. These results demonstrate for the first time the existence of OAS between two phylogenetic clades of H5N1 HPAIV that both have caused large scale outbreaks in domestic poultry and are endemic in avian species.
