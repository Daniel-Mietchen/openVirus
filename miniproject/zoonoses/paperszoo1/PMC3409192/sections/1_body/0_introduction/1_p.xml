<p>Influenza virus infection causes serious respiratory illness, and seasonal human influenza epidemics are estimated to result in about 40,000 deaths and over 200,000 hospitalizations annually in the U.S. alone and up to 1.5 million deaths worldwide

 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Osterholm1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Influenza virus contains a segmented negative-strand RNA genome and are categorized into three different types (A, B, and C) based on the antigenic properties of its two internal proteins, nucleoprotein and matrix protein 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Cox1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Types B and C influenza viruses are primarily human pathogens, whereas the type A influenza virus exists in both humans and a number of animal species and has a natural reservoir in aquatic birds. Influenza A viruses are further divided into different subtypes based on their surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). To date, 16 subtypes of HA (H1–H16) and 9 subtypes of NA (N1–N9) glycoproteins have been identified in influenza A viruses. However, only 3 HA subtypes (H1–H3) and 2 NA subtypes (N1–N2) have been circulated and caused pandemic and seasonal influenza epidemics. Historically, three influenza A pandemics have occurred in the last century with the appearance of each new HA subtype

In March and April of 2009, outbreaks of a new H1N1 influenza virus in humans emerged in California of the United States and in Mexico, which subsequently spread worldwide and led to the declaration of a new influenza pandemic by WHO in June 2009 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Characterization of the new H1N1 influenza virus showed that it is of swine origin

 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The rapid spread of the new H1N1 influenza virus demonstrates that a new human influenza pandemic of zoonotic origin poses a real threat to the public health.
