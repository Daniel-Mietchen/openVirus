<p>Based on genetic analysis of the HA gene, H5N1 HPAIV isolates have been categorized into 10 different clades that exhibit different antigenic properties 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-WHO3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, information on cross reactivity of antibody responses between antigenically different H5N1 HPAIV isolates is still lacking. In this study, we investigated immune responses induced by HA DNA vaccines of two H5N1 HPAIV isolates, A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/3/2005 (QH) and A/chicken/Shanxi/2/2006 (SX), that are representatives of two HPAIV antigenic lineages clade 2.2 and clade 7 respectively 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The QH virus was isolated in an outbreak in the Qinghai Lake of China in 2005 that caused massive deaths of wild birds 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, whereas the SX virus was isolated in an outbreak in Shanxi, China in farm poultry in 2006 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Chen3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Both viruses are highly pathogenic to domestic chickens and the HA proteins contain a polybasic amino acid segment that is characteristic of H5N1 HPAIV. Their HA protein sequence differs by about 7% and we recently reported that these two viruses do not exhibit significant cross reactivity in chicken 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In this study, we further investigated the immunogenicities of the QH and SX HA DNA vaccines in mice. Our results show that the HA of these two viruses are antigenically distinctive in mice. Interestingly, by carrying out heterologous priming-boosting immunizations, we observed that boosting with a heterologous HA effectively augmented antibody responses to the HA of the priming virus strain but not to the HA of the boosting virus strain, indicating the existence of original antigenic sin (OAS) between these two concurrently circulating H5N1 HPAIV strains.
