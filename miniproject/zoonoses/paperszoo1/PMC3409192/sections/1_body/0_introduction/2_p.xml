<p>Several subtypes of avian influenza virus have also been postulated to possess pandemic potential and the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) is of particular concern 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Yen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The first human outbreak of H5N1 HPAIV occurred in 1997 in Hongkong, China as a result of direct avian-to-human transmission that led to 18 human infections with 6 deaths 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Claas1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Subbarao1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. While massive culling of poultry effectively controlled human outbreak for several years, H5N1 HPAIV remained endemic in poultry species in Southern China

 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Webster1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In late 2003, new human outbreaks of H5N1 HPAIV occurred in the Southeast Asia 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-SturmRamirez1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and the virus has since then spread to Europe and Africa, causing over 600 human infections with 356 deaths as of May, 2012 according to the World Health Organization 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-WHO2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The ability of H5N1 HPAIV to directly infect humans with a high fatality rate (almost 60%) makes it a great threat as a causative agent for a potential new influenza pandemic. Moreover, the evolution of H5N1 HPAIV in wild birds and farm poultry has resulted in concurrent circulation of diverse virus strains with distinctive antigenic properties 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and H5N1 HPAIV of different antigenic lineages has been reported to cause direct infection in humans 
 <xref rid="pone.0041332-ONeill1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The high sequence variation in circulating H5N1 HPAIV poses a great challenge for the development of a vaccine strategy for the control of a potential H5N1 pandemic.
