  <title>Schematic diagram of immunization study design.</title>
  <p>Five groups of mice (groups of 6) were immunized with different regimens of QH and/or SX H5N1 HA DNA vaccines as indicated. Group QH and SX were immunized four times with the same HA DNA vaccine. Groups QH/SX and SX/QH were first immunized two times with the HA DNA vaccine of one virus strain and then boosted two times with the HA DNA vaccine of the other virus strain. Group C were immunized with control plasmid vector pCAGGS. All immunizations were carried out by intramuscular injection of 50 Âµg DNA vaccines at 4-week intervals. Blood samples were collected at two weeks after each immunization and were designated by the number (1, 2, 3, or 4) following the designated name of each group as used in subsequent figures. Mice were sacrificed at two-weeks after the final immunization to prepare splenocytes for analysis of T cell responses.</p>
