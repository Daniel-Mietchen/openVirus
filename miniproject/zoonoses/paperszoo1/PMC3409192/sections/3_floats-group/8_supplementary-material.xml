   <bold>Characterization of QH and SX HA expression by DNA vaccines.</bold> HeLa cells were grown to confluence in a six-well plate and then transfected by QH or SX HA DNA vaccines using Lipofectamine2000. At 24 hr post transfection, cell lysate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Expression of the HA proteins was detected using a mixture of mouse sera against QH and SX HA as primary antibodies and HRP-conjugated goat-anti-mouse antibodies as secondary antibodies. Lane C, Control transfection by DNA vector pCAGGS; lane QH, transfection by QH HA DNA vaccine; lane SX, transfection by SX HA DNA vaccine.
