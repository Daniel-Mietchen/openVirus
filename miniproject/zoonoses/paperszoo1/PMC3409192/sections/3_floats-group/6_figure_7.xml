  <title>Similar levels of CD8 and CD4 T cell responses against HA were induced by different DNA immunization regimens.</title>
  <p>Mice were immunized as described in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041332-g001">Figure 1</xref>. At two weeks after the final immunization, mice were sacrificed and splenocytes were prepared for analysis of T cell responses by intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Comparison of CD8+ T cell responses induced in mice after DNA immunizations. Splenocytes were stimulated with a peptide corresponding to known CD8+ T cell epitopes in HA for 6 h in the presence of Brefeldin A, and then stained for cell surface CD8 as well as intracellular IFN-γ, followed by flow cytometry analysis. The percentages of IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T cells in splenocytes from each individual mouse after stimulation are shown. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Comparison of CD4+ T cell responses induced in mice after DNA immunizations. Splenocytes from immunized mice were stimulated with dendritic cells that have been pulsed with different VLPs as indicated. After 6 h stimulation in the presence of Brefeldin A, the cells were stained for cell surface CD4 as well as intracellular IFN-γ, followed by flow cytometry analysis. The percentages of IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells in splenocytes from each individual mouse after stimulation are shown. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation.
