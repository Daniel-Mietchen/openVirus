  <title>Antibody responses against the primary virus train were effectively boosted by a single heterologous HA DNA immunization.</title>
  <p>Blood samples collected from Groups QH/SX and SX/QH after the first heterologous boost immunization were analyzed for antibody responses against the primary virus strain, QH or SX viruses respectively, from which the HA DNA vaccine was used in priming immunizations. The results were compared with Groups QH or SX respectively that received homologous boosting immunizations. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Antibody responses against the QH virus. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Antibody responses against the SX virus. (
   <bold>c</bold>) HAI activity against the QH virus. (
   <bold>d</bold>) HAI activity against the SX virus. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. Dashed lines indicate detection limit for HAI titer (1∶20).
