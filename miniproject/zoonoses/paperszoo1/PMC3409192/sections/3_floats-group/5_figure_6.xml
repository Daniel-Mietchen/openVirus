  <title>Antibody responses against the original virus strain were not enhanced by the second boost with a heterologous HA DNA vaccine.</title>
  <p>Blood samples collected from Groups QH/SX and SX/QH after the first and second heterologous boost immunization were analyzed for antibody responses against the primary virus strain (QH or SX virus respectively) from which the HA DNA vaccine was used in priming immunizations, in comparison with sera collected from Groups QH or SX respectively after the third and fourth immunizations with the HA DNA vaccine of the primary virus strain. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Antibody responses against the QH virus. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Antibody responses against the SX virus. (
   <bold>c</bold>) HAI activity against the QH virus. (
   <bold>d</bold>) HAI activity against the SX virus. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. Dashed lines indicate detection limit for HAI titer (1∶20).
