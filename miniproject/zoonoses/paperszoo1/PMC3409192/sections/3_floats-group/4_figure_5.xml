  <title>A second boost with the heterologous HA DNA vaccine augmented antibody responses against the second virus strain.</title>
  <p>Blood samples collected from Groups QH/SX and SX/QH after the second heterologous boost immunization were analyzed for antibody responses against the second virus strain (QH or SX virus respectively) in comparison with sera collected from Groups SX or QH respectively after two immunizations with the SX or QH HA DNA vaccines. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Antibody responses against the QH virus. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Antibody responses against the SX virus. (
   <bold>c</bold>) HAI activity against the QH virus. (
   <bold>d</bold>) HAI activity against the SX virus. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. Dashed lines indicate detection limit for HAI titer (1∶20).
