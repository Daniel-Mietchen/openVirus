  <title>Characterization of antibody responses induced by QH and SX H5N1 HA DNA vaccines.</title>
  <p>Blood samples from mice vaccinated with QH (Group QH) or SX (Group SX) HA DNA vaccines were collected after each immunization and analyzed for antibody responses against homologous as well as heterologous viruses. The levels of antibody responses in serum samples were determined by ELISA using purified inactivated QH or SX virus as coating antigens as indicated, and expressed as the amount of virus-specific antibodies in 1 ml of serum samples (ng/ml). The HAI activity (HAI titer) was determined as the highest serum dilution that resulted in complete inhibition of hemagglutination by inactivated QH or SX virus as indicated. (
