  <title>A heterologous HA DNA boosting induced similar levels of antibodies against the second virus strain as a single immunization with the HA DNA vaccine of the second strain.</title>
  <p>Blood samples collected from Groups QH/SX and SX/QH after the first heterologous boost immunization were analyzed for antibody responses against the second virus strain, SX or QH viruses respectively, from which the HA DNA vaccine was used in boosting immunizations. The results were compared with Groups SX or QH respectively after a single immunization. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Antibody responses against the SX virus. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Antibody responses against the QH virus. Data are presented as the mean Â± standard deviation.
