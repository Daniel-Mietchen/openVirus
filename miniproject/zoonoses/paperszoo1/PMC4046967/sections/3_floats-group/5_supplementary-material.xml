   <bold>Table S1.</bold> List of leptospires characterized in rodents from seven localities in Thailand, Lao PDR and Cambodia. 
   <italic>Leptospira</italic> species identification relied on 
   <italic>rrs</italic> gene sequencing. We also indicate information about molecular results of the 
   <italic>secY</italic> gene sequencing (strain A to G), MLVA typing and capture data. ND: non-determined, FL: floodable lands; NFL: non-floodable lands, F: forest, HD: human dwellings. 
   <bold>Table S2.</bold> List of reference and clinical strains used in this study. We indicate information about species, serogroup, host, sampling and molecular results of the 
   <italic>secY</italic> gene sequencing (alleles A to G) and MLVA typing. ND = non-determined. 
   <bold>Table S3.</bold> General Linear Model of rodent infection by 
   <italic>Leptospira borgpetersenii</italic> with binomial distribution and logit link function (Log-Likelihood Type 1 Test). Selection of the best model using AIC criterion, with initial model with locality, habitat, species, sex and maturity as explicative variables 
   <bold>Table S4.</bold> General Linear Model of rodent infection by 
   <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic> with binomial distribution and logit link function (Log- Likelihood Type 1 Test). Selection of the best model using AIC criterion, with initial model with locality, habitat, species, sex and maturity as explicative variables.
