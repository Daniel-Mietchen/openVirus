<p>Whether environmental conditions (outside the host) determine 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> species distribution in nature remains largely unexplored. Ganoza et al. 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Ganoza1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> showed differential distribution of isolates in urban or rural water sources in Peru, reflecting rates found among human isolates from both urban and rural settings. Perez et al 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Perez1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> demonstrated that seasonal variations influence 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> prevalence in rats and mice from New Caledonia. Very little data has been published concerning the epidemiology of both 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> in humans and wildlife, however some human epidemiology reports suggest that 
 <italic>L. interrogans</italic> is commonly acquired from contaminated surface water, whereas a host-to-host transmission cycle is more likely to occur for 
 <italic>L. borgpetersenii</italic>
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Bulach1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. However our results suggest a lower transmission risk from rodents to humans for local 
 <italic>L. borgpetersenii</italic> strains, in comparison with 
 <italic>L. interrogans</italic> strains.
