<p>Another insight of our study is that the two most abundant 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> species, 
 <italic>L. interrogans</italic> and 
 <italic>L. borgpetersenii</italic>, both of which are of great significance to human disease in Asia 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Thaipadungpanit1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Laras1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Benacer1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Vedhagiri1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, may have different epidemiological cycles. 
 <italic>L. interrogans</italic> infection in rodents was restricted to humid habitats while 
 <italic>L. borgpetersenii</italic> infection was equally frequent in both humid and dry habitats. This new ecological data on rodents is consistent with previous data gained from experimental and genomic studies. Experimental data suggest that survival in water is highly reduced for some strains of 
 <italic>L. borgpetersenii</italic> when compared to 
 <italic>L. interrogans</italic>. 
 <italic>L. borgpetersenii</italic> serovar Hardjo lost &gt;90% viability after 48 h in water, whereas 
 <italic>L. interrogans</italic> retained 100% viability over the same period 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Bulach1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. 
 <italic>L. interrogans</italic> would thus be able to survive in such an environment, especially in surface water, allowing transmission from contaminated water. Whereas 
 <italic>L. borgpetersenii</italic> would not survive outside its host, forcing direct host-to-host transmission. This difference in ecological niche is reflected in the genomic composition of the two species. 
 <italic>L. borgpetersenii</italic> serovar Hardjo strains have a smaller genome than 
 <italic>L. interrogans</italic>. Genome rearrangement in these strains of 
 <italic>L. borgpetersenii</italic> mainly affect the ability to sense the external environment, which may indicate that these strains are in the process of becoming specialized for direct transmission. In contrast, 
 <italic>L. interrogans</italic> has many environmental sensing genes and exhibits large shifts in protein expression when moved from a natural environment-like medium to a host-like medium 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Eshghi1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. While we cannot presume that the change reported by Bulach et al. 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Bulach1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> is representative of all 
 <italic>L. borgpetersenii</italic> strains or is only restricted to certain strains, their study demonstrates that genome composition and habitat preference may largely differ across strains and species. These 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> results are consistent with our ecological observations.
