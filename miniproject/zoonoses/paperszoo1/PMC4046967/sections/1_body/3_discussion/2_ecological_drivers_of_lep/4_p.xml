<p>Finally we discuss any of the present study's limitations, which may mitigate some of the above interpretations. As reported in other agricultural systems (see 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Gauffre1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Bonnet1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> for instance) rodents may move among habitats, either as part of the dispersal process (i.e. the movement of an organism from its birth place to its first breeding site, or from one breeding site to another), or in response to the seasonal variation in habitat quality (i.e. amount of food, shelter availability, competition with other rodents, predation etc.). In the case of Southeast Asian rodents, one can imagine seasonal movements between flooded and non-flooded habitats, or between other habitats, but we lack data on these movements, which have not been the subject of publication to our knowledge. Because these movements may involve rodents infected with 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic>, this process could have important consequences on 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> distributions within Southeast Asian agricultural landscapes (see 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Guivier1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> for an example of the importance of rodent movements for the epidemiology of a rodent-borne hantavirus in Europe). As has already been pointed out by Singleton and collaborators 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Singleton1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, more data is needed on the ecology of rodents in Southeast Asia, and such data would probably significantly increase our understanding of 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> epidemiology.
