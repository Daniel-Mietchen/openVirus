<p>Additionally, rodent susceptibility to 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection did not significantly vary across rodent species. Most rodent species were found to be infected by 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> and our statistical modelling did not highlight “species” as a significant factor explaining 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection. The observed variation in prevalence across rodent species is most probably an indirect consequence of their specific habitat requirements. For instance the Pacific rat, 
 <italic>Rattus exulans</italic>, was rarely found infected, but this probably results from its close association with human dwellings where 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> prevalence is consistently lower than in other habitats. Although rarely documented, the different rodent species investigated here display clear habitat preferences

 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Bordes2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Some species are more abundant in rain-fed paddy fields (
 <italic>Bandicota indica, R. argentiventer</italic>) or forests (
 <italic>Leopoldamys edwardsi, Maxomys surifer</italic>) or non-flooded fields (
 <italic>Mus cervicolor, Mus cooki</italic>). In line with other studies

 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Herbreteau2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, our results confirmed the importance of 
 <italic>Bandicota</italic> and 
 <italic>Rattus</italic> species as hosts for 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> strains of human health importance. However, high prevalence of pathogenic species and strains were also observed in rarely investigated rodents such as forest species (
 <italic>Berylmys sp.</italic>, 
 <italic>Maxomys sp.</italic>) and wild mice (
 <italic>Mus sp.</italic>). This observation suggests that rodent reservoirs for human leptospirosis are probably more diverse than previously thought (see
