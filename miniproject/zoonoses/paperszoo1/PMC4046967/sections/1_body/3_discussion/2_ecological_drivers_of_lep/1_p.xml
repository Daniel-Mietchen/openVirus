<p>Most research on the presence of leptospires in rodents has been conducted in urban areas, or rural areas in the vicinity of households

 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Ivanova1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Our study suggested that the mean prevalence in rodents across localities was approximately 10%, when we excluded rodents trapped in human dwellings where prevalence was very low (2%). 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> prevalence was similar between floodable areas, forests and non-floodable agricultural fields. Our results then challenge the widely accepted belief that leptospires mainly circulate in wetlands. Two potential leptospirosis transmission routes are generally assumed; direct transmission between individuals, or via the external environment. The relative importance of these routes in rodents is unknown; however, our results suggest that direct transmission could explain the circulation of leptospires in dry habitats.
