<p>Individual variation in susceptibility to infection is a common outcome of epidemiological studies. In the context of pathogenesis, infection may vary with numerous individual features such as sex, age, physiological condition, behavior and immunogenetics

 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Keeling1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Statistical analyses of our dataset revealed that males were clearly more susceptible to 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> infections than females, consistent with many reports on vertebrate infections 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Differing infection rates observed due to sex might result from endocrine-immune interactions. Androgens have immunosuppressive effects, explaining the reduced efficiency of the male immune system and its association with higher infection rates. Moreover, steroid hormones alter rodent behavior which then influences susceptibility to infection. Males of most mammals are more aggressive than females, more likely to disperse, and have larger home ranges with more intense foraging activities; all these behaviors cause increased pathogen exposure.
