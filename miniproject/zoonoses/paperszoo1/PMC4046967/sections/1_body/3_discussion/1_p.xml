<p>Using a combination of molecular and ecological data, we have been able to document the circulation of 
 <italic>Leptospira spp.</italic> within Southeast Asian rodent communities. We were able to determine the genotypes of isolates infecting rodents, by direct amplification of kidney DNA, without the need to culture the pathogen. Our data support the premise that rodent infection is mainly driven by habitat rather than rodent species. Moreover, the two most abundant 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> species have contrasting habitat requirements: 
 <italic>L. interrogans</italic> is restricted to humid habitats (rice fields, forests and floodable lands) while 
 <italic>L. borgpetersenii</italic> was equally abundant in floodable lands, forests and non-floodable lands. Finally, two leptospiral strains were found in common between humans and rodents, consistent with the theory that rodents transmit the disease to humans 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Thaipadungpanit1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Therefore, human infection risk may not just be limited to wetlands, as currently believed. The circulation of 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> species is also high in forested and non-floodable lands, suggesting that human activities like forest work, hunting and preparing rodents for their consumption, deserve more attention in future epidemiological studies.
