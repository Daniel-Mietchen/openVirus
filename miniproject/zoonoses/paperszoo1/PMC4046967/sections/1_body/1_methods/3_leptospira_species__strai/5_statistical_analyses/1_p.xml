<p>We investigated the effects of host species, sex, maturity (young 
 <italic>vs</italic> adult) and environmentally-linked variables (habitat and locality) on the infection status of individual rodents. Statistical logistic regressions were performed with the R statistical platform using the package MuMIn v.1.7.2 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Barton1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and lme4 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Bates1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Model selection was performed using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Burnham1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The model with the lowest AIC value was viewed as the most parsimonious, i.e. the model which explains the majority of variance with the fewest parameters 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Burnham1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The significance of each explanatory variable was tested using Wald tests based on z values.
