<p>Conventional PCR assays targeting the 
 <italic>rrs</italic> gene were performed on positive RT-PCR samples (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002902.s001">Text S1</xref>). We first used primers A and B 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Mrien1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and, if the PCR was negative, we performed a second round of amplification with the inner primers C and RS4. All samples were also amplified for 
 <italic>secY</italic> as previously described 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Ahmed1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The 
 <italic>rrs</italic> and 
 <italic>secY</italic> PCR products were sequenced at the Platform Genotyping of Pathogens and Public Health (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France).
