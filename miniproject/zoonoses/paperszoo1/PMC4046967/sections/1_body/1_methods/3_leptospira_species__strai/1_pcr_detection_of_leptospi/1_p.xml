<p>Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting 
 <italic>lipL32</italic> and 
 <italic>βactin</italic> genes were performed on rodent kidney DNA, extracted with Bio Basic EZ-10 96 Well Plate genomic DNA isolation kit for animals and the Qiagen DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit. Following alignment of 
 <italic>βactin</italic> gene sequences of Asian rodents 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Badenhorst1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, the 
 <italic>βactin</italic> primers (forward: 
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′-CCA TGA AAC TAC ATT CAA TTC CA-3′</named-content>; reverse: 
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′-TTC TGC ATC CTG TCA GCA A-3′</named-content>) and probe (
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′-AGA CCT CTA TGC CAA CAC AGT GCT G-3′</named-content>) were designed using the highly conserved fifth exon sequence along with the Probe Design software for Light Cycler LC480 (Roche). 
 <italic>βactin</italic> was used as an internal control for the RT-PCR. The Taqman

 <italic>Leptospira</italic>
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Haake1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, was performed as previously described by Stoddard et al. 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Stoddard1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The amplification was performed on a Light Cycler 480 thermocycler (Roche). A Ct&lt;40 for the
