<p>Within localities, samplings were conducted over an area of about 10 kilometers squared. Four main habitats were distinguished, namely 1) forested (rubber and teak plantations, secondary and primary forest); 2) non-floodable lands (shrubby wasteland, young plantations, orchards), (3) floodable lands (cultivated floodplains, rice fields), and (4) human dwellings (in villages or cities). For each habitat, 10 trapping lines, which each consisted of 10 wire live-traps (hand-made locally, about 40×12×12 cm) every five meters, were installed over a period of four days. Additional captures were also conducted by locals. Captured rodents were collected each day and taken back to the laboratory for dissection according to the protocol of Herbreteau et al.
