<p>Where possible, rodent species were determined in the field using morphological criteria from Pages et al. 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Pags1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, but as morphological criteria were not fully discriminant between some genera, molecular approaches were also carried out. The 
 <italic>mt</italic> gene was used for barcoding 
 <italic>Mus</italic> species and some 
 <italic>Rattus</italic> species (
 <italic>R. tanezumi, R argentiventer, R. sakeratensis, R. adamanensis</italic>) 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Galan1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In accordance with Pages et al 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Pags2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, the 
 <italic>mt</italic> lineages “
 <italic>Rattus</italic> lineage II” and “
 <italic>Rattus</italic> lineage IV” of Aplin et al 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Aplin1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, were considered as conspecifics and named 
 <italic>R. tanezumi</italic>. Barcoded samples were identified using the webservice RodentSEA 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Clairon1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.
