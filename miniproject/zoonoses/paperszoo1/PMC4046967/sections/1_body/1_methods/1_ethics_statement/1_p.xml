 <italic>Leptospira</italic> cultures from human patients analyzed in this study were previously isolated by the Mahidol University in Thailand as part of the national surveillance for leptospirosis. The strains and DNA samples derived from these cultures were analyzed anonymously for this research study. Systematic field sampling was carried out by joint Asian and French research institute teams. Traps were set within houses with the approval of the owner or tenant. Outdoors, traps were set with the agreement of the village chief. None of the rodent species investigated are on the CITES list, nor the Red List (IUCN). Animals were treated in accordance with the guidelines of the American Society of Mammalogists, and with the European Union legislation (Directive 86/609/EEC). Each trapping campaign was validated by the national, regional and local health authorities. Approval notices for trapping and investigation of rodents were given by the Ministry of Health Council of Medical Sciences, National Ethics Committee for Health Research (NHCHR) Lao PDR, number 51/NECHR, and by the Ethical Committee of Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand, number 0517.1116/661. Cambodia has no ethics committee overseeing animal experimentation. The ANR-SEST (
 <italic>Agence Nationale pour la Recherche, Santé-Environnement et Santé-Travail</italic>) program on rodent-born diseases in Southeast Asia, which provided part of the funding for this project, has been approved by the Managing Directors from both the Asian and French research institutes. In addition, regional approval was obtained from the regional Head of Veterinary Service (Hérault, France), for the sampling and killing of rodents and the harvesting of their tissues (approval no. B 34-169-1) carried out during this study.
