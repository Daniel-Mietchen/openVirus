<p>Limited research has been conducted on the distribution of leptospires in both the environment and in reservoir species. Many species can act as reservoirs, but wild rodents are usually considered to be the main reservoirs for human leptospirosis. Rodents generally acquire leptospirosis as pups, and maintain it as a chronic infection in the renal tubules, excreting bacteria in their urine throughout their life span, often in increasing amounts

 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Ganoza1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> showed that the concentration and species of leptospires found in environmental surface water correlated with the risk of severe leptospirosis in humans. However, whether leptospiral species have different natural habitat and landscape distribution requirements remains largely unexplored.
