<p>An additional problem is the limited understanding surrounding basic aspects of the disease epidemiology. Leptospirosis is caused by infection with members of the genus 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> that includes nine pathogenic species and at least five intermediate species 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002902-Al1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Most cases of human leptospirosis, however, are not identified at the species, serogroup, or serovar level, hindering environmental risk awareness. In addition to studies aimed at understanding leptospirosis from a genetic standpoint, there have been numerous attempts to understand its transmission. Exposure to virulent leptospires may be direct, via contact with urine or tissues from infected animals, or indirect, where freshwater or humid environments are contaminated with an infected animal's urine. Socio-economic variables and occupations such as mining, cleaning sewers, working in a slaughterhouse, farming, and cattle breeding are known to increase the risk of contracting leptospirosis in Southeast Asia
