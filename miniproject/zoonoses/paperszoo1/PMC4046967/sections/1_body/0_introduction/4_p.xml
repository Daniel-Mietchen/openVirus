<p>In the present study, we aimed to (1) describe 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> prevalence, species and strains in rodents from seven localities in Southeast Asia (Thailand, Laos PDR and Cambodia); (2) compare isolates from humans living in regions where rodents were sampled; (3) determine whether certain habitats or rodent species increase the prevalence of infection with specific 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> species. Finally, we discuss the outcomes from this combination of approaches, and their implication for infection routes and environmental risks for humans.
