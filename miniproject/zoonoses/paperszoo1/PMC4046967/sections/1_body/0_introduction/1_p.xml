<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the global burden of leptospirosis at over one million severe human cases per year, with a growing number of countries reporting leptospirosis outbreaks

In addition, many cases occur in tropical locations without adequate health care, surveillance and reporting, these factors are therefore likely to influence an underestimation of case numbers. For example, Thailand, which has a relatively good health system, reports several thousand cases of leptospirosis each year, while its neighbors, Cambodia and Lao PDR, report very few. This discrepancy is almost certainly due to under-reporting
