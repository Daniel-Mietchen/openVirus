<p>Statistical analysis revealed that rodent locality, habitat and sex, significantly affected individual infection (
 <xref rid="pntd-0002902-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Rodents living in households showed significantly lower infection rates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002902-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Males were significantly more likely to be infected than females (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002902-g003">Figure 3</xref>). By contrast, rodent species showed no correlation with infection. As there was potential non-independence between the distributions of rodent species among habitats; as three species are strictly restricted to households; we re-analyzed the data after removing all household rodent data. We found similar results (data not shown), again with significant effects due to locality and sex, but not species, indicating that those species living outside human dwellings have an overall similar level of infection.
