<p>Two

 <italic>L. interrogans</italic> were recovered from both rodents and humans (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002902.s001">Text S1</xref>). The 
 <italic>secY</italic> C allele was recovered from the wild mouse, 
 <italic>M. cookie</italic>, from Loei, northern Thailand. This allele had previously been characterized from the ST34 clone, which corresponds to a Autumnalis serogroup human isolate associated with the northern Thailand outbreak between 1999 and 2003 (Thaipadungpanit et al. 2007). Secondly, the 
 <italic>secY</italic> D allele (MLVA pattern 640/750/650) of the Pyrogenes serogroup was found in both rodent and human samples from Loei, northern Thailand.
