<p>The 
 <italic>rrs</italic> PCR assay was performed on the 64 samples which were positive for 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic>. After 25 of these samples returned negative results following direct PCR, they were then analyzed by nested PCR. All PCR products were then sequenced and the 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> species were categorized based on phylogenetic analysis of the 
 <italic>rrs</italic> fragment. Four species were determined: 
 <italic>L. borgpetersenii</italic> (n = 36), 
 <italic>L. interrogans</italic> (n = 25), 
 <italic>L. kirschneri</italic> (n = 2) and 
 <italic>L. weilli</italic> (n = 1).
