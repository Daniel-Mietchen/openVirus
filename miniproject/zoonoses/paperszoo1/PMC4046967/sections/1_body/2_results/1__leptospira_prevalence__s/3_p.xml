<p>The amplification of 
 <italic>secY</italic> was successful in 31 of the 64 samples positive for 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic>, including 20 
 <italic>L. borgpetersenii</italic> and 11 
 <italic>L. interrogans</italic>. No amplification could be detected for 
 <italic>L. kirschneri</italic> and 
 <italic>L. weilli</italic>. Lack of amplification was probably due to low levels of 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> DNA in the samples. The alignment of the 549-bp 
 <italic>secY</italic> fragments distinguished a total of eight distinct alleles (GenBank accession numbers: KF770694-KF770731), including two alleles for 
 <italic>L. borgpetersenii</italic> (A and B) and six for 
 <italic>L. interrogans</italic> (C to H). There was no clear association between 
 <italic>secY</italic>-identified strains and either locality or rodent species (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002902.s001">Text S1</xref>). MLVA positively identified 15 of the 25 tested samples, which were positive for 
 <italic>L. interrogans</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002902.s001">Text S1</xref>). The MLVA patterns are in close agreement with the alleles determined by 
 <italic>secY</italic> sequencing. Comparison with our reference strains indicates that our samples share an identical 
 <italic>secY</italic> sequence and MLVA profile to strains of the Canicola, Pyrogenes and Autumnalis serogroups (
