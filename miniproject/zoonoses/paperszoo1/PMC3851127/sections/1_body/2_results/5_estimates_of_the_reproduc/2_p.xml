<p>Among the 130 A/H7N9 patients reported by 26 May 2013, in mainland China, three family clusters ranging in size from two to three were identified, with onset dates between 11 February and 21 March [see Additional file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>; see also [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]]. Of the 130 cases, 67% reported a history of poultry exposure (88/122; eight have unknown exposure information), including 47% of patients who visited live bird markets (37/79, 51 unknown). Based on the proportion of new infections presumed to arise directly from the poultry reservoir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], we can estimate R is approximately 1–0.67 = 0.23 (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). An upper bound for R is provided by assuming a stricter definition of exposure solely based on exposure to live bird markets (the hypothetical reservoir), which yields an upper R estimate of 1–0.47 = 0.53.
