<p>Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> illustrates the course of the A/H7N9 epidemic by date of symptom onset in Zhejiang and Shanghai provinces from 19 February to 26 May 2013. Overall, 71.4% (50/70) of the influenza A/H7N9 cases reported in these provinces were associated with exposure to poultry and/or live bird markets (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> present the progression of the outbreak separately in Shanghai (n = 33) and Zhejiang (n = 45). The incidence accelerated around 27 March 2013 in Shanghai (the first of three consecutive days with non-zero cases), and approximately two weeks later in Zhejiang on 8 April 2013.
