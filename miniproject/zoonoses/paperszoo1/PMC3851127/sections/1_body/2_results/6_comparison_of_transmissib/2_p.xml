<p>We compiled R estimates for zoonotic influenza viruses that episodically cause human infections, in particular for avian-origin A/H5N1 and swine-origin A/H3N2v. Estimates in the range 0.52 to 0.54 have been proposed for A/H5N1 in Thailand and Indonesia, based on a Bayesian approach similar to that used here [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Using the ratio of secondary infections to primary cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], we obtain R approximately 0.29 in this period of relatively intense H5N1 activity.
