<p>A sensitivity analysis on the prior distribution for 
 <italic>R</italic> confirmed that there was high uncertainty in the posterior estimates of 
 <italic>R</italic> [see Additional file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1]. However, the posterior mean of R and upper 95% credible interval remained below the epidemic threshold (R = 1) as epidemiological data accumulated, no matter the prior. Further, estimates were robust to assumptions regarding variance in case count data [see Additional file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S2].
