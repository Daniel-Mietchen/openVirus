<p>Importantly, simulations show a substantial change between prior R distribution (centered at 0.2, as in our main analysis) and posterior R distributions, when the true R is above 0.6 [see Additional file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S3]. This suggests that if the true R was above 0.6 for A/H7N9, we would have detected a greater change in posterior distribution than we did in the observed outbreak data. Finally, our simulation studies indicate that the proportion of A/H7N9 patients arising from human-to-human transmission is approximately equal to R, when 0.1 ≤ R ≤0.9 [see Additional file
