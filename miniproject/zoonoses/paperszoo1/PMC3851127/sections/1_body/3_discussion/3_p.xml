<p>Alternative estimation approaches based on individual level contact tracing and prior exposure suggest a range of R of 0.03 to 0.53, in line with a recent modeling study analyzing the cluster size distribution of A/H7N9 cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These low R estimates are consistent with the results of intense efforts by the Chinese health authorities to monitor contacts of infected cases, which have so far revealed only limited instances of secondary transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. While the occurrence of three (perhaps four) family clusters of A/H7N9 cases is consistent with short chains of human to human transmission, these clusters do not rule out exposure to common environmental or animal sources. Taken together, information from contact surveys [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and available R estimates are consistent with a predominance of spillover events from a hypothetical reservoir.
