<p>In the context of subcritical outbreaks (R &lt;1), alternative methods based on contact tracing and exposure information are attractive, although they depend heavily on prior knowledge of the ecology of the disease. These methods rely on estimates of the proportions of cases arising from human-to-human transmission versus direct exposure to the reservoir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and, hence, assume that the reservoir is well known and that onset dates and serial intervals can be accurately determined. Further, methods relying on cluster size distribution are more sensitive to reporting schemes than growth rate methods (for example, if clusters are more likely to be reported once a family member is infected) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].
