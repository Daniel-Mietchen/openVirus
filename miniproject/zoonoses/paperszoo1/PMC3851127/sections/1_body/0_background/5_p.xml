<p>In the case of an emerging infection, obtaining near real time estimates of R is essential to guide intervention strategies. Bayesian estimation approaches [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] are naturally well-suited for situations where epidemiological data are gradually accumulating, due to their flexibility to incorporate prior information. In these approaches, prior information is sequentially updated as more complete outbreak data become available, providing posterior distributions of the epidemiological parameters of interest [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In contrast, more traditional 'epidemic curve fittingâ€™ approaches have been typically used to provide retrospective estimates of 
 <italic>R</italic> once the outbreak is over [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Alternative estimation approaches are based on detailed individual-level information on prior exposure to suspected animal reservoirs and/or contact with infected patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].
