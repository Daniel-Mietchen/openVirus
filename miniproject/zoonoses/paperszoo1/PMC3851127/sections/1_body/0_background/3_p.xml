<p>Preliminary studies suggest a low incidence of A/H7N9 infection in chickens and pigeons in affected areas [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Nevertheless, live bird markets were preemptively closed and sick birds culled since 6 April 2013 in Shanghai and 16 April 2013 in Zhejiang, which may have slowed down the progression of the outbreak [
