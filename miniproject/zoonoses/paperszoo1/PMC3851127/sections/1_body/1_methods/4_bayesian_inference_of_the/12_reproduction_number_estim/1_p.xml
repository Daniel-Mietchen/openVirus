<p>As a complementary method to estimate the R for influenza A/H7N9, we used an approach recently developed by Cauchemez 
 <italic>et al</italic>. for zoonotic infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In this approach, R = 1-p, where p is the estimated proportion of infected patients arising from direct contact with the A/H7N9 reservoir (scenario 1 in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]). This approach provides a conservative upper bound on R as it assumes that case detection probability is independent of cluster allocation (while in general, once an index case is identified, other infections in the family are more likely to be detected). This is a reasonable approach when human-to-human transmission is low [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].
