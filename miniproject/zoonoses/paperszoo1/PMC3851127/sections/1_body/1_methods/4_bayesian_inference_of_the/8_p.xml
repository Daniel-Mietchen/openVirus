<p>To compute numerically the posterior of R at each daily iteration, we use EquationÂ 5, relying on the posterior from the previous day as the new prior, following [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The posterior R distribution was evaluated using 1,000 discrete bins between 0 and 1.5.
