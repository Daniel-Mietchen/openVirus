<p>We have to set an initial prior on R to initialize the sequential approach at 
 <italic>t</italic> = 0, which can reflect any 
 <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge of the disease. Based on preliminary R estimates derived from the exposure history of A/H7N9 patients (see below), we assumed normal distributions centered around 0.2 (SD = 0.2) and 0.5 (SD = 0.2) as initial priors for R; both distributions were left-truncated at 0. We also consider a more extreme prior center at R = 1 in Additional file
