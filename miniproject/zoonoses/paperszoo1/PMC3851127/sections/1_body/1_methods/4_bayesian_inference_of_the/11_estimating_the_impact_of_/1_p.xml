<p>To estimate the impact of live bird market closures in the most affected provinces of Shanghai and Zhejiang, we fit an exponential curve with intrinsic growth rate 
 <italic>r</italic> to the daily case time series in the pre-intervention period (before 6 April). We used a Negative Binomial log likelihood fit to account for over-dispersion in case counts. The 95% confidence intervals on the growth rate were determined from the range of values of 
 <italic>r</italic> that yield log L = log L_max - s^2/2 where s = 1.96, and L_max is the value of the likelihood at the best-fit value of 
 <italic>r</italic>[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Using the exponential model fit up to 6 April, we forecasted the expected number of A/H7N9 cases in subsequent weeks. We confronted the progression of reported cases past 6 April against that predicted by the pre-intervention model as an indication of the effectiveness of control measures.
