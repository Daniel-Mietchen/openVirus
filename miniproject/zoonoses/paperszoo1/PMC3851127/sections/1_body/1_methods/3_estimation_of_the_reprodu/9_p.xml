<p>In this approach, both the latent and infectious periods (1/γ, 1/κ) are fixed and, hence, the only parameter to be estimated is R. We made two different assumptions for the latent and infectious periods to illustrate a short infection process consistent with seasonal influenza [

 <sup>-1</sup> = 1.5 days and γ-
 <sup>1</sup> = 1.5 days, so that the generation interval is 3.0 days) and a longer infection process in line with descriptions of the prolonged course of A/H7N9 infections in humans (k
 <sup>-1</sup> = 3 days, γ-
 <sup>1</sup> = 3 days, so that the generation interval is 6.0 days) [
