<p>We adopted a sequential Bayesian framework combined with a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission model to estimate R for influenza A/H7N9 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Here, the theoretical R value is a fixed (unknown) quantity, and R estimates are updated in a sequential Bayesian framework as data accumulate over time. This approach was previously applied to study the dynamics of the A/H5N1 influenza outbreaks in Asia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], the 1918 influenza pandemic in San Francisco, USA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In this model, the population is assumed to be well-mixed. Susceptible individuals (S) come in contact with infectious individuals (I) and progress to the exposed stage (E) with an average latency period of k
 <sup>-1</sup> days. Exposed individuals (E) then progress to the infectious stage (I), with an average infectious period of Î³
 <sup>-1</sup> days. Both the latent and infectious periods are assumed to be exponentially distributed.
