<p>Previous studies in China also demonstrated that the transmission of HFRS was influenced by such environmental elements as elevation, precipitation, temperature, vegetation type, land use, and ENSO (

These studies have suggested that the climatic variables related to rodent population dynamics might serve as indicators for the risk of HFRS transmission. However, the quantitative relationship between climate variation and the transmission of HFRS remains to be determined, especially in northeastern China, where its incidence is higher than in other parts of China and where different weather and geographic characteristics prevail.
