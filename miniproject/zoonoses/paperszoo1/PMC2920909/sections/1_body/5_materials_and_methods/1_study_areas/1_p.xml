 <xref rid="b56-ehp-118-915" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al. 2007</xref>). From 1997 to 2007, Elunchun County (population size, 292,097) and Molidawahaner County (population size, 294,501), located in the east of the Da-Xing-An Mountains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ehp-118-915">Figure 1</xref>), reported the highest incidences of HFRS in China where the annual average incidence reached 59.69 and 61.12 per 100,000, respectively. Both are minority (non-Han Chinese) counties with tourist attractions, and endemic HFRS has had a considerable impact on tourism and economic development. Elunchun county has a frigid–temperate climate with windy, dry springs; rainy, sunny, short summers; and long, cold winters. Rain fall occurs mostly during the summer months between June and August. Almost half (48.9%) of the county is covered with forests. Molidawahaner county has a moderate–temperate climate with clearly delineated seasonal change. The annual rainfall is about 500 mm, with most of the rain fall in the summer months. Forestry and soybean agriculture are the main occupational activities in both counties.
