Associations between determinants and notifications of HFRS cases are presented as incidence rate ratios (IRRs) that were derived from estimated regression parameters from the final model.

Finally, the results from the empirical data during the period of January 1997 to December 2005 were used to develop the models, and data from January 2006 to December 2007 were used to validate the forecasting ability of the models. We used SPSS software (version 16.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) to perform all the analyses.
