<p>We summarized a description of climate variables and disease incidence and performed cross-correlation analysis to assess the associations between climate variables and the number of HFRS cases for a range of lags (
 <xref rid="b6-ehp-118-915" ref-type="bibr">Brockwell and Davis 2002</xref>). In this study, we included lags of up to 6 months and presented the climatic variables with the maximum correlation coefficients. Time-series Poisson regression analysis was used to examine the independent contribution of climatic variables to HFRS transmission. Time series analysis has been used extensively to study the association between climate variability and disease transmission (
