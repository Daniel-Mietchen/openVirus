<p>We performed time-series Poisson regression analysis that allowed for autocorrelation, seasonality, and lag effects after correcting for overdispersion (

 <xref rid="b25-ehp-118-915" ref-type="bibr">Hashizume et al. 2009</xref>). To control the impact of seasonality and long-term trends, we created indicator variables for “month” and “year” of onset in the model (
