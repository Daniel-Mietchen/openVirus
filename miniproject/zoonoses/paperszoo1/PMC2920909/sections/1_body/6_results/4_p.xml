<p>For Elunchun, the Poisson regression model showed that the occurrence of HFRS cases was first-order autoregressive. This findng indicated that the number of notified cases in the current month was related to the number of cases that occurred in the previous month (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ehp-118-915">Table 2</xref>). Seasonality and long-term trends were also significantly associated with HFRS notifications. More important, after controlling for the autocorrelation, seasonality, and long-term trend, rainfall at a lag of 3 months, LST at a lag of 4 months, RH at a lag of 3 months, and MEI at a lag of 4 months appeared to play significant roles in the transmission of HFRS. The final Poisson regression model suggests that a 1°C increase in the monthly mean LST may be associated with an 11.4% (95% CI, 1.8–21.9%) increase in HFRS cases. A 1-mm/day increase in monthly mean rainfall, 1% RH rise, and 1-unit MEI rise were associated with 1.1% (95% CI, 0.2–1.9%), 2.9% (95% CI, 1.4–4.4%), and 55.3% (95% CI, 20.1–89.6%) increases in HFRS cases, respectively.
