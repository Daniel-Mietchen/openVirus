<p>For Molidawahaner, the time-series Poisson regression model (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-ehp-118-915">Table 3</xref>) was also first-order autoregressive. After controlling for the autocorrelation, seasonality, and long-term trend, rainfall at a lag of 4 months, LST at a lag of 5 months, RH at a lag of 4 months, and MEI at a lag of 4 months were significantly associated with HFRS. The final model indicated that a 1°C increase in the monthly mean LST was associated with a 16.8% (95% CI, 11.5–22.3%) increase in HFRS cases. A 1-mm/day increase in monthly mean rainfall, 1% RH rise, and 1-unit MEI rise were associated with 0.5% (95% CI, 0.2–0.8%), 3.2% (95% CI, 1.7–4.6%), and 73.6% (95% CI, 41.8–95.6%) increases in HFRS cases, respectively.
