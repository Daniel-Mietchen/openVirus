<p>The results of this study suggest that antecedent patterns of LST, ENSO index, precipitation, and RH were among the key determinants of HFRS transmission in northeastern China that are easily monitored over large geographic areas. As such, whether directly influencing virus transmission or acting as surrogates for those factors, they act as a basis for a forecasting system to control and prevent rodent-borne diseases. Early warning systems based on climatic forecasting can assist in improving reservoir control and personal protection. The results of this study provide an impetus to build a predictive capacity for HFRS epidemics and to develop an early warning system for enhancing public health measures, especially for developing countries and areas of the world that are vulnerable to the impact of climate change.</p>
