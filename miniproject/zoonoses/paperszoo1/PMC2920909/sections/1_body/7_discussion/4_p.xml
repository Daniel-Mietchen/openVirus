 <xref rid="b60-ehp-118-915" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al. 2008</xref>). We used LST, rather than air temperature, in the present study because it more directly influences the abundance and distribution of rodents (

 <xref rid="b60-ehp-118-915" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al. 2008</xref>). In this study, changes in LST appeared to have a greater impact on the persistence and transmission of HFRS than did rainfall. In cooler climates, warmer temperatures may allow reservoirs to survive more easily in winters that normally would have limited their populations and to cause rodents to reach maturity much faster than lower temperatures (
