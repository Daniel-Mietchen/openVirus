<p>This is the first study to look for the responses of HFRS to climate variability at a fine timescale in two locations where hundreds of thousands of people are at risk. The statistical approaches using various sources of data identified models that accounted for a high proportion of the variation in HFRS case numbers and forecast HFRS with good accuracy.</p>
