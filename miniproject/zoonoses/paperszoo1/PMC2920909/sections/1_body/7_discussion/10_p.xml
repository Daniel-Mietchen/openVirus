<p>The limitations of this study should also be acknowledged. First, the data are from a passive surveillance system, so the quality of data is not as good as that collected from active surveillance. Some cases of HFRS might go unreported because of their milder clinical symptoms. It is likely that underreported cases influence the precision of models. However, it seems unlikely that disease severity would have an interannual component that would influence the general pattern of the observed results. Second, not all of the variation in the occurrence of HFRS cases in each region is caused by climate alone. In addition to factors such as virus and host dynamics that may be influenced directly by climate, human activities and movement, socioeconomic status, and population immunity may contribute to the transmission of HFRS. Clearing forests for agricultural use and urbanization may increase the potential for HFRS transmission (

However, data were unavailable on many of these factors. Third, the “validation” of the final model is still relatively short-term and may not remain as predictive over time because of unincorporated covariates or ecological changes associated with natural and human factors that alter the relationships.
