<p>Climate variability can affect the dynamics of infectious diseases through either linear or nonlinear pathways. It can affect several biological traits of the rodent hosts, from individual life histories to population dynamics (

The local climate is more likely to directly affect the life cycle dynamics (e.g., reproductive rates, incubation periods) of the disease agents themselves, whereas larger scale factors could also influence broader ecological processes that have important and possibly nonlinear impacts on the disease transmission dynamics (
