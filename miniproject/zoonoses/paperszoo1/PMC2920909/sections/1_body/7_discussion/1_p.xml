<p>A key finding from this study was that climate variability is an important predictor of the intensity of HFRS transmission in northeastern China. We found a consistent relationship between climatic factors with lags of 3â€“5 months and HFRS transmission. This lead time is of practical importance in predicting epidemics of HFRS and giving health authorities sufficient time to formulate plans, disseminate warnings, and implement public health interventions, such as vaccinating high-risk populations, killing the rodent hosts, and managing environments for the prevention and control of the disease (

Interestingly, despite the geographical proximity of Elunchun and Molidawahaner, lag periods for associations of all these climatic variables, except MEI, with HFRS cases were somewhat different, such that climate variables in Elunchun typically appeared to influence HFRS case reports 1 month earlier than they did in Molidawahaner. It is unclear if this difference is due to a systematic difference in reporting time, although this seems unlikely during this long time period, or reflects differences in the biological characteristics of viral transmission.
