<p>MEI, as an indicator of global climate pattern, was an important contributor for characterizing changing patterns of HFRS, which supports the notion that large-scale climate indices may be critical for forecasting patterns of disease risk, especially among larger geographic areas (

The MEI is favored over other conventional indices because it integrates more information, reflects the nature of the coupled oceanâ€“atmosphere system better than either component alone, and is less vulnerable to non-ENSO-related variability and to occasional data glitches in the monthly cycles (
