<p>Out of the 800 chicken and turkey flocks tested by competitive cELISA, 223 showed positive anti-NP antibodies. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053524-g001">Figure 1</xref> indicated positive sera peak at about 6–10% competition and 3% were considered doubtful. The overall between-flock seroprevalence was 28.7% (95% confidence interval, CI, 25.6–32.1). The highest levels of seroprevalence were observed during autumn and winter with a peaked in March at 37.2% (CI 24.1–51.9) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053524-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Highest seroprevalences were observed in Tunis (47.9%, CI 36.1–59.9), Nabeul (45.7%, CI 35.4–56.3) and Sfax (41.3%, CI 34.4–48.4) governorates where the majority of commercial farms are located (
