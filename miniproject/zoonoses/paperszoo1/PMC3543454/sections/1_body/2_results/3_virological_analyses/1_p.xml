<p>Out of the 400 tested flocks, 40 (10%) were positive by Ag ELISA for NP antigen and by rRT-PCR for M gene (ct value in the range of 15–33). Among them, only 29 samples showed cytopathic effect in chicken embryo cell (CEC) cultures, characterized by plaque formation only in the presence of trypsin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053524-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Chicken embryos inoculated with the selected samples died within 24–72 hr in only 20 cases. The HA assays revealed that the HA titers ranged from 5 to 9 log
 <sub>2</sub>. HA subtyping was done by HI test using H5, H7, and H9 specific antisera, for 20 out of the 40 positive samples. They were all identified as H9 subtype with HI titer ranging from 4 to 8 log
 <sub>2</sub>. None of them were identified as H5 and H7 subtypes. Besides, all rRT-PCR positive samples for gene M detection were also identified as H9 subtype by the same specific assay.
