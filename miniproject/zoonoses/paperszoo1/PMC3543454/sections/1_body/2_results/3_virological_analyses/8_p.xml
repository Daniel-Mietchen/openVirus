<p>Multiple alignment of the HA gene (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053524-t004">Table 4</xref>) revealed that these strains have the same P-A-R-S-S-R ↓ G amino acid motif at the cleavage site and carried the aa substitution Q234L (H9 numbering) that correlated with a shift in affinity to human type SA α2,6 receptor type. The current isolates maintained conserved residues at the receptor-binding pocket: P116, T163, H191, A189 and I235.
