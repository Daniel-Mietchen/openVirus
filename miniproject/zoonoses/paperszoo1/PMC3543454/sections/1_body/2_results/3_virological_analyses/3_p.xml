<p>The detection and the quantification of AI viral titer were performed by rRT-PCR using various amounts of purified DNA (3.7 ng/µl) or TCID50 values (10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID50/ml). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053524-g006">Figure 6</xref>, the analysis of threshold cycle (Ct) signals as function of log10 concentrations and TCID
 <sub>50</sub> titers showed a nearly linear decrease of Ct value with increased virus titer. The detection limit of rRT-PCR was 3.7×10
 <sup>−5</sup> ng/µl (while by RT-PCR, the limit was 3.7×10
 <sup>−2</sup> ng/µl) or 1 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml, respectively. The correlation coefficient R
 <sup>2</sup> value was 0.99, indicating linear regression between the standard curve line and the individual Ct data points.
