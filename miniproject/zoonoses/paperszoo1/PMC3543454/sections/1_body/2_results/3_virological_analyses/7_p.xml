 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053524-g007">Figure 7b</xref>) sequences revealed that the four isolates belonged to the Eurasian clade and fell within the same G1-like lineage. All isolates identified during 2011 and 2010 were most closely related (similarity out of 96%) to the A/Migratory Bird/TUN/51/2010 and A/Ck/TUN/12/2010 previously isolated.
