<p>Real time RT-PCR assay offered several advantages over conventional RT-PCR and other virological detection assays such as Ag EIA, hemagglutination inhibition or cell cultures. In addition to the relatively short run time, rRT-PCR is a quantitative assay and can be used for absolute or relative viral RNA quantified. This TaqMan- probe-based RT-PCR assay targeted the M and the HA genes of AIV. It has been reported that the rRT-PCR, used for the detection of human and avian influenza viruses, is very sensitive (2 copies of
