<p>NA gene was more polymorphic: drift mutations have occurred in the framework and the hemadsorption sites in the variants resulting in 9 substitutions. Three were non- synonymous substitutions. Three substitutions V360A, T384N, Q432K, not similar to the two Tunisian identified strains, were previously found in H9N2 reference strains (such as Saudi Arabia, Israel and G9 strains). Only current Tunisian isolates harbored three new mutations N356D, S442H and I444V similar to other N2 subtypes (H1N2, H6N2, H5N2, H7N2, H3N2 and H2N2). Interestingly, three S400R, N402D and G451R substitutions found exclusively in 2011 Tunisian strains. However, the biological significance of these mutations is not yet known.</p>
