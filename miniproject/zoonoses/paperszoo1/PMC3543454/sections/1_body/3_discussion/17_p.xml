<p>Phylogenetic analyses based on the HA and NA genes revealed that current Tunisian (H9N2) variants are closely related to each other and to Middle Eastern strains with a similarity score of up to 96% within the members of the G1 lineage. Interestingly, 2010â€“2011 Tunisian H9N2 strains belong closely to the same clade as the MB/TUN/51/2010 H9N2 strain previously isolated from migratory bird 
 <xref rid="pone.0053524-Tombari1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In fact, our surveillance study was carry out during the seasonal coming of migratory bird and phylogenetic analysis may underline the role of wild birds in the introducing of the virus. It has been suggested that the migratory birds play an important role in the virus introduction but that the spread of AIV to other wild and domestic species, present in their migratory pathways may be limited

 <xref rid="pone.0053524-Feare1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Environmental persistence of the virus in various aquatic habitats (lakes, rivers, ponds) of wild bird population may play a key role in its transmission within animal population and its persistence in the environment 
 <xref rid="pone.0053524-Shortridge1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Previous study showed that H9N2 viruses are transmitted by the tracheal route via aerosol mode and a lesser extent by feces 
 <xref rid="pone.0053524-Aamir1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The spreading mode could be by the contact with wild and aquatic birds, leadding to an interspecies transmission and great variability in host-range restriction and genetic diversity
