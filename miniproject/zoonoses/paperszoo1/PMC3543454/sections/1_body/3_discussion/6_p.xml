<p>In this report, we also evidenced that AIV infection may be maintained over several consecutive months in Tunisian commercial flocks. Additional longitudinal prevalence studies would be necessary to examine temporal variations of AIV infection,, but our results nevertheless suggest that AIV circulation may be more important throughout autumn and winter than in spring. The temporal fluctuations of AIV seroprevalence in this study probably reflect different proportions of poultry types sampled from one month to another. Indeed, broiler flocks – which showed lower risk of AIV seropositivity than layers, breeders or turkeys – represented the majority (more than 75%) of the flocks sampled in April and May, when seroprevalence was low (&lt;20%). However this may not be the only explanation for monthly variations as seroprevalence remained over 25% in January and March, with broilers representing 64% and 62% of the flocks sampled at that period of time. It has also been suggested that AIV prevalence may vary with contacts between poultry and wild birds and virus survival under environmental conditions, including temperature
