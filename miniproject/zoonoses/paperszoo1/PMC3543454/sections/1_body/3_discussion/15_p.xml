<p>The standard curve was generated from Ct values plotted against viral titers expressed as diluted H9 DNA concentrations or as 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>)/ml. Interestingly, rRT-PCR test, which can rapidly identify type A influenza as well as subtype H9, was very useful for the screening of AIV. It can also be a very valuable tool for the control of the disease transmission in poultry and in humans and can help reducing economic losses associated with AIV outbreaks in poultry.
