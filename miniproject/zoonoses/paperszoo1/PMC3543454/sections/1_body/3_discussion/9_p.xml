<p>In addition, our survey showed that the biosecurity level of poultry farms was significantly associated with the risk of AIV infection. Commercial poultry sector in Tunisia includes various farm management conditions with low-biosecurity level (wooden or open poultry premises, products sold on local markets), which presents high risk regarding AIV infection (OR = 1.57, CI 95%: 1–2.4), to higher-biosecurity level observed in many industrial farms with birds kept in a closed house, maintaining highly restricted physical barriers and applying strict disinfection and hygienic procedures (elimination of infected flocks to limit possible AIV spread). Besides, the poultry producers seek assistance for diseases diagnosis through professionals and dedicated trained personnel and reinforcement of biosecurity measures.</p>
