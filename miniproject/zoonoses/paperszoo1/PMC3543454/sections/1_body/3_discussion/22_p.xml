<p>A total of 120 out of 400 flocks that was negative in rRT-PCR assay, showed positive reactions for anti-NP antibodies in cELISA. This lower detection rate revealed by rRT-PCR may be related to the fact that AIV is present for a short period after initial infection and replicates poorly in the host, whereas the antibody responses last longer after infection.</p>
