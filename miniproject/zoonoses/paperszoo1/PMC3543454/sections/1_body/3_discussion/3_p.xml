<p>The study showed some limitations that should be taken into account before conclusions are drawn. First, seroprevalences should be regarded cautiously as the 800 flocks enrolled in the present study may have not been chosen randomly among all Tunisian commercial poultry farms. Indeed, questionnaire showed that most of the farms enrolled reported clinical signs. This study may thus not depict the overall AIV situation in Tunisia, but certainly provides a precise description of the AIV seroprevalence in Tunisian flocks showing clinical signs. Second, the number of poultry samples collected in the field varied greatly according to the month of year and the governorates. This makes the interpretation of geographical and temporal variations difficult, due to the heterogeneity of seroprevalence confidence intervals. Also, the temporal pattern of seroprevalence should be considered in regard to the persistence of AIV antibodies in poultry over the course of time. Further longitudinal studies, based on random sampling of farms and birds and carried out over longer periods of time, are desirable to address these limitations. At least, the questionnaire survey resulted in missing information for 176 of 800 farms. These farms were excluded from the statistical risk factor analysis, but the influence of missing values on the robustness of results could not be deeply analyzed. Despite these limitations, this study brings new insights to the epidemiology of avian influenza in the Maghreb and Mediterranean countries.</p>
