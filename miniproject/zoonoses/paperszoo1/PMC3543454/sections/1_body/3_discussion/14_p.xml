<p>Positive cases were then subtyped by both HI test using specific H9 polyclonal antisera and rRT-PCR assay followed by conventional RT-PCR using subtype-specific primers for the genes H9 and N2, respectively. The rRT-PCR assay for M and H9 genes revealed significantly higher numbers of positive samples, and confirmed all the positive results revealed by AgELISA. All new strains were subtyped as H9N2 by real time and conventional RT-PCR</p>
