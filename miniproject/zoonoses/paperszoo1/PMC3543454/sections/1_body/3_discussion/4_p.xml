<p>The overall between-flock seroprevalence of AIV antibodies was 28.7% (CI 25.6â€“32.1), which demonstrates that AIV was present in Tunisia during 2010 to 2011. The cELISA, was assessed as sensitive, specific (100%, respectively as provided) versus (95% and 96% in chickens, 86% and 88% in ducks, 97% and 100% in Turkeys, 87% and 100% in goose, and 91% and 97% in swine) and reliable tool for the study of AIV epidemiology

 <xref rid="pone.0053524-Starick1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. A higher AIV seroprevalence (71,3% ) was reported in adults birds by Toennessen et al. 
 <xref rid="pone.0053524-Toennessen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Interestingly, our finding is consistent with the high flock-seroprevalence recorded previously on chicken flocks experiencing respiratory signs or mortality in Jordan
