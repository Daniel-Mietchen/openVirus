<p>Our study showed higher prevalences for layer (50.3%) and broiler breeder flocks (46.5%) compared to broiler chickens. Recent report also suggested that broiler flocks were less affected with H9: only 1/9 (11.1%) flocks were found seropositive to H9 versus 13/18 (72.2%) and 7/12 (58.3%) for H9, in the examined layer and breeder poultry farms, respectively 
 <xref rid="pone.0053524-Afifi1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In fact, the long life span of layers and broiler breeders allows the development of a stronger immune response, as a result of the longer exposure to the risk of AI infection. This phenomena might explain the higher prevalence detected by cELISA as compared to broilers, which have a short life span and for which the blood samples may have been collected at the acute stage of infection. Results suggest that for the layer flocks, the AIV infection may have occurred during the laying phase and increased after. These findings may help to explain the observed drop in egg production.
