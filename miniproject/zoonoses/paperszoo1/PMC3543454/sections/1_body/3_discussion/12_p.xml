<p>Tissue cultures (CEF) were used as another indicator for the presence of the virus. None of the H9N2 isolates tested showed cytopathic effect (CPE) in infected CEF monolayer in the absence of trypsin whereas CPE could be observed by 72 h post infection in presence of trypsin, in 29 out of 40 samples. This clearly indicated that the Tunisian H9N2 isolates are of low pathogenicity, which is further supported by sequencing data results.</p>
