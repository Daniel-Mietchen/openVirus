<p>The amplification of H9 and N2 genes was carried out separately with primers published by Ji 
 <xref rid="pone.0053524-Ji1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and Kwon 
 <xref rid="pone.0053524-Kwon1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, respectively. PCR products were run on 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized by UV illumination. The product was purified and extracted from the agarose gel with the Gel Kit (GenClean® II kit, North America, Solon Ohio). The DNA was quantified by NanoDrop® ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA) and five 10-fold dilutions of the DNA were performed and tested by real-time RT-PCR.
