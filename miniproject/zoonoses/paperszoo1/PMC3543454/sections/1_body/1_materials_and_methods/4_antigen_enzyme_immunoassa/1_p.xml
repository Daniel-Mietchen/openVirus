<p>An initial screening for AIV was done by AgEIA as described (ID-screen® Influenza A Antigen Capture, ID-Vet, Montpellier, France). In brief, the diluted swabs was mixed well and incubated (50 µl/well) into a microwell coated with Influenza A (NP) specific monoclonal antibodies for 25 min at room temperature. IgG conjugated with horse radish peroxidase was then added (100 µl/well) followed by color development with chromogen and substrate. The Cut-off level was calculated as three standard deviations above the mean optical density value of negative controls (threshold = mean OD
 <sub>NC</sub>±3SD). Pooled swab samples having OD value above the threshold level were considered positive.
