<p>Among the available data collected in the questionnaire, seven categorical variables were selected to study the risk of AI infection such as: area (geographical location of the farms), bird species, nearby poultry farms – including backyard – within a radius of 500 m around the farmhouse, nearby humid zone (proximity to river, lakes, swamps), biosecurity measures (building infrastructure, equipments, farm management), owner/workers circulating between farms and contacts with migratory birds (wild birds observed or not in the neighboring areas). These variables were first entered in univariate logistic regression models, with flock status (infected/not infected) as dependent variable. An initial multivariate model was built based on all the predictors with p≤0.25 (LR test) in the univariate screening. Variable selection for the final model was carried out through a backward elimination process based on the log–likelihood ratio test as recommended by Hosmer and Lemeshow (2000)
