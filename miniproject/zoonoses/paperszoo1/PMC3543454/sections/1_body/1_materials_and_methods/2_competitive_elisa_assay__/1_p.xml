<p>Serological evidence of avian influenza virus was detected using a Competitive Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (cELISA) (ID-screen® Influenza A Antibody Competition ELISA Kit, ID-Vet, Montpellier, France) specific to influenza A nucleoprotein (NP) as described by Zhou et al 
 <xref rid="pone.0053524-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The results were expressed as the percentage of competition value according to the following formula: (OD samples/OD negative)×100. Poultry flocks were considered positive for antibodies to influenza A NP if the average percentage of competition (mean value of 20 tested sera) is lower than 45.
