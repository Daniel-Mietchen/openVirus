<p>Sequences were aligned using the Bioedit 5.0.6 program. The two segments were phylogenetically analyzed on the basis of their protein sequences. The MEGA5.01 version 3.65 program was used for tree building using the neighbor-joining method. The number of bootstrap replications was set to 1000. All branches supported by more than 50% bootstrap values were considered to be in the same group in the trees. Abbreviations used and GenBank accession numbers of different H9N2 viruses included in the phylogenetic analysis are listed in supplementary
