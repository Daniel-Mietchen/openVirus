<p>This study was carried out on commercial flocks reared in 20 governorates from northern, central and southern Tunisia. A total of 800 flocks consisting of 187 layer, 453 broiler, 58 breeder broiler and 102 turkey flocks were enrolled in this study. The majority of sampled flocks were recorded as having respiratory symptoms, mortality or drop in egg production. None of these flocks received any influenza A virus vaccines. Layer flocks were of varying ages, ranging from 3 to 83 weeks old (mean age 45), breeder broiler were from 10–64 weeks old (mean age 37), the broiler flocks aged from 23 to 62 days of age (mean age 33) and turkeys were from 4 to 18 weeks (mean age 11). Twenty blood samples were separately collected from birds in each of the 800 flocks, centrifuged and stored at −20°C for further serological analyses. This should allow detection of AIV antibodies for a within-flock seroprevalence of 15% (5% type I error) and estimation of the between-flock prevalence with 3% precision at the 95% confidence level (expected prevalence was set at 50%, the value for which the sample size required is the largest)
