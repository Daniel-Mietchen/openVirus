<p>All chicken sampling protocols were approved prior to the beginning of the study by the biological animal security committee of National Agriculture Ministry, and conducted by trained veterinarians. Simultaneously, a more detailed questionnaire was filled out to collect valuable information on the farm (poultry species, premises, close environment, biosecurity, etc) and the reared birds (age, health statue, vaccination programâ€¦). The owners agreed to participate in such study and a written informed consent document was obtained from each participating farm.</p>
