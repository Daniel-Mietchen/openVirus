<p>Primary chick embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells were cultured from SPF embryonated chicken eggs (Lohmann Ltz, Germany) (density of 1×10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well) in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Gibco®, Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IU/ml penicillin G, and 100 µl/ml streptomycin. The 80% confluency reached cells were inoculated with 100 µl of AgEIA positive samples, at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1∶1 in DMEM with 5% FBS supplemented with 2 µg/ml tosyl-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-Trypsin (Gibco®) 
 <xref rid="pone.0053524-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The supernatants were 10-fold diluted to calculate the infectious virus titer by determining the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) using the Reed and Muench method.
