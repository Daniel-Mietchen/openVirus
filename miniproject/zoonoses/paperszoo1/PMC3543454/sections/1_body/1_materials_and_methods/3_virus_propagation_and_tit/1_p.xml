<p>Pooled swab (cloacal and tracheal) samples were propaged in 10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs) (Lohmann Ltz, Germany). Infective amino-allontoic fluids (AAF) were harvested at 96 h post incubation, tested for the presence of hemagglutinin (HA) activity 
 <xref rid="pone.0053524-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and titrated to determine the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>)/ml, using primary chicken embryo fibroblast cultures (CEFs).
