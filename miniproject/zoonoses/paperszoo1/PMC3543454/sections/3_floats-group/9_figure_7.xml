  <title>Phylogenetic relationships of the HA (a) and NA (b) genes of 2010â€“2011 Tunisian strains (H9N2).</title>
  <p>Horizontal distances are proportional to the minimum number of nucleotide differences required to join nodes and sequences. Vertical distances are for spacing branches and labels. The phylogenetic trees were generated by using the neighbor-joining algorithm assessed by bootstrap analysis with 1,000 replications. Abbreviations used in virus designation are as follows: Av, avian; Ck, chicken; Dk, duck; gs, goose; Qu, quail; Tk, Turkey; Pa, parakeet. The in box strains are avian H9N2 Influenza viruses' isolates that were sequenced in the present study.</p>
