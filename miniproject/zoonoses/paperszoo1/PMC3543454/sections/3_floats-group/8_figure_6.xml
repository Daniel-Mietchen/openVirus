  <title>A linear relationship between threshold cycle and serially diluted DNA concentration or TCID50 values.</title>
  <p>PCR efficiency ((10
   <sup>3.503</sup>−1)×100) was 99.87% as indicated by the slope (m = −3.503). The standard curve was generated from amplification of the H9 gene with each point represents the mean of the results from three determinations.
