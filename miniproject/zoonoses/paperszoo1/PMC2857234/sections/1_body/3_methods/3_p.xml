<p>We created a list of relevant zoonotic diseases at risk for importation (hereafter referred to as risk zoonoses) by searching the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.cdc.gov</ext-link>) and the World Health Organization website (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.who.int</ext-link>), reviewing the list of Select Agents (agents with bioterrorism potential) of the US Department of Health and Human Services (

 </xref>), and consulting experts in the field. To be on the list, diseases had to meet the following 5 criteria: 1) the pathogen must be zoonotic (there must be a recorded instance of infection of a human from an animal source); 2) the pathogen must be capable of causing significant illness or death (e.g., fungal skin infections would not be on the list because although they are extremely common zoonoses, their effects are rarely debilitating); 3) the pathogen must be present in animals in the wild (i.e., not only in experimental models); 4) the pathogen must not currently be widespread in the United States, or it must have the potential for new epidemiology with regard to transmission (e.g., 
 <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> is presently found in wild rodents in the western United States, but it is not expected to be found in animals sold as pets); and 5) if the pathogen uses an intermediate vector, competent vectors must exist in the United States. The resulting list comprised 30 risk zoonoses (20 viral diseases, 9 bacterial diseases, and 1 helminthic disease); no fungal, protozoal, or prion diseases were on the list, and thus they were not analyzed.
