<p>Determination of the host range of the risk zoonoses was accomplished through systematic genus-driven and pathogen-driven searches of PubMed databases (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pubmed.gov" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.pubmed.gov</ext-link>), the Google search engine (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.google.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.google.com</ext-link>), and references within published works. Confirmed presence was defined as either isolation of the pathogen from an animal or serologic evidence of past infection. For all animals identified in the literature as carrying a risk zoonosis, genus and family were recorded. The host ranges of all of the risk zoonoses were then cross-referenced against the imported genera to generate tables showing diseases found in each imported genus (affected genera). If the disease was found in a different genus within the same family, this was also noted (potentially affected genera). The justification for this expanded risk assessment is the host nonspecificity of many infectious diseases; lack of evidence for the presence of a given disease in a given host should not be construed as evidence against its presence.
