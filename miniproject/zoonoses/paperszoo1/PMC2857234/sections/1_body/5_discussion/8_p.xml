<p>The recommendations above mirror others that exist in policy documents by the Defenders of Wildlife (

  <italic>5</italic>
 </xref>), in the 2003 joint position statement by the National Association of Public Health Veterinarians and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (

  <italic>18</italic>
 </xref>), and in a recent Policy Forum article (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">
  <italic>19</italic>
 </xref>). These reports describe clear steps for mitigating the risks presented by imported wildlife, yet their recommendations have so far gone largely unheeded. To ensure public safety, immediate proactive changes are needed at multiple levels. Such measures would be most effective if organized in consultation with groups involved in the wildlife trade.
