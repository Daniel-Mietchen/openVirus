 <p>The United States is the world’s largest wildlife importer, and imported wild animals represent a potential source of zoonotic pathogens. Using data on mammals imported during 2000–2005, we assessed their potential to host 27 selected risk zoonoses and created a risk assessment that could inform policy making for wildlife importation and zoonotic disease surveillance. A total of 246,772 mammals in 190 genera (68 families) were imported. The most widespread agents of risk zoonoses were rabies virus (in 78 genera of mammals), 
  <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> (57), 
  <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex (48), 
  <italic>Echinococcus</italic> spp. (41), and 
  <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. (35). Genera capable of harboring the greatest number of risk zoonoses were 
  <italic>Canis</italic> and 
  <italic>Felis</italic> (14 each), 
  <italic>Rattus</italic> (13), 
  <italic>Equus</italic> (11), and 
  <italic>Macaca</italic> and 
  <italic>Lepus</italic> (10 each). These findings demonstrate the myriad opportunities for zoonotic pathogens to be imported and suggest that, to ensure public safety, immediate proactive changes are needed at multiple levels.
