<p>A wide variety of pathogens can be transmitted by

 <italic>pipiens</italic>. For example, these mosquitoes are important vectors of West Nile virus that was first characterized in Uganda in 1937 but has spread over large areas of Africa, Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Americas. Usutu virus is another example of a previously tropical mosquito-borne virus that has now been introduced and established in temperate climate â€“ originally isolated from a bird-biting mosquito, 
 <italic>Culex univittatus</italic>, in South-Africa, and historically detected in various places in sub-Saharan Africa, the virus, in 2001, suddenly emerged in the Austrian capital of Vienna (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>) and in southern Germany (

 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> has been suggested to be one of the main vectors for the heartworm disease by 
 <italic>Dirofilaria immitis</italic> that can be rather common in some areas in southern Europe (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>). Rift Valley fever virus is another virus that can be carried by 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic>, and can cause severe disease in both animals and humans in various parts of Africa (however, carried by other mosquito species in African cases) (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>). In September 2000, Rift Valley fever cases were diagnosed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, raising concerns that it could extend to other parts of Asia and Europe.
