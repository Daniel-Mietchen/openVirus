<p>Two of the markers used here were the same that were used in Fonseca et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>), where two distinct lineages were found. In one of the loci CxpGT9, the allele frequency spectrum of the three outlying populations (France, Romania, and Turkey) was similar to the underground populations discovered in Ref. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>) and the allele frequency spectrum for the rest was close to the one found in the above-ground populations found in Ref. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>). The difference between the two populations can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Fig. 3</xref>a, where the allele size 116 [corresponding to allele size 114 in Ref. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>)] is shown to be very frequent in France, Romania, and Turkey. In Ref. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>), the same allele reached a frequency of around 0.5, while in the other populations, the frequencies were much lower. Allele size 124, on the other hand, was not found in Romania, Turkey, or France, but in all other populations, at about the same frequency. It is also worth noting that allele size 116, being the most frequent one in the putative underground populations, was found in almost all of the other populations, albeit at a much lower frequency. This suggests a gene flow between the underground populations and the above-ground populations. The same pattern can be seen in locus CQ29 where allele size 178 reaches a high frequency in the above-ground populations, but not in the below-ground populations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Fig. 3</xref>b), while allele size 184 is very common in France, being almost the only allele found, and relatively common in Romania, but having a low frequency in Turkey. Both alleles are found in both groups, but at a much lower frequency, again indicating some gene flow between the groups.
