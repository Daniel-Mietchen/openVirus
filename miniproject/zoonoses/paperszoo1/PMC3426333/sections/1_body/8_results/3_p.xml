<p>The mean frequency of private alleles was 0.026, which when corrected for sample size yields an estimate of the number of migrants of 5.74. The number of migrants between Malta and Sweden (the most distant populations) was as high as 2.04.We found that the estimate of effective population, θ = 2.85, which assuming a mutation rate for microsatellites (µ) of 5×10
 <sup>−4</sup>, gives an estimate of 
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>e</sub>≈1500, and with a more conservative estimate of 10
 <sup>−4</sup>, gives 
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>e</sub>≈7100. To obtain the range of observed 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub>-values by drift alone, we would expect 
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>e</sub> in the range of at least 6000, which is possible given the conservative estimate of mutation, but only at short times since separation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Fig. 4</xref>). Thus, even if the observed 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub>-values are not unattainable, the conditions under which this might happen are quite restricted.
