<p>The number of alleles, allelic richness, and expected heterozygosity did not differ much between the populations (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>). The global 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> was 0.090 (95% CI: 0.049–0.14) using the uncorrected data set and 0.054 (95% CI: 0.032–0.80). The pairwise 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub>-values were low but were not different from zero, except in one case; between Denmark and Serbia (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0002">Table 2</xref>). This result was consistent regardless of which data set was used. However, the comparisons that involved the samples from France, Rumania, and Turkey were highly differentiated from the rest of the populations. This can be illustrated in the NJ-trees made (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Fig. 2</xref>). As can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Fig. 2</xref>, the distance between populations was on average lower using the corrected data set. If we exclude the three deviating populations, global 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> was now only 0.029 (0.018–0.041) and 0.022 (0.015–0.028), respectively, which corresponds to G’
 <sub>ST</sub>-values of 0.20 and 0.15, respectively. The two estimates of 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> was strongly correlated (
 <italic>r</italic>=0.99, 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001; Mantel test). There was a significant correlation between geographic and genetic distances [log (distance) versus 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub>/(1 − 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub>), 
 <italic>r</italic>=0.31, 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.0.032 for the corrected data set, Mantel test].
