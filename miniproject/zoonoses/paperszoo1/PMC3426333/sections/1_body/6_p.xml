<p>One way to estimate the similarity and the rate of contact between European 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> populations is to look at the gene exchange between mosquito populations. Since gene flow is always lower than the actual movements of individuals, this will give a rather conservative estimate of the amount of spread of individuals between parts of Europe. By analyzing the extent of contact between populations that have been shown to be able to carry certain pathogens and populations in northern Europe that have yet not been seen to transmit them, we can estimate the possibility of natural pathogen dispersal under changing climatic conditions. To estimate the genetic diversity and degree of differentiation between European 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> populations, we used eight microsatellite markers in 10 mosquito populations originating from northern, central, and southern Europe.
