<p>Understanding the connection between infectious diseases and climate is difficult because of the multivariate nature of climate change and non-linear thresholds in both disease and climate change processes. It is commonly assumed that the distribution of infectious diseases is determined by climate and that the present climate change will increase their incidence and geographic distribution. Consequently, the relationship between temperature and the transmission of pathogens has gained substantial attention (
