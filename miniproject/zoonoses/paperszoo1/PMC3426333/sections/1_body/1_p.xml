<p>Species in the 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> complex are common almost all over the world and act as important vectors for many serious zoonotic diseases, mostly because they often are the most common mosquitoes in urban areas (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>). The taxonomy and systematics of the 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> complex is a challenge. The form molestus that was originally described as a species by the Linnaean disciple Forssk√•l in 1775 from Egypt has since been reduced to represent a bioform (bf.) of the species 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic>. This decision was based upon the fact that no morphological characters were found that would allow the discrimination of one species from the other. Fonseca et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>) showed that there were distinct genetic differences using microsatellites between populations of bf. pipiens and molestus and that they probably had undergone a recent speciation event. Because bf. pipiens is strictly ornithophilic while molestus readily bites humans and other mammals, this is of epidemiological importance when discussing diseases such as West Nile fever (WNF). Supposedly, molestus will act as a bridge vector between the bird reservoirs and susceptible mammal hosts, while pipiens only will maintain the bird-to-bird transmission. Except for some underground populations of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> bf. molestus, in northern European cities, most specimens of this temperate species require a blood meal for egg development (
