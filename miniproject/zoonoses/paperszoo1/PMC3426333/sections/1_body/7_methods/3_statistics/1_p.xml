<p>We used the software Microchecker (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref>) to check for null alleles and other technical problems. We detected a significant number of null alleles in several loci, apparent as an uncommonly large proportion of homozygotes for a few alleles, which created large deviations from Hardyâ€“Weinberg equilibrium. The repeatability of the amplifications was 95%; so, there are no reasons to believe that technical problems caused this pattern. Since several samples did not amplify at all for a given locus, there are reasons to suspect that there are alleles present that did not amplify. Null alleles are commonly found in Lepidoptera (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref>) and seem to be present also in this Dipterian sample. The main effect of null alleles seems to be an overestimate of

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">22</xref>), but no major distortions of genetic structure. We used the method by Chapuis and Estoup (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">23</xref>) to correct for the presence for null alleles since this method performed best in a comparative study. The method is implemented in the software FreeNA (
