<p>To perform basic statistics, such as the number of alleles, allelic richness, and expected heterozygosity, we used the softwares Arlequin 3.5.1.2 (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">24</xref>) and Fstat 2.9.3.2 (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">25</xref>). To calculate pairwise 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub>, we used FreeNA using both uncorrected data and data corrected for null alleles; 95% confidence intervals were obtained through 1000 bootstrap replicates. Since 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> is dependent on the level of heterozygosity, a low estimate can be due to a high within population variation rather than lack of differentiation. We therefore also calculated G’
 <sub>ST</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">26</xref>), which rescales 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> to have bounds between zero and one to get an intuitive picture of the degree of differentiation. To tests for possible isolation by distance patterns, we used the program Mantel 2.0 (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">27</xref>). Finally, to make neighbor-joining (NJ) trees based on the distances obtained, we used MEGA5 (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">28</xref>). To assess if the sampling and the number of loci used was enough to detect a structure if there is one (i.e. power of the tests), we used the program POWSIM (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">29</xref>). We used all loci and simulated 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub>-values for two populations being separated for 250 generations, each with an effective population size (
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>e</sub>) of 5000 and with a sampling effort of 30 individuals (as in this study). The values were used to simulate a case where the split of the populations are very recent, and the populations are very large. Hence, this is a very conservative test of power, as if time is longer and 
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>e</sub> is smaller, it would be much easier to find significant results. Nevertheless, even with these very conservative start values, we found that the expected 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> is 0.025 (95% range, 0.0139–0.0392) and the power 0.99. Thus, we are confident that, given the number of loci and sampling effort, we can find differences if they exist.
