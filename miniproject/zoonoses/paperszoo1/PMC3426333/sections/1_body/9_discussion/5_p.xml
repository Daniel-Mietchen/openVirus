<p>A concern associated with pathogens carried by 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> mosquitoes is the distribution of hybrid populations between bf. pipiens and molestus. Because pipiens is strictly ornithophilic while molestus has a more catholic taste and readily bites humans and other mammals, these hybrid populations are thought to be the most high-capacity vectors in southern Europe and North America (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0035">35</xref>). This gives rise to concern, should those hybrids spread to northern Europe or if another hybridization event should occur. It is possible that presently the populations of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> in Sweden and the rest of northern Europe are less likely to be involved in zoonotic transmission of, for example, WNF since they are not constituted of hybrids. However, in a recent paper, Reusken et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0035">35</xref>) showed the presence of hybrid pipiens√ómolestus mosquitoes in the Netherlands. Since our results imply an extensive gene flow between populations of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> in Europe, hybrid mosquitoes could spread fast over the whole Europe. This could potentially alter the epidemiology of many arthropod-borne viruses in Northern Europe giving rise to epidemics/epizootics similar to the WNF outbreak in North America from 1999 and onward. Consequently, up-to-date surveillance systems are called for all over the Europe as, without them, detection and response to emerging vector-borne diseases can be severely impaired (

The emergence of WNF in 1999 in New York is a good example of the consequences that a delayed response can have on the outcome of novel pathogen introduction. Studies show that impaired mosquito surveillance can make the management costs of epidemics several times higher than applying a strategy with sustained surveillance and early case detection (
