<p>The study showed two major results: first, three of the analyzed populations (France, Romania, and Turkey) were very different from the rest of the populations (Sweden, Denmark, Alsace, Croatia, Serbia, Spain, and Malta) and they also greatly differed from each other (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0002">Table 2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Fig. 2</xref>). In fact, they were so different that there are reasons to believe that they belong to differentiated lineages. Furthermore, the allele frequency distribution in these populations match the one that has been earlier found in the underground populations (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>). Second, most pairwise differences were low and showed a shallow structure among the populations apart from the three deviating ones (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Fig. 2</xref>). The low

 <sub>ST</sub>-values between populations suggest that there is an extensive gene flow between the populations, and this was confirmed by the simulations where the conditions for differentiation by drift alone was far too stringent given what is known about these populations. A low

 <sub>ST</sub> by itself does not mean that there is extensive gene flow (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0032">32</xref>) since 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> is dependent on the level of heterozygosity. However, even if we rescale the values to account for within-population heterozygosity, the overall level of differentiation is still low in the above-ground populations. Thus, we are confident that basically all European populations of the above-ground 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> share genes. The estimate of gene flow was high, which together with the simulations, suggests that the genetic similarity among populations is due to ongoing gene flow rather than a result of a recent shared history and expansion.
