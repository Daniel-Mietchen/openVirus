<p>Vector competence of mosquitoes describes their ability to transmit pathogens after taking an infected blood meal. The ability of vectors transmitting a pathogen is known to vary between populations of mosquito species. The exact relationship between vector competence and environmental factors is however not clear and can be influenced by many external factors (

 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> in Europe. Therefore, infectious diseases spread by this species may not be associated with a certain vector genotype, but rather with suitable environmental conditions. Consequently, we would expect these pathogens to disperse northward with favorable climatic parameters.
