<p>The distribution and intensity of mosquito-borne infections is strongly influenced by the interactions between temperature, vectors, hosts, and pathogen genetics. Temperature often determines both the latitudinal boundary and upper elevation limit of pathogen transmission when the extrinsic incubation period becomes greater than the life span of the vector (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>). Temperature is also linked to the intensity and transmission of pathogens. In temperate regions, seasonality is one of the key components of the climate. In many temperate regions, however, the summer temperatures can be as high as temperatures in the tropics. The difference with tropics lays in the absence of winters. Therefore, tropical mosquito-borne diseases can be introduced and transmitted during the right season in the temperate regions, but in most cases, they will be eliminated during the winter (
