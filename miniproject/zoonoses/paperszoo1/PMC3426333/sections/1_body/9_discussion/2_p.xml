<p>An alternative explanation is that the species only very recently spread throughout Europe, and thus due to incomplete lineage sorting and subsequent local stochastic effects, the populations have not diverged more, which is reflected in the unclear relationships between the populations. However, this species were described by Linnaeus in 1758 (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">33</xref>), and there are no reasons to believe that it was an uncommon species at that time. Even if the species had very recently arrived to Northern Europe when Linnaeus described it, 250 years is ample time to develop a population structure if gene flow is restricted or absent. The results from the power analysis confirm this; the expected

This strengthens the support for a wide-ranging dispersal of mosquito-individuals across large distances in Europe, and hence the possibility of a spread of vector-borne pathogens.
