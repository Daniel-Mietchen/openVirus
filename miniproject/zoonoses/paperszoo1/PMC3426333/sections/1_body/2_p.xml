<p>Anthropogenic climate change is presently exerting multifaced effects on ecosystems, communities, and populations (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>). The ecology, behavior, development, and survival of mosquitoes and the disease transmission dynamics are strongly influenced by climatic factors. Temperature, rainfall, and humidity are thought to be the main components influencing the life history of mosquitoes, even if other factors, such as the wind and photoperiod can have significant influence (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>). The same factors also influence the survival and transmission pattern of mosquito-borne pathogens â€“ for example, the temperature affects the rate of pathogen multiplication within the insect, which in turn affects the rate of infective organisms in the salivary secretion and thus the likelihood of successful transmission to another host (
