<p>Influenza A virus is a fascinating pathogen from a scientist's perspective, with a potentially high impact on animal and human health. The virus is enzootic in wild migratory birds of aquatic habitats around the world [

Influenza A viruses occasionally spill over from this avian “virus reservoir” into other animal hosts, including domestic poultry, pigs, horses, a variety of carnivores, and marine mammals. Most spillover events involve limited numbers of animals, but on occasion, when more sustained transmission within the new species takes place, they may result in large outbreaks. Sporadically, the viruses adapt to their new animal hosts, leading to enzootic virus circulation for years or decades [
