<p>Since its first detection, in 1997, HPAI A/H5N1 virus has devastated the poultry industry of numerous countries of the Eastern Hemisphere. The continued circulation of A/H5N1 viruses in poultry for over a decade and their occasional spill over to wild birds and mammals, including humans, have led to ongoing virus evolution. More than 10 distinct “clades” of H5N1 viruses have been described since 1997, from which new sublineages or clades emerge periodically [
 <xref rid="JIS257C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Whether such ongoing evolution could eventually lead to the emergence of A/H5N1 virus with pandemic potential has remained a key question since the first documented infections in humans, in Hong Kong. Many experts have judged this risk to be very low because of existing dogmas in the influenza field that stem from historical data on influenza pandemics: since all known previous pandemics were caused by influenza virus subtypes H1, H2, and H3 and since at least the last 2 emerged as a consequence of reassortment (ie, the mixing of genes of animal and human influenza viruses), it has often been argued that fully avian viruses of the H5 subtype could not gain pandemic potential [
 <xref rid="JIS257C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Our research program aimed to test whether A/H5N1 virus could acquire the ability to spread via aerosols in mammals after undergoing genetic changes similar to those identified in previous pandemic viruses. The results of such work would help to better assess the risks of the current A/H5N1 epizootics for human health and would increase our understanding of the contribution of particular mutations or reassortments and their associated biological traits to transmission of the virus. In other words, this work may have major prognostic value for prediction, prevention, and treatment of the next pandemic.
