<p>It is important to emphasize that even if individual occupational exposure to HPAI A/H5N1 virus occurred on rare occasion, primarily because of human error by personnel working under BSL3 and BSL4 conditions, several options are available to prevent subsequent exposure of the public at large and the environment. All of these options are in place at our facilities. First, H5 vaccines are offered to personnel handling the virus. Second, antiviral drugs are available for use as effective postexposure prophylaxis. Third, personnel can be quarantined upon exposure. Thus, despite the minute risk of occupational exposure, which is inherent to this type of work and perhaps unavoidable because of human error, the risks for the public and the environment can be reduced to nearly zero.</p>
