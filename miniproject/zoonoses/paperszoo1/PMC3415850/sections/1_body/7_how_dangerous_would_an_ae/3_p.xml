<p>Extrapolating from animal studies involving both macaques and ferrets, the virulence of the 1918 H1N1 virus, which had an estimated case-fatality rate of 2.5% in humans, was found to be within the same range as that for A/H5N1 virus [
 <xref rid="JIS257C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Serious limitations of these animal studies are that virulence in animals and humans may be different, that virulence may vary with the route and dose of virus inoculation, and that virulence may be strain dependent. Overall, it is our opinion that data from human cases, serological analyses, and animal studies indicate that the case-fatality rate of 60% is a vast overestimate. Additional work to provide better estimates is urgently needed.
