<p>The work of Yoshihiro Kawaoka's team and our team followed the normal route in which research in the life sciences is performed. The research agenda within the influenza field was discussed with a broad range of experts at meetings coordinated by agencies such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in the recent past. The need for more information on viral factors that affect transmission and contribute to the emergence of pandemic viruses was highlighted in the “Report of the Blue Ribbon Panel on Inﬂuenza Research, September 11–12, 2006” [

 <xref rid="JIS257C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Subsequently, funding agencies published requests for proposals to specifically address these issues [
 <xref rid="JIS257C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="JIS257C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] or considered funding such work through open competitive grant programs. Proposals were then peer reviewed, and the most competitive proposals were funded. At that stage, the need to perform this particular line of research was clearly agreed upon by the research field as a whole, the scientists proposing the work, the funding agencies, and the external reviewers. From the conception phase of the research onward, biosafety and biosecurity experts were consulted to provide assurance that facilities and working conditions were such that the safety and security could be ensured at all times [
