<p>Two major requirements determine the ability of a “new” influenza A virus strain to establish itself in the human population and cause a pandemic: (1) virus adaptation that enables efficient replication in the human respiratory tract and transmission between humans and (2) the absence of preexisting immunity in the human population. What exactly determines transmission of influenza viruses in humans has remained largely unknown, but all pandemic viruses studied to date have had the ability to be transmitted efficiently via aerosols or respiratory droplets (ie, airborne transmission) [
 <xref rid="JIS257C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Only when we fully understand the viral and host factors that drive airborne transmission can we start to estimate the risk that influenza viruses in the animal world may pose for future influenza pandemics. Important information and insights can come from studies of pandemic and zoonotic viruses in the laboratory, using animal model systems and reverse genetics. One candidate virus for such studies is the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A/H5N1 virus.
