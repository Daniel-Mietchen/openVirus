<p>First, from GenBank 
 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Benson1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, 888 genetic sequences of influenza A H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes were isolated from a variety of hosts between 1996 and 2009 across the areas of East-Southeast Asia covering Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Indonesia, and China. With reported geographic localities, the sequences could be assigned to lattices by geocoding. Multiple alignment of all sequences from each HA and NA gene was carried out using MUSCLE 
 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Edgar1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, and the HA and NA sequences were combined using TaxonDNA 
 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Meier1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. A phylogenetic tree for the combined dataset was constructed using neighbor-joining (NJ) 
 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Saitou1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> in PAUP* 4.0 
 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Swofford1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>(see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029617.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The best-fit model of genomic RNA substitution for the NJ analysis was assessed by Model test version 3.7 
 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Posada1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Base composition and pairwise comparisons were examined using MEGA version 4.02 
 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Tamura1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The NJ algorithm was adopted in this study because this distance-based method of phylogenetic reconstruction gave the genetic distances among the sequences that needed to be combined with the results of the other analysis in the knowledge fusion step.
