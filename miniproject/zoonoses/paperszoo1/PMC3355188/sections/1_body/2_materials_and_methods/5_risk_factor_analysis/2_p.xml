<p>A very large majority of lattice points have no outbreaks which makes fitting the logistic model to all the lattice points unsatisfactory (see also 
 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Gilbert1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>). We build models by selecting all outbreak-present lattice points and randomly selecting double the number of lattices points with no outbreaks. The number of H5N1 outbreaks in East-Southeast Asia including Indonesia and China are much lower than in Thailand and Vietnam. One thousand bootstrap replicates were implemented to ensure a satisfactory sample size for carrying out model inference. In each repeat, the coefficient and
