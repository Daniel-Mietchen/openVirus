 </inline-formula>30 because the number of cases is small relative to the original spatial resolution of the data which is extremely fine-grained. The observed outbreaks were converted to a rate by calculating for each areal unit the number of outbreak cases divided by the population at risk which is the human plus poultry population, (number of outbreak)/(population
