<p>Three analyses are implemented on raster data frames. The probability of the occurrence of HPAI H5N1 is estimated for each lattice point (or small pixel). Specifically, this study consists of four parts. First, phylogenetic tree are built for the evolution of the H5N1 virus. The branches and the topology of the tree describe the processes of viral evolution. The ability of a virus to survive in nature (its “capability”) is a characteristic of a virus which goes through a long evolutionary process with wide spatial dispersion and persistence over time. Strong capability may lead to a high probability of the disease spreading widely. In this study, the years and localities from which the genetic sequences were sampled are collated for each H5N1 virus. Integrating in space and time, the quantification of the phylogenetic tree is a feasible way to measure and map the capability of the H5N1 virus. Second, the local

The estimates obtained from the analysis are an indicator of outbreak clusters. Third spatial epidemiological analysis involves building a logistic regression model for analyzing the statistical association between the presence/absence of reported H5N1 outbreaks and eight socio-environmental variables. This model can be used to predict the probability of the occurrence of an H5N1 outbreak. The findings obtained from the three analyses provide evidence with which to explore the spatial distribution of H5N1. To present a powerful, robust, and unified result, Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is applied to integrate the different forms of evidence.
