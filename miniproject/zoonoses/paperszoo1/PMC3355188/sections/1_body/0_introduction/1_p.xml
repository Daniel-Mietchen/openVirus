<p>Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 first isolated in Guangdong province, southern China in 1996 
 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The HPAI H5N1 virus was redetected in East-Southeast Asia in late 2003 associated with large outbreaks among poultry in Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, and China 
 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The HPAI H5N1 influenza virus has established multiple regional sub-lineages and shown long-term persistence in these countries 
 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Also, the virus has continued its geographical migration through Southeast Asia to Eurasia and Africa. Disease control measures resulted in large numbers of domestic and wild birds being killed or culled to prevent a possible avian-influenza pandemic that might cost still more human lives in addition to huge economic loss 
 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Enserink1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. HPAI H5N1 is considered a serious public health risk despite relatively low numbers of human infections. The public health risk arises through the high human mortality rates (to September 2010, a total of 505 patients from 15 countries were known to have been infected by H5N1, of which about
