<p>However, any study that relies on only one kind of disciplinary knowledge may miss important connections. For example, not taking into account the effects caused by geographical scale (the so-called “modifiable areal unit problem” 
 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Openshaw1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>) could lead to interpretation errors when reviewing results from statistical analysis and modeling in area-based epidemiology. The predictive mapping of H5N1 risk in China, for instance, in Fang et al. 
 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, conflicts with empirical observations 
 <xref rid="pone.0029617-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0029617-FAO1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and previous studies

 <xref rid="pone.0029617-SmallmanRaynor1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Also, phylogenetic analysis 
 <xref rid="pone.0029617-CavalliSforza1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> has its own limitations when genetic data are incomplete, and evolutionary models inappropriate 
 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Penny1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. This form of analysis, which provides a micro-scale insight into the process of viral evolution, is insufficient for understanding macro-scale spread of avian influenza. In addition, uncertainty, perhaps arising from incomplete data, limited domain knowledge, or the application of an insufficiently sophisticated methodology could limit the value of these analyses. Wallace et al. states that limited sampling may lead to results that are not statistically significant
