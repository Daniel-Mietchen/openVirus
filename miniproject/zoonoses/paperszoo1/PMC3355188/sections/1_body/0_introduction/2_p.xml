<p>Traditional genetic analysis, which infers the phylogenetic relationships associated with the H5N1 virus from its genomic sequences, has enabled progress to be made in understanding the evolution of avian influenza viruses

 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. By this means, possible sources and pathways that are associated with the spread of the H5N1 virus can be inferred

 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Duan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Phylogeographic analysis 
 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Avise1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> offers a method of tracking the migration of the H5N1 virus. It analyzes the topology of the phylogenetic tree and uses evolutionary models to statistically infer the resident localities of the H5N1 virus 
 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Wallace1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Medical geography examines the spatial pattern of H5N1 looking for localized hot spots where outbreaks are significantly clustered 
 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Si1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In spatial epidemiology, risk factor analysis focuses on the identification of factors associated with H5N1 occurrence and statistical modeling is used to predict the incidence of the disease 
 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Gilbert1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. All these different forms of analyses have a common objective which is to understand the distribution and the spread of avian influenza. The study of avian influenza H5N1 is multi-disciplinary across Virology, Molecular Biology, Evolutionary Biology, Medical Geography, and Spatial Epidemiology.
