<p>This article proposes a novel approach to integrating the findings of phylogenetic analysis, which unravels H5N1 evolution in space and time, with modified local 
 <italic>K</italic> function analysis, which identifies outbreak clusters in space, and also with spatial epidemiology, which determines socio-ecological factors associated with the occurrence of H5N1. In this study, Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence

 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Shafer1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, a mathematical method for making inferences based on multiple forms of evidence and which recognizes the uncertainties associated with the different sources of evidence, is used to formally integrate the three sets of findings. The present study is novel and significant in seeking to lay a solid foundation for the inter-disciplinary study of this and other relevant influenza epidemics. First, it uses genetic sequences and space-time data to create a phylogenetic tree to estimate the virus' capability of spreading. This is the first attempt to provide a mapping of H5N1 viruses derived from the phylogenetic tree. Second, by integrating the results obtained from the three analyses, we offer insights into the occurrence and space-time spread of H5N1 that have a higher level of correlation with empirical evidence than is found when analysis is based on only one methodology. In addition, we apply the methodology across multiple scales; that is to the whole of East-Southeast Asia as well as the individual countries of Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, and China, respectively. Our analysis results in a significant advance in findings over those reported in, for example, Gilbert et al. 
 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Gilbert1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and we believe our findings are more precise and informative in representing the occurrence and the space-time dynamics associated with the spread of H5N1.
