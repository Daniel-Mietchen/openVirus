<p>For Vietnam, the greatest risk occurs in the north and to a lesser extent the south of the country (

 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Gilbert1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, our results not only model the spatial distribution of H5N1 outbreaks, but also the space-time dynamics of viral evolution. Our analysis combines real-world outbreak data with evidence on viral evolution. For instance, the H5N1 virus was first detected and became established around Hanoi, north Vietnam, in 2001 and consequently spread to the south around Ho Chi Minh city

 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Furthermore, the northern H5N1 virus is associated with novel genetic subtypes, and these have facilitated the spread of the disease both within and outside the country

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029617.s001">Figure S1</xref> again demonstrates that the risk estimates obtained from our integrated analysis correspond more closely than the results from Gilbert et al. to the empirical outbreak pattern at a range of different scales.
