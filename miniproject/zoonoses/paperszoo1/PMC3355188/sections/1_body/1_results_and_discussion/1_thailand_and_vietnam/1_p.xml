 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029617.s001">Figure S1</xref>(c) and (f) demonstrate our estimate of the spatially varying ‘degree of belief’ in the level of risk of H5N1 obtained by integrating the three forms of analysis (see

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029617.s001">Figures S1</xref>(b) and (e) are the results from the epidemiological analysis of Gilbert. et al. 
 <xref rid="pone.0029617-Gilbert1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In both cases the closer any area's value is to 1 (the redder it is) the greater the likelihood of an H5N1 outbreak in that area. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029617.s001">Figure S1</xref> also reports Pearson correlation coefficients (R) and associated 
 <italic>p</italic>-values which show that our experimental patterns ((c) and (f)) have a closer correspondence to the observed pattern of cases ((a) and (d)) than the results of Gilbert et al.
