<p>For China, our result shows that the highest risk of H5N1 is in Guangdong, Yunnan, Fujian, and areas close to Dongting Lake in Hunan province, south China. High risk also appears to extend along the coastline of southern China (see

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0029617-t001">Table 1</xref>), including altitude, population density, poultry density, and the shortest distances to inland water bodies, coastlines, migratory bird pathways, railways, and roads, fail to show statistical significance within the two periods between 1996 and 2004, and 2005 and 2009. This might be due to data limitations associated with using such a short time span.
