 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029617-g002">Figure 2(f)</xref> depicts the risk of occurrence of avian influenza H5N1 in East-Southeast Asia. The large-scale mapping shows that the highest risk is in central Thailand and the northern and southern parts of Vietnam. The central part of Indonesia also has high risk. Compared to these countries, China appears to have lower levels of risk, especially in the northwest including Tibet and Xinjiang autonomous regions, and the northern part of Qinghai province. This pattern can be regarded as a reflection of the relationship between the disease and heterogeneity of the local socio-ecological environment. The logistic regression analysis indicates that outbreaks significantly (

In East-Southeast Asia, most cities and countries are usually located in areas where the environment is suitable for human habitation and agricultural production. Rice cropping and poultry rearing are popular in Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, and south China. These countries benefit from abundant hydrological resources (e.g., river deltas), but suffer from ecological-environmental problems caused by a rapidly increasing population which in turn facilitates the establishment of multiple H5N1 sublineages
