   <bold>NJ tree of the 888 H5N1 concatenation of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) DNA sequences from East-Southeast Asia covering Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia, and China.</bold> The best model is TVM+I+G (transversional model incorporating invariable sites and rate variation among sites). The goose H5N1 DNA sequence from Guangdong in 1996 (A/Goose/Guangdong/1/96) is used to root the tree. The length of a unit is .02. The taxa are colored by locality with green for Thailand, blue for Vietnam, orange for Indonesia, and black for all others including China, Cambodia, Laos, and purple, especially, for Qinghai province, western China.
