  <title>Survival of mice after vaccination and challenge infection with CHIKV.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>). Mice (n = 8) were immunized intra-muscularly with MVA-6KE1, MVA-E3E2, MVA-E3E26KE1 or MVA-wt. Subsequently, the mice were challenged intra-peritoneally with 1000 TCID
   <sub>50</sub> CHIKV-S27. The survival rates of the mice after challenge are depicted as Kaplan-Meier curves. Differences between the curves were determined by the log-rank test. (
   <bold>B, C, D</bold>). Vial RNA copies were determined in spleen (B), liver (C) and brain (D) samples of animals that succumbed to the infection and survivors (day 14 post challenge). (
   <bold>E</bold>) Neutralizing antibody titers were determined on day 0, 21, 63, 70, and 77. Animals were immunized on day 0 and 21 and challenged on day 63. A clear booster response is seen after challenge, where a higher response was measured in MVA-6KE1 immunized group. The results are expressed as TCID
   <sub>50</sub> equivalents per gram of tissue; *indicates a statistically significant result (
   <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) and ** indicates highly significant results (
   <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) as determined by the 
   <italic>Student's t test</italic>.
