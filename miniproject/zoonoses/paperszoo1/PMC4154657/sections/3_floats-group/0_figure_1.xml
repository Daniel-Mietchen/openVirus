  <title>Analysis of candidate vaccines.</title>
  <p>Different MVA constructs were checked for presence of the specific transgene E3E2 (panel A), E3E26KE1 (panel B), and 6KE1 (panel C) using different sets of primers (
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003101.s001">Table S1</xref>). PCRs were conducted on DNA extracted from uninfected BHK-21 cells (lane 1, negative pcr), BHK-21 cells infected with wildtype MVA (lane 2) and recombinant MVA DNA (lanes 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13), as positive controls shuttle vector containing the three respective transgenes (lane 4, 6, 8, 10,12 and 14) were used as a template. Amplicons were separated on 1% agarose gel with Sybrsafe staining and were visualised under blue light transillumination. M Smartladder, kb molecular weight.
