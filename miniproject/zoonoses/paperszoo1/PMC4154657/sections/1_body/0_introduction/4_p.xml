<p>Recombinant Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is among the most promising live viral vector systems, because of its well-established biological and clinical safety, together with its suitability for expression of various heterologous proteins. MVA was originally developed as a safe and effective vaccine against smallpox by employing serial passages in primary chicken embryo cells

 <xref rid="pntd.0003101-Mayr1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. After more than 570 passages in avian tissue culture MVA had lost the ability to undergo multiple rounds of productive replication in a broad range animal species including humans
