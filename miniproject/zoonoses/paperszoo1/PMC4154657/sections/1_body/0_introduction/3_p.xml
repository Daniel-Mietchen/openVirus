<p>CHIKV is composed of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of about 12 kb and contains two open-reading frames (ORFs). These two ORFs encode four non-structural proteins (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4), which are important for virus replication, and five structural proteins (C, E1, E2, E3 and 6K). The capsid (C) proteins surround the RNA molecule and together form the nucleocapsid. The E1/E2 heterodimers are embedded in the viral membrane and the average CHIKV particle contains around 80 E1/E2 spikes projecting from the viral envelope. Alphaviruses enter susceptible cells after attachment to cellular receptors on many different cell types. The E1 spike protein drives the fusion process within the cytoplasm, while the E2 protein is believed to interact with cellular receptors and therefore most probably constitute the target of neutralizing antibodies
