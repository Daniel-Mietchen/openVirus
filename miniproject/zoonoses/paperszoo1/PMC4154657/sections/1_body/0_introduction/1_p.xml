<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) belongs to the family 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>, genus Alphavirus. The virus was first isolated in 1952 during an epidemic of arthralgic disease in Tanzania, and CHIKV is now known as a mosquito-borne virus endemic in many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa as well as in Asia 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003101-Charrel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Epidemic CHIKV is maintained mainly as an urban transmission cycle, involving humans as amplification hosts and the peri-domestic mosquitoes 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, and since recently also 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. Large outbreaks have been reported since 2004, with the first description originating from Kenya

 <xref rid="pntd.0003101-Ravi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. These epidemics resulted in up to six million cases, with regular importation of the virus in Europe, Southeast Asia and the Americas

The widespread dissemination of CHIKV is associated with amino acid mutations in the glycoprotein E1 (A226V), which facilitated adaptation of CHIKV to the
