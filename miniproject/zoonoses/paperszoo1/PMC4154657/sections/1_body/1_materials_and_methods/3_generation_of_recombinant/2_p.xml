<p>Recombinant MVA expressing 6KE1, E3E2, and E3E26KE1 (MVA-6KE1, MVA-E3E2, MVA-E3E26KE1) were generated using the principles of homologous recombination targeting the site of major deletion III within the MVA genome for insertion of recombinant gene sequences. Primary CEF were infected with MVA followed by transfection of the infected cells with pIIIRedH5 DNA, using FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche). Clonal isolates of recombinant MVA were obtained by multiple rounds of plaques purification on CEF cells and screening for the transient expression of the fluorescent marker mCHERRY. In each round, the MVA genome at the insertion site was analyzed by PCR and recombinant gene expression was confirmed by immunostaining of BHK-21 cells infected with selected recombinant viruses. Clonal recombinant MVAs expressing mCHERRY were further propagated on CEF until loss of the transient marker mCHERRY. To this end, limiting dilutions of the recombinant viruses were done and wells with the highest virus dilution displaying cpe were selected for further analysis. To generate the vaccine batches for the pre-clinical animal studies, all recombinant MVA were propagated in a multistep amplification process on CEF cells, purified by ultracentrifugation through 20% sucrose, and reconstituted in TE buffer, pH 9.0. Expression of the respective genes was confirmed by Western blot analysis of lysates of infected BHK-21 cells. Six different PCR primer sets were used to confirm the genetic integrity of the recombinant viruses (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003101.s001">Table S1</xref>). The sequence of all inserted recombinant genes was confirmed to be identical to the original CHIKV-S27 sequence using the 3130Ã—l automatic sequencer (ABI).
