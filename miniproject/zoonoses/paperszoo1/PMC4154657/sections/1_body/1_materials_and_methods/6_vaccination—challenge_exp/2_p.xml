<p>Six weeks after the last immunization (day 63), all animals were challenged by intraperitoneal inoculation of 10
 <sup>3</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of CHIKV-S27 in a total volume of 100 Âµl and animals were checked daily for clinical signs of infection, such as lethargy and hind limb weakness. Animals were then sacrificed either 14 days post challenge or earlier if a humane end point (immobility and paralysis) was reached. At the end of the experiment, the survival rates were analyzed and compared between groups.
