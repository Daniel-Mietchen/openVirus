 <xref rid="pntd.0003101-vandenBroek1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> have been described previously to be susceptible to CHIKV infection 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003101-Partidos1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The AG129 mice were purchased from B&amp;K Universal (UK) at the age of six weeks. Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and were allowed to adjust to the facility for one week before experiments were performed. Four groups of mice (n = 8 for each group) were immunized with the MVA-6KE1, MVA-E3E2 and E3E26KE1 twice at 3-week intervals. Wildtype (wt) MVA was used as a negative control. All MVA stocks had a concentration of 10
