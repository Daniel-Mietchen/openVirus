<p>Vero E6 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (HI-FBS), supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin/L-glutamine (2 mM) (psg; Biowhittaker for all), sodium bicarbonate and 10 mM hepes buffer. Baby hamster kidney BHK-21 cells (clone 13, 
 <named-content content-type="gene">ATCC</named-content> CCL-10) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% HI-FBS and psg. 
 <italic>Aedes pseudoscutelaris</italic> insect cells (AP-61) were grown in Leibovitz-15 medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 5% tryptose phosphate broth medium (MP Biomedicals), psg and 5% HI-FBS. Cells were grown and maintained at 27Â°C. Primary chicken embryo fibroblast cells (CEF) were isolated from 11-day old embryonated chicken eggs and maintained in DMEM (BioWhittaker) supplemented with psg, non-essential amino acids (Sigma) and 10% HI-FBS.
