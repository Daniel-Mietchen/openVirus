<p>The African prototype CHIKV-S27 strain (genbank acc.nr. AF369024), the CHIKV-IND/NL10, and LS3 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003101-Scholte1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> strains were grown on Vero E6 cells and virus titers were determined after titration of virus stocks on Vero E6 cells. To this end, 96-wells plates (greiner) were seeded with 5×10
 <sup>4</sup> Vero cells per well. A serial ten-fold dilution of virus stocks was made in octaplicates on the seeded plates, and plates were subsequently incubated for four days at 37°C. The Vero E6 plates were scored microscopically for cytopathic changes (cpe). Viral titers were expressed as TCID
 <sub>50</sub> per ml as calculated with the Kärber method 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003101-Brownie1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The highly attenuated vaccinia virus (VACV) strain MVA (clonal isolate F6, CEF passage 584) was used for this study. MVA is derived from VACV chorioallantois virus Ankara (CVA) by more than 570 passages in CEF. During this serial passage MVA incurred six major deletions and many smaller mutations in its genome and developed a severe restriction in host range so that it is unable to replicate in most mammalian cells
