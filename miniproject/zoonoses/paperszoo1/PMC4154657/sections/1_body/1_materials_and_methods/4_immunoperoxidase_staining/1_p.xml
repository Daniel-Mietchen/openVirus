<p>Cells were fixed in methanol, washed with PBS, blocked for endogenous peroxidase with hydrogen peroxide and after two washes with PBS cells were subsequently stained with polyclonal rabbit anti-E1 or rabbit anti-E2 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003101-Metz1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> for 1 hour at 37°C. Cells were washed twice with PBS and primary antibody was detected using peroxidase labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) after incubation for 45 min at 37°C and 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) substrate for 10 min at RT. Amount of cells expressing the recombinant proteins were counted using a light microscope.
