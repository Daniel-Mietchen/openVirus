<p>The animal experiments described in this paper were conducted according to Dutch guidelines for animal experimentation after approval (EMC 2514, 122-11-27) by the Animal Welfare Committee of the Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Research plans were reviewed by the local ethical review committee, which considered the benefit of an experiment against the cost of distress inflicted to the animals during the experiments. Appropriate practices and procedures as defined in the Biosafety in microbiological and biomedical laboratories (US Dept. of Health and Human Services) were used in sample handling. Samples were stored at −80°C in a biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) facility at the Erasmus Medical Centre Rotterdam, The Netherlands.</p>
