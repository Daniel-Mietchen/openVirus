<p>Tissues were removed and fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 4 µm. Slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and analyze by light microscopy. Subsequently, 4-µm thick paraffin sections were processed for immunohistochemistry. To this end, sections were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated in descending concentrations of ethanol and incubated for 10 min in 3% H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> diluted in PBS to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Antigen exposure was performed by incubation for 15 min at 121°C in citrate buffer (0.01 M, pH 6.0). Sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with rabbit-anti-CHIKV capsid (1∶5000), and the primary antibody was detected with secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG-PO (1∶100; Dako, The Netherlands). Sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin and mounted with Kaiser's glycerin-gelatin and analyzed using a light microscope.
