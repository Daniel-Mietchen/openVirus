<p>To investigate whether the recombinant MVA-E3E26KE1 lead to generation of VLPs, BHK-21 and Hela cells were infected with the recombinant MVA, using an MOI of 1 and 10. Supernatant were collected 24 hours and 48 hours after infection. Supernatant were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1200 rpm and 10 µl was used for EM analysis. Briefly, Copper 400 square mesh grids (Veco) were treated by Argon gas discharge and loaded with 5 µl culture fluid of MVA-infected cells for 30 sec at room temp. Excess liquid was removed using filter paper and the grids were treated with 2% uranyl acetate for 30 sec, excess uranyl acetate was carefully removed using filter paper. The grids were air dried and analyzed with a JEOL JEM 1011 transmission electron microscope at the Wageningen Electron Microscopy Centre.</p>
