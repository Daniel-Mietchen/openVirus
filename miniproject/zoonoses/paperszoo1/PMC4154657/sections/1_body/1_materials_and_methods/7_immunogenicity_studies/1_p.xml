<p>To characterize the antibody responses triggered by immunization with the recombinant MVA vaccines, a virus neutralization test was performed. To this end, sera of immunized mice were heat-inactivated and diluted (1∶10 to 1∶2560) in triplicate in 96-wells plate and 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of CHIKV-S27, CHIKV-IND/NL10 or CHIKV-LS3 was added to each well. After one hour of incubation at 37°C, 1×10
 <sup>4</sup> Vero E6 cells were added to each well and plates were incubated for another four days. Neutralizing titres were determined microscopically and expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution still giving 100% suppression of cpe.
