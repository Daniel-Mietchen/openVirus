<p>In order to quantify relative numbers of viral RNA in the respective tissues, 100 µL of organ homogenate was added to 400 µL of lysis buffer (Roche). Viral RNA was then extracted from spleen, liver, kidney, spinal cord, and brain samples using the automated MagnaPure method (Total nucleic acid isolation kit, Roche Diagnostics, the Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and quantified using a one-step RT-PCR TaqMan protocol (EZ-kit, Applied Biosystems) and an ABI PRISM 7500 detection instrument. The primers and probe used for CHIKV RNA quantification were essentially as described
