<p>When animals reached the humane-endpoint after challenge, they were sacrificed and several tissues were collected to quantify virus titers. High levels of CHIKV RNA were detected in the liver and spleen (average: 10
 <sup>5</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> equivalents/g tissue), and moderate amounts of viral RNA were found in the brain (average: 10
 <sup>2</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> equivalents/g tissue) of mock vaccinated animals. However, no viral RNA was detected in the kidney or spinal cord of the infected animals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003101-g003">Figure 3 Bâ€“D</xref>). Six out of 8 animals immunized with MVA-E3E26KE1 and challenged with CHIK-S27 had very low levels viral RNA detectable in the spleen (range: 12 to 68 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> equivalents/g tissue) and only 2 out of 8 animals had low RNA levels in the liver. No RNA was detected in the brain of these, indicating that MVA-E3E26KE1 provided high level protection against virus replication in the periphery and the brain. By contrast, most animals immunized with MVA-6KE1 and MVA-E3E2 and challenged with CHIKV-S27 had virus RNA in the liver, spleen and brain. The two animals that died after immunization with MVA-6KE1 had high levels of viral RNA in these organs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003101-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Infectious virus could not be recovered from any of the animals that received either MVA-E3E2 or MVA-E3E26KE1. On the other hand, low levels of infectious virus were isolated from the spleen of all the animals that received the MVA-6KE1 vaccine. However, the exact amount infectious virus in the spleen of these animals could not be determined because of toxicity in cell culture.
