<p>Immunohistochemical analyses were performed on tissues of animals that died as a result of CHIKV challenge and tissues collected from animals that survive the infection (day 14). No significant abnormalities were observed in the HE staining of the liver, brain, spinal cord, or leg skeletal muscle of neither the sick nor the healthy animals. In majority of the sick animals, neutrophils were seen in the sinusoids in the liver (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003101-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). This pathological finding was not observed in mice that survived the infection. Furthermore, abundant CHIKV antigens were detected in endothelial cells of all examined organs. In addition, antigen was detected in Kupffer cells in the liver (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003101-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) and adipocytes in the muscles of all mice that succumbed to infection. Few cells of the choroid plexus and endothelial cells were found antigen positive in the brain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003101-g004">Figure 4E</xref>), whereas no antigens were found in the spinal cord of any mice (not shown). Furthermore, no CHIKV antigen was detected in any organs of the animals that survived the infection. The negative immunohistochemical results obtained in the spleen of surviving animals that received MVA-6KE1, suggest low levels of virus in these animals.
