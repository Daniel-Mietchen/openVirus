<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003101-t001">table 1</xref>, immunization with MVA-6KE1 and MVA-E3E2 induced low levels of neutralizing antibodies (range: 10–20) against both CHIKV-S27 and CHIKV-IND/NL10, 56 days post immunization. In contrast, recombinant MVA expressing the structural envelope cassette E3E26KE1 induced significantly higher levels of neutralizing antibodies compared to the other two candidate vaccines (P&lt;0.05), with titers ranging from 40–160. Only MVA-E3E26KE1 induced neutralizing antibodies in 100% of the animals after one vaccination (day 21). Similar titers were obtained in neutralization assay using the LS2 strain (not shown).
