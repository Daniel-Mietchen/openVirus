<p>The first step in generation of the candidate vaccines was selection of recombinant MVA that contained CHIKV-S27 gene sequences of interest. These recombinant viruses expressed the mCHERRY marker and contained the expected CHIKV gene. Next the recombinant viruses were passaged until they were mCHERRY-free and all constructs underwent thorough quality control PCR (
