<p>In order to investigate whether the MVA-E3E26KE1 construct resulted in production of VLPs, supernatant of cells infected with the MVA construct were collected several time points after infection. Extensive screening with electron microscopy revealed no presence of VLPs, suggesting that MVA-E3E26KE1 did not result in generation of VLPs.</p>
