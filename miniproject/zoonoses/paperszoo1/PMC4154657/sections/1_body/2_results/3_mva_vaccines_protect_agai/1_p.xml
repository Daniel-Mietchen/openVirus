<p>In order to study the protective efficacy of the different recombinant MVA candidate vaccines, all the mice were challenged intra-peritoneally with a lethal dose of CHIKV-S27. The survival rates of the eight animals were monitored in each group after challenge. All mock-vaccinated (MVA-wt) mice died within five days post infection (

In contrast, 75% (6/8) of the animals immunized with 6KE1 were protected against lethal infection caused by challenge with CHIKV-S27. A clear booster response could be seen in all the groups (

The anamnestic response in animals that received MVA-E3E26KE1 was two-fold lower than those immunized with MVA-E3E2, indicating that these two candidate vaccines provided similar levels of protection.
