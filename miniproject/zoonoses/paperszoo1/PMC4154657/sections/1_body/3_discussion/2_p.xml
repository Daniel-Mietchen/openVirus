<p>To date, there are no licensed drugs or vaccines against CHIKV for use in humans. Safety and immunogenicity are major concerns when developing new vaccines. Recombinant vector vaccines such as MVA represent attractive alternatives for safe and effective vaccines. One theoretical disadvantage of an extensive use of the MVA system is the development of anti-MVA immunity. Several studies have shown that MVA is effective in eliciting protection against several virus infections and is not affected by anti-MVA immunity

 <xref rid="pntd.0003101-Lai1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In this study, we have constructed several recombinant MVA vaccines that express E1, E2, or a combination of E1E3. We have chosen to clone the structural proteins from the West African CHIKV strain S27. E1 of S27 differs from la Reunion strain (LR2006) in only three amino acids (A226V, M270V, and V323A). These mutations are conserved. The E2 of S27 differed in six amino acids however (G57K, G79E, I211T, M266R, T312M, and A344T). The CHIK-NL10 strain was 100% identical to the LR2006 in the E1 protein and had only two mutations in the E2 (S191T and K252Q) compared to LR2006. However, because the S27 strain replicates faster in vitro and it is more virulent than NL10 in mice (not shown), we decided to use the S27 strain as the protein donor for the vaccine and challenge virus. A dose of 5×10

 <sub>50</sub> of recombinant MVA expressing E3E26KE1 rendered 100% protection against disease in challenged mice and the data suggest that presence of neutralizing antibodies correlates with protection. The antibody neutralization titers against a heterologous strain of CHIKV, which is more similar to LR2006, suggest that a vaccine based on the S27 strain would provide sufficient cross-protection against a different CHIKV strain. The relatively low levels of neutralizing antibody titers obtained against S27, NL10 and LS3 is unlikely to be explained by differences between the viruses. The most likely explanation is the relatively low dose of the vaccine that was administered, which was 1–2 log lower than what is normally given to reach high levels of antibody titers (10

 <sub>50</sub>). The LS3 CHIKV strain is a synthetic virus based on the consensus sequence of several CHIKV strains. It is interesting to note that low levels of virus RNA could still be detected in 75% (6/8) of the spleens of animals immunized with E3E26KE1. Whether infectious virus persists is not known. It has been shown that CHIKV may persist in macrophages of humans and macaques long after acute infection

 <xref rid="pntd.0003101-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. All the platforms that express E1 and E2 rendered mice complete protection. It is known that vaccines based on inactivated virus or subunit proteins need to be adjuvanted to achieve satisfying immunogenicity. However, the use of adjuvants in humans is conflicting and non-adjuvanted vaccines are preferable. Live-attenuated vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective for several viral infections, but are associated with side-effects and there is fear for reversion to a virulent phenotype. Consistently, live-attenuated CHIKV vaccines have been shown to be more immunogenic in animal models and humans, but were associated with some side-effects

In this study we used AG129 mice, which are deficient in IFN-α, β, and γ receptor. It has been suggested that IFN-α and IFN-β system mainly inhibits early spread of virus from the primary site of infection, whereas the IFN-γ system may play a more important role in later stages of viral infection, e.g., viral persistence
