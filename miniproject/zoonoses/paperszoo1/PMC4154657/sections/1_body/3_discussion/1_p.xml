<p>In the present study, we have evaluated recombinant MVA expressing the structural genes of CHIKV-S27 for induction of protective immunity. Immunization of AG129 mice with MVAs expressing E2 or the entire CHIKV envelope polyprotein cassette E3E26KE1 provided 100% protection against lethal disease. Development of neutralizing antibodies correlated with protection against lethal infection
