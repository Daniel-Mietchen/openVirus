Although infection usually leads to a readily identifiable rash disease, virus transmission begins prior to the onset of the rash and is very efficient. The infectiousness of measles virus has proven to be one of the barriers to elimination, as the threshold for herd immunity requires 93â€“95% of the population to be immune. Achieving this level of immunity with a vaccine that has a 95% seroconversion rate requires delivery of two doses of the vaccine (
