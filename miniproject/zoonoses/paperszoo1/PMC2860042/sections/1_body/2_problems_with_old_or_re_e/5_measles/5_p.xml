<p>The neurological complications of measles include the autoimmune disease, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (1:1000, primarily older children) and the progressive CNS infection subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) (1:10,000, primarily children infected before the age of 2 years) appearing 7â€“10 years after acute infection (

Because of the difficulty of the diagnosis and a shortage both of neuroimaging facilities and neurologists, the disease may not always be recognized or reported. Alternatively, cases may be being diagnosed, but reports have not appeared in the literature (

More research on neurologic complications of measles in developing countries will help to determine if manifestations and susceptibility differ between populations and may shed light on the poorly understood pathogenesis of SSPE.
