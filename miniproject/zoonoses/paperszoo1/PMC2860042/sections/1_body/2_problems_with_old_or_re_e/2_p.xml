<p>Viruses, such as smallpox, that have humans as the only host, offer the opportunity for eradication and this is a current goal for poliovirus. Features of smallpox that were important for the eradication effort included a distinctive rash that facilitated identifications of all infections, and the availability of an easily administered vaccine that conferred long-lasting protective immunity. Other factors that affect the possibility of virus eradication include the infectiousness of the virus and an international commitment to the goal of eradication.</p>
