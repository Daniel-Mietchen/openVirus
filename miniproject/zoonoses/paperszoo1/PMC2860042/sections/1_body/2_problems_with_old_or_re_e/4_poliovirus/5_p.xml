<p>However, in the same year a new problem was recognized. Viruses isolated from a cluster of children with paralysis on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola were identified as mutated vaccine viruses that had circulated in an under vaccinated population for about 2 years and had reacquired neurovirulence. Subsequently, several other polio outbreaks were identified as due to vaccine-derived polioviruses that can circulate widely (

However, spread to nonprotected individuals can occur and result in paralytic disease. Recombination between the vaccine strains, as well as other related enteroviruses, such as Coxsackie A viruses, is also frequent, although importance of this for acquisition of virulence is less clear (
