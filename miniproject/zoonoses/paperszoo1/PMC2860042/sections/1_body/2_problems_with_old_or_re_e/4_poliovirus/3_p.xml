<p>There are three poliovirus serotypes and immunity must be induced to all three for full protection from paralytic disease. This can be accomplished either through the use of an inactivated vaccine or a live attenuated virus vaccine. The inactivated vaccine induces serum antibody that prevents virus spread to the CNS, but does not necessarily prevent infection of the gut. The live attenuated vaccine is essential for eradication efforts because it is delivered orally, infects and induces immunity in the intestinal tract and protects against subsequent wild type virus infection and thus interrupts silent spread of wild type virus from person-to-person.</p>
