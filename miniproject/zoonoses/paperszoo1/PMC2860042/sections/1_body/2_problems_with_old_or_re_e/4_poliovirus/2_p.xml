<p>Poliovirus is an enterovirus that is spread by the oral route through contaminated food and water and causes asymptomatic infection in the majority of people. It is approximately two times more infectious than smallpox virus, but only one in 100â€“200 will develop virus spread to motor neurons in the CNS followed by acute flaccid paralysis due to motor neuron death or dysfunction. Thus, unlike smallpox, poliovirus can circulate widely in the population in the absence of symptoms. Furthermore, virus can continue to be shed from the gastrointestinal tract for weeks after infection. Therefore, laboratory tests are needed to identify poliovirus infection and surveillance relies on identifying cases of acute flaccid paralysis associated with poliovirus in the stool.</p>
