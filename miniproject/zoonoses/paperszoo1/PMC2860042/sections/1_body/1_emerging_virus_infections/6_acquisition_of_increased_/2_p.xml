<p>Several recently emergent viruses, including WNV and CHIKV, appear to be more neurovirulent than their predecessors, although specific mutations responsible for this have not been identified. In general, increased neurovirulence is associated with improved ability of a virus to enter the CNS and usually with more efficient replication in neurons that can result in neuronal cell death (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Griffin, 1998</xref>). Another important current example is enterovirus 71 (EV71). EV71, along with other closely related type A enteroviruses, causes hand, foot and mouth disease. However, EV71 has gained the ability to invade the CNS and cause a spectrum of serious neurologic syndromes, including meningitis, encephalitis and paralysis, in young children (
