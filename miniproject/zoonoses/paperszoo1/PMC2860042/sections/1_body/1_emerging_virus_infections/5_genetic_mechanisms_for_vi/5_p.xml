<p>An additional mechanism for virus evolution is recombination. In this case, two similar viruses that infect the same cell can recombine different portions of their genomes to produce new viruses. This is commonly observed for enteroviruses that can infect and be shed from the gastrointestinal tract for long periods of time. This is of current importance for poliovirus where the live virus vaccine includes three strains of polio that not only mutate, but also recombine with themselves and other enteroviruses to produce new vaccine-derived strains that may have increased virulence (
