<p>Influenza virus has eight gene segments and is the most important virus that evolves by reassortment. When two different strains of influenza (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> an avian strain and a human strain) infect the same host cell, the new progeny viruses can reassort the two sets of eight genes with a potential for 256 different combinations of segments in individual virus particles. This process results in viruses with new properties. Most will be less “fit” for human infection than the original viruses, but others may be able to replicate well in humans that do not have immunity to the new virus. This is the process that resulted in the antigenic shift that occurred prior to the influenza pandemics of 1957, 1968 and, most recently, 2009 (
