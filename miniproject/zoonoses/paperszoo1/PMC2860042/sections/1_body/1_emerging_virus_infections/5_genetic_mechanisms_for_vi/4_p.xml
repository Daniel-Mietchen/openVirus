<p>Mutation is an important mechanism of change for all RNA viruses because viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases are error-prone and have no built in mechanism for correcting mistakes (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Domingo et al., 2006</xref>). Polymerase errors, plus the lack of proofreading, results in one mistake approximately every 10,000 nucleotides, an average of one error in every genome. Furthermore, progeny viruses are produced in large numbers by infected cells. Most of these mutations will be deleterious to virus growth, but will occasionally be advantageous. It has recently been shown in animal models of polio and foot and mouth disease that this ability to vary is important for virulence (
