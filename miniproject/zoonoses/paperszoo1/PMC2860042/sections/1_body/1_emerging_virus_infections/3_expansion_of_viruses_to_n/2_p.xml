<p>Important examples of the expansion of the range of encephalitic viruses have been seen with the arthropod-borne viruses. These viruses are maintained in natural cycles involving both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts and can increase their range and cause human disease if introduced into a new location that has appropriate hosts available to maintain the natural cycle. Modern transportation has introduced vectors that efficiently transmit arboviruses into new areas (
