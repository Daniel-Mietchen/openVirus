<p>New infectious diseases are continuously emerging in the human population. These infections are most commonly due to RNA viruses and half of these newly recognized infections cause neurologic disease (
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Olival and Daszak, 2005</xref>). Changes in vector populations, in human association with reservoir hosts and appearance of new viral variants that are more efficiently transmitted are associated with emerging viruses. Emergence of new viral diseases of the CNS can come through expansion of viruses to new geographic regions, spread from an animal reservoir or by the acquisition of increased neurovirulence by a previously non-neurotropic virus.
