<p>Hendra is a paramyxovirus that was first identified when horses, and a few humans in close association with the horses in Australia, became ill with respiratory and neurologic disease that was often fatal. The related Nipah virus was recognized in Malaysia because of an outbreak of respiratory disease in swine and encephalitis in humans exposed to infected swine. For each, horses and pigs became infected through exposure to infected bats, and humans became infected through exposure to the infected horses and pigs. The viruses do not cause disease in the bat reservoir hosts. Recently, in Bangladesh, humans have developed fatal neurologic disease directly from exposure to infected bats with evidence of subsequent human-to-human spread (
