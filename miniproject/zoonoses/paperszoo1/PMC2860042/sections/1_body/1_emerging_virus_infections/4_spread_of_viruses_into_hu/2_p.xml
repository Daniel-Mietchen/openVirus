<p>Exposure of humans to animals provides the opportunity for animal viruses to spread into human populations. This may result only in infection of the exposed human (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> rabies after a bite from a rabid animal) or in infection that has or gains the ability to spread within the human population (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> HIV, SARS coronavirus) (
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Wolfe et al., 2007</xref>). For instance, lentiviruses of primates have been transmitted on multiple occasions to humans, but only a few strains acquired the ability for human-to-human transmission to become the HIV strains that are currently prevalent in human populations around the world (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Sharp et al., 2001</xref>). If, such as rabies, the virus remains a zoonosis with intermittent transmission to humans, then control of infection in animal populations is necessary to prevent human disease (
