<p>The nervous system can be a frequent site for opportunistic infections associated with immunosuppression due to HIV infection (
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Simpson and Tagliati, 1994</xref>) or treatment of malignancy or autoimmune disease with immunomodulatory drugs (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Major, 2009</xref>). These opportunistic neurologic infections can be new primary infections (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> cryptococcus, syphilis) or reactivation of infections that were previously controlled by the host immune response (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus, progressive multifocal encephalopathy). Furthermore, there is a risk of CNS immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome when antiretroviral treatment is initiated in HIV-infected individuals with profound immunosuppression. With widespread prevalence of HIV infection and increasing availability and use of antiretroviral and immunomodulatory drugs for treatment of HIV and autoimmune diseases, the importance of this source of neurologic disease is likely to increase.
