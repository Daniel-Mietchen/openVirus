<p>The highest burden of neurologic diseases, as defined by disability adjusted life years (DALYs), occurs in countries with the lowest income levels (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Johnston and Hauser, 2008</xref>). These countries have a disproportionate amount of disease due to neurologic damage associated with trauma and asphyxia at birth, but infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are also over-represented as a cause of death and long-term disability. Some infections, such as bacterial meningitis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated dementia, are important causes of CNS disease worldwide, while infections such as cerebral malaria, African trypanosomiasis and viral encephalomyelitis are often more geographically restricted. Many of the important viral neurologic infections are new diseases that have recently expanded their geographic range, spread from animal reservoirs or evolved to become more neurovirulent, while others are old diseases that continue to be problematic because of difficulties with treatment, vaccine delivery or vector control.
