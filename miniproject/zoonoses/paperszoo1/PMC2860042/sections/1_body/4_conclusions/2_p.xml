<p>Virus infections of the CNS are an important, but likely under-diagnosed cause of neurological disease in many developing countries. Because viruses are constantly evolving, there is a continuing opportunity for infection of new hosts, extending range, increasing virulence and producing new diseases. Furthermore, HIV and drug-induced immunosuppression has increased susceptibility and incidence of neurologic infections. Application of currently available control measures can lessen the burden of neurological disease in many vulnerable populations.</p>
