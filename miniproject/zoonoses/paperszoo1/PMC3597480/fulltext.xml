There have been detailed studies on YFV ecology in West Africa and South America, but current understanding of YFV circulation on the African continent is incomplete. This inadequacy is especially notable for East and Central Africa, for which the unpredictability of human outbreaks is compounded by limitations in both historical and present surveillance efforts. Sparse availability of nucleotide sequence data makes it difficult to investigate the dispersal of YFV in these regions of the continent. To remedy this, we constructed Bayesian phylogenetic and geographic analyses utilizing 49 partial genomic sequences to infer the structure of YFV divergence across the known range of the virus on the African continent. Relaxed clock analysis demonstrated evidence for simultaneous divergence of YFV into east and west lineages, a finding that differs from previous hypotheses of YFV dispersal from reservoirs located on edges of the endemic range. Using discrete and continuous geographic diffusion models, we provide detailed structure of YFV lineage diversity. Significant transition links between extant East and West African lineages are presented, implying connection between areas of known sylvatic cycling. The results of demographic modeling reinforce the existence of a stably maintained population of YFV with spillover events into human populations occurring periodically. Geographically distinct foci of circulation are reconstructed, which have significant implications for studies of YFV ecology and emergence of human disease. We propose further incorporation of Bayesian phylogeography into formal GIS analyses to augment studies of arboviral disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Yellow fever virus (YFV) is a mosquito-transmitted pathogen of great public health significance, which is endemic to tropical areas of Africa and South America. Despite the availability of an effective vaccine, and programs that exist in many endemic areas to reduce populations of mosquitoes, YFV continues to circulate and emerge in regions with developing public health infrastructures. Periodic outbreaks of YFV into humans are unpredictable and merit thorough investigation of the ecology and genetic diversity of the virus. Our analyses improve the current understanding of African YFV evolution in several respects. We have included unpublished viral sequence data from Central and East Africa, which is significant because the availability of YFV isolates from these regions is extremely limited. We present a modeled geographic structure of African YFV dispersal, and propose a new model for the spread of YFV based on concurrent historical movement of the virus from reservoirs in central African jungles to both eastern and western regions of the continent. Our results provide evidence for the presence of unique genotypes of the virus in both central and east African circulation. The presented findings not only provide insight to estimations of outbreak risk for the regions in question, but also contribute to rational GIS analysis and approaches to vaccination campaigns.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by NIH contract HHSN272201000040I/HHSN27200004/D04.

The enveloped, 50 nm particle, encloses a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 10.8 kb, bearing a 5&#x02032; cap, and 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; terminal untranslated regions (UTRs), without 3&#x02032; polyadenylation. Translation occurs as a single open reading frame, the product of which is co- and post-translationally cleaved into 10 functional proteins. The three structural proteins, capsid (C), pre-membrane/membrane (prM/M), and envelope (E), are upstream of 7 nonstructural proteins NS1, NS2A, NS2A, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5. Many members of the genus <italic>Flavivirus</italic> participate in complex transmission cycles that involve mammalian and insect hosts <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Holmes1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The risk of periodic emergence into humans depends upon many factors, including vaccination status, elevation, dispersal patterns, and interaction with competent vector populations.</p><p>Geographic distribution of YFV endemicity covers tropical areas of Africa and South America. For the African continent, human epidemics have been reported from western regions with more regular frequency than the east. This observation is almost certainly biased by regional differences in population density, vaccination coverage, and surveillance capacity <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Despommier1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. However, ecological factors presumably govern some observed differences in outbreak severity and frequency of East and West African YFV outbreaks. The natural history of human YFV infection includes periodic emergence events in rainforest perimeter transition zones, following contact of humans with infected hematophagous mosquitoes of the <italic>Aedes</italic> genus. Prediction of YFV emergence in East and Central Africa is confounded both by overlapping distributions of competent vectors and uncertain dynamics of sylvatic maintenance in populations of arboreal nonhuman primates. Sylvatic vector burden for the region in question is dominated by the diverse <italic>A. africanus</italic> complex, which ranges across the entirety of sub-Saharan Africa. Regardless of the structure of maintenance cycles, proximity to contiguous vector habitat is a prime risk factor of infection for susceptible human populations, an ecological property originally supported by high rates of seroprevalence in residents of Ugandan villages adjoining forest galleries of known YFV endemicity <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Mahaffy1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Viral dispersal patterns may have tracked with human movement as a consequence of civil unrest, or with agricultural and population changes brought by the European colonial era <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Ellis1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The displacement of north Ugandan citizens into temporary camps during civil conflicts of the previous two decades is a potential example of such an alteration to the YFV transmission landscape <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Internal1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Nucleotide sequence analysis of 3&#x02032;UTRs of representative YFV genomes have inferred a shared ancestry for West and East/Central African genotypes of the virus, based on the variable presence of one, two or three 41-nucleotide repeat segments, which presumably form secondary RNA structures that contribute to host range adaptation <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Mutebi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Funk1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Overall, phylogenetic and epidemiological analysis of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> supports a model of YFV emergence that is dependent upon both the presence of competent vectors and sylvatic nonhuman primate reservoir hosts <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Gaunt1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Grard1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Sampling history for YFV in Africa is limited, especially with respect to central and eastern regions of the continent. However, phylogenies derived from the use of the historical YFV isolates have yielded important data on the association of viral dispersal patterns with ecological features, including evidence for the existence of geographically associated YFV genotypes. The first phylogenetic evidence for geographic association of African YFV taxa resolved the bifurcation of African YFV circulation into east and west lineages <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Lepiniec1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Variable presence of repeat segments in the 3&#x02032; noncoding regions of YFV isolates was associated with the region of isolation (East/West Africa and South America), indicating a role for repeat element structures in virus range adaptation <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Mutebi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. A neighbor-joining analysis of African YFV strains, provided evidence for the presence of 5 prototype lineages in circulation in the continent, West Africa I, West Africa II, East Africa, East/Central Africa, and Angola <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Mutebi2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Subsequent analysis using full-length YFV sequences provided confirmatory evidence for the putative geographic structure <xref rid="pntd.0001910-vonLindern1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Bayesian estimation of divergence dates offers clarity to historical correlations of virus dispersal. Utilization of accurate clock models for arboviral phylogeny estimation is a matter of ongoing study. The reliability of this technique for measurements of viral evolutionary dynamics depends upon a combination of historical reference events, confirmation by independent data, and uncertainty of posterior estimates. In this manner, Bryant and colleagues estimated a plausible timescale of YFV divergence events, finding experimental support for the hypothesized introduction of YFV from West Africa to South America with the transatlantic slave trade <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Bryant1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Subsequently, relaxed clock analysis was used to estimate divergence histories for Trinidadian YFV isolates, producing evidence for enzootic maintenance of YFV on the island <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Auguste1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Significance of estimated dates was derived by correlation with observed recent history of YFV epizootic activity in nonhuman primate populations. A relaxed clock analysis was performed to determine phylogenetic placement of new sequence data from a Ugandan YFV outbreak that had occurred in 2010 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-McMullan1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. This rare acquisition of east African sequence data resulted in a tree of topology and time estimates consistent with other published materials, using a combination of envelope gene and full-length sequences.</p><p>Phylogeographic modeling incorporates distance and location under the presumption that these features are informative properties of the viral dispersal path. Most significantly, these methods permit direct testing of hypotheses on lineage dispersal and geographic association, including estimation of surface diffusion rates <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Lemey1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. We believe that use of diffusion analysis is justified for reconstruction of African YFV phylogenies due to both the origin of sequence isolations from a contiguous landmass, and epidemiological guidance that continuous vegetation is a useful proxy for YFV infection risk <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Jentes1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The spatial relationships between extant African YFV lineages are currently unknown <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Ellis1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Determination of lineage orientation in physical space offers clarity to the structure of periodic and uncertain disease emergence, especially for isolates of east African origin. Our dataset includes a recent historical phylogeny of African YFV ranging in time of isolation from the prototype strain Asibi, isolated in 1927, to a recent isolate from 2010 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-McMullan1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.

Most significantly, ancestral nodes of the subordinate genotypes were estimated to have arisen in a spatially biased sequence, with earlier nodes belonging to the east/central and west/central genotypes. This finding suggests that spatially outlying genotypes were the most recently established, and that ancestral populations of YFV were located centrally on the continent. Sall et. al. <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Sall1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> inferred a topology in which YFV taxa isolated from the Central African Republic are represented in both east and west lineages, implying a pattern of multiple YFV introductions from central reservoirs. Across the phylogeny, several instances of relatively high substitution rates are recovered in the earliest-emerged taxa of several clades (Nigeria/1948, Uganda/1948, Central African Republic/1977, Kenya/1993) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001910.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The appearance of these higher rates may be a result of periodic local expansions, and consequent increases in sequence diversity. This property exists in east and west lineages, and in all cases appears to precede diversification of a stable clade.</p><p>Previously described YFV sequence data supports ecological features of geographic niche association. 3&#x02032; UTRs of YFV contain specific repeat regions that occur with frequencies reflecting the major region of origin <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Mutebi3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The presence of three noncoding tandem repeat sequence elements in West African YFV isolates, and two in East African isolates, allows a parsimonious interpretation that one repeat segment is gained or lost in lineage diversification between East and West Africa. Discrete model estimates inferred in this study substantiate the longitudinal orientation of African lineage diversification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001910-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This finding provides a context to the paradigm of viral transition between contiguous vegetative ecosystems, a geographic proxy measure for human YFV infection risk <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Jentes1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The discrete model permits time-reversible transitions, or free lineage exchange between location states without preconditioned directionality. This aspect of the model mirrors the reality of sylvatic YFV circulation, in which epizootic foci are hypothesized to be geographically dynamic <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Bryant3" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Spatial boundaries represented by sequence features will only be fully resolved by rigorous surveillance.</p><p>The observation of positive selection for the envelope protein mutation G100S in the fusion loop has been demonstrated for prM/E alignments of YFV sequence data containing combined taxa of African and South American origin <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Bryant1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Vasconcelos1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The significance of the mutation G100S for African YFV emergence dynamics is unknown, but it arises independently three times in our expanded African dataset. Times between isolations of this mutation are seven years (Democratic Republic of Congo/1958 and Guinea Bissau/1965) and 27 years (Guinea Bissau/1965 and Senegal/1992), respectively. Selection at this site would be expected to be biologically significant. In aggregate, experimental evidence suggests that flavivirus envelope protein mutations in the fusion loop play a significant role in antigenicity and host entry. Mutational analysis of this region provided evidence for sequence conservation to facilitate effective fusion with host intracellular membranes <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Allison1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. A comparison of flavivirus fusion loop sequences found this mutation to occur mostly in YFV isolates, with rare occurrence in other members of the genus <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Seligman1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. The apparent mutational diversity at E100 has been found in temporally and geographically diverse YFV isolate groups, but the result of a selection pressure that has not been identified.</p><p>Significantly, the results of our BSSVS analysis strongly supports transitions that span the most ancestral node of the inferred tree, providing evidence for connection of the ecosystems of eastern and western circulation. Long-distance (Senegal-Ethiopia, The Gambia-Kenya) transitions were reconstructed from the West to each of the subordinate Eastern clades, implying a level of independence for the east and east/central genotypes for the seeding of virus from unobserved reservoirs. This property contrasts with the transitions reconstructed from the Western lineage, in which local diffusions are supported. Transitions to Angola were not supported by BSSVS significance criteria used in the study. This is not unexpected, considering that transition to Angola from eastern circulation is not consistent with the pattern of east-west diffusions so far described. However, the highest root state probability was estimated to have originated from Angola, implying that the 1971 urban outbreak in Luanda was seeded from a more ancestral population than is represented in the phylogeny to date. The virus Angola/1971 may have entered the population through a rare dispersal mechanism, such as traveler movement or population displacement. Disruptions to population or infrastructure provoked by the Nigerian Civil War (1967&#x02013;1970) or the Angolan War of Independence (1961&#x02013;1975) may represent appropriate historical correlations to the outbreak; however this interpretation must considered with caution as is it is based on a single isolation event.</p><p>Coalescent demographic analysis indicates stability of the viral population across the most adequately sampled timescale of the dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001910-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Biologically, this finding supports a classic model of persistent sylvatic arboviral maintenance. Campaigns of reactive mass vaccination presume risk to community members following the appearance of human cases, and is a response to presumed static dynamics of YFV spillover events during response timescales <xref rid="pntd.0001910-McMullan2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001910-World1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Irregular East African YFV emergence is a result of human intrusion into the range of viral circulation, including human movement as a consequence of civil unrest (a recent example is a 2005 Sudanese YFV outbreak, of which commentary suggested that previously blocked north/south pastoralist migration routes had opened due to relief in civil tensions, exposing immunologically naive individuals to fatal YFV infections <xref rid="pntd.0001910-World2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>) and with agricultural and population changes brought by the European colonial era <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Ellis1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Low sampling frequency preceding 1948 does not permit resolution of demographic trends for the early time interval.</p><p>This alternative model of YFV emergence is supported by the estimated posterior density intervals for the divergence dates of east and west lineages, which was estimated to have occurred between 1733 and 1802 CE, suggesting that alterations or intrusions to continental ecology may have been concurrent with European colonization of YFV-endemic regions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001910-t001">Table 1</xref>). A plausible reconstruction for this time period of geographic movements is supported by studies on human immunodeficiency virus 2 (HIV-2) that suggest population movements during this time period <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Faria1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Again, flat demographic estimates offer a constant paradigm from which to model variable intrusions of humans into regions of YFV circulation.</p><p>Bayes factor support for Cauchy-distributed viral diffusion rates suggests the existence of a heterogenous dispersal process. It is possible that the irregularities seen in emergence of human cases in Central and East Africa are the combined result of wandering epizootic transmission with variability of interaction between susceptible humans and regions of sylvatic maintenance. Forty-three of the 49 isolates used in the study were obtained from human cases, so this property is relatively uniform in the dataset. Local-scale geographic averaging produced by discrete state modeling offers some clarity to this question. By including all isolates within a politically defined landmass, the discrete model may provide some correction to sampling errors introduced by the transit of human cases from the location of infection before discovery of illness.</p><p>Estimated connection of the east and west lineages ceased during the 30-year interval starting in 1644 CE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001910-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Our modeled reconstruction of YFV lineage phylogeography independently supports topotype mapping derived from ecological data, and expands upon this information to suggest the presence of overlapping foci of circulation <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Digoutte1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Assuming a centered spatial average for node location estimates, diffusion analysis supports the overlap of East African genotypes in recent history. Posterior diffusion uncertainty was visualized against a publicly available model for predicting the presence of <italic>Ae. africanus</italic>, the major vector of sylvatic YFV in Africa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001910-g004">Figure 4</xref>) <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Foley1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Considering the timescales of the diffusion analyses, it is possible that past spatial mixing of the virus obscures aspects of the dispersal path from basal nodes. This is especially true for the root of the inferred phylogeny, which at the timescales represented occupies a central section of the African continent (80%HPD).</p><p>The inference of divergence events presented in this study remedies gaps in the historical understanding of YFV emergence, and offers further opportunity to correlate viral dispersal events with human social and demographic history. Evidence for stable maintenance, in a context of irregular emergence, highlights the need for further surveillance and acquisition of YFV sequence information.
