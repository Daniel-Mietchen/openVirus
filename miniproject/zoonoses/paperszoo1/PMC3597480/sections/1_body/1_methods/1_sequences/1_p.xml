<p>49 partial coding region YFV sequences comprising 670 nucleotides spanning prM, M and E genes were used in the study. Publicly available sequences were downloaded from NCBI/Genbank (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001910.s003">Table S1a</xref>). Seven novel Central and East African YFV isolates were obtained from the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (Galveston, TX) amplified by RT-PCR, sequenced for the specified region, and added to the alignment. Sequences newly added to GenBank are as follows: JX012097, JX012098, JX012099, JX012100, JX012101, JX012102, JX012103. The complete listing of accession taxa used in the study are compiled as supplemental data (
