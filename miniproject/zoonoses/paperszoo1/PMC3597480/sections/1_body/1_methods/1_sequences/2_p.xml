<p>Amplification conditions were as follows: Reverse transcription was performed at 50°C for 30 min, followed by denaturation at 95°C for 2 min.; 40 amplification cycles were performed at 95°C for 10 s, 55°C for 30 s, 68°C for 60 s. Final extension was at 68°C for 2 min. Reactions were cooled to 4°C before downstream use. Primers used for all amplifications were CAG (

 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Mutebi2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Amplified fragments were agarose gel-purified and directly sequenced. All sequencing was performed at the Protein Chemistry Core Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch (Galveston, TX). Alignment was performed following translation using the MUSCLE algorithm as implemented in the SEAVIEW v.4 platform

 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Edgar1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The prepared alignment was screened for recombination with methods RDP, GENECONV, BOOTSCAN, and 3SEQ using the RDP3 platform 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Martin3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Using a consensus of these methods, we found no significant evidence of recombination in the alignment.
