<p>Bayesian Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses were performed using the BEAST 1.6.1 platform on the CIPRES computational resource (CA, University of California San Diego) 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Drummond1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. A codon-based substitution model SRD06 was used for all inference calculations in the study 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Shapiro1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. A chain length of 30 million generations was used, discarding burn-in of 10 percent. Stable combinations of molecular clock and coalescent model were modeled, and assessed for relative significance by comparisons of marginal likelihood estimated by path-sampling and stepping stone sampling 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Baele1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. A consensus of these techniques supported the use of a lognormally distributed clock with a constant population coalescent prior. A Bayesian skyline coalescent prior was applied to a lognormally distributed clock model to obtain estimates of population change for the dataset. Analysis of posterior data, including assessment of convergence and Bayes factor (BF) comparisons, was performed using Tracer v1.5 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Rambaut1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Posterior results were summarized as maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees with TreeAnnotator v. 1.6.1, and visualized using FigTree v.1.3.1. Confirmatory inference was performed using 20 partial coding sequences containing the C-terminal section of the NS5 gene and 3′ non-coding region (786 nucleotides). 3′ noncoding region sequences were aligned using the ClustalW algorithm and hand-verified using the BioEdit platform 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. A neighbor-joining tree using observed distance and 1000 bootstrap replicates was computed for this alignment using SEAVIEW v.4.
