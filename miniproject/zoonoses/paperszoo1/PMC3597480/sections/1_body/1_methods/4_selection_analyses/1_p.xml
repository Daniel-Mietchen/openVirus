<p>We performed selection analyses on the full dataset using Datamonkey server implementation of HyPhy 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Pond1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. We used the Single Likelihood Ancestor Counting (SLAC), Fixed Effects Likelihood (FEL), Internal Fixed-Effects Likelihood (IFEL), and Random-Effects Likelihood (REL) algorithms to assay for the presence of selected sites in the prM/E alignment. Significance of SLAC, FEL and IFEL results used a p-value cutoff of 0.05, and results of REL were assessed to be significant for Bayes Factors greater than 50.0.
