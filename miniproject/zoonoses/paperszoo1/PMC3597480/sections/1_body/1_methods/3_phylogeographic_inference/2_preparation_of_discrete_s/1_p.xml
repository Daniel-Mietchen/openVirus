<p>Taxon states were sampled according to the country of isolation (K = 14). BSSVS sampling was additionally performed using distance-informed priors to apply relative penalty to state transitions representing greater geographic distance. Bayes factors greater than 5 and BSSVS indicators greater than 0.5 were used as criteria for state transition significance. Final projection and visualization were accomplished using country boundary centroid coordinates.</p>
