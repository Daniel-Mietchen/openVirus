<p>The MCMC chain was sampled for discrete state, bivariate continuous, and relaxed random walk (RRW) diffusion as implemented in BEAST v.1.6.1. Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) was used to provide evidence for statistically supported diffusion between state variables. BSSVS output and surfaces representing uncertainty for continuous diffusion processes were formatted as KML using the SPREAD utility 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Bielejec1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Coordinate determination for taxon locations was performed using Google Earth v.6.0.1. For final rendering, KML files were imported and manipulated in ArcMap 10.0 [ESRI, Redlands CA] using an Albers equal-area conic projection for the African continent. Surfaces representing uncertainty for the diffusion process were observed as overlay with a maximum entropy raster considering the presence of 
 <italic>Ae. africanus</italic>; the raster file was obtained from the MosquitoMap resource of the Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit [Suitland, MD]
