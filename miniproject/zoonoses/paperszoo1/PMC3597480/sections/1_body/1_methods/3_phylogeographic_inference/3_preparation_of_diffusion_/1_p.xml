<p>For West African isolates, we retrieved location data from the outbreak histories of Digoutte 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Digoutte1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. For East African isolates, we utilized location data in decimal degrees of latitude/longitude for all sampling locations as listed in the historical YFV outbreak summary of Ellis and Barrett 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Ellis1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Political boundary centroid coordinates were used for isolates without available detail. Diffusion analysis was modeled using continuous, Cauchy, lognormal, and gamma-distributed diffusion rates, and posterior results were assessed for relative significance using Bayes Factor comparisons of marginal likelihood.
