<p>Cauchy-distributed diffusion rates were highly supported by BF comparisons of all available models (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001910.s004">Table S2</xref>). For Cauchy-distributed RRW diffusion, the mean root position was inferred at 4.2°N, 10.5°E (Central Cameroon). Mean lateral diffusion rate was 10.6 km/yr, 95% HPD = 4.9 to 17.4 km/yr. The 80% HPD interval containing diffusion uncertainty coverage for the most recent common ancestor of the tree encompasses a broad region of the mass of the African continent (
