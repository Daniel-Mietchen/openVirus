<p>Discrete state analysis returned a number of dominant transitions in the posterior sample, indicating focal dominance of Ethiopian, Ugandan, Nigerian, and Senegalese origin in four well supported and geographically associated clades, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001910-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The highest posterior probability for the root state was Angola (0.083). BSSVS models returned significant BF values for a number of state transitions. Under the criteria (BF&gt;5, Indicator&gt;0.5), significance for certain traits was maintained with the use of a linearly relative distance penalty (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001910-t002">Table 2</xref>). All significant transitions returned from the BSSVS model span the longitudinal axis of the African continent, connecting the east and west lineages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001910-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The transition between Nigeria and the Central African Republic received the greatest relative support by the BF criterion (BF = 22.79, uncorrected).
