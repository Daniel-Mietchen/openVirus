<p>Bayesian skyline analysis indicated a stable viral population over the length of time represented by the sample set (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001910-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The early terminus of the plot, encompassing the date ranges of 1927â€“1940, lacks adequate sampling frequency to resolve the skyline model at these timepoints, but the time period of the sample between 1940 and 2010 is adequately sampled and shows evidence of an unchanging population size during that period. Lack of sampling in some intervals (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001910-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and the sensitivity of this coalescent model to short sequence length requires that any interpretation should be made with caution.
