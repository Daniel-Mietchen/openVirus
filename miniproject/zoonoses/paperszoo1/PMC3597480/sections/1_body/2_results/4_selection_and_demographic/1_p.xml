<p>Analysis using the SLAC algorithm detected a global ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions (
 <italic>d
  <sub>N</sub>/d
  <sub>S</sub>
 </italic>) of 0.0382, which suggests the presence of predominantly purifying selection. Integrated results from all algorithms used found evidence for 192 sites under negative selection. FEL analysis detected evidence for one positively selected site, position 631 of the alignment, an envelope protein amino acid substitution G100S that was present in three isolates: Democratic Republic of Congo/1958, Guinea-Bissau/1965, and Senegal/1992 (p = 0.045). REL analysis also detected positive selection at this site (BF = 55.43). SLAC and IFEL analyses recovered no evidence of positively selected sites.
