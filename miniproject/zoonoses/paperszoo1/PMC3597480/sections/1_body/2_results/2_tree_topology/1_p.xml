<p>The maximum clade credibility tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001910-g001">Figure 1</xref>) supports the presence of two primary circulating lineages in western and eastern regions of the African continent. Each lineage is further bifurcated spatially into outlying and central genotypes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001910-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Posterior support was high for ancestral nodes of the primary lineages and subordinate genotypes (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001910-t001">Table 1</xref>). Confirmatory neighbor-joining analysis based on the NS5-3â€²UTR sequences (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001910.s001">Figure S1</xref>; Taxa listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001910.s003">Table S1b</xref>) was found to have the same geographic topology as the Bayesian phylogeny constructed from the prM/E sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001910-g001">Figure 1</xref>).
