<p>Divergence dates inferred by models under Bayes factor support were tabulated with accompanying 95% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001910-t001">Table 1</xref>). The branch time-corrected mutation rate was 2.8×10
 <sup>−4</sup> substitutions/site/year, 95%HPD: 1.3×10
 <sup>−4</sup> to 4.5×10
 <sup>−4</sup> substitutions/site/year. In order from earliest inferred divergence and expressed as mean height in decimal years for the indicated node, the time of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) was dated to 1007 CE (95% HPD: 342 to 1608). The divergence of the singular Angola isolate from the East lineage was dated to 1415 CE (95% HPD: 1017 to 1769). The West lineage was dated to 1695 CE (95% HPD: 1520 to 1853) with the west/central genotype dated to 1820 CE (95% HPD: 1728 to 1902) and the west genotype dated to 1887 CE (95% HPD: 1840 to 1922). The East lineage was dated to 1844.37 CE (95% HPD: 1751 to 1909) with the east/central genotype dated to 1736 CE (95% HPD: 1579 to 1872) and the east genotype dated to 1835 CE (95% HPD: 1740 to 1912).
