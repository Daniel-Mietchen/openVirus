<p>Nucleotide sequence information for African YFV is sparse, especially for eastern and central regions of the continent. We acquired and sequenced 7 unpublished YFV sequences fragments, now totaling 26 isolates from Central and East Africa, and comprising all known isolates from this region. Although the complete dataset remains sparse, requiring careful interpretation, the resultant phylogeny provides new information on regional dispersal patterns of YFV, supported by several methods of Bayesian phylogeographic inference.</p>
