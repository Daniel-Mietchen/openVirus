<p>Yellow fever virus (YFV) is a mosquito-vectored member of the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, which includes the causative agents of dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile fever, and other prominent, arthropod-borne infections. The enveloped, 50 nm particle, encloses a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 10.8 kb, bearing a 5′ cap, and 5′ and 3′ terminal untranslated regions (UTRs), without 3′ polyadenylation. Translation occurs as a single open reading frame, the product of which is co- and post-translationally cleaved into 10 functional proteins. The three structural proteins, capsid (C), pre-membrane/membrane (prM/M), and envelope (E), are upstream of 7 nonstructural proteins NS1, NS2A, NS2A, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5. Many members of the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> participate in complex transmission cycles that involve mammalian and insect hosts 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Holmes1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The risk of periodic emergence into humans depends upon many factors, including vaccination status, elevation, dispersal patterns, and interaction with competent vector populations.
