<p>Bayesian estimation of divergence dates offers clarity to historical correlations of virus dispersal. Utilization of accurate clock models for arboviral phylogeny estimation is a matter of ongoing study. The reliability of this technique for measurements of viral evolutionary dynamics depends upon a combination of historical reference events, confirmation by independent data, and uncertainty of posterior estimates. In this manner, Bryant and colleagues estimated a plausible timescale of YFV divergence events, finding experimental support for the hypothesized introduction of YFV from West Africa to South America with the transatlantic slave trade

Significance of estimated dates was derived by correlation with observed recent history of YFV epizootic activity in nonhuman primate populations. A relaxed clock analysis was performed to determine phylogenetic placement of new sequence data from a Ugandan YFV outbreak that had occurred in 2010
