<p>Sampling history for YFV in Africa is limited, especially with respect to central and eastern regions of the continent. However, phylogenies derived from the use of the historical YFV isolates have yielded important data on the association of viral dispersal patterns with ecological features, including evidence for the existence of geographically associated YFV genotypes. The first phylogenetic evidence for geographic association of African YFV taxa resolved the bifurcation of African YFV circulation into east and west lineages 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Lepiniec1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Variable presence of repeat segments in the 3â€² noncoding regions of YFV isolates was associated with the region of isolation (East/West Africa and South America), indicating a role for repeat element structures in virus range adaptation

 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. A neighbor-joining analysis of African YFV strains, provided evidence for the presence of 5 prototype lineages in circulation in the continent, West Africa I, West Africa II, East Africa, East/Central Africa, and Angola
