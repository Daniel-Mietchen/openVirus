<p>Nucleotide sequence analysis of 3â€²UTRs of representative YFV genomes have inferred a shared ancestry for West and East/Central African genotypes of the virus, based on the variable presence of one, two or three 41-nucleotide repeat segments, which presumably form secondary RNA structures that contribute to host range adaptation
