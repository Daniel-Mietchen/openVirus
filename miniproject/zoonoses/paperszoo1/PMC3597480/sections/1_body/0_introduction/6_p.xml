<p>Phylogeographic modeling incorporates distance and location under the presumption that these features are informative properties of the viral dispersal path. Most significantly, these methods permit direct testing of hypotheses on lineage dispersal and geographic association, including estimation of surface diffusion rates 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Lemey1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. We believe that use of diffusion analysis is justified for reconstruction of African YFV phylogenies due to both the origin of sequence isolations from a contiguous landmass, and epidemiological guidance that continuous vegetation is a useful proxy for YFV infection risk 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Jentes1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The spatial relationships between extant African YFV lineages are currently unknown 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Ellis1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Determination of lineage orientation in physical space offers clarity to the structure of periodic and uncertain disease emergence, especially for isolates of east African origin. Our dataset includes a recent historical phylogeny of African YFV ranging in time of isolation from the prototype strain Asibi, isolated in 1927, to a recent isolate from 2010 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-McMullan1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. These analyses present the most complete Bayesian phylogeny of African YFV to date.
