<p>Geographic distribution of YFV endemicity covers tropical areas of Africa and South America. For the African continent, human epidemics have been reported from western regions with more regular frequency than the east. This observation is almost certainly biased by regional differences in population density, vaccination coverage, and surveillance capacity 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Despommier1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. However, ecological factors presumably govern some observed differences in outbreak severity and frequency of East and West African YFV outbreaks. The natural history of human YFV infection includes periodic emergence events in rainforest perimeter transition zones, following contact of humans with infected hematophagous mosquitoes of the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> genus. Prediction of YFV emergence in East and Central Africa is confounded both by overlapping distributions of competent vectors and uncertain dynamics of sylvatic maintenance in populations of arboreal nonhuman primates. Sylvatic vector burden for the region in question is dominated by the diverse 
 <italic>A. africanus</italic> complex, which ranges across the entirety of sub-Saharan Africa. Regardless of the structure of maintenance cycles, proximity to contiguous vector habitat is a prime risk factor of infection for susceptible human populations, an ecological property originally supported by high rates of seroprevalence in residents of Ugandan villages adjoining forest galleries of known YFV endemicity
