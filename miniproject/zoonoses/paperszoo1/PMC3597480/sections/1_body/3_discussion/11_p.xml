<p>Estimated connection of the east and west lineages ceased during the 30-year interval starting in 1644 CE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001910-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Our modeled reconstruction of YFV lineage phylogeography independently supports topotype mapping derived from ecological data, and expands upon this information to suggest the presence of overlapping foci of circulation 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Digoutte1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Assuming a centered spatial average for node location estimates, diffusion analysis supports the overlap of East African genotypes in recent history. Posterior diffusion uncertainty was visualized against a publicly available model for predicting the presence of

 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Foley1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Considering the timescales of the diffusion analyses, it is possible that past spatial mixing of the virus obscures aspects of the dispersal path from basal nodes. This is especially true for the root of the inferred phylogeny, which at the timescales represented occupies a central section of the African continent (80%HPD).
