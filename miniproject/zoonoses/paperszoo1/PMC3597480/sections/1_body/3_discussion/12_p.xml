<p>The inference of divergence events presented in this study remedies gaps in the historical understanding of YFV emergence, and offers further opportunity to correlate viral dispersal events with human social and demographic history. Evidence for stable maintenance, in a context of irregular emergence, highlights the need for further surveillance and acquisition of YFV sequence information. The results of this study have potential to be incorporated into design of regional surveillance efforts and implementation of vaccination strategies.</p>
