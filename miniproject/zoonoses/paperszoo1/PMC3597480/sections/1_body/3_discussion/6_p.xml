<p>The observation of positive selection for the envelope protein mutation G100S in the fusion loop has been demonstrated for prM/E alignments of YFV sequence data containing combined taxa of African and South American origin 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Bryant1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Vasconcelos1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The significance of the mutation G100S for African YFV emergence dynamics is unknown, but it arises independently three times in our expanded African dataset. Times between isolations of this mutation are seven years (Democratic Republic of Congo/1958 and Guinea Bissau/1965) and 27 years (Guinea Bissau/1965 and Senegal/1992), respectively. Selection at this site would be expected to be biologically significant. In aggregate, experimental evidence suggests that flavivirus envelope protein mutations in the fusion loop play a significant role in antigenicity and host entry. Mutational analysis of this region provided evidence for sequence conservation to facilitate effective fusion with host intracellular membranes 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Allison1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. A comparison of flavivirus fusion loop sequences found this mutation to occur mostly in YFV isolates, with rare occurrence in other members of the genus 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Seligman1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. The apparent mutational diversity at E100 has been found in temporally and geographically diverse YFV isolate groups, but the result of a selection pressure that has not been identified.
