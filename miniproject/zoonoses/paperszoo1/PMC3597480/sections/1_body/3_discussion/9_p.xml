<p>This alternative model of YFV emergence is supported by the estimated posterior density intervals for the divergence dates of east and west lineages, which was estimated to have occurred between 1733 and 1802 CE, suggesting that alterations or intrusions to continental ecology may have been concurrent with European colonization of YFV-endemic regions (
