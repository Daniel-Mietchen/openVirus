<p>Previously described YFV sequence data supports ecological features of geographic niche association. 3â€² UTRs of YFV contain specific repeat regions that occur with frequencies reflecting the major region of origin 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Mutebi3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The presence of three noncoding tandem repeat sequence elements in West African YFV isolates, and two in East African isolates, allows a parsimonious interpretation that one repeat segment is gained or lost in lineage diversification between East and West Africa. Discrete model estimates inferred in this study substantiate the longitudinal orientation of African lineage diversification (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001910-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This finding provides a context to the paradigm of viral transition between contiguous vegetative ecosystems, a geographic proxy measure for human YFV infection risk 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Jentes1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The discrete model permits time-reversible transitions, or free lineage exchange between location states without preconditioned directionality. This aspect of the model mirrors the reality of sylvatic YFV circulation, in which epizootic foci are hypothesized to be geographically dynamic
