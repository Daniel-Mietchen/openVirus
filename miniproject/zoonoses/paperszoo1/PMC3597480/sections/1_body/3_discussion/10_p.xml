<p>Bayes factor support for Cauchy-distributed viral diffusion rates suggests the existence of a heterogenous dispersal process. It is possible that the irregularities seen in emergence of human cases in Central and East Africa are the combined result of wandering epizootic transmission with variability of interaction between susceptible humans and regions of sylvatic maintenance. Forty-three of the 49 isolates used in the study were obtained from human cases, so this property is relatively uniform in the dataset. Local-scale geographic averaging produced by discrete state modeling offers some clarity to this question. By including all isolates within a politically defined landmass, the discrete model may provide some correction to sampling errors introduced by the transit of human cases from the location of infection before discovery of illness.</p>
