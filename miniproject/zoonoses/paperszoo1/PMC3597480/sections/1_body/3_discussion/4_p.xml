<p>Estimations of divergence dates were indistinguishable for the common ancestors of both east and west lineages, potentially indicating simultaneous dispersal of these lineages to the eastern and western regions of the African continent from ancestral populations. Most significantly, ancestral nodes of the subordinate genotypes were estimated to have arisen in a spatially biased sequence, with earlier nodes belonging to the east/central and west/central genotypes. This finding suggests that spatially outlying genotypes were the most recently established, and that ancestral populations of YFV were located centrally on the continent. Sall et. al. 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Sall1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> inferred a topology in which YFV taxa isolated from the Central African Republic are represented in both east and west lineages, implying a pattern of multiple YFV introductions from central reservoirs. Across the phylogeny, several instances of relatively high substitution rates are recovered in the earliest-emerged taxa of several clades (Nigeria/1948, Uganda/1948, Central African Republic/1977, Kenya/1993) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001910.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The appearance of these higher rates may be a result of periodic local expansions, and consequent increases in sequence diversity. This property exists in east and west lineages, and in all cases appears to precede diversification of a stable clade.
