<p>Two West African genotypes were resolved as described previously (West Africa I and West Africa II) 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Mutebi2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Based on the current findings we redefine West Africa I and West Africa II genotypes as the West/Central genotype and Western genotype, respectively. The West/Central genotype is defined by predominant sampling of isolates of Nigerian origin while the Western genotype is defined by isolates originating primarily from Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, and the Gambia. Incorporation of sequence information from seven additional isolates in this study enabled us to find evidence for structure in the East African lineage that has so far been poorly resolved. As presented, the inferred phylogeny supports the presence of both East and East/Central genotypes with high posterior probability. The proposed East/Central genotype is defined primarily by sampling from Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The proposed east genotype is represented by isolates primarily recovered from Sudan and Uganda.
