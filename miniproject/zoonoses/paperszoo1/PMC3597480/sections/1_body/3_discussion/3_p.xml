<p>Comparison of dates for significant nodes shows broad agreement with previous findings. The common ancestor of all African lineages was estimated to have arisen in 1003 years before the most recent taxon, a later divergence than proposed by Bryant et al. (742) 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Bryant1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, but earlier than that proposed by Sall et al. (1262) 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Sall1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, or McMullan et al. (2188) 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-McMullan2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, however, overlap of posterior density is considerable for estimations of Bryant et al 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Bryant2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and Sall et al. 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Sall1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, indicating agreement.
