<p>Coalescent demographic analysis indicates stability of the viral population across the most adequately sampled timescale of the dataset (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001910-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Biologically, this finding supports a classic model of persistent sylvatic arboviral maintenance. Campaigns of reactive mass vaccination presume risk to community members following the appearance of human cases, and is a response to presumed static dynamics of YFV spillover events during response timescales

Irregular East African YFV emergence is a result of human intrusion into the range of viral circulation, including human movement as a consequence of civil unrest (a recent example is a 2005 Sudanese YFV outbreak, of which commentary suggested that previously blocked north/south pastoralist migration routes had opened due to relief in civil tensions, exposing immunologically naive individuals to fatal YFV infections

 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Ellis1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Low sampling frequency preceding 1948 does not permit resolution of demographic trends for the early time interval.
