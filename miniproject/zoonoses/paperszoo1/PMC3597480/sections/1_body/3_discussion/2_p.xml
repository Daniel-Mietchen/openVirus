<p>Posterior estimates for time structure of the dataset are consistent with patterns observed in previous studies. The mean substitution rate estimate of 2.8×10
 <sup>−4</sup> substitutions/site/year, (95%HPD 1.3 to 4.5×10
 <sup>−4</sup> substitutions/site/year) overlaps a previously estimated range 1.0×10
 <sup>−4</sup> to 3.3×10
 <sup>−4</sup> substitutions/site/year, (mean = 2.1×10
 <sup>−4</sup>) computed from an alignment of complete E gene sequences 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Sall1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The estimated rate from this study is not directly comparable to that of Sall et al. 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001910-Sall1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, as the alignments used are derived from different regions of the YFV genome. However, the overlap of posterior density does not permit significant discrimination of the means derived from either study. Additionally, our estimation is similar to that provided by Auguste, et al., using the criterion of 95% HPD overlap and based primarily on isolates from the Americas
