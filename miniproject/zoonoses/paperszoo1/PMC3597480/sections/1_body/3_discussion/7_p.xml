<p>Significantly, the results of our BSSVS analysis strongly supports transitions that span the most ancestral node of the inferred tree, providing evidence for connection of the ecosystems of eastern and western circulation. Long-distance (Senegal-Ethiopia, The Gambia-Kenya) transitions were reconstructed from the West to each of the subordinate Eastern clades, implying a level of independence for the east and east/central genotypes for the seeding of virus from unobserved reservoirs. This property contrasts with the transitions reconstructed from the Western lineage, in which local diffusions are supported. Transitions to Angola were not supported by BSSVS significance criteria used in the study. This is not unexpected, considering that transition to Angola from eastern circulation is not consistent with the pattern of east-west diffusions so far described. However, the highest root state probability was estimated to have originated from Angola, implying that the 1971 urban outbreak in Luanda was seeded from a more ancestral population than is represented in the phylogeny to date. The virus Angola/1971 may have entered the population through a rare dispersal mechanism, such as traveler movement or population displacement. Disruptions to population or infrastructure provoked by the Nigerian Civil War (1967–1970) or the Angolan War of Independence (1961–1975) may represent appropriate historical correlations to the outbreak; however this interpretation must considered with caution as is it is based on a single isolation event.</p>
