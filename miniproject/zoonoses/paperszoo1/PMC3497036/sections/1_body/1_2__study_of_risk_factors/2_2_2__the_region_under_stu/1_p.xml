<p>HIV-1 M is most closely related to SIVcpz retrieved from the southeast corner of Cameroon, a region flanked by the Sangha, Ngoko, and Boumba rivers, from the sites MB and LB (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-viruses-04-01950">2</xref>]. SIVcpz forms phylogenetic clusters associated with regions separated by rivers and other geographical barriers, which pose obstacles to chimpanzee migration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-viruses-04-01950">2</xref>]. This, and the short branches connecting HIV-1 M to SIVcpz collected from this area, justify the assumption that this group likely originated in the area enclosed by the above mentioned rivers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-viruses-04-01950">2</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-viruses-04-01950">15</xref>]. Here we will build on this assumption, while recognizing that it would need to be revised, should future evidence indicate that chimpanzee (or its virus) migration was more extensive over the century since the origin of HIV-1 M. In this region, current SIVcpz prevalence in chimpanzees is 20%â€“35%, higher than in chimpanzees from Cameroon and Gabon as a whole [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49-viruses-04-01950">49</xref>], while hundreds of local gorilla fecal samples did not yield any evidence of SIVgor infection [
