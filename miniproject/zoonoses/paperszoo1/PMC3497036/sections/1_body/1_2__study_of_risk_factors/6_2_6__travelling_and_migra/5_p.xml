<p>During the war, German troops retreated from areas of Gabon and Congo-Brazzaville into Cameroon, and concentrated in Yaoundé and Ebolowa, the two larger urban centers that they controlled during most of the war.

Thus, the war caused an unprecedented transit of people between Cameroon and neighboring regions of Congo-Brazzaville, CAR, Gabon, and Equatorial Guinea, and particularly of highly mobile people, relying on bushmeat while in the forest, and moving from forest areas to Cameroonian cities (Douala, Yaoundé, Ebolowa). At least in Douala, CSWs and GUD were abundant [
