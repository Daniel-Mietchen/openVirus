<p>During the First World War, intense military operations occurred in the region. French forces took Nola in October 1914. Franco-Belgian forces conquered Moloundou in December and Yokadouma in January 1915. These forces totaled about 2,000 soldiers and had thousands of porters helping them. They stayed in southeast Cameroon for five months, before resuming the offensive to the west. They “encouraged” (forced?) local people to supply them with food. During these five months and beyond, through February 1916, numerous steamers supplied troops from Brazzaville and Leopoldville [

Although the war in Cameroon lasted only 18 months, it involved intense steamer movements to/from the Pool cities, intense soldier and porter movements in the interior [
