In the 1930s, these regions probably generated more traffic to and from the southern cities than southeast Cameroon, and after 1932, when the French railway became available, this traffic was probably being increasingly directed to Brazzaville rather than to Kinshasa.

Trade connections between southeast Cameroon and the Pool peaked in the period 1899â€“1923.
