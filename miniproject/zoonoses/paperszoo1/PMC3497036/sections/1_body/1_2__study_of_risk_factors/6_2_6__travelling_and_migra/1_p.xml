<p>We attempted to obtain information about migration of people from the studied area to cities, or to work in the French railway construction (1921–1932) and the Belgian railway upgrade works (1923–1931). We collected census/survey tables of colonial cities that partition inhabitants by ethnic/regional origin. These tables appear sporadically in archives, articles, and books. Some were published as supplements to our previous article [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-viruses-04-01950">16</xref>]. For the period 1927–1934, the number of immigrants from either southeast Cameroon or the Nola area recorded in Leopoldville and Brazzaville censuses is negligible. However, these censuses likely missed floating populations and illegal immigrants, and also may have misrepresented the real origin of immigrants, so we cannot conclude that the real number was negligible. Also, we did not obtain similar censuses from before 1927. Additional research is needed to quantify these migrations in more detail.
