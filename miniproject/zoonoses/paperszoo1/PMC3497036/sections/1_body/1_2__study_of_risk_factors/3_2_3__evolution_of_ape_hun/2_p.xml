<p>According to some sources, the Aka and Baka pygmies that inhabit these regions seldom eat ape meat, although they hunt them to supply meat to clients [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64-viruses-04-01950">64</xref>]. The non-pygmies of these areas generally eat apes, although this is restricted by certain beliefs: often an animal species is thought to represent the clansâ€™ ancestors, or to have helped them in the past, this preventing their hunting. For example, gorillas and chimpanzees are not killed by a branch of the Bangantu ethnic group, because they are believed to have helped their ancestors [
