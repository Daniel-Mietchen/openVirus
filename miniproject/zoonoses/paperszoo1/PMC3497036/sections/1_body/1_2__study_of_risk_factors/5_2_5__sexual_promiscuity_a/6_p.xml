<p>The health reports of French Congo show the numbers of 
 <italic>consultants</italic> (treated cases) for syphilis and the population partitioned between adults and children of the Ouesso (or Ngoko-Sangha) district in the period 1932â€“34. The reported syphilis incidence in adults in these three years was 4.8%, 5.2%, and 19.9%, respectively. The same reports show the number of 
 <italic>consultations</italic> for syphilis in the Nola subdivision (which was part of the Haute Sangha district) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51-viruses-04-01950">51</xref>]. Assuming the Nola consultations/consultants ratio is the same as in Ouesso, we can estimate the numbers of consultants in Nola; based on that we estimated syphilis incidence in Nola at 10.7% in 1933 and 15.2% in 1934. Part of these cases could be tertiary or serological manifestations of yaws, which were hard to distinguish from syphilis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51-viruses-04-01950">51</xref>]. The very high reported incidence in 1934 may reflect an increase in treatments and serological diagnoses [
