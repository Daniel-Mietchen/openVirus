<p>We found limited direct data on the incidence of STDs and sexual promiscuity in the region of study. The high levels of social disruption and biased sex ratio suggest that STDs may have been as incident as in contemporaneous colonial troops stationed in other regions. A review of STD and GUD incidence in French colonial troops from all colonies in the period 1903–1906 indicates overall syphilis and chancroid annual incidences in the ranges 3.2%–4.1% and 5.1%–6.9%, respectively. In the more CSW-ridden Caribbean colonies these incidences were 7.3% and 13.3%, respectively [
