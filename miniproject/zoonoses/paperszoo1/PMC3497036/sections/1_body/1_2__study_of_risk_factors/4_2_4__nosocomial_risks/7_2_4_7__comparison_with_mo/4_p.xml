<p>Our research indicates that syphilis and yaws patients in Cameroon, in the period 1922–1931, were receiving only 1.4–2.3 injections per year (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="viruses-04-01950-t001">Table 1</xref>); in rural dispensaries, the average per syphilis patient could be twice that number [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94-viruses-04-01950">94</xref>]. In AEF, in the period 1930–1935, surveyed HAT patients received 3–5 injections per year, and by 1937 this had increased to 7.8 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="viruses-04-01950-t002">Table 2</xref>), although newly found patients would receive around 12 injections in the first year (

 <italic>hypnoseries</italic> the average patient could receive more injections but, in the 1930s, the standard treatment was 12 injections. Reviews indicate that patients received 15–24, spread over two or more years (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot4dot4-viruses-04-01950">Section 2.4.4</xref>). Even in the unlikely scenario of these injections being all unsterile, their frequency was much smaller than either the injection frequency in modern nosocomial outbreaks, or the needle sharing frequency among IDUs (including non-sharers) suffering explosive HIV-1 spread (60–245 per year), and was comparable to the sharing frequency among IDUs with low and/or stagnant HIV-1 prevalence. A comparison of the injection intensities in Central African health campaigns, among IDU communities, and in modern HIV outbreaks can be seen in
