<p>While in some IDU communities the sharing frequency remained similarly high despite interventions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B127-viruses-04-01950">127</xref>], in others the interventions were very successful in reducing the needle sharing frequency to 10–30 per year (and sometimes to &lt;10) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B129-viruses-04-01950">129</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B130-viruses-04-01950">130</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B138-viruses-04-01950">138</xref>]. In the latter cases HIV-1 prevalence either is very low, or is persistently stable or declining. For example: (1) in Australia, interventions were very effective, annual needle sharing rate is &lt;10, and HIV-1 prevalence is stable at ~1% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B129-viruses-04-01950">129</xref>]; (2) in Edinburgh’s IDUs, after explosive HIV-1 spread in the early 1980s, effective interventions reduced needle sharing rate to &lt;20 per year, and HIV-1 prevalence remained stable around 20% during many years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B138-viruses-04-01950">138</xref>]; (3) a similar pattern was observed in several Dutch cities (estimated annual needle sharing rates of ~23 in Rotterdam and ~14 in Arnhem) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B135-viruses-04-01950">135</xref>], and in Montréal (estimated annual needle sharing rate of ~27 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B130-viruses-04-01950">130</xref>]; (4) in Vancouver, HIV-1 prevalence was stable at 3–4% in the period 1984–1994, and annual needle sharing rate was estimated at ~30 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B139-viruses-04-01950">139</xref>]; (5) the IDUs from Bristol, UK, were estimated to share needles 48 times per year and had only 1% HIV-1 prevalence, while those from Teesside, UK, shared needles 14 times per year and had zero HIV-1 prevalence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B140-viruses-04-01950">140</xref>]. Such data seem to suggest that the above sharing frequencies do not enable HIV-1 rapid spread in IDUs.
