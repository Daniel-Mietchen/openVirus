<p>The most important drug used against these diseases was the arsenical compound 
 <italic>neoarsenobenzol</italic> (called 
 <italic>neosalvarsan</italic> or 
 <italic>neo</italic>), available since 1912, soon after its predecessor 
 <italic>arsenobenzol</italic>. It was administered intravenously. Other arsenical compounds, and bismuth and mercury compounds were also used. Bismuth was administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously [

Accordingly, the best anti-venereal disease hospitals, clinics, and dispensaries in urban centers often administered many injections per patient. For example, in the Institut Policlinique de Dakar, in 1933 and 1934, syphilis patients received an average of 17 and 25 injections per year, respectively; in the Vernes Dispensaries of Madagascar, in 1934, the average was 17 [
