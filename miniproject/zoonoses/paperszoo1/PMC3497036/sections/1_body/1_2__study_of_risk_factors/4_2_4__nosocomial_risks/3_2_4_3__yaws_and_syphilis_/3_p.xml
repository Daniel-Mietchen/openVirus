We refer these Madagascar data because only for this colony the French articles we reviewed provide the figures of injections per patient for "normal" (non-specialized in venereal disease) dispensaries. This is relevant, because the dispensaries existing in the region under study were also non-specialized. Several authors writing about syphilis and yaws treatments in medical

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104-viruses-04-01950">104</xref>]. This is corroborated by the administrative reports of Cameroon sent to the League of Nations: in the period 1922–1931 the average number of such injections per treponematosis patient per year was in the range 1.0–1.9 (or 1.4–2.3 counting mercurial and
