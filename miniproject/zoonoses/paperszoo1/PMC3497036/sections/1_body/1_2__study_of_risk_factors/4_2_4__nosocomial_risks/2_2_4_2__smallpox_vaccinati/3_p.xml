<p>In the period 1890–1910 there were shortages of viable vaccine in interior regions because the heat during the long journey to the interior often caused them to lose effectiveness. Pressed by smallpox epidemics, doctors performed arm-arm inoculations: they collected lymph from the pustule of a recently vaccinated person to vaccinate the next. As was well recognized at the time [

Some of these interventions were done by the French in “Haute Sangha”, which normally designates the region to the north of (and including) Nola [
