<p>Most calculations of HIV-1 Mâ€™s tMRCA published recently produced results in which the upper interval of the highest probability distribution falls before 1930 (with a few exceptions) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27-viruses-04-01950">27</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-viruses-04-01950">30</xref>]. This is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-04-01950-f003">Figure 3</xref>, and suggests that HIV-1 M probably originated at a time when parenteral risks in the studied region were considerably smaller than in the 1930s.
