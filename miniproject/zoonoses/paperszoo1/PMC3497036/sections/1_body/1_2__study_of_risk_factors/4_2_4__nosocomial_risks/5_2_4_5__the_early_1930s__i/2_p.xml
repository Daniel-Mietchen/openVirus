<p>Anti-HAT campaigns in the neighboring AEF regions of Nola and Ouesso peaked after 1929â€“1930, although there was some activity before [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72-viruses-04-01950">72</xref>]. In Nola, there were only 380 new HAT cases treated in 1930, and the number rose sharply after that (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="viruses-04-01950-t003">Table 3</xref>). The Mbimou people, who live between Yokadouma and Nola were the main focus but were only systematically treated in the 1930s (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="viruses-04-01950-t003">Table 3</xref> and related references). However, according to a reviewer, they were being insufficiently treated at least until 1935 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51-viruses-04-01950">51</xref>] reveals that each surveyed (new or old revisited) HAT patient from Nola (mostly Mbimou) received an average of 4.58 injections in 1933 and 4.59 the following year.
