<p>All known HIVs that originated in Central Africa are derived from either SIVcpz or SIVgor. The chances for an HIV-1 epidemic to originate in a particular region within the ranges of the relevant chimpanzee and gorilla subspecies would depend on local SIVcpz/SIVgor prevalence in wild apes, levels of ape bushmeat hunting, and the chance that an infected human carrier would bring the virus to a city hub at or near these areas, where transmission factors were favorable to its initial adaptation and spread. Most regions watered by the navigable branches of the Congo-Oubangui-Sangha fluvial system (which therefore had more contacts with the above cities during the early colonial period) are inhabited by either central chimpanzees (
