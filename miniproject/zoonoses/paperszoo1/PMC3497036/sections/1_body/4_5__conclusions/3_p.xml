<p>We therefore propose an Enhanced Heterosexual Transmission Hypothesis for the origin of HIV-1 M, by which the emergence of the virus was caused by a coincidence of high intensity of favorable factors for cross-species transmission (SIV prevalence and ape bushmeat hunting), and of factors that are today associated with HIV heterosexual spread in Africa (travel/migration, social disruption, sex work, STDs, GUDs, and possibly lack of male circumcision). While there is no necessity for parenteral transmission in this hypothesis, it does not exclude a role for it in the initial adaptation of SIVcpz to humans.</p>
