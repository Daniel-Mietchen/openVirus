<p>In this article, we reviewed the factors that may have helped HIV-1 M to emerge from its birthplace in the African rainforest. The cross-species transmission from chimpanzees has been suggested to have taken place in southeast Cameroon or the neighboring AEF areas. Indeed, SIVcpz is far more prevalent in this area than in most other areas of the 
 <italic>P.t.troglodytes</italic> and 
 <italic>P.t.schweinfurthii</italic> range, while SIVgor has not been found there. The conjunction of favorable conditions in a short period of time—ape bushmeat hunting intensification, social disruption, nascent cities with commercial sex workers and STDs (including genital ulcer diseases)—seem to have coincided with tMRCA estimates for HIV-1 M, suggesting that the origin of the epidemic was opportunistic, probably more associated with these conditions than with a potential predisposition of local SIVcpz over other SIVcpz to infect humans.
