<p>While the parenteral hypothesis of HIV origins still deserves further verification through modeling, we already see two major difficulties. First, the injection treatments in the region intensified sharply only in 1930â€“1932, while the upper confidence intervals of most recently published tMRCA calculations fall before that. Second, local syphilis, yaws, and HAT patients received far fewer injections per year than current IDUs and patients in hospital outbreaks for which good records were kept. Therefore, the strongest version of the parenteral theories, that proposing massive parenteral spread of HIV-1 to thousands of people in rural areas, seems unlikely. A more limited local parenteral outbreak of HIV-1 could have occurred in 
 <italic>hypnoseries</italic> or other health facilities where injection intensity was higher than average, especially after 1932. The hypothesis of HIV-1 adaptation by serial passage involving a short chain of transmissions is plausible and could have happened at any time during colonial domination of the region. This mechanism could have happened by either parenteral or sexual transmission.
