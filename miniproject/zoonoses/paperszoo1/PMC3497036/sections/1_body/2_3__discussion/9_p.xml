<p>During the HAT and other campaigns done in rural Central Africa in the 1920s–1940s, people formed a queue waiting for injections or vaccinations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50-viruses-04-01950">50</xref>]. The hastiness of the procedures would leave little time for appropriate sterilization of syringes and catheters [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18-viruses-04-01950">18</xref>] and, accordingly, SIV/HIV transmissions may have occurred. However, in such procedures an infected index patient would have been able to transmit the virus to the next person in the row (the first one exposed), but hardly to the second one, because most of his/her blood remaining in the syringe would be injected in the first exposed person, and very little would remain while injecting the second exposed. Thus, the probability of infecting additional people in the queue is likely to exhibit an exponential decline, as has been observed for the probability of recovering HIV-1 from syringes after successive rinses: experiments suggest a 55%–80% decline in this probability after the first rinsing with water [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B171-viruses-04-01950">171</xref>]. Per shared needle, the probability of transmission is around 0.6%–1.4% for intravenous injections and substantially less for intramuscular injections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B123-viruses-04-01950">123</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B125-viruses-04-01950">125</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B168-viruses-04-01950">168</xref>]. Therefore, as a thought experiment, if all people in an entire country were injected once with the same unsterilized syringe, and if there were 100 HIV-infected people before the campaign, assuming a 1% per needle share probability of transmission, the campaign would hardly do more than increase the number of infections from 100 to 101.
