<p>What is the likelihood of parenteral outbreaks of SIV/HIV in campaigns where infected index patients were injected many times (as happens in IDUs and modern hospital outbreaks)? The best candidate environments in the region of study would be the 
 <italic>hypnoseries</italic> (such as in Nola and Ouesso) where the more severe HAT patients might have been interned together and could have received more than the standard number of 12 injections. If an SIV-infected index case entered such a ward, the situation might have mimicked modern nosocomial outbreaks with the virus being able to spread locally, adapt to humans, and possibly initiate an epidemic in a city. This scenario could have produced a local outbreak, but not a massive outbreak to thousands of people [
