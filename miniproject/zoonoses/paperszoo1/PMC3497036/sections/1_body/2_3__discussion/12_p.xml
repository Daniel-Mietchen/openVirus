<p>Whereas recent datings of the origin of HIV-1 M (corroborated by the use of two “fossil” virus samples from 1959 and 1960) calculated the tMRCA of HIV-1 M in the range 1900–1915, with 95% confidence interval 1873–1924 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27-viruses-04-01950">27</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-viruses-04-01950">30</xref>], it cannot be excluded that these dates may still change, for example if heterotachy (differing evolutionary rate between lineages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-viruses-04-01950">30</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B172-viruses-04-01950">172</xref>]) results in overestimating the age of HIV-1 M [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-viruses-04-01950">30</xref>]. In addition, previous datings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25-viruses-04-01950">25</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26-viruses-04-01950">26</xref>] included the 1930s in their 95% confidence interval. Further refinement of molecular dating techniques, and the discovery of new HIV-1 M “fossil” viruses may increase the accuracy of tMRCA datings and, when this happens, all arguments will have to be revised in the light of such new findings.
