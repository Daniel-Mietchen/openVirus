The probability of such conditions would have been higher after the early 1930s for several reasons: (1) the first systematic HAT, syphilis, and yaws campaigns started in 1932 in southeast Cameroon, and in 1930 in the Nola sector (

However, the several serological surveys that were made in the area in the period 1975–1992 found zero prevalence until 1987, when HIV-1 arrived there with the pandemic wave (reviewed in [
