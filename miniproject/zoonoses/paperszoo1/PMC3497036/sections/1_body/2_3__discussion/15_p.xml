<p>The coincidence of the above referred factors in a short period of time, together with the high SIVcpz prevalence in the wild, and the local peoplesâ€™ penchant for ape hunting (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot3-viruses-04-01950">Section 2.3</xref>), may indicate that the origin of HIV-1 M was opportunistic, more determined by the conjunction of favorable factors and opportunities, than by any (unknown) superiority of the local SIVcpz viruses over others in their 
 <italic>a priori </italic>genetic ability to infect humans. Further biological studies are however needed to clarify this. We are not suggesting here that the studied region was unique, just that the superimposition of the three geographically patchy variables (ape SIV prevalence, ape bushmeat intensity, and intensity of contacts with the Stanley Pool cities) probably implied that, in the whole range of 
 <italic>P.t.troglodytes</italic>, 
 <italic>P.t.schweinfurthii</italic>, and 
 <italic>G.g.gorilla</italic>, few hot spots with comparably high risk of HIV emergence existed, and that the region under study was one of such hot spots. Why epidemic HIV-1 arrived to Kinshasa only from that hot spot and not from others might have been a matter of chance. Our suggestion that local high SIVcpz prevalence (as observed by recent studies) was relevant to explain the location of HIV-1 M origin depends on the assumption that regional differences in SIVcpz prevalence did not change dramatically in the 
 <italic>P.t.troglodytes</italic> range in the last 100 years. Although this assumption is not proven, it is parsimonious, and in the absence of contrary evidence, we consider it reasonable.
