<p>It has been proposed that unsterile injections given in rural Central Africa exponentially amplified HIV-1 to thousands of infections from a single SIVcpz-infected human [

In this paper, we attempted to assess the injection intensity of such campaigns around the time of the HIV-1 M origin, to have a semi-quantitative appreciation of their possible role in early HIV spread, and to have sound information on which to base future modeling efforts. We found that at present unsterile injections are not capable of sustaining an HIV-1 epidemic without extremely high rates of needle sharing, even though modern HIV-1 is probably more efficient at human-to-human transmission than the initial virus. In the general populations of modern Africa, unsterile injections are still relatively common, and they only account for an estimated 2.5% of all HIV infections [
