However, this is not a unique feature of parenteral serial transmission, and could perhaps more easily have happened by sexual serial transmission (or by a combination of sexual and parenteral transmission). Since the late 1890s there were CSWs, gonococcal urethritis, syphilis, and possibly other GUDs in the colonial posts of the region [

Sex acts involving GUD have higher HIV transmission probability than unsafe intravenous injections: for a female with a genital ulcer, the per-act female-to-male transmission risk was estimated to be 4% if the male is circumcised and 43% if he is uncircumcised [
