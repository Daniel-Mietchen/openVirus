<p>In currently observed human SIV infections, including among laboratory workers, the viral load is undetectable [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19-viruses-04-01950">19</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B163-viruses-04-01950">163</xref>], suggesting lack of adaptation and transmissibility past acute infection. However, if “nascent HIV”, after the initial cross-species transmission was only transmissible among humans during acute infection, then the origin of HIV-1 M required an initial series of acute transmissions. Either the first human case (e.g., a bushmeat handler) must have carried the virus to a city during the short time frame of his/her acute infection, or there might have been some local human spread of the virus close to its geographic origin, followed by a migration to a city hub.
