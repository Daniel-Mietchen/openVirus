<p>In our previous work we showed that, in the early 20th century, Kinshasa had a strongly male‑biased sex ratio, the presence of CSWs, most women unmarried, a high GUD prevalence, and a lower level of male circumcision than it has today. In Kinshasa the sex ratio was more biased, sex work was more flourishing, and male circumcision was less common than in neighbouring Brazzaville [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-viruses-04-01950">16</xref>]. Our simulations show that initial heterosexual spread of such a virus would have been much more probable under the conditions prevailing in the city in the early 20th century—particularly a high GUD prevalence [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101-viruses-04-01950">101</xref>]—than either in the preceding or in the subsequent periods. In our sensitivity analyses, we let the simulation parameters vary under realistic values, and we tested 51 different scenarios. GUD prevalence appeared to be a key determinant of the magnitude of the simulated epidemics and was crucial to allow for long chains of transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-viruses-04-01950">16</xref>]. In our simulations, the effects of GUD and acute infection in transmissibility combined in a multiplicative way, a method that has been used in other major published models [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B166-viruses-04-01950">166</xref>]. However, our simulations included, for simplicity, random periods of GUD ulcerations in the affected populations (GUD transmission itself was not explicitly implemented), and thus, the real magnitude of the GUD effect may have been underestimated. We intend to upgrade our models, both the multiplicative and the additive, by implementing explicit transmission of GUD, which might generate strong correlations between GUD and HIV prevalence in the most connected parts of the sexual network and thereby intensify the effect of GUD prevalence on HIV transmission. We did not include the contribution of unsterile injections to the origin and initial spread of HIV-1 in Kinshasa in our model, but we recognize that such contribution is plausible since injection intensity was high in some of the city's health facilities in the 1920s and 1930s [
