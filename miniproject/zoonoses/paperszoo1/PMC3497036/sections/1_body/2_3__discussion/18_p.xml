<p>Our research shows how varied the risk factors present in the region of origin of HIV-1 M were, and how far we are from knowing the complete picture. Either sexual or parenteral serial transmission could have partially adapted the virus in the studied region. It could have generated a small local epidemic before moving to Kinshasa, or it could have been brought there by a migrant bushmeat handler directly. Further sampling of SIVcpz viruses from many sites within the Boumba-Ngoko-Sangha enclosure and more migration information during the last century from its host, the chimpanzee, could help to establish better where the virus crossed to humans, which in turn could help to test the hypotheses above exposed. Refinement of MRCA dating techniques and new “fossil” viruses could establish more clearly whether increasing parenteral risks after 1932 were accompanied by a radiation and expansion of the virus. Further archival research might help to quantify trade and migration ties to Kinshasa, Brazzaville, and other cities, the intensity of GUDs in the region, and to investigate the possible role of World War I. New simulations could test competing hypotheses. What exactly happened at the origin of HIV-1 M and HIV-1 O is still mostly unknown.</p>
