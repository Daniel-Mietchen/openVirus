<p>SIVcpz is endemic in southeast Cameroon and the neighboring Nola area (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-04-01950-f001">Figure 1</xref>), where currently the SIVcpz closest related to HIV-1 M has been found (reported at sites MB, LB, and BY (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-04-01950-f001">Figure 1</xref>)), with a prevalence over 30% in the MB community, which is higher than the average of either central or eastern chimpanzees [

We show here that ape bushmeat hunting was already widespread in the region in the period 1900–1910, probably boosted by massive gun selling in the area. Local clans had a higher cultural inclination to hunt apes than elsewhere in Cameroon. Ape bushmeat hunting was probably more intense in the period 1899–1930, when the rubber business peaked, and laws protecting chimpanzees had not been enacted yet. Ape hunting was more common in southeast Cameroon and around Nola than in southwest and south-central Cameroon (

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot1-viruses-04-01950">Section 2.1</xref>), southeast Cameroon and the neighboring Nola area might have been particularly permissive for cross-species transmission of HIV-1-like viruses.
