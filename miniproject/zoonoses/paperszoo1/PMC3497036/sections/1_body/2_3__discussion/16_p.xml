<p>We found no clear evidence of parenteral risk factors having played a decisive role in HIV adaptation and emergence, and we found that intense co-factors potentially favoring HIV heterosexual transmission were present in both the region of study and in the Stanley Pool cities at the likely time of origin. Therefore we propose an Enhanced Heterosexual Transmission Hypothesis for the origin of the several HIV groups: each of these viruses emerged and adapted to humans through heterosexual transmission enhanced by a spatial and temporal coincidence of a high intensity of factors that favor cross-species transmission (SIV prevalence, ape bushmeat intensity), and of the same co-factors of heterosexual transmission that are today observed to contribute the most to the current African epidemic, without the need to invoke additional factors. Since we are proposing a major role for co-factors of heterosexual transmission, which is the overwhelmingly predominant mode of transmission in Africa, our hypothesis follows the principle of parsimony. Our data shows that the coincidence of factors existed for HIV-1 M and we hypothesize that it permitted the virus to emerge by heterosexual transmission. Our hypothesis predicts that similar coincidence is likely to have been a key element in the origin of the other epidemic HIV-1 and HIV-2 groups, as well.</p>
