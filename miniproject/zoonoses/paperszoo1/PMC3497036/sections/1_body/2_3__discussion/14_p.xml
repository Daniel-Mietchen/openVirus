<p>The most recent tMRCA calculations fit well with the time of most intense selling of firearms in the region (1900–1907), maximal rubber exploitation in the region (1899–1923), intense trade relations with Kinshasa (1899–1932), First World War (1914–1916), the period when chimpanzee hunting was not outlawed (pre-1930), and the period of intense GUD epidemics in Kinshasa [
