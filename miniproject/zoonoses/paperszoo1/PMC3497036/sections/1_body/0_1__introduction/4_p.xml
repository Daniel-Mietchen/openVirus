<p>Several authors proposed a major role of unsterile injections in HIV origins. One hypothesis proposes that unsterile injections serially transmitting SIV between humans in a chain of 3–4 acutely infected people, improved its adaptation to the new host (as happens in experimental serial passage of SIV in macaques and monkeys [
