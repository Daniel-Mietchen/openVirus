<p>HIV-1 M clusters most closely with SIVcpz currently found in southeast Cameroon [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-viruses-04-01950">2</xref>], which suggests that the cross-species transmission happened in this part of Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-viruses-04-01950">2</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-viruses-04-01950">15</xref>]. This motivated us to investigate which factors present in these areas in the early 20th century might have been able to potentially promote SIV zoonotic transmission, sexual or parenteral transmission of the virus between humans, and migration of the virus to major centers. We retrieved colonial reports and archival data about Cameroon and AEF, and additional colonial medical, ethnographic and other literature to compare the different theories of HIV origins with available information from such archives.
