<p>Social changes, and/or increased human mobility [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-viruses-04-01950">3</xref>], and the onset of urbanization in colonial Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27-viruses-04-01950">27</xref>] have also been invoked as explanations for HIV emergence. We proposed that a high frequency of genital ulcer diseases (GUD), such as syphilis, chancroid, and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), a result of those social changes, and possibly also a relatively low frequency of male circumcision, in nascent colonial cities may have been the triggers of initial HIV transmission and adaptation to humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-viruses-04-01950">16</xref>]. GUD induced genital ulcers can dramatically increase HIV transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-viruses-04-01950">16</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36-viruses-04-01950">36</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37-viruses-04-01950">37</xref>], and our work suggests that the high prevalence of these diseases might have provided crucial “help” for the initial spread of the virus.
