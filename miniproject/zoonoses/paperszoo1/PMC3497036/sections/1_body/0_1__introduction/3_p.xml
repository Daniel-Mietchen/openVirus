<p>Molecular clock analyses were used to estimate the timings of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of epidemic human retroviruses. Estimates of tMRCA for the different HTLV-1 subtypes span between less than 3,000 and about 50,000 years ago [

Similar research showed that the tMRCA of HIV-1 group M and its closest SIVcpz relative found to date, predates the spread of HIV-1 group M by only a few decades, suggesting that the cross-species transmission of SIVcpz giving rise to HIV-1 group M must have been in late 19th–early 20th century. This fact suggests that phenomena new in the 20th century might have constituted the driving factors of HIV emergence. Among the potential factors, it has been noted that bushmeat intensification, forced labour, and smallpox vaccinations performed without proper sterilization were common in colonial Afrique Équatoriale Française (AEF; a federation of French colonies encompassing French Congo, Gabon, Oubangui-Chari, and Chad), these factors potentially increased human exposure to SIV and risks of human-to-human transmission and viral adaptation [
