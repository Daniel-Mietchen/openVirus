<p>Influenza is caused by RNA viruses of the Orthomyxoviridae family. Whereas fever and coughs are the most frequent symptoms, in more serious cases a fatal pneumonia can develop, particularly in the young and the elderly. Typically, influenza is transmitted through the air by coughs or sneezes, creating aerosols containing the virus; but influenza can also be transmitted by bird droppings, saliva, feces, and blood. Birds and pigs play an important role in the emergence of new influenza viruses in humans. Fecal sampling of migratory birds has revealed that they harbor a large range of different subtypes of influenza A viruses

Some wild duck species, particularly mallards, are potential long-distance vectors of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1), whereas others, including diving ducks, are more likely to act as “sentinel” species that die upon infection

Following the introduction of a new pandemic influenza A virus subtype from an avian reservoir, either directly or via another mammalian species such as the pig, the virus may continue to circulate in humans in subsequent years as a seasonal influenza virus. In the past century, three major influenza epidemics resulted in the loss of many millions of lives. Spanish flu alone caused the deaths of more than 50 million people by the end of World War I in 1918. The 2009 outbreak of a new H1N1 virus (causing “swine flu”) that started in Mexico further illustrates the pandemic potential of influenza A viruses.
