<p>After introduction of a new influenza A virus from an avian or porcine reservoir into the human species, viral genomics studies are essential to identify critical mutations that enable the circulating virus to spread efficiently, interact with different receptors, and cause disease in the new host. For example, the importance of residue 627 of the PB2 protein of the viral polymerase in determining species restriction has been demonstrated through these kinds of approaches

The hemagglutinin of avian H5N1 influenza viruses preferentially binds to oligosaccharides that terminate with a sialic acid–α-2,3-Gal disaccharide, whereas the hemagglutinins of mammalian influenza A viruses prefer oligosaccharides that terminate with sialic acid–α-2,6-Gal (

Fatal viral pneumonia in humans infected with avian H5N1 viruses is partly due to the ability of these viruses to attach to and replicate in the cells of the lower respiratory tract, which have oligosaccharides that terminate in sialic acid–α-2,3-Gal disaccharide
