<p>Microarray-assisted mRNA expression profiling of emerging zoonotic viral infections, including influenza A virus, is used to phenotype the host response in great detail. By comparing mRNA expression in individuals infected with an emerging virus to expression in individuals infected with a related established virus, researchers can generate a “molecular fingerprint” of the host response genes or pathways specifically involved in the often-exuberant host responses to the emerging virus. By using genetically engineered influenza A viruses, a role for the nonstructural NS1 viral protein in evasion of the innate host response has been demonstrated 
 <xref rid="ppat.1000557-Geiss1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Interestingly, the NS1 protein derived from the 1918 Spanish H1N1 pandemic influenza virus blocked expression of interferon-regulated genes more efficiently than did the NS1 protein from established seasonal influenza viruses

Other genomics studies of genetically engineered influenza A viruses containing some or all of the gene segments from either the 1918 H1N1 virus or the highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (H5N1), suggest that these highly pathogenic influenza viruses induce severe disease in mice and macaques through aberrant and persistent activation of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses

Application of genomics tools not only supports the elucidation of mechanisms underlying pathogenesis but may also help to identify leads for therapeutic intervention. In ferrets, H5N1 infection induced severe disease that was associated with strong expression of interferon response genes including the interferon-γ-induced cytokine CXCL10. Treatment of H5N1-infected ferrets with an antagonist of the CXCL10 receptor (CXCR3) reduced the severity of the flu symptoms and the viral titers compared to the controls
