<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) primarily infect the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of mammals and birds. Five different currently known CoVs infect humans and are believed to cause a significant percentage of all common colds in human adults. Surprisingly, recent studies revealed that approximately 6% of bats sampled in China were positive for CoVs

Subsequent phylogenetic studies revealed that bat CoVs that resembled human SARS-CoV clustered in a putative group comprising one subgroup of bat CoVs and another of SARS-CoVs from humans and other mammalian hosts. According to the current hypothesis SARS-CoV has arisen by recombination between two bat viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV isolates from animals indicate that the resulting bat virus was transmitted first to palm civets (
