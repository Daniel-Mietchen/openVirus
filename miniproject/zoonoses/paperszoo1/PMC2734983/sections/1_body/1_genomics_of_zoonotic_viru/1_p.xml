<p>New molecular techniques such as high-throughput sequencing, mRNA expression profiling, and array-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis provide ways to rapidly identify emerging pathogens (Nipah virus and SARS-CoV, for example) and to analyze the diversity of their genomes as well as the host responses against them. Essential to the process of identification and characterization of genome sequences is the exploitation of extensive databases that allow the alignment of viral genome sequences and the linkage of these genomics data to those obtained by classical viral culture and serological techniques, and epidemiological, clinical, and pathological studies

Extensive genetic analysis of HIV-1, for example, has provided clues to the geography and time scale of the early diversification of HIV-1 strains when the virus emerged in humans. HIV-1 strains are divided into multiple clades, each of which has independently evolved from a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) that naturally infects chimpanzees in West and Central Africa. Current estimates date the common ancestor of HIV-1 to the beginning of the twentieth century
