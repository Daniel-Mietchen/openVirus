  <title>Zoonotic transmission of influenza A virus.</title>
  <p>The hemagglutinin of avian influenza A viruses (blue) preferentially bind to oligosaccharides that terminate in sialic acid–α-2,3-Gal (red), whereas the hemagglutinin on human influenza A viruses (green) prefer oligosaccharides that terminate in sialic acid–α-2,6-Gal (orange). Fatal viral pneumonia in humans infected with the H5N1 subtype of avian influenza A viruses is likely due to the ability of these viruses to attach to and replicate in the lower respiratory tract cells, which have sialic acid-α-2,3-Gal terminated saccharides. The horizontal arrows indicate interspecies transmission, including the transmission from an avian or porcine reservoir into the human species. Image credit: Bart Haagmans, Erasmus MC.
