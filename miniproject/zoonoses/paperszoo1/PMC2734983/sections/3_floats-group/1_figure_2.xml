  <title>Zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV.</title>
  <p>Genomic analyses provided evidence that genetic changes in the spike gene of SARS-CoV from bats (left) and civet cats (center) are essential for the animal-to-human transmission (horizontal arrows). Species-to-species genetic variation in the (thus far unidentified) viral receptor in bats and in the 
   <italic>angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)</italic> gene, encoding the SARS-CoV receptor in civet cats and humans also affects the efficiency with which the virus can enter cells (vertical arrows). The SARS-CoV that caused the epidemic evolved a high affinity for both civet (center) and human (right) ACE2 receptors (indicated by the single diagonal and the right side vertical arrow).
