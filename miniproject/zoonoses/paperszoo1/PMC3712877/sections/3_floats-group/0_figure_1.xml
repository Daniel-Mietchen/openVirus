   </xref> since 1940 was used to identify the most likely origins of each separate emergence event. Presence or absence of infections emerging from wildlife was analysed with logistic regression against a series of known drivers, including human population density, change in human population density, and wildlife diversity (mammalian species richness), gridded at 1 km
   <sup>2</sup> resolution. The global distribution of model outputs gives a measure of the likelihood of a region to generate a new zoonotic emerging infectious disease that originates in wildlife. Because previous pandemics have mainly originated in wildlife, these maps identify hotspots where the next pandemic is most likely to originate.
