<p id="para350">Identification of zoonotic pathogens has been substantially improved by advances in molecular diagnostics, which make possible the identification of hitherto unknown pathogens in nature (so-called pathogen discovery).

 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> This process also includes differential diagnosis of infectious disease and surveillance for known or novel microbes that are normally benign in natural hosts but have the potential to become pathogenic in other hosts. Traditionally, microbe hunters used many techniques, including in-vitro and in-vivo culture, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and serology. Immunohistochemistry of clinical samples was used successfully in several cases. Molecular techniques were used to first identify sin nombre virus, Nipah virus, West Nile virus, SARS coronavirus, and Lujo virus, among others. With the advent of unbiased molecular methods, the use of visualisation techniques has already begun to shift from discovery to provision of evidence of causal relations between an infectious agent and disease, by locating evidence of the agent at sites of pathological changes, including in both chronic and acute disease.
