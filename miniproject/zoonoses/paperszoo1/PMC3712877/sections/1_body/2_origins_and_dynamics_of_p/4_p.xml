<p id="para280">The situation, however, is substantially different for pathogens that have reached stage 3. A disproportionate number of these pathogens are viruses, suggesting that viruses have the potential to evolve more rapidly than do other kinds of pathogen. However, this finding could be due to ascertainment bias. Less complete knowledge is available about the diversity of viruses than that of other pathogens, and researchers might still be missing many at stages 1 and 2.

 </xref> Although a lot of stage 3 pathogens that infect only people don't strictly have reservoirs (eg, HIV-1), many are thought to have had zoonotic origins, including in non-human primates, which contrasts strongly with the minor contribution of primates as reservoirs for zoonoses in general. If risk is a function of contact frequency and probability of successful adaptation to human beings, pathogens acquired from other primates might already be better adapted to successful transmission than those from other mammals (exposure from rodents, bats,
