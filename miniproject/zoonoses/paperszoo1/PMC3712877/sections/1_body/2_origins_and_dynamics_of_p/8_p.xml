<p id="para320">A successful pathogen needs to possess the molecular machinery to infect people, invade human cells or tissues, replicate, and access tissues from which it can exit the host and transmit (directly or indirectly) to other people.

 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Historical examples are few, and thus to quantify the relative contribution of exposure frequency versus phylogenetic relatedness to the risk of successful infection is difficult. Analysis of hostâ€“pathogen databases of primates shows that closely related sympatric host species are more likely to share parasite species than are distantly related sympatric host species.

 </xref> Although any pathogen from a mammalian (or avian) host is a potential threat, that exposure of people to novel pathogens from our closest animal relatives poses the greater risk to public health is at least plausible.
