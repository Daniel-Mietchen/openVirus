<p id="para260">The process through which pandemic zoonoses emerge can be analysed to identify the crucial control points and specific research challenges (
 <xref rid="box1" ref-type="boxed-text">panel 1</xref> , 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref> ). The model we adopt here (developed by Daszak) to assess pandemic potential has three stages—no human infection (stage 1), localised human infection (spillover; stage 2), and widespread transmission and global dissemination (stage 3). The frequency at which stages 1 and 2 occur is unknown but probably high. That human populations are continually exposed to a wide variety of non-human-animal pathogens, many of which infect human beings, seems reasonable to assume. To assess the role of pathogen biology in emergence, investigators need to know how many pathogens people are exposed to and how many successfully cross the species barrier. A complete inventory of spillovers is not available, but researchers have a good working knowledge of pathogens of domestic livestock and pets (species in frequent contact with human beings). Almost 50% of the roughly 1000 species of pathogens that are noted in livestock and pets are zoonotic,

 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>18</sup>

 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Pathogens can transfer from human beings to animals and between different animal species before being transferred back to people, allowing remixing and evolution with spill-back and potentially enhanced pathogenicity (eg, influenza).

  <p id="para10">Several researchers have separated the process of emergence into distinct steps or stages. Morse originally divided the process into two steps, introduction (into a new species, such as human beings) and establishment/dissemination.

   <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows an alternative depiction of the stages of emergence, which emphasises the dynamics of infection rather than pathogen properties. The frequency of these events probably diminishes from stage 1 to stage 2, and the final stage, true pandemic emergence (ie, intercontinental spread of a pathogen in human beings), is far rarer than the initial localised emergence events.
  </p>
  <p id="para30">Stage 1 (pre-emergence): the putative pandemic pathogen is still in its natural reservoir. Ecological, social, or socioeconomic changes (eg, change in land use) alter the dynamics of pathogen transmission within the host or between hosts and allow the pathogen to expand within its host population, spread to a new region, or be transmitted to another non-human host population or species. Each of these changes increases the likelihood of the pathogen making contact with and spilling over into human beings (and thus progressing to stage 2).

   <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
   <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The drivers that cause stage 1 emergence tend to be large-scale environmental, agricultural, or demographic shifts—eg, moving of livestock to a region for the first time, or transportation of wildlife from a region for food. Such events happened before the emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1997, after intensively managed pig farms and fruit orchards were built in a region frequented by fruit bats (the natural reservoir). These bats began to feed on fruit trees around pigsties, enabling viral transmission to pigs and stage 1 emergence.

    <sup>14</sup>
   </xref> Similarly, change in land use in Africa has brought livestock, people, and wildlife into the same habitat, leading to multidirectional pathogen transmission between livestock and non-human primates (stage 1), and some spillover into people (stage 2).

  <p id="para40">Stage 2 (localised emergence): initial spillover of a wildlife or livestock pathogen to people. Causes range from handling of butchered wildlife to exposure to fomites in wildlife markets or livestock farms, or in the wild. Outcomes vary widely, from small clusters of human cases (eg, Menangle virus)
   <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">
    <sup>16</sup>
   </xref> to large outbreaks, some with limited person-to-person transmission (eg, Ebola virus) and some without (eg, Hendra virus).
  </p>
  <p id="para50">Stage 3 (full pandemic emergence): sustained person-to-person transmission and large-scale spread, often aided by global air travel (eg, HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome) or the international movement of reservoir hosts or vectors through trade (eg, West Nile virus). Stage 3 pandemics are rare because even pathogens capable of some person-to-person transmission might not be able to maintain long enough chains of transmission to spread (eg, Nipah virus in Bangladesh).</p>
