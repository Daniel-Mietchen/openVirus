<p id="para250">When the origins of emerging infectious diseases are traced back to first emergence in the human population, some distinctive patterns are revealed that could be used in disease control.
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> First, the frequency with which new pathogens emerge is increasing, even when the increased surveillance globally is taken into account,

 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Second, the emergence of all major groups of emerging infectious diseases correlates strongly with human population density, supporting the hypothesis that disease emergence is driven by largely anthropogenic changes, such as the expansion of agriculture, travel routes, and trade, and changes in land use.
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>11</sup>
 </xref> Finally, the emergence of zoonotic pathogens of wildlife origin (which have dominated the pandemics of the past 100 years) correlates strongly with both human density and the global distribution of wildlife biodiversity.
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Spatially explicit models can be used to identify the regions most likely to produce the next emerging zoonoses (so-called hotspots of emerging infectious disease).
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>3</sup>
 </xref> These hotspots are regions where human activities take place against a background of high wildlife biodiversity, with concomitant microbial biodiversity (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref> ). Targeting of surveillance to such regions provides a rationale for better allocation of global resources to prevent emerging infectious disease or rapidly deal with outbreaks.
