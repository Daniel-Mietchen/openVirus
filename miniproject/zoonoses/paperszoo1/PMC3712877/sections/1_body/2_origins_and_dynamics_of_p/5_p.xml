<p id="para290">Many pandemic zoonoses (ie, those that reach stage 3), such as HIV/AIDS,
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>26</sup>
 </xref> have achieved sustained person-to-person transmission without the need for a non-human reservoir. For example, SARS, which originated from the SARS-like coronaviruses of bats, emerged in China in 2003 and was due to hunting and trading of bats for food.
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>27</sup>
 </xref> In the wildlife markets of southern China these bat viruses seemed to become stage 1 pathogens, which spilled over to civets before being transmitted to people and achieving stage 2.
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>28</sup>
 </xref> SARS coronavirus then underwent repeated cycles of transmission in people, and spread nationally and then globally (ie, reached stage 3), including 251 cases as far away as Toronto. Non-human hosts can have a role in the maintenance and transmission of some stage 3 pathogens (eg, influenza A virus).
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Of the 400 or so known emerging pathogens, roughly 100 occur only as human pathogens—ie, such specialisation is rare.
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>29</sup>
 </xref> Some of the seemingly specialist human pathogens are thought to have had zoonotic origins much further back in evolutionary time (eg, 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>).
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>30</sup>
 </xref> This pattern could be the norm, but the origins of most specialist human pathogens are unknown.

 </xref> Much more is known about the dynamics of pandemic pathogens once they can be transmitted among people. Transmission rates are often higher in dense than in sparse populations, and spread is often greatly enhanced by air travel or human migration. The mathematics of these spreading events is well known, and a sophisticated array of computational models have been used to back-predict such events accurately—eg, the first case clusters of SARS
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>31</sup>
 </xref> and the subsequent global spread, including the country-by-country distribution of human cases.
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>32</sup>
 </xref> Models based on air travel, realistic human contact networks, and individual countries' capacities to deal with outbreaks can now produce reasonably accurate predictions of future pandemic spread (particularly for influenza).

 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> However, less is known about the factors that enable pathogens to move from stage 2 to stage 3 and ultimately achieve pandemic status. During this process, stuttering chains of novel human transmission (as with human monkeypox in Africa, for example
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) can become self-sustaining (which monkeypox has still not achieved in people
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>36</sup>
 </xref>). The distribution and behaviour of human beings, reservoir hosts, and vectors are crucial for emergence, and human demographics and behaviour often establish capacity for person-to-person transmission.
