<p id="para340">Testing of the relative importance of exposure and host relatedness in stage 2 emergence is an important challenge. For plant pathogens, experimental infection of closely or distantly related plants with a range of fungal pathogens has shown that host relatedness is a key factor in the ability of a pathogen to infect a novel host.

 </xref> Such a study would be logistically and ethically challenging in mammals, but experimental work with several model systems and various other organisms is underway, and systematic studies of hostâ€“parasite databases might provide an alternative. These studies might provide new surveillance opportunities by allowing improved targeting of the key wildlife species most likely to harbour the next emerging zoonosis.
