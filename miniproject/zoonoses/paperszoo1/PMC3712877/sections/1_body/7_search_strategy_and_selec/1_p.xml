  <p id="para490">We searched PubMed and ISI Web of Knowledge with the terms “emerging infectio*”, “zoonos*”, or “pathogen discovery” in combination with the terms “modeling”, “prediction”, “surveillance”, “evolution”, “ecology”, or “methodology” for papers published in any language before Sept 25, 2012. We did our searches when we began to develop and write the paper and again before submission of the revised, final version. Some coauthors provided references that they deemed of particular importance. We largely selected publications from the past 5 years, but did not exclude commonly referenced and highly regarded older publications. We also searched the reference lists of articles identified by our searches and selected those judged relevant. Reviews and book chapters are cited to provide readers with more detailed information and references than is possible in the space allowed. Our reference list was modified on the basis of comments from peer reviewers.</p>
