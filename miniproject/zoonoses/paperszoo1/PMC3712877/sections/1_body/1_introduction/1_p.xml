<p id="para170">The emergence of novel infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and pandemic influenza has shown the vulnerability of human beings to new zoonotic health threats. The mortality and morbidity associated with HIV/AIDS have devastated communities in some countries and led to global changes in public health. The rapid pandemic spread of SARS coronavirus in 2003 and a new triple-reassortant H1N1 influenza in 2009 both resulted in substantial economic loss as the pathogens exploited—and in some instances closed down—global travel and trade networks.
