 </xref> Indeed, no pathogens have been predicted before their first appearance. However, patterns in the origins and spread of new pathogens can be noted and are an intrinsic, albeit ad-hoc, part of surveillance strategy. For example, more than 60% of the roughly 400 emerging infectious diseases that have been identified since 1940 are zoonotic,

 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> These advances, coupled with a better understanding of the dynamics of pathogen transmission, ecology, and evolution as they emerge and spread, promise the possibility to predict pandemics. Here we review these findings and the most promising strategies to improve anticipation, prediction, and pre-emption of the next pandemic zoonosis at the source.
