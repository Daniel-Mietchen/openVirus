<p id="para410">The Emerging Pandemic Threats programme, through its PREDICT component, has developed an approach in which predictive modelling is used to identify the regions, wildlife hosts, and human beingâ€“animal interfaces most likely to propagate the next emerging zoonosis. The approach brings together experts from specialties, including wildlife ecology, epidemiology, genetics, virology, informatics, and veterinary medicine, all focused on building of a global early warning system for emerging diseases that move between wildlife and people. The programme's first goal is to obtain timely and reliable data for zoonotic threats, through internet surveillance of reports of unusual events in hotspot countries, analyses of the capacity of pathogens to emerge and then spread under different social systems in hotspots, and in-depth sample collection from the wildlife hosts most likely to harbour zoonoses. Samples are analysed to identify known zoonotic pathogens and new, closely related viruses, and then those deemed most likely to infect and cause illness in people are more fully characterised.</p>
