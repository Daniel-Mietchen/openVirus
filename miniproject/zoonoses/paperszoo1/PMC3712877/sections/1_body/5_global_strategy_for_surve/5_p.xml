<p id="para430">The ultimate goal of the Emerging Pandemic Threats programme is to develop a strategy to prevent future pandemics at the source before they infect human beingsâ€”an ambitious goal that requires more than building of health-care capacity or surveillance and diagnostic programmes. The challenge to true pandemic prevention (and pre-emption) is how to address the underlying drivers that are essentially ecological (eg, juxtaposition of livestock production and wildlife populations) or occur on large spatial scales because of economic activity (eg, change in land use related to development of tropical forests).

Could the seemingly opposing forces of economic development and public health have been reconciled before rather than after these outbreaks occurred? Expansion of so-called health impact assessments is a possible approach.

 </xref> Incentives for industries with roles in activities that propagate pandemics could be linked to development initiatives. For example, concessions in development of logging or mining could include better food supply chains as an alternative to bushmeat hunting, better clinics for migrant workers than are available, and more intensive surveillance of livestock at these crucial interfaces. Similarly, efforts to curtail the wildlife trade for food and pets in hotspot and other countries could include creation of incentives for consumers that lead to certification of industries promoting healthy practices.
