<p id="para400">Efforts to reduce or prevent pandemic zoonoses before they emerge in people have also begun, and might form the template for a new, globally coordinated pandemic prevention strategy. For influenza, these efforts have been focused on animal surveillance as a strategy to identify periods when the risk of spillover to people is high.

The Emerging Pandemic Threats programme is a noteworthy project initiated in 2009 by the US Agency for International Development. The programme is a suite of capacity-building investments designed to rapidly identify (and eventually predict) the emergence of new public health threats and increase country-level capacities to mitigate the potential effects of these threats.
