<p id="para460">Political will for countries to act together to strengthen global networks against pandemic emergence also seems to have become positive. This new approach to pandemic prevention is shown by the handling of the discovery, in 1997, of a highly pathogenic influenza A (H5N1) of avian origin that infects people (precursor of the now widespread H5N1 avian influenza).

 </xref> The response to H5N1 has implicated not only clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic advances, but also better understanding of avian ecology, the economics of poultry production in low-income countries, and the ecology of the virus across the virus's broad host range. For perhaps the first time, the response to a zoonotic pandemic has included development agencies improving individual countries' abilities to identify new zoonoses early and mitigate quickly any new health threats arising within their borders.
