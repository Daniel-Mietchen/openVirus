<p id="para380">These research questions are part of a much-needed basic research programme to investigate prediction of pandemics. However, previous evidence of pathogen spillover is a simple predictor of possible future emergence, and an active interface between human beings and other species is an obvious sine qua non. The capacity of a novel virus to transmit to people, and especially to cause illness, is a clue that the virus can replicate well in human beings, and thus could gain the properties that allow onward transmission. Spillover infections just below the threshold for self-sustainment in people (ie, infections with a basic reproduction number slightly &lt;1) have been suggested as the prime epidemics-in-waiting,

For H5N1, intensive monitoring of each spillover case in endemic countries is crucial for prediction of if and when this pathogen moves from stage 2 to 3. Additionally, because pandemic zoonoses are such a large threat to global public health, to understand the ecological, virological, and social rules governing their emergence seems important. A concerted, interdisciplinary research focus on the process of disease emergence is urgently needed, and should include all sectors of the medical sciences, ecologists, social scientists, and wildlife biologists, among others.
