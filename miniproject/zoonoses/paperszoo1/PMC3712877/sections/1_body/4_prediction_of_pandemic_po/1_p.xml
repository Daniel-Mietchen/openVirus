<p id="para370">Advances in meta-genomic technology have led to efforts in which molecular data are prospectively used to identify potential human pathogens in other species. The goal of such studies is to characterise novel microbes and assess probable virulence and transmissibility in people. However, crucial challenges exist in prediction of the effects of these new microbes, especially for viruses.

 </xref> In some cases (eg, coronaviruses
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">

 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>52</sup>

 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> although the experimental development of mutations in H5N1 that increase transmissibility in a ferret model has allowed targeted surveillance for isolates that are most likely to become efficient human pathogens.
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>56</sup>
 </xref> However, even when putative human pathogens can infect human-cell cultures, they are often unable to infect people. Genetically humanised murine models have been developed for SARS

  <sup>58</sup>
 </xref> Humanised mice,
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>59</sup>
 </xref> or other model systems, could perhaps be adapted to screen for the ability of newly discovered microbes from wildlife reservoirs to infect people. Workers at the Rockefeller Foundation Virus Program in the mid-20th century used a low-tech version of the strategy—intracerebral inoculation—on suckling mice, which are susceptible to many infections by this route.
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>60</sup>
 </xref> However, screening in humanised mice is not yet widely available. In most cases, prediction of human virulence or transmissibility from molecular or phylogenetic data alone is still not feasible (another crucial unmet need), although promising work has been done with in-vitro tests to assess ability to induce a hyperinflammatory cytokine response in human cells as a predictor of virulence.
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> Molecular data will be of increasing predictive value as the global genomic database expands, thereby allowing wider comparisons and identification of commonalities. The predictive value will increase further if these molecular data are correlated with epidemiological and clinical data, and as our understanding of host requisites for transmission and barriers to cross-species transfer improves. As programmes for pathogen discovery in wildlife expand rapidly, the development of risk assessment criteria for the importance of these microbes is crucial. In our opinion, crucial questions remain and further research could substantially improve our understanding and our capacity to prevent pandemics before they emerge (
