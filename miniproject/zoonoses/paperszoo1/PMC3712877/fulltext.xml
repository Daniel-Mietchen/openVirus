). The model we adopt here (developed by Daszak) to assess pandemic potential has three stages&#x02014;no human infection (stage 1), localised human infection (spillover; stage 2), and widespread transmission and global dissemination (stage 3). The frequency at which stages 1 and 2 occur is unknown but probably high. That human populations are continually exposed to a wide variety of non-human-animal pathogens, many of which infect human beings, seems reasonable to assume. To assess the role of pathogen biology in emergence, investigators need to know how many pathogens people are exposed to and how many successfully cross the species barrier. A complete inventory of spillovers is not available, but researchers have a good working knowledge of pathogens of domestic livestock and pets (species in frequent contact with human beings). Almost 50% of the roughly 1000 species of pathogens that are noted in livestock and pets are zoonotic,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> implying that any barriers between these hosts and human beings are routinely breached by many different pathogens. More than 50% of the recognised pathogens of human beings can infect other vertebrate hosts.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Many non-human pathogens can infect several hosts, and clear examples of viruses transferring between different animal hosts to cause outbreaks in other species have been reported.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Pathogens can transfer from human beings to animals and between different animal species before being transferred back to people, allowing remixing and evolution with spill-back and potentially enhanced pathogenicity (eg, influenza).<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<boxed-text id="box1"><label>Panel 1</label><caption><title>Stages in disease emergence</title></caption><p id="para10">Several researchers have separated the process of emergence into distinct steps or stages. Morse originally divided the process into two steps, introduction (into a new species, such as human beings) and establishment/dissemination.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Wolfe and colleagues<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> subsequently developed a model with five stages&#x02014;a so-called pathogen pyramid&#x02014;to represent successively greater pathogen adaptation to successful human infection and transmission, from inability to infect human beings (stage 1) to exclusively human disease (stage 5).</p><p id="para20">
<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows an alternative depiction of the stages of emergence, which emphasises the dynamics of infection rather than pathogen properties. The frequency of these events probably diminishes from stage 1 to stage 2, and the final stage, true pandemic emergence (ie, intercontinental spread of a pathogen in human beings), is far rarer than the initial localised emergence events.</p><p id="para30">Stage 1 (pre-emergence): the putative pandemic pathogen is still in its natural reservoir. Ecological, social, or socioeconomic changes (eg, change in land use) alter the dynamics of pathogen transmission within the host or between hosts and allow the pathogen to expand within its host population, spread to a new region, or be transmitted to another non-human host population or species. Each of these changes increases the likelihood of the pathogen making contact with and spilling over into human beings (and thus progressing to stage 2).<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The drivers that cause stage 1 emergence tend to be large-scale environmental, agricultural, or demographic shifts&#x02014;eg, moving of livestock to a region for the first time, or transportation of wildlife from a region for food. Such events happened before the emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1997, after intensively managed pig farms and fruit orchards were built in a region frequented by fruit bats (the natural reservoir). These bats began to feed on fruit trees around pigsties, enabling viral transmission to pigs and stage 1 emergence.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Similarly, change in land use in Africa has brought livestock, people, and wildlife into the same habitat, leading to multidirectional pathogen transmission between livestock and non-human primates (stage 1), and some spillover into people (stage 2).<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref>
</p><p id="para40">Stage 2 (localised emergence): initial spillover of a wildlife or livestock pathogen to people. Causes range from handling of butchered wildlife to exposure to fomites in wildlife markets or livestock farms, or in the wild. Outcomes vary widely, from small clusters of human cases (eg, Menangle virus)<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> to large outbreaks, some with limited person-to-person transmission (eg, Ebola virus) and some without (eg, Hendra virus).</p><p id="para50">Stage 3 (full pandemic emergence): sustained person-to-person transmission and large-scale spread, often aided by global air travel (eg, HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome) or the international movement of reservoir hosts or vectors through trade (eg, West Nile virus). Stage 3 pandemics are rare because even pathogens capable of some person-to-person transmission might not be able to maintain long enough chains of transmission to spread (eg, Nipah virus in Bangladesh).</p></boxed-text><fig id="fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Emergence of pandemic zoonotic disease</p><p>Stage 1 is a pre-emergence state, in which naturally occurring microbes are transmitted between their animal reservoirs. Disturbances to the ecology of these populations (eg, due to changes in land use) change the dynamics of microbial transmission and can lead to a heightened risk of pathogen spillover to other non-human wildlife or livestock hosts (but not people). Stage 2 is localised emergence, either through self-limiting spillover events (green peaks and troughs, representing the rise and fall in numbers of infected people with time) or large- scale spillover (red peaks, representing spikes in the number of infected people with time), that leads to person-to-person transmission for a few pathogen generations. In stage 3, some spillover events might lead to indefinitely sustained person-to-person outbreaks, international or global spread, and the emergence of a true pandemic. The size, spread, and potential effect of events increase from stage 1 to stage 3, but the frequency falls so that full stage 3 pandemics are quite rare. By dissecting this process and analysing the interactions of the underlying drivers with the risk of spillover and spread, development of a more structured approach to pandemic prevention is possible. The ultimate goal of successful pandemic prevention is to move the control point to stage 1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr2_lrg"/></fig></p><p id="para270">Human pathogens from all taxa contain zoonotic species.

</p><p id="para280">The situation, however, is substantially different for pathogens that have reached stage 3. A disproportionate number of these pathogens are viruses, suggesting that viruses have the potential to evolve more rapidly than do other kinds of pathogen.

If risk is a function of contact frequency and probability of successful adaptation to human beings, pathogens acquired from other primates might already be better adapted to successful transmission than those from other mammals (exposure from rodents, bats,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> and other common vertebrates are the most frequent).</p><p id="para290">Many pandemic zoonoses (ie, those that reach stage 3), such as HIV/AIDS,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> have achieved sustained person-to-person transmission without the need for a non-human reservoir.

Traditionally, microbe hunters used many techniques, including in-vitro and in-vivo culture, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and serology. Immunohistochemistry of clinical samples was used successfully in several cases. Molecular techniques were used to first identify sin nombre virus, Nipah virus, West Nile virus, SARS coronavirus, and Lujo virus, among others. With the advent of unbiased molecular methods, the use of visualisation techniques has already begun to shift from discovery to provision of evidence of causal relations between an infectious agent and disease, by locating evidence of the agent at sites of pathological changes, including in both chronic and acute disease.<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr"><sup>51</sup></xref>
</p><p id="para360">Rapid, cost-effective molecular techniques allow broad-scale screening of samples, and pathogen discovery could be a strategy in wildlife to pre-empt pandemic zoonotic disease emergence through early identification. This strategy might be particularly effective when enhanced by hotspot modelling, which allows targeting of specific regions with the highest spillover risks. Historically, most surveillance efforts have been designed to detect individual pathogens in natural reservoirs, vectors, or at-risk human or animal populations through use of individual (so-called singleplex) PCR assays or serology. However, the costs for multiplex PCR, microarrays, and high-throughput sequencing continue to fall, and thus these assays are increasingly used as primary techniques for syndromic surveillance and studies of microbial diversity and discovery.<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> The challenge with any of these technologies is determination of the relevance of a microbial signature. 5000 species of mammals and 10&#x02008;000 species of birds are known, each of which probably has at least several unique endemic viruses. Therefore the total number of new pathogens awaiting discovery is probably far higher than the 2000 to 3000 characterised. When other vertebrate-associated microbes are also considered, clearly the unfocused application of high-throughput screening could rapidly exhaust resources without substantively reducing pandemic risk. Therefore, discovery efforts need to be directed toward reservoirs and vectors where human being&#x02013;animal interfaces<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> and hotspot modelling<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> or other information suggest an increased risk of transmission.

However, sequence data became available while an epidemic was still in progress for the first time only during the West Nile outbreak in 1999, and then again during the 2003 SARS outbreak and the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic. This information was invaluable for rapid development of diagnostics, identification of the source of the infection, and pathogen discovery.

However, previous evidence of pathogen spillover is a simple predictor of possible future emergence, and an active interface between human beings and other species is an obvious sine qua non. The capacity of a novel virus to transmit to people, and especially to cause illness, is a clue that the virus can replicate well in human beings, and thus could gain the properties that allow onward transmission. Spillover infections just below the threshold for self-sustainment in people (ie, infections with a basic reproduction number slightly &#x0003c;1) have been suggested as the prime epidemics-in-waiting,<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>, <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref> although they are difficult to identify in advance. Thus, spillover events of any magnitude should be carefully monitored.

Additionally, because pandemic zoonoses are such a large threat to global public health, to understand the ecological, virological, and social rules governing their emergence seems important.

The programme's first goal is to obtain timely and reliable data for zoonotic threats, through internet surveillance of reports of unusual events in hotspot countries, analyses of the capacity of pathogens to emerge and then spread under different social systems in hotspots, and in-depth sample collection from the wildlife hosts most likely to harbour zoonoses. Samples are analysed to identify known zoonotic pathogens and new, closely related viruses, and then those deemed most likely to infect and cause illness in people are more fully characterised.</p><p id="para420">PREDICT is active in 20 developing countries in emerging infectious disease hotspots and focuses on surveillance at human being&#x02013;animal interfaces where cross-species transmission is most likely.

To avoid this issue, PREDICT uses a combination of risk modelling to target locations, interfaces, and host taxa, and computerised data collection and analysis and active wildlife field sampling at high-risk sites to collect and identify viruses that might transfer from wildlife and cause disease. The programme partners with national and local governments, in-country scientists, and other local specialists who are active in outbreak reporting, microbial characterisation, and pathogen discovery, in collaboration with other US Agency for International Development Emerging Pandemic Threats projects as appropriate. These partnerships are intended to ensure the longevity of the programme by building capacity in the most in-need regions. The programme's scale gives some indication of how feasible this type of approach is for identification of the many thousands of novel pathogens that are probably in wildlife globally. In the first two years of the programme, around 100&#x02008;000 samples from 20&#x02008;000 animals (mainly bats, rodents, and non-human primates) in 20 countries have yielded 150 novel viruses from families known to harbour zoonoses.
