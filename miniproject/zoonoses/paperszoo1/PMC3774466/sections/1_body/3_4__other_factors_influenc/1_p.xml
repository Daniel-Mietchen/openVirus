<p>We state that Australia possesses a number of mosquito species that could facilitate the establishment and maintenance of an exotic strain of WNV. Nonetheless, a number of other factors would contribute to the complexity of urban WNV transmission cycles. The impact of seasonal shifts in mosquito feeding behavior can greatly influence WNV transmission. For instance, in North America, populations of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> in the mid-Atlantic states exhibit a shift in feeding patterns from feeding predominantly on birds in early summer, to feeding moreso on humans in autumn, coinciding with the dispersal of its preferred avian host and potentially driving the observed patterns of human epidemics of WNV [

 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57-ijerph-10-03735">57</xref>] did not observe any seasonal patterns in host feeding behavior of 
 <italic>Cx. annulirostris</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> in a remote community in northern Australia, but seasonal variation in feeding behavior has been described for 
 <italic>Cx. annulirostris</italic> in restricted foci on the south coast of New South Wales [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77-ijerph-10-03735">77</xref>], and may be observed in other populations and species if examined.
