<p>The implications of variability in host feeding patterns between mosquito populations can have huge implications for WNV transmission dynamics. Kramer 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-ijerph-10-03735">1</xref>] postulates that the absence of human cases in Northern Europe, when compared with southern Europe, may be explained by differences in the feeding behavior of the dominant vector, 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic>. In this region, 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> form molestus feeds predominantly on humans, whilst form pipiens feeds on birds. Unlike in southern Europe or in the United states, these two forms do not hybridize, so the difference in feeding behavior is distinct [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38-ijerph-10-03735">38</xref>]. This phenomenon has important implications for Australia, as the taxonomy of the Australian 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> group is unclear [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55-ijerph-10-03735">55</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78-ijerph-10-03735">78</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79-ijerph-10-03735">79</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80-ijerph-10-03735">80</xref>], and the associated behavioral differences between morphologically similar populations have not been fully examined. As the most widespread Australian member of this group, 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus,</italic> is implicated as a major potential vector of WNV, resolution of the taxonomic status of Australian members of this group may greatly enhance the understanding of flavivirus ecology in the Australasian region.
