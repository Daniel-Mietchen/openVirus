<p>Recently, the identification of distinct genetic lineages and, in some cases cryptic species, within 
 <italic>Cx. annulirostris</italic> has provided some context for the reconsideration of both morphological and epidemiological uncertainties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81-ijerph-10-03735">81</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82-ijerph-10-03735">82</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83-ijerph-10-03735">83</xref>]. Indeed, further examination of population genetic structure may explain differences in vector competence observed between populations of 
 <italic>Cx. annulirostris</italic> for both WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51-ijerph-10-03735">51</xref>] and WNV 
 <sub>NY-99</sub> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46-ijerph-10-03735">46</xref>]. Geographic variation in the vector competence for WNV between populations of the same mosquito species is well documented in North America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59-ijerph-10-03735">59</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84-ijerph-10-03735">84</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85-ijerph-10-03735">85</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86-ijerph-10-03735">86</xref>]. However, behavioral differences between morphologically similar Australian vector populations have not been fully examined and are a major impediment for detailed understanding of arbovirus transmission cycles, especially if considering the potential transmission of an ecological generalist like WNV.
