<p>Based on its antigenic properties, WNV is regarded as a member of the Japanese encephalitis virus serological group, which also includes Australasian members Murray Valley encephalitis (MVEV) and Japanese encephalitis viruses (JEV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-ijerph-10-03735">5</xref>]. There is some question regarding whether an exotic strain of WNV could establish in Australia in the presence of WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-ijerph-10-03735">3</xref>] particularly since WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> is almost identical, both genetically and antigenically, to exotic strains of WNV including the New York 1999 strain (WNV
 <sub>NY-99</sub>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-ijerph-10-03735">6</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7-ijerph-10-03735">7</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-ijerph-10-03735">8</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-ijerph-10-03735">9</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-ijerph-10-03735">10</xref>]. Attenuated WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> can protect against WNV
 <sub>NY-99</sub> in mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-ijerph-10-03735">10</xref>] and crows [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-ijerph-10-03735">11</xref>], and it has been suggested that the presence of the endemic virus may make it more difficult for exotic WNV to spread rapidly and become established in Australia compared with what has occurred in North America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-ijerph-10-03735">3</xref>]. However, as described by Russell and Kay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-ijerph-10-03735">12</xref>], a viremic host or, perhaps more likely, an infected mosquito would most likely enter Australia via the eastern seaboard, where, until recently, WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> has seldom been active [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13-ijerph-10-03735">13</xref>] and where little protective immunity would naturally exist in the vertebrate fauna or humans. Indeed, the apparent rarity of detectable flavivirus infection in urban mosquito populations in eastern Australia suggests that endemic urban flaviviruses would have minimal influence on potential exotic WNV transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14-ijerph-10-03735">14</xref>]. However, in 2011, a highly pathogenic strain of WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> caused an outbreak of acute encephalitis in horses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-ijerph-10-03735">15</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-ijerph-10-03735">16</xref>]. Whilst centered west of the Great Dividing Range, cases were reported in coastal areas of New South Wales, suggesting that the virus can occasionally circulate near areas where an exotic strain of WNV may be introduced.
