<p>Despite WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> being classified as a subtype of WNV, key epidemiological differences between the viruses warrant further consideration of potential transmission cycles of exotic WNV strains. Most importantly, infection with WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> rarely causes disease in humans. On such rare occasions it can cause encephalitis, but is more often associated with a febrile illness that may or may not be accompanied by rash, malaise, headache, photophobia, arthralgia, myalgia and lymphadenopathy [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-ijerph-10-03735">21</xref>] demonstrated that a New York strain of WNV was significantly more neuroinvasive than wild-type WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub>: 1,000â€“10,000 fold more infectious virus is needed to produce disease in adult mice by peripheral inoculation. Furthermore, Brault

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-ijerph-10-03735">11</xref>] demonstrated that no illness or death occurred in WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub>-inoculated American crows compared with 100% mortality observed in those inoculated with the WNV
 <sub>NY-99</sub> strain. Like the North American strain of WNV, WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> has been responsible for neurological disease in horses, although reports of severe disease in horses were rare [
