<p>WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> has been isolated from all mainland states of Australia with the majority of isolates obtained from the tropical regions of northern Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and northern Queensland, where the virus appears endemic [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24-ijerph-10-03735">24</xref>]. WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> activity has been less frequently detected in the temperate regions of central and southern Australia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25-ijerph-10-03735">25</xref>]. Rather, WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> activity in the southeast is considered a result of the introduction from endemic northern areas, principally by migrating water birds that follow the flooding of major watercourses in the southern regions or existence in otherwise unknown cryptic foci [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26-ijerph-10-03735">26</xref>]. Elsewhere across the globe WNV commonly circulates in urban regions. Importantly, the epidemics in southern Romania, the Volga delta in southern Russia, the northeastern USA between 1996 and 1999, and southern USA in 2012 occurred in large urban populations [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28-ijerph-10-03735">28</xref>], highlighting that urban environments are at risk of potential exotic WNV introduction. In contrast, WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> is rarely associated with urban virus activity.
