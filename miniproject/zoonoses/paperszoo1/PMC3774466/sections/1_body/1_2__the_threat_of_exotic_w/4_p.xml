<p>Another key epidemiological difference between exotic WNV and WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> concerns vertebrate reservoir hosts. Many species of birds, particularly water birds belonging to the order Ciconiiformes, are implicated in the natural transmission cycles of WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub>, as demonstrated by field isolations and serological surveys [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29-ijerph-10-03735">29</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-ijerph-10-03735">30</xref>]. Of these, laboratory studies have shown that herons and egrets may develop particularly high viremia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23-ijerph-10-03735">23</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31-ijerph-10-03735">31</xref>]. Interestingly, while ardeid wading birds are important in WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> transmission in Australia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29-ijerph-10-03735">29</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-ijerph-10-03735">30</xref>], it seems that they are not for WNV transmission in the USA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32-ijerph-10-03735">32</xref>]. Conversely, American Crows (
 <italic>Corvus brachyrhynchos</italic>), which are considered important amplifying hosts of WNV in the USA, produce significantly lower viremia levels when infected with WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> than when infected with the WNV
 <sub>NY-99</sub> strain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-ijerph-10-03735">11</xref>]. Furthermore, unlike the strains of WNV recently circulating in the USA and Israel, there is no evidence that WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> is associated with disease in birds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13-ijerph-10-03735">13</xref>].
