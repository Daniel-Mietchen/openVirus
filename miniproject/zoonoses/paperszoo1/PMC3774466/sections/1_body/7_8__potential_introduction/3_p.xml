<p>As a number of mammals can develop viremia sufficient to infect mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97-ijerph-10-03735">97</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98-ijerph-10-03735">98</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99-ijerph-10-03735">99</xref>], it is plausible that a viremic mammal, possibly a human, may be capable of importing WNV into a naïve environment. WNV is recognized as a “disease of quarantine concern” to Australia and the importation of animals is subject to strict quarantine requirements, including a period of post entry quarantine and mandatory vaccination of horses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B119-ijerph-10-03735">119</xref>]. However, a viremic human or illegally imported animal may pass undetected/unregulated. Importation of human WNV infection has been documented [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B120-ijerph-10-03735">120</xref>], but it is unlikely that humans would develop a viremia sufficiently high to infect mosquitoes as humans typically develop only a transient viremia of low magnitude [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B121-ijerph-10-03735">121</xref>]. Nothwithstanding, non-arthropod-borne transmission has been documented in cases of organ transplantation, blood transfusion, intrauterine transmission and probable transmission via breast milk [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B122-ijerph-10-03735">122</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B123-ijerph-10-03735">123</xref>]. Accordingly, WNV is recognised as a potential threat to the Australian blood supply [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B124-ijerph-10-03735">124</xref>], and given the absence of an approved blood screening assay for WNV in Australia, donors are excluded from donating fresh blood components for four weeks after leaving an endemic country (including the USA and Canada), however plasma collection for fractionation can continue during this time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B125-ijerph-10-03735">125</xref>].
