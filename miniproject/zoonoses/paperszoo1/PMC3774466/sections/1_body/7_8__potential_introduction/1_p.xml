<p>Exotic viruses may enter Australia through a range of modalities, including migratory birds, wind-blown insects and air transport of infected humans, animals and insects [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B113-ijerph-10-03735">113</xref>]. However, introduction of wind-blown WNV-infected insects into Australia would probably be unlikely, because strains of WNV (other than WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub>) are not recognized in the Australasian region. Similarly, the introduction of WNV via a migratory bird is probably unlikely, due to both the route and duration of migration required [
