<p>Thus the most likely route of introduction of an exotic strain of WNV into Australia would probably be via transport in an aircraft. Of these, an infected mosquito may be the most likely threat [

 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115-ijerph-10-03735">115</xref>] confirmed that infected mosquitoes arriving via aircraft arriving in Sydney represented a risk of entry into Australia, albeit considered low to moderate. Further, this study indicated that the proportion of aircraft containing infected mosquitoes and the number of mosquitoes present have a significant influence on the probability of exotic WNV entry into Australia. During a study of 307 planes arriving in Australia between 1971 and 1979, Russell 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B116-ijerph-10-03735">116</xref>] determined that an average of 2.2 live mosquitoes arrived on each incoming aircraft. To best manage this threat, inflight aircraft disinsection and residual insecticidal treatments are employed [
