<p>As mentioned previously, exotic WNV would most likely enter Australia via the eastern seaboard [

 <sub>KUN</sub> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13-ijerph-10-03735">13</xref>], little protective immunity from previous infection with WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> would be expected amongst the resident populations of potential vertebrate reservoirs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-ijerph-10-03735">12</xref>]. Indeed, the lack of detection of any flavivirus in mosquitoes in some recent studies from urban areas of eastern Australia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14-ijerph-10-03735">14</xref>] supports the notion that previous exposure to endemic urban flaviviruses would have little impact upon the establishment of novel flaviviruses that may be introduced into these regions. Nevertheless, other endemic flaviviruses including Edge Hill and Stratford viruses have been isolated from mosquitoes collected in coastal areas of New South Wales, including some urban locations in the greater Sydney region [
