<p>When incriminating mosquito species, it is also necessary to identify potential reservoir hosts which serve as a source of infection for these vectors [

In addition to physiologically supporting virus amplification, an effective reservoir for WNV must be relatively abundant in comparison with other avian species, have frequent exposure to infection via mosquitoes, and be biologically capable of infecting vector species [
