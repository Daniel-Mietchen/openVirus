<p>There is increasing evidence that mammals and reptiles may serve as competent amplifying hosts of WNV and studies have shown that a number of small mammals are capable of developing viremias sufficient to infect mosquitoes [

 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97-ijerph-10-03735">97</xref>] suggests that some of these peridomestic species, especially squirrels, may be important in WNV transmission in the urban environment in North America. Aside from birds, few vertebrate species have been implicated in JEV serological group flavivirus transmission in Australia. In addition to ardeid wading birds, pigs are primary amplifying hosts of JEV in northern Australia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100-ijerph-10-03735">100</xref>] and black flying foxes (
 <italic>Pteropus alecto</italic>) can develop a viremia sufficient to infect recipient mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101-ijerph-10-03735">101</xref>]. If WNV were to be introduced into urban Australia it would be pertinent to consider the potential role of small peridomestic mammals such as flying foxes (
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> spp.) and marsupial possums (
 <italic>Trichosurus vulpecula</italic>; 
 <italic>Pseudocheirus peregrinus</italic>) as these mammals are potential reservoirs of a number of Australian arboviruses and can be abundant in urban environments [
