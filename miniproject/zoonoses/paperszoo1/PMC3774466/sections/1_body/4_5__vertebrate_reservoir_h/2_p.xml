<p>Australia possesses a rich bird diversity, which is approximately comparable in terms of species diversity to North America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92-ijerph-10-03735">92</xref>]. As WNV is considered an ecological generalist in terms of reservoir hosts, it is probable that at least some Australian bird species may fulfil the criteria required for an effective reservoir host. Only one species, the Little Raven (
 <italic>Corvus mellori</italic>) has been examined for its ability to become infected with a North American strain of WNV. After inoculation with WNV 
 <sub>NY-99</sub>, 
 <italic>C. mellori</italic> developed an average viremia of around 4â€“5 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL, with a maximum viremia of 7 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL in one individual [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93-ijerph-10-03735">93</xref>]. Whist this viremia is only moderate if compared with that of the American crow (mean viremia up to 10.2 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60-ijerph-10-03735">60</xref>], it may be sufficient to infect at least some recipient mosquito vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60-ijerph-10-03735">60</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90-ijerph-10-03735">90</xref>,
