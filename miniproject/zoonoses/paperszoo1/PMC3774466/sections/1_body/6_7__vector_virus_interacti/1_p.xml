<p>The potential establishment of WNV in Australia may be driven by the strain of virus introduced. Indeed, the recent emergence of a new dominant WNV genotype (WNV
 <sub>02</sub>) in the USA has highlighted phenotypic differences between different WNV strains [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109-ijerph-10-03735">109</xref>]. For instance, comparison between the WNV
 <sub>02</sub> and WNV
 <sub>NY-99</sub> strains has revealed differences in the transmission efficiency in mosquitoes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110-ijerph-10-03735">110</xref>], but some subsequent studies have not observed similar differences in transmission rates using the same virus strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B111-ijerph-10-03735">111</xref>]. Likewise, further phenotypic differences are evident if more divergent strains, including WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> are considered [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-ijerph-10-03735">11</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13-ijerph-10-03735">13</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-ijerph-10-03735">15</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-ijerph-10-03735">21</xref>].
