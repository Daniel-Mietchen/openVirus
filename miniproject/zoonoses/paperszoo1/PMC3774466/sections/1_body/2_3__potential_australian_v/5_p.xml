<p>A recently introduced species into Australia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64-ijerph-10-03735">64</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65-ijerph-10-03735">65</xref>], 
 <italic>Cx. gelidus,</italic> is also a highly efficient laboratory vector of WNV
 <sub>NY-99</sub> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46-ijerph-10-03735">46</xref>], as it is for a range of JEV serological group viruses, including WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> and JEV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66-ijerph-10-03735">66</xref>]. Whilst there is potential for this species to spread [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67-ijerph-10-03735">67</xref>], 
 <italic>Cx. gelidus</italic> does not currently share the wide geographical distribution of 
 <italic>Cx. annulirostris</italic> or 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic>, being restricted mostly to focal regions in northern Australia and usually at low densities. Further, 
 <italic>Cx. gelidus</italic> is largely mammalophilic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54-ijerph-10-03735">54</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68-ijerph-10-03735">68</xref>] which may reduce its potential role in urban enzootic transmission of WNV. Nonetheless, the establishment of 
 <italic>Cx. gelidus</italic> in Australia clearly demonstrates the potential impact of exotic mosquito species on the transmission cycles of both exotic and endemic arboviruses.
