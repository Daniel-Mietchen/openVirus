<p>A number of other 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. could play a regional or supplemental role in virus transmission of an exogenous WNV strain. For example, despite being a relatively poor laboratory vector of WNV 
 <sub>NY-99</sub> (transmission rates &lt; 10%; [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46-ijerph-10-03735">46</xref>]), 
 <italic>Cx. sitiens</italic> readily feeds on birds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45-ijerph-10-03735">45</xref>], is widely distributed in coastal areas and can reach high population densities during favorable conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69-ijerph-10-03735">69</xref>]. Similarly, 
 <italic>Cx. squamosus</italic> may be important for potential WNV transmission in urban centers of northern Queensland where it is abundant, has yielded isolates of WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70-ijerph-10-03735">70</xref>], and is reported to feed extensively on birds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57-ijerph-10-03735">57</xref>], supported by its abundance in the tree canopy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71-ijerph-10-03735">71</xref>].
