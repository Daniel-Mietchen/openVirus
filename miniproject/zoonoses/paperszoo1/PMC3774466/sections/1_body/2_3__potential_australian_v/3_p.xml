<p>Given its accepted status as the primary vector of WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub>, it is not surprising that 
 <italic>Cx. annulirostris</italic> would most likely be the primary potential vector of exotic WNV strains in Australia. This species is widely distributed on mainland Australia and has the capacity to reach high population densities under optimal weather conditions. 
 <italic>Cx. annulirostris</italic> has been implicated as a major vector in urban arbovirus outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53-ijerph-10-03735">53</xref>] and is also considered to be the major vector of MVEVand JEV, which are related to WNV within the JEV serocomplex [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-ijerph-10-03735">5</xref>]. Recently, populations of 
 <italic>Cx. annulirostris</italic> from eastern Australia were shown to be the most competent laboratory vectors of exotic WNV
 <sub>NY-99</sub> from nineteen species tested, displaying transmission rates between 48% and 84% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46-ijerph-10-03735">46</xref>]. 
 <italic>Cx. annulirostris</italic> is opportunistic in terms of its host feeding patterns, readily feeding on mammals and birds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45-ijerph-10-03735">45</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47-ijerph-10-03735">47</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54-ijerph-10-03735">54</xref>]. The percentage of mosquitoes feeding on human or birds can each exceed 20% in urban areas of Australia indicating that 
 <italic>Cx. annulirostris</italic> could be involved not only in enzootic WNV transmission between birds, but also in bridge transmission to mammals, including humans.
