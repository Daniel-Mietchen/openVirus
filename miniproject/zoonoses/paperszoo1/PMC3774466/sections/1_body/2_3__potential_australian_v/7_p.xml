<p>As mentioned previously, WNV transmission is reliant upon the involvement of 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72-ijerph-10-03735">72</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73-ijerph-10-03735">73</xref>]. Indeed, when compared with 
 <italic>Culex</italic> species, Australian mosquitoes belonging to other genera are less competent for WNV
 <sub>NY-99</sub> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46-ijerph-10-03735">46</xref>] and some species, including 
 <italic>An. farauti</italic> sensu lato, appear relatively refractory to infection. Whilst flavivirus isolates are obtained from various species of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> in Australia, there is scant evidence for the involvement of these species in endemic flavivirus transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24-ijerph-10-03735">24</xref>]. Further, as most 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. are primarily mammalian feeders and typically do not feed readily on birds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45-ijerph-10-03735">45</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47-ijerph-10-03735">47</xref>], 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes are less likely than 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. to maintain endemic WNV transmission in Australia. However, these species may be involved in transmission as bridge vectors, transmitting the virus to mammals from avian hosts, much in the same way that 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> do in the USA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73-ijerph-10-03735">73</xref>]. Indeed, two common Australian urban species, 
 <italic>Ae. notoscriptus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. vigilax</italic>, may fulfill the role of bridge vector for WNV, similar in the way they have been implicated in the transmission of JEV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54-ijerph-10-03735">54</xref>]. Additionally, species belonging to the genera 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> or 
 <italic>Verrallina</italic> with desiccation resistant eggs may be involved in virus overwintering, as they likely are for other endemic arboviruses, including the flavivirus, MVEV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74-ijerph-10-03735">74</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75-ijerph-10-03735">75</xref>]. Importantly, throughout its distribution, transmission cycles of WNV are both highly variable between geographical locations and are ecologically broad, encompassing a variety of vector and host species, so the potential role of other species cannot be discounted.
