<p>A vector is considered “competent” if it permits infection, replication and transmission of a virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33-ijerph-10-03735">33</xref>]. But, this statement does not alone indicate whether a particular species may play a role in enzootic transmission of a virus. Additional vector characteristics influence the potential role of a mosquito species in arbovirus transmission, including host feeding behavior, longevity, population densities and transmission dynamics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34-ijerph-10-03735">34</xref>]. WNV is transmitted between susceptible vertebrate hosts by mosquitoes and those belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Culex</italic> are considered the primary vectors throughout its geographical range. In Africa, 
 <italic>Cx. univittatus</italic> is considered to be the most important vector of WNV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35-ijerph-10-03735">35</xref>] and in Europe the principal vectors include 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx. modestus</italic> and 
 <italic>Coquillettidia richiardii</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36-ijerph-10-03735">36</xref>]. Major Asian vectors are 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cx. vishnui</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36-ijerph-10-03735">36</xref>]. The primary vectors of WNV in the USA belong to the 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> complex [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37-ijerph-10-03735">37</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38-ijerph-10-03735">38</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39-ijerph-10-03735">39</xref>]. 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. restuans</italic> are considered major vectors in the northeastern and north central USA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40-ijerph-10-03735">40</xref>], while 
 <italic>Cx. tarsalis</italic> is particularly important in the great plains and western USA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41-ijerph-10-03735">41</xref>]. Finally, 
 <italic>Cx. nigripalpus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> are important in southeastern USA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42-ijerph-10-03735">42</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43-ijerph-10-03735">43</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44-ijerph-10-03735">44</xref>]. However, with the exception of 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic>, these mosquito species do not occur in Australia. Nevertheless, several Australian mosquito species are potential urban vectors of exotic virulent strains of WNV, based on their ability to transmit endemic flaviviruses including WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub>, host feeding behavior, urban distribution and seasonal abundance. Recent studies, involving vector competence experiments with the WNV
 <sub>NY-99</sub> strain and analysis of host feeding patterns, have provided further evidence to incriminate candidate Australian vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45-ijerph-10-03735">45</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46-ijerph-10-03735">46</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47-ijerph-10-03735">47</xref>].
