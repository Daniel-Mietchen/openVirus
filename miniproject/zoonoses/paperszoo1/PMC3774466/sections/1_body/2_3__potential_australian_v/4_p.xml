<p>Many WNV vectors identified abroad belong to the 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> group of mosquitoes. Although Australia has four members of the 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> group, including 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx. australicus</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx. globocoxitus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. molestus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55-ijerph-10-03735">55</xref>], only 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> has been assessed for its ability to become infected with and transmit WNV
 <sub>NY-99</sub> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46-ijerph-10-03735">46</xref>]. Commensurate with its role overseas, 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> was a competent vector, with at least half of the mosquitoes tested from Sydney and Brisbane expectorating virus in saliva. Although some studies have demonstrated that it does feed on humans and other mammals, 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> is highly ornithophilic in urban areas of Australia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45-ijerph-10-03735">45</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56-ijerph-10-03735">56</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57-ijerph-10-03735">57</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58-ijerph-10-03735">58</xref>] and species-specific identification of avian bloodmeals showed that 96% of avian bloodmeals identified from this species from the northern Queensland city of Cairns originated from passeriform birds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45-ijerph-10-03735">45</xref>], the primary reservoir hosts of WNV in North America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59-ijerph-10-03735">59</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60-ijerph-10-03735">60</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61-ijerph-10-03735">61</xref>]. For these reasons, 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> has great potential not only as a primary enzootic vector facilitating virus transmission between passerine birds, but also, to a lesser extent, as a bridge vector to humans. Like 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx. australicus</italic> is an avian feeder [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56-ijerph-10-03735">56</xref>] and has yielded isolates of both WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62-ijerph-10-03735">62</xref>] and MVEV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63-ijerph-10-03735">63</xref>]. Other Australian members of the 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> group, including 
 <italic>Cx. molestus</italic>, should also be considered potential WNV vectors in their respective geographical distributions.
