<p>Herein, we evaluated entomological factors that could influence the establishment of an exotic strain of WNV in Australia, and suggest endemic mosquito species that would most likely play a role in potential transmission cycles, particularly in urban environments. Of the common Australian mosquito species examined, 
 <italic>Cx. annulirostris</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. gelidus</italic> appear to be the most competent vectors and, of these, 
 <italic>Cx. annulirostris</italic> also has the capacity to act as a major vector, able to facilitate both enzootic transmission and epizootic transmission from reservoir hosts to mammals. Consideration of ornithophilic feeding behavior incriminates 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> as likely to be involved in enzootic transmission of WNV. Conversely, 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> or 
 <italic>Verrallina</italic> spp., due to observed opportunistic or mammalophilic feeding, are more likely to act only as bridge vectors that transmit the virus from birds to mammals.
