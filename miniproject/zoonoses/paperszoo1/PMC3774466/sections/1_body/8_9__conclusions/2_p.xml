<p>From an entomological perspective, urban centers of eastern Australia could support the transmission of an exotic strain of WNV. The widespread abundance of competent vector species, in addition to evidence of host feeding on passerine bird species, suggests that the major prerequisites for transmission may be readily available. Further, the apparent rarity of flaviviruses in urban populations of mosquitoes suggests that endemic flaviviruses would have little impact on potential transmission cycles of an exotic WNV strain in urban centers. Obviously, there is a need to identify competent avian hosts in these environments, but the variety of bird species available, coupled with the knowledge that WNV can replicate in a wide variety of avian species, implies that suitable vertebrate hosts are most likely available. As has been observed in North America, it is probable that WNV transmission cycles would vary, depending on the unique environmental, climatic and ecological conditions present in different geographical locations, but hypothetical transmission in urban Australia is certainly plausible.</p>
