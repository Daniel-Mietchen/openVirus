<p>Plague is a flea-borne rodent-associated zoonotic disease that is caused by 
 <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> and characterized by long quiescent periods punctuated by rapidly spreading epidemics and epizootics. 
 <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> is notorious for causing three major human pandemics that killed millions. The magnitude of these pandemics has been credited for changing economic and political history and for notable improvements in public health

 <xref rid="pone.0035598-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Defining the geographic foci in which 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> persists during inter-epizootic periods and understanding the mechanisms of persistence are critical for designing interventions aimed at locally eliminating the pathogen and for anticipating where future epizootics are most likely to occur.
