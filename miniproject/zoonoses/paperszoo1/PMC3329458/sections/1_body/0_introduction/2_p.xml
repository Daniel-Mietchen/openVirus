<p>Plague foci represent areas where 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> has persisted over long durations of time spanning multiple epidemics or epizootics that are often disrupted by periods of low and often undetectable transmission. These foci are commonly characterized based on landscape (e.g., elevation, vegetation) and climatic variables
