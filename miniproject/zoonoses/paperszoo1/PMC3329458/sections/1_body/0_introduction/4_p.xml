<p>Prior to the last pandemic, the majority of human plague cases was reported from temperate foci where seasonality is clearly defined and there is marked variation in monthly temperatures

Recent studies have identified landscape level differences between localities in the West Nile region that have reported human plague cases and those that have not

Consistent with plague foci in North America and other parts of east Africa, the West Nile focus was defined based on elevation, wetness, and land use. However, it remains unclear how landscape level differences relate to mechanisms that account for differences in plague risk. Here, we sought to determine if abundance or diversity of hosts and fleas differed among villages inside versus outside of this recently delineated human plague focus in the West Nile region of Uganda. Our findings highlight the importance of flea diversity in
