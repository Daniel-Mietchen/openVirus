<p>Within plague foci, the timing of epizootics is often predicted based on temperature and precipitation 
 <xref rid="pone.0035598-Gage2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Why weather and climate are often predictive of the temporal and spatial distributions of 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, respectively, is poorly understood. Temperature and precipitation may affect the distribution and abundance of key hosts and vectors involved in 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> transmission

 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> to persist in, or be transmitted by, fleas.
