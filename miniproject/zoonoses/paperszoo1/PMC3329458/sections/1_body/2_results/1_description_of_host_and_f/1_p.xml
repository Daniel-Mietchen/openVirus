<p>During a total of 7,832 trap nights spanning from 22 February 2010 to 10 April 2011 and run within 40 homesteads at 10 elevation points, a total of 1,503 small mammals comprised of at least 14 species were captured. Together, the four most commonly collected hosts (
 <italic>Rattus rattus</italic>, 
 <italic>Arvicanthis niloticus</italic>, 
 <italic>Crocidura spp.</italic> and 
 <italic>Mastomys spp.</italic>) accounted for 77% of all hosts examined (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0035598-t001">Table 1</xref>). From all hosts examined, a total of 1,707 fleas comprised of 12 species were collected. Five species were extremely rare, each representing less than 1% of the sample (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0035598-t001">Table 1</xref>). Subsequent analyses in this sub-section focus on the five species of fleas that were commonly associated with the four most abundant host species identified above: 
 <italic>Xenopsylla cheopis</italic>, 
 <italic>X. brasiliensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Ctenophthalmus cabirus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Dynopsyllus lypusus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Stivalius torvus</italic>. Although 
 <italic>X. nubica</italic> was more abundant than 
 <italic>D. lypusus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. torvus</italic>, they were collected primarily from gerbils (belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Tatera</italic> or 
 <italic>Taterillus</italic>), which represented only 10% of all hosts collected (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0035598-t001">Table 1</xref>). 
 <italic>Xenopsylla cheopis</italic> and 
 <italic>X. brasiliensis</italic> were collected commonly from each of the four key host species, but 
 <italic>X. cheopis</italic> was rare above 1300 m (only 1 
 <italic>X. cheopis</italic> was recovered above 1300 m) and 
 <italic>X. brasiliensis</italic> was absent on sampled hosts below this elevation threshold (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035598-g003">Figure 3</xref>). By contrast, with the exception of a single 
 <italic>C. cabirus</italic> collected at site 5, 
 <italic>C. cabirus</italic>, 
 <italic>D. lypusus</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. torvus</italic> were not observed in sites 1–5, were observed in low numbers at site 6 (n = 4 
 <italic>D. lypusus</italic> and 1 each of 
 <italic>C. cabirus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. torvus</italic>) and were common at sites 7–10 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035598-g003">figure 3</xref>). It is noteworthy that site 6, although lower than 1300 m elevation, marks the first site to appear within the predicted elevated risk area (
