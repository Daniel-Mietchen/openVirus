<p>Site-specific cumulative rainfall during the month of July explained 90% of the variation observed in the flea diversity index (F = 68.40, d.f. = 1,9, P&lt;0.0001; Flea diversity = 0.006 mm
 <sup>−1</sup> * Cumulative rainfall in July – 0.276). Overall, rainfall amounts in July were significantly higher for high elevation sites (median 178.46 mm, rang: 162.76–193.71 mm) relative to low elevation sites (81.99 mm [63.46–132.98 mm]; χ = 6.55 d.f. = 1, P = 0.011). It should be noted that with the exception of May, October and December, rainfall within each month yielded a significant positive association with the site-specific flea diversity index. These months may represent time periods when rainfall was similarly above (during the heavy rains) or below (during the dry season) critical rainfall thresholds for sites above or below 1300 m. Flea diversity was negatively associated with the average monthly maximum temperature in the warmest month of the year (February) and this relationship explained 83% of the observed variation in site-specific flea indices. (F = 39.1, d.f. = 1,9, P = 0.0002; Flea diversity = −0.105 K-1 * Tmax (Feb)+32.53). Thus, diversity was lower in areas below 1300 m that are the hottest during the February heat. Average maximum temperature for February was significantly lower above 1300 m (301.96 K [301.05–302.80 K]; 29.8°C [28.9–30.7°C]) than below (306.34 K [304.24–308.37 K]; 34.2°C [32.1–36.2°C]).
