<p>For each host species or genus, we compared abundances between sites situated above or below 1300 m elevation. With the exception of 
 <italic>Mus minutoides</italic>, which was more abundant above 1300 m (median 0.04 
 <italic>M. minutoides</italic>/trap: range: 0.03–0.04 
 <italic>M. minutoides</italic> /trap) than below (0.01 [0–0.03]; Wilcoxon rank sums test with chi square approximation χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 5.5 d.f. = 1 P = 0.02), host abundances were similar between high and low elevation sites. In addition, host diversity was similar between sites above and below 1300 m (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035598-g004">figure 4</xref>). Likewise, median numbers of fleas and fleas per host were similar between sites above and below 1300 m. Thus, it is unlikely that differences in plague risk, which are associated with this elevation threshold, result from differences in host or flea abundance or from differences in host diversity. By contrast, flea diversity was significantly higher for sites above 1300 m (Simpson's index of diversity median 0.73; range: 0.73–0.75) than below (0.20 [0–0.65]; Wilcoxon rank sums test with chi square approximation χ = 6.55 d.f. = 1 P = 0.01) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035598-g003">figures 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035598-g004">4</xref>). Flea diversity was positively associated with elevation and elevation explained 79% of the observed variation in flea diversity (Flea diversity = 0.0009 m
 <sup>−1</sup>* elevation−0.55; F = 30.17, d.f. = 1,9, P = 0.0006).
