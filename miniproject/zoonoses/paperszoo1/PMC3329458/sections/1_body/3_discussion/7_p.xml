<p>As reviewed recently (Gage and Kosoy 2005, Eisen and Gage 2009), there has been extensive discussion, but few solid conclusions, on how 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> is maintained during inter-epizootic periods. Many of the most common hypotheses focus on host abundance, host community composition, spatial configurations of host populations, or survival of 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> outside of vertebrate hosts. Although survival of 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> within infected fleas has been proposed repeatedly, the importance of flea diversity in 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> persistence has seldom been addressed. These findings highlight the need to explicitly consider flea diversity within models of 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> persistence.
