Indeed, although the measures used in our study are likely attenuated by microclimatic conditions, temperature and rainfall may play an important role in defining the distribution of certain vector species. We showed that flea diversity is strongly and positively associated with rainfall and negatively associated with temperature. It is possible that wetter and cooler conditions at the higher elevation sites are more conducive to the survival of certain flea species (i.e.

 <italic>C. cabirus</italic>, and 
 <italic>D. lypusus</italic>). It is most likely that temperature and moisture affect the immature life stages, which exist primarily off of hosts and are presumably more sensitive to temperature and moisture fluctuations, than adults
