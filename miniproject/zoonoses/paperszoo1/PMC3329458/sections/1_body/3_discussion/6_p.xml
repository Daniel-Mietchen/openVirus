<p>The generality of our observation that flea diversity is higher in plague foci compared with outside requires further evaluation. In one instance, Laudisoit and others (2009) sought to compare host and flea communities in areas of Tanzania where plague was endemic to areas where plague was rare or absent. Similar to our study, they found no difference in host density between sites. However, in contrast to our study, they did not detect differences in any variables related to flea abundance or diversity. We argue that this may be because the sites evaluated encompassed sites where cases were rare, rather than absent, thus all sites were contained within the plague focus. Indeed, when looking at similarly defined sites within the West Nile focus (i.e., villages with or without a history of plague), host and flea diversity and abundance were similar between sites (Amatre et al. 2009).</p>
