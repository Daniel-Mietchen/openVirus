<p>Throughout a year of sampling along an elevation gradient spanning from low elevation sites situated outside of the West Nile plague focus, to higher elevation sites within the focus, we did not identify any significant differences in host abundance or diversity between sites within the defined plague focus compared with outside the focus. Likewise, numbers of host-seeking fleas, fleas recovered from hosts, and fleas per host were similar inside compared with outside of the focus, suggesting that pathogen transmission was not a simple function of contact rates between vectors and hosts. By contrast, we detected significant differences in abundance of particular flea species inside compared with outside the focus. However, it is notable that 
 <italic>X. cheopis</italic>, which is arguably the most efficient vector of 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic>
 <xref rid="pone.0035598-Eisen5" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, was the predominant species outside of the focus. Therefore, lack of an efficient vector outside the focus is an unlikely cause of the absence of 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic>. Furthermore, 
 <italic>X. cheopis</italic> replaces 
 <italic>X. brasiliensis</italic> in the northern portion of this plague focus 
 <xref rid="pone.0035598-Amatre1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, suggesting that these species fill a similar ecological niche. This observation challenges the notion that perhaps simple species replacement could explain the observed distribution in plague risk. Instead, our data implicate higher flea diversity as a significant factor in defining plague foci and may play an important role in 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> persistence or transmission from enzootic cycles to humans. This finding contrasts the dominant view held in the 20
 <sup>th</sup> century and prior that host ecology drives the distribution and persistence of plague bacteria
