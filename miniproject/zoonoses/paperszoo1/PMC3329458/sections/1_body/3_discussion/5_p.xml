<p>Flea community composition, which also varies with elevation, could play a role in explaining the geographic distribution of plague bacteria. Plague foci are typically situated in tropical and sub-tropical latitudes and extend into warmer regions of temperate latitudes. However, within these broad limits, 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> is usually absent in deserts and large continuous forests, and foci are commonly restricted to highlands, but absent from extremely high elevations 
 <xref rid="pone.0035598-Tikhomirov1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Consistent with our observations at a very local scale that flea diversity is higher within higher elevation sites, several studies from other geographic regions that were reviewed recently 
 <xref rid="pone.0035598-Krasnov2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> have noted that flea species diversity and richness are higher at higher elevation sites, but depressed in very high elevations. However, these studies did not differentiate between plague endemic and non-endemic regions. Indeed, studies of host and vector diversity along transects that span from inside to outside of plague foci are uncommon. During examination of one instance where attempts were made to compare flea diversity inside and outside of a focus in Central Java 
 <xref rid="pone.0035598-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, we noted remarkable similarity to our findings in the West Nile region. In both regions, 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> is restricted to higher elevation sites (above 1,000 m in Central Java). Likewise, both primary and secondary hosts are present inside and outside the Central Java focus, but flea diversity is lower below 1000 m with the proposed vectors 
 <italic>Stivalius cognatus</italic> and 
 <italic>Neopsylla sondaica</italic> absent or rare below this elevation 
 <xref rid="pone.0035598-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.
