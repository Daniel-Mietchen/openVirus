<p>Interestingly, temperature (often captured by elevation) and rainfall variables (often captured by greenness of vegetation indices) frequently emerge in spatial risk models as the best predictors of plague risk areas around the world

 <xref rid="pone.0035598-Nakazawa1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. To some extent, temperature may be a predictor of plague foci because it influences the ability of fleas to survive, which may contribute to persistence. Temperature also influences the ability of 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> to form biofilm, which might enable fleas to maintain 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> infections 
 <xref rid="pone.0035598-Vetter1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Biofilm production is regulated by the hemin storage locus gene complex, and biofilm production appears to be optimized at 20°–26°C 
 <xref rid="pone.0035598-Perry1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Interestingly, within our study sites, average maximum temperature for sites above 1300 m ranges from 25.3° to 26.9°C, whereas sites below 1300 m range from 28.3° to 32.7°C. However, it is important to note that adult fleas of some species typically remain on their mammalian hosts rather than spending most of their time in nests or burrows, so the temperature range experienced by these fleas is somewhat buffered from ambient temperatures 
 <xref rid="pone.0035598-Pollitzer1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In addition, the temperatures reported represent the maximum temperatures observed for these sites, and these maxima are still below the temperature at which hms proteins begin to degrade, circa 37°C
