<p>Relative host abundance, measured as the number of hosts per trapping effort, was determined for each elevation point by dividing the numbers of hosts of a particular genus or species collected within an elevation point (e.g., sites 1â€“10 shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035598-g001">figure 1</xref>) by the number of trap nights per site. Host diversity was estimated for each sampling site using Simpson's Index of Diversity 
 <xref rid="pone.0035598-Simpson1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, described as:

 </disp-formula>where n is the total number of hosts of a particular species or genus and N is the total number of hosts of all species. Flea diversity, based on on-host fleas, was estimated using the same equation. Hosts and fleas used in these calculations correspond with those listed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0035598-t001">Table 1</xref>. The Simpson's index of diversity ranges from 0 to 1 with the greater value indicating greater diversity within the sample. Median numbers of hosts per trap, total number of fleas collected from host, fleas per host, total numbers of host-seeking fleas, and diversity indices were compared between sites above or below 1300 m elevation using Wilcoxon rank sum tests with chi square approximations.
