<p>The relationship between elevation and flea diversity was explored using linear regression. To evaluate the association between flea diversity and rainfall, forward stepwise regression was used to screen average monthly site-specific values of rainfall. Rainfall in this region follows a bimodal distribution with the reliable heavy rain falling from August through November during the primary rainy season. December through February marks the dry season, which is followed by the less reliable and often lighter rainy season from Marchâ€“June. June and July are characterized as the interval season with variable amounts of rain

 <xref rid="pone.0035598-MacMillan1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, therefore we used a forward stepwise screening process that included each average monthly value for rainfall to identify the best statistical fit to the flea diversity data. Regardless of the month, temperatures consistently decreased with increasing elevation and temperature showed only a single peak with highest temperatures observed in February and the lowest temperatures in June. Therefore, average minimum temperature in June (lowest temperature during the coolest month) and average maximum temperature for February (highest temperature for the warmest month) were included in models of flea diversity. These temperature extremes were selected because flea survival is often temperature dependent and average values may have obscured the true range in temperature experienced by the fleas. For both the rainfall and the temperature models, the best model was selected based on comparisons of the corrected Akaike Information Criterion. Because only 10 sites were included in the model, we restricted the number of predictive variables to one.
