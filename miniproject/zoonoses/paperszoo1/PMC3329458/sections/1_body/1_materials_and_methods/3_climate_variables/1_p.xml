<p>Meteorological observation networks are sparse in sub-Saharan Africa, and no observation stations were established within our study area. As a result, to assess the relationship between flea diversity and climatic variables, we used ten-year averages (1999â€“2008) for cumulative monthly and annual precipitation, minimum temperature during the coolest month (June) and maximum temperature during the hottest month (February) of the year derived from a suite of atmospheric simulations performed specifically for the West Nile region with the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF)

 <xref rid="pone.0035598-Monaghan1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> demonstrated that the resulting WRF-based climate dataset better resolves the spatial variability and annual cycle of temperature, humidity, and rainfall in West Nile compared to satellite-based and
