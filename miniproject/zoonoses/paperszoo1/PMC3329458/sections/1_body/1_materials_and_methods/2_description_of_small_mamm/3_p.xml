 <xref rid="pone.0035598-Kilonzo1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> on the floor in locations deemed to be the most protected from animals that are frequently in the huts (e.g., chickens, goats, dogs) and were placed away from areas where residents slept. The pan traps measured 20.0 cm in diameter and 3.0 cm in depth. A flashlight was suspended above the pans in a solution of 2% saline with Tween 80 (5 drops of Tween 80 added to 1.0 cm to 1.5 cm in depth of saline). Petroleum jelly was applied to the rim of the pan to prevent fleas from escaping. After each of the 2 nights, fleas were collected from the pans and stored in 70% ethanol until species identification could be performed.
