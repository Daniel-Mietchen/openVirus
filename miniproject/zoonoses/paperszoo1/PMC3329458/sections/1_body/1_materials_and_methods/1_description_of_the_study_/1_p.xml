<p>Our sampling was focused in Arua and Zombo districts in the plague-endemic West Nile Region of northwestern Uganda. The majority of human plague cases in these districts have been reported from localities situated above the Rift Valley escarpment, which roughly bisects our study site

 <xref rid="pone.0035598-Winters1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. We established 10 small mammal sampling sites that were evenly spaced with respect to elevation along a transect spanning from approximately 725 (site 1) to 1630 m (site 10) in elevation (average difference in elevation between neighboring sites: 99 m, range: 73–127 m). Half of the sites were situated in areas identified by our previous risk model as posing an elevated risk for plague (sites 6–10)

 <xref rid="pone.0035598-Winters1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Our delineation of areas that pose an elevated risk was based on approximately 10 years of epidemiological surveillance data collected from clinics above and below the 1300 m elevation threshold

Animal-based surveillance for plague activity is not routinely conducted in Uganda, in part due to the cost but also because seropositivity and culture recovery efforts are extremely low, especially during inter-epizootic periods. Thus, although humans are incidental hosts of 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, the epidemiological dataset provided the best available estimate of plague activity in the region. It is possible that 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> may circulate in small mammal communities outside of the identified epidemiological focus. However, surveys designed to assess differences in human demographics or behaviors that we believed to be important risk factors for plague (e.g., household size, food storage and agricultural practices and vector and rodent control methods) revealed no obvious differences between high (&gt;1300 m) and low elevation sites. Thus, lack of human infections at low elevation sites is likely attributable to either a lack of bridging vectors between zoonotic cycles and human hosts, or lack of 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic>. Sites located above 1300 m were generally wetter (median cumulative annual rainfall [range]: 1644.8 mm [1500.2–1889.2 mm]) and cooler (median average maximum monthly temperature [range]): 26.1°C [25.3–27.0°C]) than sites below this elevation (1080 mm [864.2–1483.3 mm]; 30.6°C [28.3–32.7°C]). Site-specific rainfall and temperature data were derived from high-resolution atmospheric model simulations for 1999–2008, described below.
