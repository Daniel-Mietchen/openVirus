  <title>scFv-Fc ToR67-3B4 protects mice against VEEV disease.</title>
  <p>BALB/c mice were challenged by the aerosol route with approximately 100 LD
   <sub>50</sub> VEEV strain TrD (Panel A and B), Mena II, Fe37c and Mucambo virus (BeAn8, Panel C and D). Six, twenty-four, forty-eight and seventy-two hours later they were injected with 100 µg scFv-Fc ToR67-3B4 intraperitoneally (Panel A, B and C, n = 6 or 10). As negative control mice remained either untreated or were injected with a human IgG1 antibody (Panel B) or a nonspecific antibody (anti-WEEV, Panel D, n = 10 or 5). Animals were observed twice daily for clinical signs of infection and were culled when appropriate using humane endpoints.
