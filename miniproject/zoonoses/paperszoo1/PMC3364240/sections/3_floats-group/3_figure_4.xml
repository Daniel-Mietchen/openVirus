   <italic>In vitro</italic> neutralisation activity of scFv-Fc fusion ToR67-3B4 to different VEEV strains and Everglades virus.
  </title>
  <p>VEEV strains of subtype IA/B (Panel A and B) and Everglades virus (strain Fe37c, Panel C) with a TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/ml of 5×10
   <sup>4</sup> were incubated with serial dilutions of scFv-Fc ToR67-3B4 and other mAbs at 37°C for 2 hours. Starting concentrations were between 0.5 to 1.0 mg/ml. Subsequently the mixtures were subjected to cell culture infection. Residual infectious activity of virus was estimated by specific immunostaining one day post infection with VEEV-specific antibodies. Absorbance (OD450 nm) values obtained with virus samples not preincubated with any antibody served as positive control and were set as 100% infectivity. Non-infected Vero cells were used as negative control. The mean values of two independent experiments are shown.
