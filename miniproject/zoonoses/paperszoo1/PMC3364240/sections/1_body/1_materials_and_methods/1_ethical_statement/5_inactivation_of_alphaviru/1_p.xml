<p>Inactivation of all viral antigens was performed with a final concentration of 0.1% ß-propionolactone (ß-PL, Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany). Immediately before use a 10% ß-PL solution was prepared and 0.1 ml of this dilution was incubated with 5 ml of virus containing cell culture supernatant (pH 8 to 8.5) for 1 h at 4°C and 4 hours at 37°C with constant stirring. After 2 and 4 hours the pH of the cell culture supernatant was controlled and adjusted if necessary. In order to achieve a complete hydrolysis of remaining ß-PL after the inactivation the supernatant was kept at 4°C for another 12 to 18 hours. After low speed centrifugation of the sample for 30 min at 1000× g the viral inactivation was verified by inoculation of Vero cells and monitoring for cytopathic effects (CPE) for 3 to 5 days.</p>
