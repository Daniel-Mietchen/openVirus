<p>Lymphocytes of the macaque bone marrow were sampled after 6 boosts and subjected to RNA preparation by using Tri Reagent (Molecular Research Center Inc, Cincinnati, USA). The isolated RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA and diverse combinations of forward and reverse primers were used to amplify DNA, coding for the variable regions of antibodies, VLκ and VH 
 <xref rid="pone.0037242-Pelat1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In order to obtain the cognate sublibraries, the PCR fragments were subcloned into the pGemT vector (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) as described

 <xref rid="pone.0037242-Hust2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. For the phage-displayed library the precloned VH and VL repertoire was reamplified and specific restriction sites were inserted by PCR 
 <xref rid="pone.0037242-Pelat2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. For the construction of the library the reamplified VH and VL genes were subcloned into the phagemid pHAL14 in two successive ligation steps. The VH PCR products were subcloned into pHAL14 as
