 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells and Hyperphage were incubated for 30 min at 37°C without shaking, followed by a further incubation for 30 min with shaking at 250 rpm. The infected cells were harvested by centrifugation and transferred to glucose-free TY-medium containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and 50 µg/ml kanamycin in order to repress the lac promoter of pHAL14 and allow the expression of the scFv::pIII fusions. After incubation overnight at 250 rpm and 30°C bacteria were removed by centrifugation and phage particles in the culture supernatant were precipitated as previously described
