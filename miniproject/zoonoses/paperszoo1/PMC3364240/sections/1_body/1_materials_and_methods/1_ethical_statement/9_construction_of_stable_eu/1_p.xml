<p>VEEV specific scFv gene fragments were subcloned from the immune library vector pHAL14 into the mammalian expression vector pCMV2.5-hIgG1-Fc by using the restriction sites 
 <italic>Nco</italic>I and 
 <italic>Not</italic>I 
 <xref rid="pone.0037242-Schirrman1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. The mammalian expression vector allows the expression of scFvs in frame with the human IgG1 gene. The fusion is under the control of the CMV promoter. Moreover, the vector contains besides the 
 <italic>bla</italic>-gene a neomycin phosphotransferase (Neo) expression cassette for antibiotic selection with G418.
