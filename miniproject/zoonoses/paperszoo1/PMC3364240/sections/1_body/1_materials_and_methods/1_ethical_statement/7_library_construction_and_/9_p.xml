<p>The panning and amplification of specifically bound phage was repeated three times before proceeding with postpanning analysis and each panning included a preselection and selection step. In order to remove unspecific binders, the library was preincubated in parallel with non-infected Vero cells and a nonspecific murine IgG. Therefore, 100 µl of the phage library was incubated for 1 h at room temperature (RT) onto a mixture of coated and concentrated VRS supernatant from non-infected Vero cells plus 1% BSA (bovine serum albumin) in PBST (PBS plus 0.01% Tween 20) containing 10 µg/ml of the murine IgG D1-4G2-4-15
