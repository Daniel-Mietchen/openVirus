 <xref rid="pone.0037242-Guide1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Animals were kept under stable temperature (22±2°C) and relative humidity (50%) conditions, with 12 hours of artificial lighting per day. Their cages were individual (6 per room) and each had a perch. Animals were fed twice a day, once with dried food, once with fresh fruits and vegetables, and water was provided concurrently. The food intake and general behaviour were observed during feeding by animal technicians, who were able to access a veterinarian if needed. Systematic veterinary visits to each NHP-room were conducted twice a week. General anesthesia was administered prior to any blood or bone marrow collection. Additionally, subsequent analgesics were administered in the following days by animal technicians if pain was suspected, according to the observations of animal behaviour.
