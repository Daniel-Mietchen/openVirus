<p>The ability of scFv-Fc ToR67-3B4 (25 µg) to neutralise virus infectivity was determined by mixing the construct with VEEV strains TrD, Fe37c or BeAn8 (approximately 100 pfu) and incubating at 4°C overnight. Residual infectious virus was estimated by a standard plaque assay in L929 cells as described
