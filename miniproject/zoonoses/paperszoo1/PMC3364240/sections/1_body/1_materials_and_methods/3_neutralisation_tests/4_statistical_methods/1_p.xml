 <italic>in vivo</italic>, a linear regression model was fitted to the log transformed data to estimate the rate of change over time. A change of 0.30 units on the log scale equates to a 50% reduction of the data on the original scale. This value is divided by the estimated model slope to obtain the half-life.
