<p>BALB/c mice, 6–8 weeks old, were used for all passive antibody protection studies. Mice were challenged by the airborne route with 100LD50 strain TrD

 <xref rid="pone.0037242-Henderson1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. The LD50s for strains Mena II, Fe37c and Mucambo virus have not been determined. However, titres were used in the collision nebuliser that have reliably achieved 100% mortality in previous experiments

 <xref rid="pone.0037242-OBrien1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Afterwards mice remained either untreated or were injected intraperitoneally with 100 µg scFv-Fc ToR67-3B4, human IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) or control construct (anti-WEEV). Mice received just one injection at a single time-point (6, 24, 48 or 72 h) post-challenge and were monitored for clinical signs of infection (piloerection, hunching, inactivity, excitability and paralysis) twice daily by an observer who was unaware of the treatment allocations. Animals were scored according to the severity of the clinical signs and were humanely culled as appropriate 
 <xref rid="pone.0037242-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. These experiments therefore record the occurrence of severe disease rather than mortality. Even though it is rare for animals infected with virulent VEEV and showing signs of severe illness to survive, our use of humane endpoints should be considered when interpreting any virus dose expressed here as 50% lethal doses (LD
 <sub>50</sub>). In one experiment, sera were harvested by cardiac puncture from mice that were alive fourteen days post-challenge. Samples were assayed for VEEV-specific antibodies using sucrose density gradient-purified β-propiolactone-inactivated antigen from strain TC-83.
