<p>As positive control for infection, virus samples not preincubated with any antibody as well as virus samples preincubated with VEEV specific antibodies that do not display any neutralising activity like mAb WIS VEE1 were used. Moreover, virus samples preincubated with mAb SFV 8/6 and 1A3B-7, both antibodies with known neutralizing capacity (
 <xref rid="pone.0037242-Roehrig2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> and Hülseweh, personal communication) were applied as a positive control and non-infected Vero cells served as negative control. Twenty to twenty-four hours post infection all cell monolayers were fixed with 3% formalin in PBS for 3 h at 4°C and infection of cells was demonstrated by specific immunostaining of viral antigens. After washing with PBS-T, the monolayers were overlaid with 100 µl of a 1∶5000 dilution of the VEEV-specific biotinylated mAb SFV 8/6 and incubated for 2 h at RT. Bound biotinylated mAbs were detected by using the streptavidin HRP conjugate (GE Healthcare, USA, 1∶6.000) and visualisation was performed with precipitating TMB as substrate. The staining reaction was stopped by adding 100 µl of 1 M sulphuric acid and absorbance was measured at 450 nm in a microwell plate reader. The absorbance values were correlated to relative infectious activity. Thereby absorption at 450 nm (OD450 nm) values of the positive control, namely Vero B4 cells infected with VEEV, were set as 100% infectivity. A reduction equal or greater than 50% in A450
 <sub>nm</sub> in the wells was considered as indicative for neutralisation.
