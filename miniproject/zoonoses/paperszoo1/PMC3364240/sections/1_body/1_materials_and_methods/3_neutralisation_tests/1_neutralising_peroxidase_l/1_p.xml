<p>The NPLA assay for scFv-Fc fusions and complete IgG antibodies was done according to the technique of Jensen 
 <xref rid="pone.0037242-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> with several modifications. All assays were performed in 96 well microwell plates and Vero cells were used as host for infection. Fifty µl of two-fold dilutions of scFv-Fc fusions or mAbs (starting concentration between 0.5 to 1.0 mg/ml) were incubated with an equal volume of VEE virus strains TC-83, TrD or Fe3-7c with a TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml of 5×10
 <sup>4</sup> for 2 hours at 37°C in 96-well plates. Following this incubation, 100 µl of freshly trypsinised Vero cells at a concentration of 4×10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml were transferred to the antibody virus mixture.
