<p>Vero cells (100 µl of 2×10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml) were grown in 96-well microtiter plates for 24 h and subsequently infected with serial log
 <sub>10</sub> dilutions of either VEEV TC83 or TrD. Non-infected Vero cells served as negative control. Specific staining of VEEV infected cells was performed with biotinylated scFv-Fc ToR67-3B4 and mAb SFV 8/6 as positive control. In detail, one day post infection the infected cells were fixed with 3% formalin in PBS for 3 h at 4°C. Afterwards the fixed samples were incubated with their cognate antibodies in either a 1∶5000 or 1∶10.000 dilution in PBSF-T (PBST plus 1% FCS) for 1 h in a humid chamber at 37°C. After 3 consecutive washes in PBS-T the fixed cells were incubated for 30 min with the conjugate streptavidin - horseradish peroxidase (PSA, GE Healthcare, USA) diluted 1∶6000 in PBS-FT. After further extensive washing and in order to visualise infected cells microscopically, the samples were incubated with the precipitating colorimetric peroxidase substrate TMB (KPL, Germany) for 10 minutes. Staining was stopped by rinsing the plates with Millipore-purified water.
