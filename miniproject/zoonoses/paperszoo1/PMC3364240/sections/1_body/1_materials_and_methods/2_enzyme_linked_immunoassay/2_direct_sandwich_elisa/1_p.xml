<p>All sandwich ELISAs were performed in 96 microwell plates (Maxisorp™, Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) that were either coated with 3 µg/ml antibody or scFv-Fc by incubation for 2 h at 37°C or overnight at 4°C. For the detection of VEEV we used either the monoclonal antibody (mAb) VEE-WIS1 or a mixture of mAbs VEE-WIS1, SFV3/4 and SFV 12/2 as capture antibodies

 <xref rid="pone.0037242-Ehricht1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. MAb VEE-WIS1 (E1-specific) regognises specifically VEEV of subtype IA/B, while the antibody mixture binds Old world as well as New world Alphaviruses. In order to capture WEEV specifically mAb SVF 12/2 was applied. The ELISA to detect EEE virus was done on plates coated with a mixture of mAbs SFV 8/6 (E1-specific), SFV3/4 and SFV 12/2

After further washes, wells were additionally overlayed with liquid plate sealer (Candor Bioscience GmbH, Wangen, Germany), stored at 4°C and used for ELISA studies within three to six weeks. Samples with virus were incubated for 2 h at room temperature on precoated microwell plates and afterwards extensively washed. Bound viruses were detected by using biotinylated scFv-Fcs or mAbs in appropriate dilutions (1∶500, 1∶2000 or 1∶5000) and incubation for 1 h at 37°C. After three further washes the conjugate Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (PSA, GE Healthcare, USA) was applied to the wells in a 1∶ 6000 dilution and plates were incubated for 30 min at RT with agitation. Bound biotinylated mAbs and fusions were detected by using TMB staining (commercial solution from Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) that was stopped with 2 M sulphuric acid after 10 minutes. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm.
