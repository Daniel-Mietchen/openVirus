<p>Therefore, purified VEEV particles were disrupted either by incubation for 20 minutes at 56°C or 5 minutes at 95°C in Laemmli sample buffer 
 <xref rid="pone.0037242-Laemmli1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> containing either no or 1 mM DTT. The viral proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran, BA85, Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany). The membrane was blocked with PBS plus 1% Casein, pH7.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific GmbH, Dreieich, Germany) for 1 h at RT. For the detection of virus-specific proteins, the membrane was incubated with either biotinylated scFv-Fc (Tor67-3B4: 1∶5000) fusions or mAbs (SFV 8/6: E1-specific mAb, 1∶10.000; WIS-VEE1: E1-specific mAb, 1∶1.000; 1A3B7: E2-specific mAb, 1∶1.000) for 1.5 h at RT in the dark. After 3 washes with PBS-T the membrane was incubated with the conjugate streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (1∶1000, GE Healthcare, Munic, Germany) for 30 min. Staining and visualisation of specific proteins was performed with 5-Brom-4-Chlor-3-Indolyl-Phosphat/Nitro Tetrazolium Blue Chloride (NBT-BCIP, Thermo Fisher Scientific GmbH, Dreieich, Germany) according to standard procedures.
