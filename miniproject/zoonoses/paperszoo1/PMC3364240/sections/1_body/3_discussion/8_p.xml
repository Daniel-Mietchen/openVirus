<p>Besides applications for specific detection and identification purposes, the NHP antibody described here may have application for human antiviral therapy. Database comparison of scFv ToR67-3B4 indicated the highest similarity to the human IGHV4-59*01 and IGKV2-30*01. Its variable regions were as similar to human V
 <sub>H or</sub> V
 <sub>L</sub> sequences as 24 and 7% present in Kabat's database respectively. Therefore, scFv ToR67-3B4 might be regarded “as human” as these human sequences. Generally, a high level of humanness is expected to correspond to decreased immunogenicity and could be beneficial for therapeutic treatment of VEE.
