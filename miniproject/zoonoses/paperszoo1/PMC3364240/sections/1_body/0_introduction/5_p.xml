<p>In this work, we describe the isolation of the anti-VEEV single scFv ToR67-3B4 using antibody phage display from a non-human primate (NHP) antibody gene library. We describe the immunological and biochemical characterisation of its cognate Fc-fusion and investigate its 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> stability as well as its 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> inactivation potential in BALB/c mice.
