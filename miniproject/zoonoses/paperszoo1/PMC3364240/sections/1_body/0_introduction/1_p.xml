<p>Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) belongs to the 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus within the Togaviridae family and was first isolated from horses in the 1930s 
 <xref rid="pone.0037242-Kubes1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0037242-Powers1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Besides equids, several species of this virus family are also pathogenic to man and are recognized as potential agent of biological warfare and biological terrorism. VEEV is listed as a “Dirty Dozen agent” and is classified as Category B agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta (

 <xref rid="pone.0037242-Sudia1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. It is a single stranded positive-sense RNA virus and is maintained in a cycle between rodents and mosquitoes in nature. VEEV represents a complex of viruses previously classified as subtypes I to VI. However, recent taxonomic changes have classified only the subtype I viruses as VEEV and differentiate five distinct variants (IA/B, IC, ID, IE, IF; 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ictvonline.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://ictvonline.org</ext-link>). Mainly the subtypes IA/B, IC and ID have been proven to be pathogenic for man. The disease they cause, ranges from mild febrile reactions to fatal encephalitic zoonoses and outcomes are significantly worse especially for young and elderly patients. Subtypes II–VI are now classified as distinct species (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ictvonline.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://ictvonline.org</ext-link>) and especially Everglades and Mucambo virus (formerly subtypes II and IIIA) share a high level of genetic homology to VEEV and cause a similar human disease that may lead to encephalitis and death in a small proportion of cases
