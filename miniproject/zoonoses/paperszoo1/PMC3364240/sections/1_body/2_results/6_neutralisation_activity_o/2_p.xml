<p>For this purpose the ability of scFv-Fc ToR67-3B4 to neutralise virus infectivity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> was assessed for different VEEV strains in 2 to 3 independent experiments. Serial dilutions of scFv-Fc ToR67 3B4 were mixed with a TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml of 5×10
 <sup>4</sup> of VEEV of subtype IA/B and II. The virus antibody mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 2 hours and subsequently subjected to cell culture infection. Residual infectious activity of virus was estimated by specific immunostaining one day post infection with VEEV-specific antibodies. Absorbance (OD450 nm) values obtained with virus samples not preincubated with any antibody served as the positive control and were set as 100% infectivity, non-infected Vero cells were used as the negative control.
