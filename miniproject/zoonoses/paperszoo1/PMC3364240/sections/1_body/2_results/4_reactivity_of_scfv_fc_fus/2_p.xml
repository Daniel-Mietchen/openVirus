<p>Moreover, the ability of scFv-Fc ToR67-3B4 to detect different Alphavirus species was tested by a direct sandwich ELISA, using scFv-Fc ToR67-3B4 either as detection (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037242-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037242-g002">figure 2B</xref> scFv-Fc ToR67-3B4 displayed only marginal cross-reactivity to other Alphavirus species except for EEEV if applied for detection. The recombinant antibody can be combined with the capture antibody mAb VEE WIS1 for the highly specific detection of VEEV. At least a TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml of 10
 <sup>6</sup> was manifested as detection limit in a sandwich ELISA for strain TC83 (IA/B).
