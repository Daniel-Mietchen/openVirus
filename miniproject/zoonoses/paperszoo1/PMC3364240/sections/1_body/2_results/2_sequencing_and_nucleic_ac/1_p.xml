<p>The DNA fragments of 24 positive monoclonal binders were sequenced in order to identify unique binders and to define the germline gene family and the amino-acid subgroups of the heavy (V
 <sub>H</sub>) and light (V
 <sub>L</sub>) chain variable regions. However, three rounds of panning yielded only one unique VEEV-specific clone that predominated the resulting antibody panel. All binders were identical in their V
 <sub>H</sub> and V
 <sub>L</sub> sequences. Thereafter, further analysis was exclusively performed with the binder ToR67-3B4. The alignment of the amino acid sequence of ToR67-3B4 to VBASE2, the integrative database of germ-line variable genes from IgG loci of human and mouse, showed the highest similarity to the human IGHV4-59*01 and IGKV2-30*01. Furthermore, we calculated the G-score of the antibody's variable (V) regions since macaque antibodies have been suggested to have extremely human-like character 
 <xref rid="pone.0037242-Thullier1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, a property that could be especially beneficial for a therapeutical antibody. The V
 <sub>H</sub> region of ToR67-3B4 had a G-score of 0.707 thus meaning that it has the same level of similarity as 24% V
 <sub>H</sub> sequences present in Kabat's database. If the human V
 <sub>H</sub> sequences present in Kabat's database are regarded as representative of human V
 <sub>H</sub> sequences, this result may be summarized as “the V
 <sub>H</sub> region of ToR67-3B4 is as human as 24% of human V
 <sub>H</sub> regions”. The V
 <sub>L</sub> chain displayed a G-score of −1.505, indicating that it is “as human as” 7% of human sequences present in the Kabat database.
