<p>Since a sufficient 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> stability of an antibody is a basic requirement for successfull protection 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, the half-life of ToR67-3B4 in BALB/c mice was estimated before the recombinant antibody was applied in virus challenge experiments. One-hundred µg of the scFv-Fc were injected intraperitoneally and sera were harvested from the murine marginal tail veins at 8 hours, 1, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 25 days post-administration. The serum antibody concentration of the remaining scFv-Fc ToR67-3B4 in blood was determined by ELISA and the recombinant antibody was no longer detectable after 5 days (data not shown). The decrease in antibody serum concentration over time resulted in a half-life of 1.68 d (95% confidence intervals: 1.65–1.71 d, data not shown) that was considered as sufficient to justify analysing the therapeutic potential of this construct.
