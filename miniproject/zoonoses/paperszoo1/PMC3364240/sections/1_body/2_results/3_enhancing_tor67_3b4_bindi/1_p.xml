<p>By one step subcloning, the scFv ToR67-3B4 was inserted as a 
 <italic>Nco</italic>I-
 <italic>Not</italic>I fragment into the mammalian expression vector pCMX2.5-hIgG1-Fc-XP, that allowed the fusion of scFv antibody coding regions to the gene fragment encoding the human IgG1 Fc part (hinge-CH2-CH3) and enabled the stable expression of homodimeric and bivalent scFv-Fc fusion proteins in CHO-K1 cells. Moreover, the IgG1 Fc part allowed routinely high affinity purification with goat anti-human antibodies coupled to sepharose. The fusion of a scFv to a Fc part mediates enhanced 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> protein stability, could prolong serum half-life and mediates IgG effector functions if necessary
