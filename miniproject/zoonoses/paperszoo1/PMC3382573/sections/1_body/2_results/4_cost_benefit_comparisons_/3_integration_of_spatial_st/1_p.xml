<p>The AI data allowed the generation of three sets of metrics, potentially applicable in cost-benefit analyses: 1) a 
 <italic>spatial statistical</italic> (SS) approach, 2) a 
 <italic>Network Theory</italic> (NT) version, and 3) a 
 <italic>bio-geo-temporal</italic> alternative. While the SS version appeared to cover small circles (i.e., a low ‘cost’ per case), because it did not consider connectivity, control measures based on such approach should involve the cumulative areas of all such small circles. While the NT approach considered connectivity, it covered a much larger area than the SS model because, in NT, a cluster is defined in a different way: it includes both nodes and edges (links) which, together, define polygonal areas rather than small circles. These differences in concepts were visualized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039778-g010">Figure 10</xref>, which also showed that the bio-geo-temporal model integrated both SS and NT views, producing a better solution.
