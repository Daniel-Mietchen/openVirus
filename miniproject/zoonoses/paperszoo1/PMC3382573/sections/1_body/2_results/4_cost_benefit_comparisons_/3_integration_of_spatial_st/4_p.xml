<p>If, instead, 
 <italic>Network Theory</italic> (NT) was considered, only a 
 <italic>single cluster</italic> would be observed, which would be composed of 
 <italic>4 nodes</italic> (the 4 partially merged 
 <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> observed within the red pentagon, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039778-g010">Figure 10</xref>). In this model, connectivity among nodes could be determined by inside- and outside-node road segments. At least three calculations could then be generated, e.g.: 1) if it was assumed that all within-node cases, of all nodes, would be protected if the 
 <italic>whole area of the cluster</italic> was intervened, the ‘cost’/case would be  = 32970/65 = 
 <bold>507</bold> sq km; 2) if it was assumed that optimal control depends on interventions covering 
 <italic>the area defined by epidemic nodes</italic>, the ‘cost’ would be equal to the surface of nodes #1–4 (17,307 sq km)/number of cases within such nodes (54) or 
 <bold>320.5</bold> sq km/case; or 3) if it was assumed that such intervention would prevent all within-node cases (including those outside the node cluster), then the ‘cost’ would be: the surface of nodes #1–4 (17,307 sq km)/all within-node cases (65) = 
 <bold>266.3</bold> sq km/case.
