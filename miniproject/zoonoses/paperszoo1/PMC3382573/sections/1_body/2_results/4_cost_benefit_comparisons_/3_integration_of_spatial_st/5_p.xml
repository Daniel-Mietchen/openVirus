 <italic>bio-geo-temporal</italic> analysis could integrate both SS advantages (a small area upon which interventions are imposed) and NT advantages (those associated with the application of NT properties, especially, identification of highly influential nodes and directionality). Such model could focus on the most influential node (ranked epidemic node [REN] #1), which had a surface equal to 3019 sq km). If NT holds, an early intervention on such node could prevent all within-node cases (n = 65) at a ‘cost’ of 3019/65 =
