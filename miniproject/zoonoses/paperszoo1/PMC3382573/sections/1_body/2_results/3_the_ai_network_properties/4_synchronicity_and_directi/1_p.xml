<p>The number of

 <italic>epidemic node</italic> was used to rank nodes, e.g., 
 <italic>ranked epidemic node</italic> (REN) # 1 was crossed by the highest number of 
 <italic>infective links</italic>. When RENs were plotted against the number of 
 <italic>epidemic cases/</italic>week, both synchronicity and directionality were observed. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039778-g007">Figure 7a</xref> reveals that nodes of similar rank were engaged at the same time and high RENs were involved before low RENs. The number of 
 <italic>epidemic cases</italic> grew rapidly in REN #1 and, when few or no new cases were reported, nodes of a lower rank (RENs # 2 and 3) became active, which displayed the same pattern and were followed, later, by nodes of an even lower functionality. In contrast, the last class of nodes failed to spread infections: RENs # 8 and 9 only generated one case each (
