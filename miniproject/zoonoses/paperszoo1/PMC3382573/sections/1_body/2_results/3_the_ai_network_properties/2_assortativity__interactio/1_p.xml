<p>Assortativity was visually observed: AI nodes # 1–3 showed the highest number of cases and linked with one another through a continuous ring of short-range road segments (red pentagon,

 <italic>epidemic cases</italic>, i.e., only 9 
 <italic>road intersection areas</italic> –a network composed of circles of radius equal to that of
