<p>In the FMD epizoonotic, the smallest circle that included &gt;50% of the cases, from the second transmission cycle (TC) onward, had a 7.5-km radius, while, in the AI epizoonotic, 31-km radius circles were the smallest that, at all times, included &gt;50% of the cases (

 <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> (Table 1 in Text S1). 
 <italic>Epidemic nodes</italic> included 57.5% (65/113, in AI) and 70% (402/572, in FMD) of all epidemic 
 <italic>cases</italic>. These circles revealed epidemic dynamics: within 3 days (between TC I and TC II), the FMD epicenter (the centroid defined by all 
 <italic>epidemic nodes</italic>) moved 40 km in a SW direction, while the centroid of the AI epizoonotic differed 700 km between the first and the second TC (
