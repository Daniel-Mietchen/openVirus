<p>Because some TC I and TC II 
 <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> overlapped, such nodes were merged. Because FMD data, after TC II, were temporally aggregated, TC-specific node merging could not be conducted after TC II. To explore relationships between merged 
 <italic>nodes</italic> (or 
 <italic>cases</italic>) and 
 <italic>long-range connectivity</italic>, a graph that connected every pair of epidemic 
 <italic>cases</italic> was created. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039778-g002">Figures 2</xref> d and e express high- and low-scale versions of such graph, showing lines here named 
 <italic>infective links</italic>. 
 <italic>Infective link density</italic>/
 <italic>node</italic> (the number of TC I or II 
 <italic>infective links</italic> crossing each [merged or non-merged] 
 <italic>epidemic node</italic>, per sq km) was correlated with overall within-node 
 <italic>case density</italic> (
 <italic>r</italic> = .75,

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039778-g003">Figures 3a and b</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039778.s003">Table S2</xref>). That is, long-range connectivity, measured in the first 10% of the epidemic (days 1–6), predicted the density of cases/sq km found in the last 90% of the epidemic.
