<p>Only one of the 6 FMD 
 <italic>cases</italic> (16.6%) reported in TC I (days 1â€“3) was found within 
 <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039778-g002">Figure 2a</xref>). Therefore, not all primary 
 <italic>cases</italic> were functionally identical: only one was connected. In contrast, in TC II (after the infectious agent had enough time to disseminate), 17 of the 24 cases (71%) were reported within 
 <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039778.s002">Table S1</xref>). Hence, disease spread depended on getting access to a disseminating (connected) network, which was observable at or after TC II, as 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039778-g002">Figure 2b</xref> shows.
