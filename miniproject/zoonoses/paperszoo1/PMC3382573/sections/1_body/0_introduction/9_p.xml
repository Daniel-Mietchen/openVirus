<p>To control epidemics, functional (network theory-based), geographically explicit models that measure both dynamics and connectivity are needed

 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Vespignani1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Calls to study both global and local dynamics –which occur at high and low scales, respectively– have been expressed

 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Vespignani1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Yet, the simple combination of the previous models will not generate what is needed because they focus on contacts (people or animals) and, at the earliest epidemic phase, the number of infected individuals is very low. While air-borne epidemics have been investigated 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Meyers1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Wagner1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, they are atypical because their connecting structure is mobile, and, in air travel-mediated epidemics, reduced to the few yards that separate passengers sharing the same aircraft.
