<p>Therefore, a model that measures epidemic connectivity, is needed. Connectivity relates to, but differs from distance

 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Ellis1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, for instance, two pairs of points, separated by the same Euclidean distance, will differ in connectivity if one pair is separated by a mountain or lake but the other pair is not. Connectivity can modify or be modified by distance, time, and/or neighbors: different geographical sites may behave as nodes at different times; e. g., a factory may act as a node on week days, losing that condition on weekends, when a park may become a node. It has been proposed that, because the network’s architecture influences the global microbial invasion and/or mobility, connectivity needs to be measured and, because connections change over time, geo-temporal data should be assessed
