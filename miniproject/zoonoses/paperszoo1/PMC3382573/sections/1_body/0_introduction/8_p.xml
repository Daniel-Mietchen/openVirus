 <italic>Medical geography</italic> addresses some of the limitations described above. This approach is based on disease maps, today generated with geographical information systems. Such maps may reveal geographical data patterns likely to be missed when only tabular data are considered 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Elliott1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Geographical models are indicated when geographical heterogeneity is documented: when disease clusters (geographical aggregations of cases at higher levels than expected) are observed, homogeneous mixing-based models are not valid 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Picado1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Coupled with spatial statistical analysis, disease maps have attempted not to explain general problems but to be applicable 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Clements1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Potential limitations of this approach include: 1) dependence on a relatively large sample size (rarely available in the early phase of exotic epidemics), and 2) dependence on static processes (a rare event in emerging epidemics, in which, the centroid of disease clusters, may rapidly change).
