<p>In addition, the model should distinguish contact-related from connectivity-related networks, as John Snow did. While both networks are associated, they are not synonymous: while mobile people or animals use non-mobile connecting networks –such as road, water, railroad networks; as well as food networks (e.g., markets) and energy networks (e.g., gas stations)–, such networks are built before they are used by humans and animals. Hence, the properties of connecting networks can be investigated even without data on humans or animals.</p>
