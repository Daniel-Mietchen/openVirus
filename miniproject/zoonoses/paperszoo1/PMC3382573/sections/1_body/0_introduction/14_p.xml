<p>Accordingly, two models were evaluated: 1) one focusing on connectivity (in addition to contacts), and 2) one focusing on contacts, in which connectivity was not explicitly assessed, but neighbors were considered. Both approaches were tested utilizing geo-temporal datasets of emerging or exotic infectious diseases that affect vertebrates. The validity of the connectivity model was evaluated by asking whether network properties were revealed (such as disease clustering, assortatitivy, synchronicity, directionality, and Pareto’s’ 20∶80′ data distribution

The reproducibility was determined by investigating infectious diseases that differed in pathogen, host species, vertebrate class, geography, and time, but shared the fact that all hosts were susceptible prior to microbial invasion. The cost-benefit impact was estimated by comparing, across models, the total number of cases, observed at the end of the study period. By counting the number of cases these models captured, we expected that the role of connectivity could be determined. It was postulated that, if network properties were detected in two episodes of disease dispersal that affected different classes of vertebrates (mammals and birds) and involved different pathogens, it could then be inferred that such properties are independent of infective agent, infected host species, vertebrate class, and spatial location. We hypothesized that, to rapidly disseminate, invading microbes require not only susceptible hosts but also a pre-established connecting structure (e.g., a river network). While many networks may exist, we focused on the one reported to be used most of the time: the road network 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Balcan2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Here we asked, first, whether actual processes of infectious disease dispersal display network properties, and, second, if so, whether a connecting network –that of roads– can influence disease spread.
