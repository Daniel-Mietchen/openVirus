 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Brooks1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. A second reason to be considered is that nature does not offer bio-geo-temporal equivalents of ‘nodes’ and ‘edges’: they should be created and validated. To build such constructs, the model to be created should: 1) utilize low-scale geo-temporal data; 2) consider both short- and long-range connections as well as geo-temporal dynamics, i.e., the geo-temporal progression of the epidemic should be clearly determined; 3) evaluate reproducibility; and 4) facilitate comparisons against alternatives, which may include cost-benefit metrics
