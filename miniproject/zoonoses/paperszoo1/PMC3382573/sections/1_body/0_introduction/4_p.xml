 <italic>Mathematical epidemiology</italic> focuses on hosts. It asks who is in contact with whom.

 <sub>0</sub>
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Breslow1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The R
 <sub>0</sub> is the ratio of secondary cases generated per primary case which, if &gt;1, indicates that the epidemic will disseminate; and, if ≤1, predicts that the epidemic will soon die out 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-May1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This approach has been applied both in endemic and in epidemic diseases

 <sub>0</sub>-related quantities are directly estimated from epidemic data

 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Rivas1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, R
 <sub>0</sub> is usually indirectly estimated, utilizing a process whose validity depends on several assumptions 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. One such assumption is that individuals are homogeneously mixed: the R
 <sub>0</sub> concept may be valid when hosts are in close contact with one another. Yet, R
 <sub>0</sub>-based models, which do not consider low-scale geographical data, have overestimated some epidemics
