<p>Connectivity estimates (e.g., infective links) were calculated with either a proprietary algorithm, 
 <italic>ArcView GIS 3.3</italic>, 
 <italic>ArcGIS Desktop 9.0</italic>, and/or 
 <italic>ArcGis 9.3</italic> (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA). Geographical data and spatial statistical tests were processed with 
 <italic>ArcGis 9.3</italic>. The GIS command 
 <italic>buffer</italic> was utilized to create circles of various radii which were then used to 
 <italic>select by location</italic> the infected farms located inside and outside such circles. The GIS commands 
 <italic>intersect, clip,</italic> and/or 
 <italic>merge</italic> were used to group variables of various shapes (e.g., points and polygons).
