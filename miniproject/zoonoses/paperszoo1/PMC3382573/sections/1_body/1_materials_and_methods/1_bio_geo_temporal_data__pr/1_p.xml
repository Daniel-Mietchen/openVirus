<p>The foot-and-mouth (FMD) and avian influenza H5N1 (AI) epizoonotics here analyzed, affected cows and chickens, respectively. They have been reported before 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Rivas2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Rivas3" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Geographical data included: 1) point (epidemic cases), 2) line (roads), and 3) surface (population density) data. An 
 <italic>epidemic case</italic> was defined as any farm where, based on laboratory tests, at least one animal was diagnosed as infected. 
 <italic>Epidemic day</italic> reflected the relative time, within the epizoonotic, when a case was reported. The analyzed datasets differed: while the FMD dataset included data on the location and size of infected and non-infected farms, the AI dataset did not include data on non-infected farms. While the AI dataset included temporal data on daily basis for all observations, the FMD dataset had aggregate temporal data between epidemic days 7 and 60.
