<p>An 
 <italic>infective link</italic> was any segment of an Euclidean graph that connected pairs of 
 <italic>epidemic cases</italic>. Depending on the location of such cases and/or the relative location of 
 <italic>epidemic nodes, infective links</italic> estimated long-range connectivity. When 
 <italic>cases</italic> were outside 
 <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> and there was no 
 <italic>epidemic node</italic> between 
 <italic>cases</italic>, 
 <italic>infective links</italic> did not involve 
 <italic>epidemic nodes</italic>. However, when either 
 <italic>epidemic cases</italic> were located within 
 <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> or such nodes were located between pairs of 
 <italic>cases</italic>, 
 <italic>infective links</italic> crossed 
 <italic>epidemic nodes</italic>: in such situations, the number of 
 <italic>infective links</italic> crossing a nodeâ€™s surface estimated long-range node degrees
