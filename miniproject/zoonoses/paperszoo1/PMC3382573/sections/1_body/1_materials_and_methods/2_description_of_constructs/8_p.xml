<p>The difference between the two models was connectivity: not measured in the contact model, measured in the connectivity model. While the contact model focused on a post-outbreak variable (contacts, e.g., neighbors), the connectivity model assessed a pre-outbreak variable (roads). While the contact model evaluated circles centered on infected sites, the connectivity model investigated circles centered on the road network. While roads could be captured by the contact model, such inclusion was not intentional: the contact model, per se, did not measure connectivity. While the connectivity model measured contacts, the contact model did not consider how infected and susceptible individuals could be linked outside the original cluster: the contact model inherently assumed that the invading agent could jump from one place to another without using a geographically continuous, observable path. While disease spread may be mediated by wind, air travel, or migratory birds
