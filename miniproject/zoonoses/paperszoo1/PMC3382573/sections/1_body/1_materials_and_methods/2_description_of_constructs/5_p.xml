 <italic>Node rank</italic> was the number of 
 <italic>infective link(s)</italic> that intersected each 
 <italic>epidemic node</italic>, where ‘rank 1’ identified the node crossed by the largest number of 
 <italic>infective links</italic> and ‘rank n’ was the node crossed by the smallest number of such links. It was assumed that all 
 <italic>infective links</italic> were available from day 1 onward 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Therefore, node degrees were assessed with indicators that estimated short- and long-range connectivity: 
 <italic>road segments</italic> and 
 <italic>infective links</italic>, respectively.
