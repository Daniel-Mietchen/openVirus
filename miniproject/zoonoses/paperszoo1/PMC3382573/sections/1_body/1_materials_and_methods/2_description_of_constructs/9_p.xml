<p>Borrowing metrics from civil engineering, connectivity was described by length, continuity, and/or proximity 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. 
 <italic>Proximity</italic> was defined as the Euclidean distance between pairs of road intersections. 
 <italic>Length</italic> referred to that of road segments. 
 <italic>Continuity</italic> described the degree of fragmentation, if any, the road segments found in epidemic nodes could reveal. By superimposing the layers described above, additional digital and graphic data were created.
