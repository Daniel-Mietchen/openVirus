<p>The 
 <italic>epidemic node</italic> was defined as the smallest circle that included: 1) &gt;50% of all 
 <italic>cases</italic> reported per viral transmission cycle (TC), except TC I 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Rivas3" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, and 2) a 
 <italic>highway intersection</italic>. The reason why the smallest possible circle was measured is due to the finite dimensions of the Earth: the number of nodes is inversely related to their size (if the radius of the node were as large as that of this planet, there would be only one node and no links). The reason why data reported in TC I were not considered was that no disease dispersal has yet occurred at that time, i.e., in order to disseminate over space, a pathogen needs a time period equal to, or longer than one TC. We considered the TC of the FMD virus to be 3 days and that of the AI virus to be 2 days 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Rivas2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Rivas3" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Assuming that 
 <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> were circular, their critical radius was determined by counting, at each TC, the number of cases located inside and outside circles of various radii 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Rivas3" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. While 
 <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> always included 
 <italic>cases</italic>, 
 <italic>cases</italic> could also be found outside such 
 <italic>nodes</italic>.
