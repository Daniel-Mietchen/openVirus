<p>While the validity of 
 <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> and 
 <italic>infective links</italic> was supported, their limitations should not be ignored. 
 <italic>Infective links</italic> assumed that connectivity remains constant over the course of an epidemic, which is unlikely 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Rocha1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. While 
 <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> detected ‘along-road’ disease clusters even if they were not independent –an advantage over classic approaches 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Choo1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>–, such nodes, here assumed to be circular, may not be realistic. To improve such constructs, future studies may consider non-circular and non-Euclidean metrics, such as 
 <italic>road segments</italic> and the 
 <italic>road length</italic> associated with each node –here measured but only partially evaluated.
