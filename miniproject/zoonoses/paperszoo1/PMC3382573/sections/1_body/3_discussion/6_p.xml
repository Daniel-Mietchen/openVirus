<p>The highly connected 
 <italic>disease clusters</italic> found within 
 <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> differed from both spatial statistical (SS) and Network Theory (NT) definitions. In SS, a 
 <italic>cluster</italic> denotes a spatial aggregation of 
 <italic>epidemic cases</italic> (point data, in this study), of unknown connectivity, which may or may not be located within 
 <italic>epidemic nodes</italic>. In NT, a cluster refers to groups of 
 <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> (circles, in this study) connected by 
 <italic>road segments</italic>. In other words, the NT version of a cluster, which is based on the clustering coefficient 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Fuller1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, is geographically larger than the SS version. On the other hand, the SS version of a cluster cannot identify critical nodes.
