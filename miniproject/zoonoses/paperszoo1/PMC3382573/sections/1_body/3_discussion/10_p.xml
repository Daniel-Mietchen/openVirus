<p>Such geo-temporal information was provided in this study because 
 <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> were distinguished. Node differentiation was possible because connectivity was not regarded to be synonymous with mobility. While the non-geographical literature assumes that mobility (the movement of people or animals, i.e., ‘contacts’) is equal to connectivity, that literature does not assess the structure that facilitates mobility. While ‘contacts’ are mobile, the connecting structure (e.g., the riverbed of a river network) is not. This distinction has practical effects: because in early disease dissemination phases, the number of infected ‘contacts’ (mobile individuals) is close to zero, the ‘contact’ version of connectivity (mobility) cannot be applied at such time. However, because there is no shortage of data on the connecting network (e. g., a road network), early and geographically contextualized calculations can be implemented when the focus of the analysis –and that of interventions– is the non-mobile connecting network, as John Snow did.
