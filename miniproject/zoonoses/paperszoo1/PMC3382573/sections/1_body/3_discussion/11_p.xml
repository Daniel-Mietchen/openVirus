<p>The fact that network properties may be observed in rapidly disseminating infectious diseases, in which the number of early cases is marginal –when information is most needed–means that, instead of focusing on the host (e.g., case counts), better decisions could be made if based on connectivity. To that end, Network Theory concepts were adjusted to bio-geo-temporal formats. To facilitate cost-benefit analyses, the definitions of 
 <italic>epidemic node</italic> and 
 <italic>disease cluster</italic> differed from those of Network Theory (NT). While nodes, in NT, are defined as dimensionless points 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Dale1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, 
 <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> were defined as surfaces (the smallest circle containing most cases). While, in NT, ‘cluster’ refers to sets of ‘nodes’, here overlapping nodes were merged, i.e., a 
 <italic>disease cluster</italic> involved both 
 <italic>cases</italic> and 
 <italic>nodes</italic>. Such adjustments of NT concepts to bio-geographical realities generated both the lowest cost (interventions applied to the smallest circle) and the highest benefit (more epidemic cases could be prevented), as 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039778-g010">figure 10</xref> shows. Because pre-outbreak data significantly correlated with post-outbreak findings, such as the positive and significant relationship found between 
 <italic>infective link density/node</italic> and 
 <italic>case density</italic>, if geo-referenced data on all susceptible sites –farms, in this study– were available, bio-geographical variables could, potentially, be measured before a microbial invasion occurs.
