<p>These different definitions and limitations were visually observed. For instance, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039778-g010">Figure 10</xref> displays either a 
 <italic>single cluster</italic> composed of 4 epidemic nodes –the NT version of a cluster (red pentagon)–, or, in the SS version, 
 <italic>6 clusters</italic> (the 6 epidemic nodes that include, each, two or more cases). While compatible with both the SS and NT approaches, the bio-geo-temporal model was more informative: if two disease clusters displayed identical SS indices (e.g., Moran’s I) or identical NT cluster coefficients 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Carpenter1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, the bio-geo-temporal approach could distinguish them in terms of 
 <italic>continuity</italic>, 
 <italic>long-range connectivity</italic>, 
 <italic>proximity</italic>, and/or 
 <italic>transmission cycle</italic>.
