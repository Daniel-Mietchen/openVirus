<p>Both epizoonotics revealed highly organized data structures 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Fortunato1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. In spite of differences in microbial agent, host species, vertebrate class, time, and geographical location, five network properties –disease clustering, assortative mixing, synchronicity, directionality, and Pareto’s pattern– were observed, which seemed to be highly conserved. Disease dispersal was better explained by the connectivity-based model: after TC II, this model captured twice as many cases as, and displayed a less fragmented and longer length of road segments than the contact model. Connectivity also distinguished functional classes of primary cases, nodes, and networks.
