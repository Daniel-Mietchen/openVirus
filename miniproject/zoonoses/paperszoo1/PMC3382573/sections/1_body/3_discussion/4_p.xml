<p>The connectivity model revealed that not all 
 <italic>primary cases</italic> were connected. That finding may explain why, in the past, R
 <sub>0</sub> has overestimated some epidemics 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Mercer1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>: the inclusion of non-connected cases overestimates the number of primary cases. Because, in emerging infections (when all hosts are susceptible), secondary cases can only be generated by some of the primary case(s), tertiary cases can only be produced by primary or secondary cases and so on 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-AndersonR1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, it follows that epidemic cases are neither independent nor functionally identical: connected 
 <italic>primary cases</italic> are much more influential than any later case. Instead of interventions based on identical control zones, centered on the location of all earlier cases –i.e., the contact model, which assumes that all earlier cases have an identical probability of disseminating the infection to their neighbors–, interventions could consider connected primary cases.
