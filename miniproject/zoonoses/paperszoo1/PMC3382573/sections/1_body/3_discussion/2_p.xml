<p>The enhanced discrimination achieved by the connectivity model was attributable to the use of two indicators: 
 <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> and 
 <italic>infective links</italic>. With these constructs, what previously seemed to lack ‘order’, became interpretable and revealed a major property of biological systems: 
 <italic>emergence</italic> (‘order’ or a high-level function 
 <xref rid="pone.0039778-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>). For instance, 
 <italic>emergence</italic> was observed when the weekly number of 
 <italic>epidemic cases</italic> was plotted vs. the rank of 
 <italic>epidemic nodes</italic>. The plot shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039778-g007">Figure 7a</xref> documents that the time, number, and place of case occurrence were not random events but the result of 
 <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> differentiated by 
 <italic>infective links</italic>.
