  <title>Three cost-benefit perspectives.</title>
  <p>The AI data allowed the generation of three sets of metrics, potentially applicable in cost-benefit analyses. 1) While the 
   <italic>spatial statistical</italic> (SS) model identified 
   <italic>6 disease clusters</italic> (the 6 
   <italic>epidemic nodes</italic>, of which two partially overlapped, which are seen, within the red pentagon, as 4 circles or ovals, of different colors), because the SS approach does not offer information on directionality, control measures should consider every 
   <italic>epidemic node</italic>, i.e., the overall ‘cost’ of an intervention would be equal to the sum of the areas of the 6 original epidemic nodes included in the red pentagon. 2) If a 
   <italic>Network Theory</italic> (NT) perspective were considered, only a 
   <italic>single cluster</italic> would be observed (the area included within the red pentagon, which is defined by nodes and edges [road segments]). The NT model may generate several cost-benefit metrics. 3) A 
   <italic>bio-geo-temporal</italic> analysis can integrate both SS advantages (a small area) and NT advantages (identification of the most influential node, based on analysis of network properties). The bio-geo-temporal model can generate the lowest ‘cost’ (smallest area to be intervened per each prevented case). Calculations are reported in the text.
