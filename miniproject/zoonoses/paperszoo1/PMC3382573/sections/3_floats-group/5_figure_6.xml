  <title>Differentiation of AI epidemic nodes based on AI infective links.</title>
  <p>After overlapping 
   <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> were merged, they were distinguished according to the number of 
   <italic>infective links</italic> that crossed their surfaces (A). The 
   <italic>density of infective links/node</italic> was so high in nodes # 1–4 that the color used to identify each node’s circle is not observed: only the color of the crossing (overlaying) 
   <italic>infective links</italic> is noticed in such nodes. The density of 
   <italic>infective links/epidemic node</italic> (infective links/sq km) decayed by a factor greater than 5 between node #1 and the following set of nodes (nodes # 2 to 4), by a factor of ∼3 between nodes # 2–4 and the set that included nodes #5 and 6, and by a factor of ∼2 between nodes # 5 and 6 and the remaining nodes. A significant positive correlation was found between the 
   <italic>infective link density/sq km</italic> and the 
   <italic>case density/sq km</italic> (
   <italic>r</italic> = .98, 
   <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, B). An enlarged view of one AI epidemic node (red box, A), is shown in C.
