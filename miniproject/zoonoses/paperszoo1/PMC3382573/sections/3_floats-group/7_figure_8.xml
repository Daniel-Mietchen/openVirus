  <title>Comparison between connectivity and contact modelsâ€“the FMD epizoonotic.</title>
  <p>After TC I, 
   <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> centered on the road network (the 
   <italic>connectivity model</italic>) showed twice as many cases as circles of equal radius that did not consider the road network (the 
   <italic>contact model</italic>): while 360 cases were reported within epidemic nodes (A), 181 cases were found within the same time frame in the neighborhood of earlier cases (B). Longer 
   <italic>road length</italic> and less fragmentated road segments were associated with the connectivity model (C) than with the contact model (D).
