  <title>Relationships between pre- and post-outbreak variables in FMD.</title>
  <p>Because some TC I and TC II epidemic nodes overlapped, they were merged. Merging resulted in a total of 9 (one in TC I, 8 in TC II) node clusters (A). The hypothesis that the number of infective links crossing each node cluster preceded case occurrence was supported by the data: the correlation between 
   <italic>infective link density</italic> (number of infective links crossing epidemic nodes, per sq km, observed at TC I and TC II) and within-node 
   <italic>case density</italic> (cases reported by epidemic day 60, expressed on a per sq km basis) was positive and significant (
   <italic>r</italic> = .75, 
   <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.02, B). 
   <italic>Early</italic> variables (
   <italic>infective links</italic> observed in the first 10% of the epidemic progression [days 1–6] predicted 
   <italic>late</italic> outcomes (within-node case density, observed in the last 90% of the epidemic [days 7–60]).
