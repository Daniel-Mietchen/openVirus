  <title>Detection of ‘along-road’ disease clusters and empirical determination of 
   <italic>epidemic nodes</italic>.
  </title>
  <p>Maps show high-scale geographical data of the 2001 Uruguayan FMD (A) and the 2006 Nigerian AI H5N1 (B) epizoonotics. Low-scale data revealed that epidemic cases not only displayed spatial auto-correlation but also clustered along the road network (C, D).The radii of 
   <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> (the smallest circles that included one or more highway intersections[s] and epidemic cases, at any viral transmission cycle [TC] except TC I) were 7.5 -km (FMD, E) and 31-km long (AI, F). In both epizoonotics, &gt;57% of all cases occurred within epidemic nodes (A, B, E, F).
