  <title>Differentiation of epidemic cases, detection of network properties, and estimation of long-range connectivity in the FMD epizoonotic.</title>
  <p>Not all primary FMD cases –those reported in the first transmission cycle or TC– were located within circles that included a highway intersection: only one the first 6 primary cases was connected (A). In contrast, at or after TC II, most cases were connected: they were within epidemic nodes. Some epidemic nodes included a much higher proportion of cases than average nodes, e.g., 8 epidemic nodes included 115 of all 402 within-node cases (B). Those 8 nodes were located in an area characterized by a high density of road segments (box, A). Such nodes revealed assortativity (selective connection among similar nodes) as well as Pareto’s “20∶80″ pattern: 8 of the 157 nodes connected at or after TC II (5% of all nodes) reported 23% of all cases (132/572), i. e., these nodes included 4.6 times (23/5) more cases than average nodes (B, C). To estimate long-range connectivity, a graph was made, which connected every pair of 
   <italic>epidemic cases</italic> with Euclidean lines, here named 
   <italic>infective links</italic> (D). A low-scale map shows 
   <italic>infective links</italic> crossing 3 partially overlapping 
   <italic>epidemic nodes</italic>, which include one 
   <italic>case</italic> (E).
