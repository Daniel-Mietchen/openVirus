  <title>Differentiation of epidemic cases, detection of network properties, and estimation of long-range connectivity in the AI epizoonotic.</title>
  <p>Low-scale data revealed that one primary AI 
   <italic>case</italic> was located close to but outside the connecting structure defined by 
   <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> (A). In contrast, at or after TC II, most cases were found within epidemic nodes (B). Two 
   <italic>clusters</italic> of 
   <italic>cases</italic> were observed (red polygons, B). Some 
   <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> displayed a much higher proportion of cases than average nodes, e.g., two nodes (nodes # 1 and 2, red pentagon, B) accounted for 46 (or 71%) of all within-node cases. Four 
   <italic>road intersection areas</italic>, out of 16 (or 25%) included 80% (52/65) of all within-node 
   <italic>cases</italic> (C). To estimate long-range connectivity, all pairs of epidemic cases were connected with Euclidean lines, conforming a graph of N * (N –1)/2 lines, where N = epidemic case (an infected farm), or (113 * 112)/2 = 6328 
   <italic>infective links</italic> (D).
