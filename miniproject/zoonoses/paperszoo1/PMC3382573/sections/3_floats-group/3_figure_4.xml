  <p>Farm density was used as a proxy variable for animal density. The 
   <italic>temporal connectivity</italic> (
   <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> per 
   <italic>TC</italic>) was positively correlated with the 
   <italic>temporal farm density</italic> (characterized by size classes and measured per TC): over time, the greater the number of farms –which were smaller and raised more animals/sq km–, the greater the number of connected epidemic nodes found per TC (A). In spite of the observed correlation, a highly fractured (heterogenous) geographical distribution was observed (B, C). A subset of the whole epidemic region (indicated in a box shown in panel B) is displayed in panel C, which reports, numerically, the data of the region under study. Findings document that post-outbreak data (
   <italic>cases</italic>, 
   <italic>epidemic nodes</italic>) can be linked to pre-outbreak (population, connectivity) data.
