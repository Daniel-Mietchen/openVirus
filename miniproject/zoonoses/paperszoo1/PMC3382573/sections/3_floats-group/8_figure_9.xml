  <title>Comparison between connectivity and contact modelsâ€“the AI epizoonotic.</title>
  <p>The AI dispersal process was similar to that of the FMD epidemic diffusion: after transmission cycle (TC) I, the connectivity model captured twice as many cases than the contact model (A, B). The length of road segments found within the area determined by the connectivity model was three times longer and less fragmented than the road structure captured by the contact model (C, D).</p>
