In both epizoonotics, 1) not all primary cases were connected but at least one primary case was connected, 2) highly connected, small areas (nodes) accounted for most cases, 3) several classes of nodes were distinguished, and 4) the contact model, which assumed all primary cases were identical, captured half the number of cases identified by the connectivity model.

Snow integrated what, today, could be described as medicine, statistics, geography, civil engineering, and cost-benefit analysis: he mapped London&#x02019;s water network and, with simple graphs, quantified the number of cholera cases associated with specific households (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Snow-cholera-map.jpg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Snow-cholera-map.jpg</ext-link>). That led him to geographically identify the water pump suspected to be contaminated. By removing the handle of the pump &#x02013;leaving it non-operational&#x02013;, he stopped the epidemic.</p><p>He did not intervene on people. He did not intervene on the pathogen. He intervened on a physical structure that connected susceptible hosts with the microbe &#x02013;the water distribution network&#x02013; and did so before infections could occur. Snow acted on connectivity, a concept related to, but independent from both the infectious agent and the susceptible host.</p><p>His example provides a reference against which views on how epidemics spread can be analyzed. Hoping that a review of fields involved in epidemiology may identify unmet research needs, the contents of mathematical epidemiology and medical geography are summarized.</p><p>
<italic>Mathematical epidemiology</italic> focuses on hosts. It asks who is in contact with whom. <xref rid="pone.0039778-Colizza1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039778-Danon1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This field began in 1908, when Sir Ronald Ross, after discovering that mosquitoes transmit malaria, defined the &#x02018;critical mosquito density&#x02019; (later known as the basic reproductive number, or R<sub>0</sub>
<xref rid="pone.0039778-Breslow1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The R<sub>0</sub> is the ratio of secondary cases generated per primary case which, if &#x0003e;1, indicates that the epidemic will disseminate; and, if &#x02264;1, predicts that the epidemic will soon die out <xref rid="pone.0039778-May1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This approach has been applied both in endemic and in epidemic diseases <xref rid="pone.0039778-Rvachev1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039778-Longini1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. While, in some cases, this quantity or R<sub>0</sub>-related quantities are directly estimated from epidemic data <xref rid="pone.0039778-Haydon1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039778-Rivas1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, R<sub>0</sub> is usually indirectly estimated, utilizing a process whose validity depends on several assumptions <xref rid="pone.0039778-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. One such assumption is that individuals are homogeneously mixed: the R<sub>0</sub> concept may be valid when hosts are in close contact with one another. Yet, R<sub>0</sub>-based models, which do not consider low-scale geographical data, have overestimated some epidemics <xref rid="pone.0039778-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0039778-Nishiura1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Other mathematical approaches have focused on <italic>social structure</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0039778-Colizza1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. They consider sub-populations suspected to be the target of the epidemic, which could be under-estimated if the highest scale (the total population) is measured but no stratification is conducted <xref rid="pone.0039778-Liljeros1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Variations of this approach assess groups, e.g., family members, co-workers, and schoolmates <xref rid="pone.0039778-Colizza1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. These models do not consider geographical data.</p><p>A third group of mathematical models has explored <italic>networks</italic>. They do not assume that the population is homogeneously mixed. Instead, they consider the relative location of each individual (a &#x02018;node&#x02019; or vertex, which may be represented by a circle or point), and contacts between individuals (&#x02018;links&#x02019; or &#x02018;edges&#x02019;, e.g., a line that connects two nodes <xref rid="pone.0039778-Watts1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0039778-Newman1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>). While network models are usually labeled &#x02018;spatial&#x02019;, typically, they lack geographic data <xref rid="pone.0039778-Parham1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>
<italic>Social network analysis</italic> (SNA) is one exception to the previous statement. This approach may include geographically explicit data, as well as temporal data. It determines the location of individuals (&#x02018;nodes&#x02019;) and the time and duration of contacts <xref rid="pone.0039778-MartinezLopez1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. SNA has demonstrated that temporal structures may influence epidemics in several ways <xref rid="pone.0039778-Rocha1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. SNA has been reported to: 1) risk missing data on connections <xref rid="pone.0039778-Rocha1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and 2) be sensitive to dynamic changes <xref rid="pone.0039778-Uddin1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>
<italic>Medical geography</italic> addresses some of the limitations described above. This approach is based on disease maps, today generated with geographical information systems. Such maps may reveal geographical data patterns likely to be missed when only tabular data are considered <xref rid="pone.0039778-Elliott1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Geographical models are indicated when geographical heterogeneity is documented: when disease clusters (geographical aggregations of cases at higher levels than expected) are observed, homogeneous mixing-based models are not valid <xref rid="pone.0039778-Picado1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Coupled with spatial statistical analysis, disease maps have attempted not to explain general problems but to be applicable <xref rid="pone.0039778-Clements1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Potential limitations of this approach include: 1) dependence on a relatively large sample size (rarely available in the early phase of exotic epidemics), and 2) dependence on static processes (a rare event in emerging epidemics, in which, the centroid of disease clusters, may rapidly change).</p><p>To control epidemics, functional (network theory-based), geographically explicit models that measure both dynamics and connectivity are needed <xref rid="pone.0039778-Remais1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039778-Woolhouse1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0039778-Vespignani1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Calls to study both global and local dynamics &#x02013;which occur at high and low scales, respectively&#x02013; have been expressed <xref rid="pone.0039778-Picado1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039778-Vespignani1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Yet, the simple combination of the previous models will not generate what is needed because they focus on contacts (people or animals) and, at the earliest epidemic phase, the number of infected individuals is very low. While air-borne epidemics have been investigated <xref rid="pone.0039778-Meyers1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039778-Wagner1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, they are atypical because their connecting structure is mobile, and, in air travel-mediated epidemics, reduced to the few yards that separate passengers sharing the same aircraft.</p><p>Therefore, a model that measures epidemic connectivity, is needed. Connectivity relates to, but differs from distance <xref rid="pone.0039778-Kretzschmar1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0039778-Ellis1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, for instance, two pairs of points, separated by the same Euclidean distance, will differ in connectivity if one pair is separated by a mountain or lake but the other pair is not. Connectivity can modify or be modified by distance, time, and/or neighbors: different geographical sites may behave as nodes at different times; e. g., a factory may act as a node on week days, losing that condition on weekends, when a park may become a node. It has been proposed that, because the network&#x02019;s architecture influences the global microbial invasion and/or mobility, connectivity needs to be measured and, because connections change over time, geo-temporal data should be assessed <xref rid="pone.0039778-Durrett1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039778-Balcan1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. These propositions have been documented: road or river networks can promote or delay disease spread <xref rid="pone.0039778-Lambin1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039778-Rivas2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0039778-Gurarie1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.</p><p>While several authors have called for methods that integrate network analysis with geographical data <xref rid="pone.0039778-Rocha1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039778-Lambin1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039778-Barthelemy1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, the lack of low-scale geo-referenced data has been mentioned as an impediment <xref rid="pone.0039778-Eubank1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039778-Brooks1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. A second reason to be considered is that nature does not offer bio-geo-temporal equivalents of &#x02018;nodes&#x02019; and &#x02018;edges&#x02019;: they should be created and validated. To build such constructs, the model to be created should: 1) utilize low-scale geo-temporal data; 2) consider both short- and long-range connections as well as geo-temporal dynamics, i.e., the geo-temporal progression of the epidemic should be clearly determined; 3) evaluate reproducibility; and 4) facilitate comparisons against alternatives, which may include cost-benefit metrics <xref rid="pone.0039778-Woolhouse1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039778-Balcan2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039778-deOliveira1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>.</p><p>In addition, the model should distinguish contact-related from connectivity-related networks, as John Snow did. While both networks are associated, they are not synonymous: while mobile people or animals use non-mobile connecting networks &#x02013;such as road, water, railroad networks; as well as food networks (e.g., markets) and energy networks (e.g., gas stations)&#x02013;, such networks are built before they are used by humans and animals. Hence, the properties of connecting networks can be investigated even without data on humans or animals.</p><p>However, the physical connecting network, per se, is not the concept of interest: measuring roads or railroads, alone, will not provide information usable to control epidemics. The network of interest is dynamic and much larger: it involves <italic>bio-geo-temporal connecting interactions</italic>.</p><p>Accordingly, two models were evaluated: 1) one focusing on connectivity (in addition to contacts), and 2) one focusing on contacts, in which connectivity was not explicitly assessed, but neighbors were considered. Both approaches were tested utilizing geo-temporal datasets of emerging or exotic infectious diseases that affect vertebrates. The validity of the connectivity model was evaluated by asking whether network properties were revealed (such as disease clustering, assortatitivy, synchronicity, directionality, and Pareto&#x02019;s&#x02019; 20&#x02236;80&#x02032; data distribution <xref rid="pone.0039778-Meyers1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039778-Watts1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039778-Girvan1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039778-Badham1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>). The reproducibility was determined by investigating infectious diseases that differed in pathogen, host species, vertebrate class, geography, and time, but shared the fact that all hosts were susceptible prior to microbial invasion. The cost-benefit impact was estimated by comparing, across models, the total number of cases, observed at the end of the study period. By counting the number of cases these models captured, we expected that the role of connectivity could be determined. It was postulated that, if network properties were detected in two episodes of disease dispersal that affected different classes of vertebrates (mammals and birds) and involved different pathogens, it could then be inferred that such properties are independent of infective agent, infected host species, vertebrate class, and spatial location. We hypothesized that, to rapidly disseminate, invading microbes require not only susceptible hosts but also a pre-established connecting structure (e.g., a river network). While many networks may exist, we focused on the one reported to be used most of the time: the road network <xref rid="pone.0039778-Balcan2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Here we asked, first, whether actual processes of infectious disease dispersal display network properties, and, second, if so, whether a connecting network &#x02013;that of roads&#x02013; can influence disease spread.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Bio-geo-temporal Data (Primary Variables)</title><p>The foot-and-mouth (FMD) and avian influenza H5N1 (AI) epizoonotics here analyzed, affected cows and chickens, respectively. They have been reported before <xref rid="pone.0039778-Rivas2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039778-Rivas3" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Geographical data included: 1) point (epidemic cases), 2) line (roads), and 3) surface (population density) data. An <italic>epidemic case</italic> was defined as any farm where, based on laboratory tests, at least one animal was diagnosed as infected. <italic>Epidemic day</italic> reflected the relative time, within the epizoonotic, when a case was reported. The analyzed datasets differed: while the FMD dataset included data on the location and size of infected and non-infected farms, the AI dataset did not include data on non-infected farms. While the AI dataset included temporal data on daily basis for all observations, the FMD dataset had aggregate temporal data between epidemic days 7 and 60.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Description of Constructs (Secondary Variables)</title><p>The <italic>epidemic node</italic> was defined as the smallest circle that included: 1) &#x0003e;50% of all <italic>cases</italic> reported per viral transmission cycle (TC), except TC I <xref rid="pone.0039778-Rivas3" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, and 2) a <italic>highway intersection</italic>. The reason why the smallest possible circle was measured is due to the finite dimensions of the Earth: the number of nodes is inversely related to their size (if the radius of the node were as large as that of this planet, there would be only one node and no links). The reason why data reported in TC I were not considered was that no disease dispersal has yet occurred at that time, i.e., in order to disseminate over space, a pathogen needs a time period equal to, or longer than one TC. We considered the TC of the FMD virus to be 3 days and that of the AI virus to be 2 days <xref rid="pone.0039778-Rivas2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039778-Rivas3" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Assuming that <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> were circular, their critical radius was determined by counting, at each TC, the number of cases located inside and outside circles of various radii <xref rid="pone.0039778-Rivas3" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. While <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> always included <italic>cases</italic>, <italic>cases</italic> could also be found outside such <italic>nodes</italic>.</p><p>
<italic>Highway intersection areas</italic> were circles of radius equal to that of <italic>epidemic nodes</italic>, centered on intersections. They shared all aspects of <italic>epidemic nodes</italic>, except <italic>epidemic cases</italic>.</p><p>
<italic>Road segments</italic> (lines) were components of the road network.

Disease dispersal was better explained by the connectivity-based model: after TC II, this model captured twice as many cases as, and displayed a less fragmented and longer length of road segments than the contact model. Connectivity also distinguished functional classes of primary cases, nodes, and networks.</p><p>The enhanced discrimination achieved by the connectivity model was attributable to the use of two indicators: <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> and <italic>infective links</italic>. With these constructs, what previously seemed to lack &#x02018;order&#x02019;, became interpretable and revealed a major property of biological systems: <italic>emergence</italic> (&#x02018;order&#x02019; or a high-level function <xref rid="pone.0039778-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>). For instance, <italic>emergence</italic> was observed when the weekly number of <italic>epidemic cases</italic> was plotted vs. the rank of <italic>epidemic nodes</italic>. The plot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039778-g007">Figure 7a</xref> documents that the time, number, and place of case occurrence were not random events but the result of <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> differentiated by <italic>infective links</italic>.</p><p>The indicators evaluated only partially related to definitions utilized in spatial statistics (SS) and Network Theory (NT). There were differences between or among: 1) &#x02018;spatial&#x02019; and &#x02018;geographic&#x02019;, 2) &#x02018;mobility&#x02019; and &#x02018;connectivity&#x02019;, 3) &#x02018;nodes&#x02019; (as defined in NT) and <italic>epidemic nodes</italic>, 4) &#x02018;links&#x02019; (node degrees, as defined in NT) and <italic>infective links</italic>, 5) &#x02018;clusters&#x02019; (as defined in SS and NT) and <italic>disease clusters</italic>, and 6) classes of <italic>primary cases</italic>, <italic>networks,</italic> and <italic>epidemic nodes</italic>.</p><p>The connectivity model revealed that not all <italic>primary cases</italic> were connected. That finding may explain why, in the past, R<sub>0</sub> has overestimated some epidemics <xref rid="pone.0039778-Mercer1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>: the inclusion of non-connected cases overestimates the number of primary cases. Because, in emerging infections (when all hosts are susceptible), secondary cases can only be generated by some of the primary case(s), tertiary cases can only be produced by primary or secondary cases and so on <xref rid="pone.0039778-AndersonR1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, it follows that epidemic cases are neither independent nor functionally identical: connected <italic>primary cases</italic> are much more influential than any later case. Instead of interventions based on identical control zones, centered on the location of all earlier cases &#x02013;i.e., the contact model, which assumes that all earlier cases have an identical probability of disseminating the infection to their neighbors&#x02013;, interventions could consider connected primary cases.</p><p>The data also differentiated several networks, which may overlay and interact with one another <xref rid="pone.0039778-Funk1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. While related, they were not identical: the <italic>epidemic node</italic> network did not include all road intersections, and the <italic>road intersection area</italic> network did not include all cases.</p><p>The highly connected <italic>disease clusters</italic> found within <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> differed from both spatial statistical (SS) and Network Theory (NT) definitions. In SS, a <italic>cluster</italic> denotes a spatial aggregation of <italic>epidemic cases</italic> (point data, in this study), of unknown connectivity, which may or may not be located within <italic>epidemic nodes</italic>. In NT, a cluster refers to groups of <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> (circles, in this study) connected by <italic>road segments</italic>. In other words, the NT version of a cluster, which is based on the clustering coefficient <xref rid="pone.0039778-Fuller1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, is geographically larger than the SS version. On the other hand, the SS version of a cluster cannot identify critical nodes.</p><p>These different definitions and limitations were visually observed. For instance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039778-g010">Figure 10</xref> displays either a <italic>single cluster</italic> composed of 4 epidemic nodes &#x02013;the NT version of a cluster (red pentagon)&#x02013;, or, in the SS version, <italic>6 clusters</italic> (the 6 epidemic nodes that include, each, two or more cases). While compatible with both the SS and NT approaches, the bio-geo-temporal model was more informative: if two disease clusters displayed identical SS indices (e.g., Moran&#x02019;s I) or identical NT cluster coefficients <xref rid="pone.0039778-Carpenter1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, the bio-geo-temporal approach could distinguish them in terms of <italic>continuity</italic>, <italic>long-range connectivity</italic>, <italic>proximity</italic>, and/or <italic>transmission cycle</italic>.</p><p>Because classic NT models only consider tabular and continuous data, critical geographical features &#x02013;which may be fragmented or discontinuous&#x02013; may be missed. Such features can be measured by the <italic>bio-geo-temporal</italic> approach which, it addition, can estimate both directionality (not measured by SS models) and low- and high-scale geographical variables (not measured by NT models). Because the bio-geo-temporal model also revealed disease clusters with outbound flows, earlier views on disease clusters, which assume disease clusters are only recipients of infective flows <xref rid="pone.0039778-Kostova1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, could be revised.</p><p>Differentiating the functional role of epidemic nodes is crucial to identify not only where, but also when an intervention can be most successful. Defining the &#x02018;critical response time&#x02019; (time available to implement an intervention and achieve the results such intervention promotes <xref rid="pone.0039778-Rivas1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>) is meaningful only if associated with information on where control measures can be applied.</p><p>Such geo-temporal information was provided in this study because <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> were distinguished. Node differentiation was possible because connectivity was not regarded to be synonymous with mobility. While the non-geographical literature assumes that mobility (the movement of people or animals, i.e., &#x02018;contacts&#x02019;) is equal to connectivity, that literature does not assess the structure that facilitates mobility. While &#x02018;contacts&#x02019; are mobile, the connecting structure (e.g., the riverbed of a river network) is not. This distinction has practical effects: because in early disease dissemination phases, the number of infected &#x02018;contacts&#x02019; (mobile individuals) is close to zero, the &#x02018;contact&#x02019; version of connectivity (mobility) cannot be applied at such time. However, because there is no shortage of data on the connecting network (e. g., a road network), early and geographically contextualized calculations can be implemented when the focus of the analysis &#x02013;and that of interventions&#x02013; is the non-mobile connecting network, as John Snow did.</p><p>The fact that network properties may be observed in rapidly disseminating infectious diseases, in which the number of early cases is marginal &#x02013;when information is most needed&#x02013;means that, instead of focusing on the host (e.g., case counts), better decisions could be made if based on connectivity. To that end, Network Theory concepts were adjusted to bio-geo-temporal formats. To facilitate cost-benefit analyses, the definitions of <italic>epidemic node</italic> and <italic>disease cluster</italic> differed from those of Network Theory (NT). While nodes, in NT, are defined as dimensionless points <xref rid="pone.0039778-Dale1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> were defined as surfaces (the smallest circle containing most cases). While, in NT, &#x02018;cluster&#x02019; refers to sets of &#x02018;nodes&#x02019;, here overlapping nodes were merged, i.e., a <italic>disease cluster</italic> involved both <italic>cases</italic> and <italic>nodes</italic>. Such adjustments of NT concepts to bio-geographical realities generated both the lowest cost (interventions applied to the smallest circle) and the highest benefit (more epidemic cases could be prevented), as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039778-g010">figure 10</xref> shows. Because pre-outbreak data significantly correlated with post-outbreak findings, such as the positive and significant relationship found between <italic>infective link density/node</italic> and <italic>case density</italic>, if geo-referenced data on all susceptible sites &#x02013;farms, in this study&#x02013; were available, bio-geographical variables could, potentially, be measured before a microbial invasion occurs.</p><p>While the validity of <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> and <italic>infective links</italic> was supported, their limitations should not be ignored. <italic>Infective links</italic> assumed that connectivity remains constant over the course of an epidemic, which is unlikely <xref rid="pone.0039778-Rocha1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. While <italic>epidemic nodes</italic> detected &#x02018;along-road&#x02019; disease clusters even if they were not independent &#x02013;an advantage over classic approaches <xref rid="pone.0039778-Choo1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>&#x02013;, such nodes, here assumed to be circular, may not be realistic. To improve such constructs, future studies may consider non-circular and non-Euclidean metrics, such as <italic>road segments</italic> and the <italic>road length</italic> associated with each node &#x02013;here measured but only partially evaluated.</p><p>While disease spread may be mediated by other means, rapidly disseminating epizoonotics appear to require pre-established connecting networks. The integration of John Snow&#x02019;s approach &#x02013;interventions neither applied on the host nor imposed on the pathogen, but centered on connectivity&#x02013; with network analysis, seems to be feasible.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0039778.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
