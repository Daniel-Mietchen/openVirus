<p>Since there is no in vitro model with robust viral replication, the virus life cycle remains hypothetical. Currently, no specific interaction with any cellular receptor has been described. Supposedly, after adsorption and uncoating, HEV RNA is probably first translated into non-structural proteins followed by the synthesis of genomic and subgenomic RNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R108">108</xref>]. Replication complexes have been observed, in vitro, at the ER membrane [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R110">110</xref>]. Subsequently the translation of ORF2 and ORF3 proteins would occur, leading to the assembly of viral particles and the release of progeny virions. There is no evidence of a direct cytopathic effect caused by HEV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R136">136</xref>], and it is more likely that the hepatocyte cytolysis observed during infection is mediated by the cellular immune response. Thus hepatitis E may be an immune-mediated disease [
