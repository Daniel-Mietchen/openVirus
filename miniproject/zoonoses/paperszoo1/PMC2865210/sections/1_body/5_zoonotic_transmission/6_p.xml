<p>The possible source of HEV infection in these cases could be feces or manure, since large amounts of virus can be excreted in feces [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. One study has investigated the presence of HEV in manure storage facilities (earthen lagoons or concrete pits) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. HEV-contaminated effluents were detected in seven of the 28 farms investigated with up to 10
 <sup>3</sup> GE of HEV genomic RNA per 60Â mL of pit samples. The presence of infectious virus was confirmed by a swine bioassay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. None of the water samples tested in the farm vicinity was positive [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. Manure storage and spreading may vary from country to country, and thus further investigations should be done to evaluate this possible contamination pathway. Furthermore, a recent study has investigated zoonotic, food-borne, or water-borne origin of genotype 3 HEV infections in people in The Netherlands. Interestingly, 17% of surface water samples were found positive [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R120">120</xref>]. The possible HEV contamination of the environment is thus of concern and must be further studied.
