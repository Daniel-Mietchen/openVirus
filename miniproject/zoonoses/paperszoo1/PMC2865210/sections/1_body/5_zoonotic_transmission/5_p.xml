<p>Recently, an acute hepatitis E was reported in a person who had been given a pet pig 2 months before the onset of symptoms. HEV sequences closely related to the sequence recovered from the patient were identified from the animal, and shown to belong to the genotype 3 HEV strain with 94% nucleotide sequence identity [
