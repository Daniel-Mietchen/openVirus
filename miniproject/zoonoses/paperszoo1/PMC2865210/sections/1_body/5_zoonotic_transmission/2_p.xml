<p>Two cases of confirmed zoonotic transmission of HEV through the consumption of contaminated animal food products have been reported in Japan (Tab. II, upper) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R138">138</xref>]. In these two cases, clinical symptoms occur 40 or 60 days after consumption of Sika deer (sushi) or wild boar (grilled) meat. In both cases, HEV RNA was successfully amplified in the patients as well as in the leftover frozen animal meat. The HEV viral sequences recovered from the patients and from the leftover frozen meats are either identical or near identical with 99.95% identity, confirming the zoonotic nature of transmission through the consumption of animal food products. In one of these cases, the level of HEV contamination of the meat was estimated by quantitative RT-PCR to be approximately 10
 <sup>5</sup> genome equivalents (GE) per gram of meat. There was no indication on the quantity of meat ingested by the patient nor the type of meat (liver or muscle) involved [
