<p>To evaluate the risk associated with zoonotic HEV transmission, a piece of very important data such as a dose-response model for HEV, is still missing. Since there is no efficient in vitro cell culture model to propagate HEV, little is known on HEV infectivity. The number of infectious particles in correlation with the number of genome equivalent (GE, estimated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR) has been estimated using the pig model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>]. A titration of a suspension containing 10
 <sup>6</sup> (GE) was performed and it corresponds to approximately 10
 <sup>4.5</sup> 50% pig infectious dose (PID
 <sub>50</sub>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>]. Thus, one PID
 <sub>50</sub> corresponds to approximately 10
 <sup>1.5</sup> GE, but IV inoculation is not a natural route of HEV transmission, except in cases of blood transfusion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>]. Another study has shown that pigs orally infected with 10
 <sup>5.3</sup> GE had seroconverted, or excreted virus in 25% of the cases (4/16) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Thus, the data suggest that infection by HEV genotype 3 requires high copy numbers of GE in animals. This observation might be different for genotypes 1 and 2 in humans, although this can serve as an indicator.
