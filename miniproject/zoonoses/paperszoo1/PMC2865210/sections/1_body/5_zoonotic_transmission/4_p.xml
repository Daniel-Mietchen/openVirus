<p>Another possible way of HEV exposure is through direct contact with animals. Higher anti-HEV antibody prevalences within individuals in close contact with pigs have been reported: slaughterhouse staff, veterinarians and pig breeders. A survey in a cohort of 295 veterinarians from 8 American states showed an antibody prevalence of 27% in swine veterinarians versus 16% in the general population [

In Moldova, it has been reported that approximately 51% of swine farmers were IgG anti-HEV positive whereas only 25% of control subjects with no occupational exposure to swine were seropositive. Swine farmers with a history of cleaning barns or assisting pig birth were 2.46 times more likely to be seropositive than controls [
