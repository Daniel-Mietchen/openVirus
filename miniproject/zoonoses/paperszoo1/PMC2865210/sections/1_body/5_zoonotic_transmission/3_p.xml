<p>In four other studies in Japan, HEV infection via the consumption of contaminated food was supported by several pieces of evidence. In all cases, hepatitis E were observed 14 to 60 days after consumption of raw or under cooked pork products [

A case-control study was performed and the risk factors found, independently associated with autochthonous HEV infection, were offal consumption (41% versus 19%) and wild-boar meat consumption (20% versus 7%). The meat products implicated should be investigated for the presence of HEV. These data would contribute to define preventive measures [
