<p>Although the zoonotic risk of HEV is now well established, only few cases (two, worldwide) of transmission from animals (deer and wild boar) to humans have been definitively confirmed. Other possible transmission pathways remain to be identified especially in non-endemic countries where the numbers of autochthonous cases are on a steady rise. An important issue of this disease is the evaluation of risk factors associated with HEV infection and the clinical consequences related to viral exposure. Quantitative risk assessments should be performed to identify and prioritize possible routes of transmission. This approach will contribute to precisely define the strategy of HEV surveillance. The impact of HEV animal reservoirs on human infections must be studied to evaluate whether, and how, zoonotic transmissions should be controlled. Particular attention on HEV genetic variability and recombination in animals must be paid to prevent the potential emergence of more pathogenic strains of HEV.</p>
