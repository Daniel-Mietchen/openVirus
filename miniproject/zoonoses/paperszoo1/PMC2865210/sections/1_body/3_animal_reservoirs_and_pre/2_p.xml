<p>Domestic pigs and wild boars are the main animal reservoir for the genotypes 3 and 4 strains of HEV worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref>]. Besides pigs, anti-HEV antibodies have also been detected in many other animal species including deer, rats, dogs, cats, mongooses, cows, sheep, goats, avian species, rabbits and horses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R152">152</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R154">154</xref>] suggesting that these animal species are exposed to HEV or to a closely related agent. While strains of HEV genotype 3 and/or 4 have been genetically identified in the wild boar, deer, mongoose and rabbit [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R154">154</xref>], the source of seropositivity in other animals, with the exception of chickens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>] and rats [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>] remains unknown [
