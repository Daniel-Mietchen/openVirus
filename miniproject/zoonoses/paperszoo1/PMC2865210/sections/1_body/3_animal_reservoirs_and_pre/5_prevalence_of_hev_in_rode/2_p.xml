<p>Rodents are present in both urban and rural areas and thus, may play an important role in HEV transmission. Rats from both urban and rural areas have been detected to be seropositive for IgG anti-HEV. It has been shown that about 77% of the rats from Maryland, 90% from Hawaii and 44% from Louisiana were positive for IgG anti-HEV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]. The IgG anti-HEV prevalence rate increases in parallel with the estimated age of the rats. All three species of wild rats (
 <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>, 
 <italic>Rattus rattus</italic> and 
 <italic>Rattus exulans</italic>) tested in the study were seropositive. In another study, 26 different species of rodents caught in the USA were tested for IgG anti-HEV prevalence, and the highest prevalence rate was found in the genus 
 <italic>Rattus</italic> (59.7%). Rodents caught in an urban area had a higher IgG anti-HEV prevalence rate than rodents caught from rural areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. In Japan, it is reported that approximately 32% of Norway rats (
 <italic>R. norvegicus</italic>) and 13% of black rats (
 <italic>R. rattus</italic>) were seropositive for IgG anti-HEV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. The seroprevalence of HEV antibodies in different rodent populations varied in different geographic regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref>]. These results indicated that there is a widespread infection of rats by HEV in different countries. The recent genetic identification of a strain of HEV from rats in Germany [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>] confirms these serological findings. It appears that the rat HEV is genetically distinct from the known strains of mammalian HEV. It remains unknown whether or not the rat HEV has the ability to cross the species barrier and infect humans.
