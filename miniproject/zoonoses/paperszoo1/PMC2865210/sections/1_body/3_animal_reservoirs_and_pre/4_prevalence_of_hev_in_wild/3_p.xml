<p>In these studies, reporting on divergent prevalence, sample sizes were generally small and of various origins such as the liver, sera, bile, and feces (Tab. I). There were limited data on the age of the animals tested, which makes it difficult to evaluate the real infection level of these animal species. The HEV strains amplified from these animal species were of genotype 3 or 4 and were genetically very closely related to human and swine strains described in the same geographic regions [
