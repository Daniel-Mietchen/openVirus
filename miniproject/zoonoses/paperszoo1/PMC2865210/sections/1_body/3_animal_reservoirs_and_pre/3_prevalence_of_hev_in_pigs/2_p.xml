<p>Several descriptive studies on HEV prevalence have been carried out in swine herds in different countries. The nature of the collected information is very diverse among studies: detection of different classes of anti-HEV antibodies IgG and sometimes IgM and/or IgA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R134">134</xref>], detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR in serum samples [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R134">134</xref>], feces from individual pigs or slurry, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R119">119</xref>], or commercial liver from grocery stores [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R149">149</xref>]. All serological studies converged on a very wide distribution of HEV in swine herds. If we consider that a herd is positive when at least one individual is identified as being seropositive, the following was found: 100% (15/15) were positive in the USA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>], 90% (20/22) in New Zealand [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>], 46% (23/50) in Laos [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], 100% (10/10) in Mexico [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], and 98% (40/41) in Spain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R125">125</xref>]. A retrospective study performed in Spain, including 208 herds followed since 1985, shows that endemic HEV infection in pigs is not a recent phenomenon (204/208 = 98%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. At the individual level, in pigs of 6 months of age, the average seroprevalence varied greatly from study to study: 56% of HEV-positive pigs in Japan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R134">134</xref>], 23% in Argentina [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref>], 81% in Brazil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>], and 51% in Laos [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. The observed high variability of seroprevalence rate results from important differences within each herd (4 to 58% for the Argentine study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref>], 15 to 100% for the Brazilian study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]). Strong fluctuations in seroprevalence rate are also observed according to the animal’s age, with pigs older than 4 months generally being higher [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R134">134</xref>]. This observation is consistent with a natural HEV infection of pigs between 10 and 12 weeks of age. In a prospective study of a swine herd in the USA, the majority of swine became infected at the age of 2 to 4 months [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>], consistent with the high seroprevalence rate in pigs older than 4 months old. The IgG anti-HEV seroprevalence rate in sows is higher, ranging from 60 to 73% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R125">125</xref>].
