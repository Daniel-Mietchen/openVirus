<p>The detection of HEV RNA in sera shows a very strong influence of the age of animals as shown in a Japanese study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R134">134</xref>]. The highest number of viremic animals is observed at 3 months of age (32/310 positive). In this study, none of the 136 animals tested at 6 months of age were positive. In the Netherlands, a survey was performed in 97 herds with 20 weeks old pigs: 53 herds (55%) contained at least one animal excreting the virus in feces [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R119">119</xref>]. Faecal excretion of HEV seems to heavily depend on the age of the animals, peaking at 18 weeks of age (86% of the pigs with fecal virus shedding), and decreasing afterwards to 41% at the age of slaughter, as shown in a study performed in Canada [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>]. In accordance with these data, the results obtained in Spain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>] show the highest number of positive pigs (12/20) with fecal virus shedding at 13–16 weeks of age, and the results from the United Kingdom [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>] show the highest number of animals with faecal excretion at 10–12 weeks of age (22%), decreasing to 4% for pigs older than 22 weeks of age. In the various studies carried out in Europe, the HEV strains identified that all belong to genotype 3 [
