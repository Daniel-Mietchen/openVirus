<p>Under natural conditions of infection, the dynamics of HEV infection is similar to what is described for most viral infections in pigs: acquisition of passive immunity through colostrum absorption (60% of the piglets), progressive decline of these passive antibodies at 8–10 weeks of age, then seroconversion between 14 and 17 weeks of age (Fig. 2) corresponding to the peak of viremia observed at 15 weeks of age (40% of animals) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. The IgM anti-HEV increased from 9 weeks of age, and approximately 100% of the pigs studied (
 <italic>n</italic> = 16) were IgG anti-HEV-positive at 22 weeks of age (Fig. 2). This dynamics observed in a Spanish herd is also in accordance with what was observed in Japan where the peak of faecal virus excretion was between 1 and 3 months of age (75 to 100% of the animals) then decreased to 7% of the animals at 5–6 months of age [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref>] (Fig. 2). The seroprevalence observed at the end of fattening reveals an effective transmission of the virus between the animals from the same fence. This was confirmed by the experimental estimation of the basic reproduction ratio (
