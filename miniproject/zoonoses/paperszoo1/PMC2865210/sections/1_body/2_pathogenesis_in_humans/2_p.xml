<p>Hepatitis E is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, usually via the consumption of contaminated water or food. In contrast to hepatitis A virus and other enteric viruses, human-to-human transmission of HEV is rare [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. From a clinical point of view, hepatitis E is similar to hepatitis A, with acute self-limiting and symptomatic disease that varies in severity from subclinical to fulminant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Incubation time ranges from 2 weeks to 2 months with an average of 40 days, viremia is transient and occurs mainly during the prodromic phase, and disappears at the onset of clinical symptoms. Fecal excretion of the virus begins a few days (5 days on average) prior to jaundice, and regresses at the onset of jaundice within 2 to 3 weeks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Most autochtonous cases of hepatitis E are reported in middle-aged and elderly men [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">109</xref>]. Fulminant hepatitis is observed in 1â€“4% of the cases which is higher than hepatitis A [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>]. The mortality rate reaches up to 20% in pregnant woman in some endemic areas (northern and central India, Pakistan) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>]. In other countries such as Egypt or southern India, pregnant women are not significantly at higher risk to develop fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R129">129</xref>]. More recently, a 20-year study of the association of HEV-associated acute liver failure with pregnancy revealed that the mortality of pregnant patients is similar to that of nonpregnant women [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Pregnancy is a poor prognostic factor for a patient with acute liver failure associated or not associated with HEV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Thus, various factors such as HEV strains (genotype or subtypes), viral load, or other co-infections might play a role in pathogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R112">112</xref>]. It appears that, compared to genotypes 1 and 2, the genotype 3 and 4 strains are less pathogenic in humans. Therefore, the differences of HEV genotypes in different geographical regions might explain the severity of infection during pregnancy. However, in Egypt and southern India where genotype 1 HEV is prevalent, low mortality rates are observed during pregnancy, thus suggesting that other factors may be involved in the observed high mortality rate during pregnancy in some regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref>]. To our knowledge, no cases of fulminant hepatitis E associated to genotype 3 infection during pregnancy have been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>].
