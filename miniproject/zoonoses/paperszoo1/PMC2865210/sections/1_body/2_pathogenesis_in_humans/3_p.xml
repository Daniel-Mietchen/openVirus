<p>More recently, other clinical forms of HEV diseases have been observed in patients under immunosuppressive conditions, such as transplant recipients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>], or patients suffering from leukemia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>]. Some of these patients developed chronic HEV infection progressing to cirrhosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>]. This clearly suggests that the atypical clinical and virological outcome for HEV infection in these cases could be related to immunosuppressive treatments, which might have resulted in suboptimal anti-HEV-specific immune responses and subsequent viral persistence. Such a hypothesis has been evocated by Kamar etÂ al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>] who found significantly reduced CD2-, CD3-, and CD4-lymphocyte counts in patients with chronic disease, and in populations at risk of developing FHF. Another population that might be at risk of chronic HEV infection are HIV patients with an advanced stage of immunodeficiency. However, so far there has been no increased prevalence of HEV infection observed in that population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R113">113</xref>]. Only a few cases of acute hepatitis E have been reported in HIV patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], including a pregnant woman who recovered completely [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R139">139</xref>].
