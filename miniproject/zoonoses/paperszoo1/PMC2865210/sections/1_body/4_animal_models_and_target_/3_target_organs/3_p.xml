<p>Studies on HEV dissemination in pigs infected experimentally by intravenous inoculation (IV) have identified extrahepatic sites of HEV replication. As expected, evidence of viral replication was found in the liver but also in the colon, lymph nodes (mesenteric and hepatic) and spleen for up to 20â€“27 days post-inoculation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R145">145</xref>]. The virus RNA was also detected in the stomach, small intestine, spleen, kidney, salivary glands, tonsils or lungs (14 days post-inoculation). Viral RNA, but no viral replication, was detected in the muscles at 14 days post-infection at which time the pigs also had viremia [

In a recent study, comparing the course of HEV infection in pigs via contact-infection or IV inoculation, the presence of HEV RNA was confirmed in Longissimus, Biceps, Femoris and Iliopsoas muscles at 27 days post-inoculation in IV-inoculated pigs and 31 days in contact-infected pigs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. These HEV RNA-positive organs may result from viremia, rather than from active virus replication, but they may still represent a risk of HEV contamination of pork products. It has been shown that the results obtained after contact-infection or IV-inoculation of pigs were different, suggesting that the route of HEV infection may influence viral dissemination. HEV was found in urine after contact infection (3/5) but not in IV-inoculated pigs (0/5) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. The presence of HEV in urine, in addition to feces, may contribute to the high transmissibility of HEV between animals. The IV route is commonly utilized in experimental infection since it is more efficient than fecal-oral or contact-exposure routes but may not reflect natural HEV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>]. By using the chicken model, Billam et al. reported on the identification of extrahepatic sites of HEV replication in animals after experimental infection via the natural oral route of HEV inoculation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. In addition to the liver, replicative HEV RNA was also detected in gastrointestinal tissues, including the colorectal, cecal, jejunal, ileal, duodenal, and cecal tonsil tissues [
