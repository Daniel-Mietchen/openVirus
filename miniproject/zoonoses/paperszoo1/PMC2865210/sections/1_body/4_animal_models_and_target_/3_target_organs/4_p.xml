<p>The omnipresence of HEV infection in pigs and the detection of HEV replication in the liver raised the concern for the presence of HEV in slaughtered pigs and in livers sold in grocery stores. Several studies reported the detection of HEV RNA in commercial pig livers: 1.9% (7/363) in Japan (genotypes 3 and 4) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R149">149</xref>]; 6.5% (4/62) in the Netherlands (genotype 3) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]; 10.8% in Korea (genotypes 3), samples collected between 1995 and 2004 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>], 0.83% (2/240) in India (genotype 4) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>] and in 11% in the USA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>] (genotype 3). In the last study, the presence of infectious virus in commercial livers was confirmed by inoculation of HEV RNA-positive liver homogenate into pigs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], raising the possibility of human infection through consumption of contaminated pork products. In order to study if heating (cooking) would inactivate HEV, small pieces of HEV RNA-positive livers were cooked at different temperatures and the residual infectious virus was measured in a swine bioassay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. The results showed that deep fried (5 min at 191 °C) or boiling (5 min) can effectively inactivate HEV, although a treatment of 1 h at 56 °C did not inactivate HEV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. These results underline that contaminated food products, if consumed raw or undercooked, could potentially transmit the virus to humans. Therefore, some food preparations, such as mid-dry liver sausage, should be consumed after cooking to minimize potential HEV infection.
