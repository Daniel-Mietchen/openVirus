<p>Initially, the macaque model was developed to study genotype 1 and 2 HEV strains isolated from humans, although non-human primates are susceptible to all 4 genotypes of HEV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref>]. This model was used to demonstrate that cross-species infections occur, since inoculation of rhesus macaques (
 <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) with swine HEV genotype 3 or 4 strains led to productive infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>]. Slight elevation of serum liver enzymes, fecal excretion and seroconversion to IgG anti-HEV were observed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Comparison of pathological lesion profiles after infection with genotype 3 human or swine HEV did not reveal major differences, suggesting that genotype 3 or 4 HEV strains have no specific host restriction between swine and primates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>]. However, an attempt to experimentally infect rhesus macaques with the avian HEV strain failed, suggesting that the avian HEV strain represents a limited risk for human infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. Swine are naturally infected by genotype 3 or 4 HEV but are not susceptible to infections by genotype 1 of the Pakistani strain (Sar-55) of HEV nor to infection with the Mexican strain of genotype 2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>]. The molecular mechanism underlying this host restriction remains unknown. Genotype 3 and 4 HEV strains isolated from humans are infectious when inoculated into pigs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>]. The comparison of pathological lesions between the genotype 3 swine and human HEV strains did not reveal a major difference [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. The experimental infection of pregnant gilts with genotype 3 swine HEV did not lead to any fulminant hepatitis, abortion or vertical transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>]. It is hypothesized that the genotype 3 swine HEV or human HEV is less virulent than genotype 1 or 2 HEV [
