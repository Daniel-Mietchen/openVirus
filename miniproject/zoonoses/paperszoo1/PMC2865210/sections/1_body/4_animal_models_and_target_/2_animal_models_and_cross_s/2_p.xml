<p>Animal models have been developed to study HEV replication and pathogenesis. One animal model was developed in non-human primates: cynomolgus macaque (
 <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>] or less frequently chimpanzee [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>]. The non-human primates were used mainly to study genotypes 1 and 2 HEV strains. A second animal model was developed in pigs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>] in which genotypes 3 and 4 replicate efficiently. Both non-human primate and pig models were used to demonstrate cross-species infections or extrahepatic sites of HEV replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R145">145</xref>]. More recently, a third animal model was developed in specific-pathogen-free chickens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] to study the avian strains of HEV and the HS syndrome associated with avian HEV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>].
