<p>It has been demonstrated that chickens can serve as a good model for the study of avian HEV replication and pathogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Unlike the swine and non-human primate models in which reproduction of HEV infection by the oral route of inoculation has been difficult, chickens can be readily infected with avian HEV via the natural oral route [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Evidence of vertical transmission has been demonstrated in the chicken model infected with avian HEV. Avian HEV detected in chicken egg white was found to be infectious, although no virus was detected in samples collected from the hatched chicks, suggesting that avian HEV could not complete the vertical transmission cycle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. The host range of avian HEV appears to be limited. Although the avian HEV can infect turkeys [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R130">130</xref>], attempts to infect pigs and rhesus monkeys with avian HEV were unsuccessful
