<p>Since HEV infection is asymptomatic in swine, HEV diagnosis is not performed routinely in pigs. HEV serology or detection of HEV RNA is performed only in research laboratories that have developed assays adapted to swine [

HEV detection in swine herds is important to measure the level of contamination of this large animal reservoir especially in countries with industrial swine farming. Sensitive and specific RT-PCR assays have been developed in independent laboratories to detect all 4 mammalian genotypes of HEV [
