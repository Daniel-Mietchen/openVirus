<p>Currently, avian HEV diagnosis is primarily based on detection of avian HEV RNA by RT-PCR or detection of avian HEV antibodies by ELISA [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R104">104</xref>]. However, the sensitivity and specificity of these assays are not known. Avian HEV capsid protein has been expressed and used in an ELISA to detect avian HEV antibodies in chickens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R104">104</xref>]. Avian HEV-specific RT-PCR assays have also been successfully developed for the detection of avian HEV infections in chickens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R104">104</xref>]. However, the specificity of the RT-PCR assays in detecting avian HEV strains in chickens from different geographic regions is not known, since avian HEV strains identified from chickens in different geographic regions are genetically heterogenic.
