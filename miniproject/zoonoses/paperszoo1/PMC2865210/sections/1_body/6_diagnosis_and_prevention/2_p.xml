<p>Viral hepatitis E is similar to the other types of acute viral hepatitis. Usually HEV markers are tested after the patients are found to be negative for the following tests: IgM antibodies to hepatitis A virus; AgHBs, anti-HBc IgM, and DNA to hepatitis B; antibodies and RNA to hepatitis C virus; IgM antibodies for Cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr Virus; anti-nuclear, anti smooth muscle and anti-LKM-1 antibodies [
