<p>HEV infection can be prevented as well with an efficient immunization program [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">109</xref>], HEV is a good candidate for the development of an effective vaccine. A large vaccination campaign in developing countries would reduce large waterborne epidemics with thousands of people concerned. Travellers to endemic regions could also benefit from a vaccine. In industrialized countries, populations at risks such as transplant recipients or people with underlying liver conditions could be a target for vaccination as well. The safety and efficacy of an HEV recombinant protein vaccine was evaluated in a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R126">126</xref>]. This vaccine, based on the HEV capsid protein, showed a good efficacy (88.5% after one dose and 95.5% after three doses) in the prevention of hepatitis E in patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R126">126</xref>]. However, with the recent identifications of genetically distinct strains of HEV in swine, rats and rabbits, it will be important to determine if the experimental vaccines are effective against these emerging and potentially zoonotic strains of HEV.
