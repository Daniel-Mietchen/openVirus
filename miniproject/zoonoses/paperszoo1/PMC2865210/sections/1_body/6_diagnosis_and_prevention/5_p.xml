<p>Efforts on HEV prevention concern mostly sanitation in developing countries, to limit contamination of drinking water by infected materials. Particular information and surveillance must be taken with populations at higher risk of fulminant hepatitis such as pregnant women and people with underlying liver conditions. In industrialized countries, where zoonotic transmissions may be the main route of hepatitis E infection, consumers of raw or undercooked meat should be advised on the potential risk. Populations at risk such as pregnant women, transplant recipients and individuals with underlying liver conditions should be informed on the possible risk of consuming raw pork, deer or wild boar meat or having contact with infected pigs. In the same line, pig handlers and veterinarians who are exposed to HEV, must take hygienic measures after handling the animals. In swine, since HEV seems very contagious between animals [

Commercial importation of swine is a very common practice and a better surveillance strategy should be developed. Very recently, a genotype 4 was isolated in swine for the first time in Europe

Since swine represent a large reservoir of HEV in non-endemic region, pigs are probably one of the sources of infection for the sporadic cases of acute hepatitis E. Surveillance of swine, with wild boar and deer reservoirs should be performed until all the routes of human exposure to HEV are identified.
