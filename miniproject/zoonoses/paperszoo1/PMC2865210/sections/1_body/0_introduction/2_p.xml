<p>Hepatitis E virus (HEV), the causative agent of acute human hepatitis E, is responsible for an important public health disease in many developing countries of Asia and Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">109</xref>]. The mortality rate associated with HEV infection (1 to 4%) is higher than that of hepatitis A (0.1 to 2%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R107">107</xref>], and can reach up to 20% during pregnancy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">109</xref>]. HEV infection in developing countries is mostly a waterborne disease associated with large epidemics due to contamination of water and water supplies, and poor sanitation conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">109</xref>]. In contrast, in industrialized countries, including many European countries, USA and Japan, acute hepatitis E occurs sporadically and the contamination pathways are still not fully understood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">109</xref>]. Several lines of evidence, such as the absence of travel to endemic countries or different HEV strains involved in cases reported from industrialized countries than from developing countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], support an autochthonous origin of these sporadic cases. The particularity of HEV is that, among all known major hepatitis viruses (A, B, C and D), HEV is the only one with animal reservoirs. Swine HEV was first isolated and genetically characterized from pigs in the USA in 1997 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>], even though HEV antibodies and RNA were reportedly detected from pigs in the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal but the identity of the virus infecting the Nepalese pigs was not determined in that study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. More recently, an avian HEV was identified and characterized from chickens with Hepatitis-Splenomegaly (HS) syndrome in 2001 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>] in the USA as well. Besides swine and chickens, recently strains of HEV have been genetically identified from deer, mongooses, rabbits and rats [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R115">115</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R141">141</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R154">154</xref>]. Accumulating evidence indicates that hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease, and swine (and likely other animal species) are reservoirs. Swine and human strains of HEV are genetically closely related and, in some cases, indistinguishable [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>], and direct transmissions through the consumption of contaminated food products such as pork have been reported in Japan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R149">149</xref>]. Thus, zoonotic transmission of hepatitis E raises an important public health concern over food safety and zoonotic risk [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref>].
