  <title>Box 1. Case History: An imported case of human rabies in Louisiana, USA, due to a vampire bat bite.</title>
  <p>In July, 2010, a 19 year old male migrant worker from Mexico developed fatigue with pain in his left hand and shoulder. He sought medical attention on July 30th and was transferred to New Orleans on August 3rd when his symptoms persisted. Further physical examination revealed generalized areflexia and a drooping left upper eyelid. A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample contained elevated white blood cells (8 cells/mm
   <sup>3</sup>) but glucose levels were normal. The patient developed a fever with a temperature of 38.4 °C and he became generally less responsive. On August 20th, rabies virus-specific IgM and IgG were detected in the patient’s CSF and serum. On August 21st, after discussion with the patient’s family, ventilator support was removed that the patient died shortly after. Rabies virus was confirmed by detection of viral antigen in brain tissue taken at postmortem. A link to vampire bats was suggested by antigenic typing of the virus isolated from the patient and genetic analysis of nucleic acid sequencing derived from reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
  </p>
  <p>A public health investigation was conducted that involved interviewing the patient’s family. The patient was originally resident in Michoacán, Mexico, where vampire bats were know to be present locally. Through an interview with the patient’s mother it transpired that he had been bitten by a vampire bat on the left heel whilst sleeping in the family residence. This was reported to have occurred on July 15th. The patient did not seek any medical attention for the bite and there was no evidence of vaccination for rabies.</p>
