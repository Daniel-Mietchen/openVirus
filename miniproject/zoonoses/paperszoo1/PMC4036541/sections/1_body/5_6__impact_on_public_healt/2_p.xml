<p>The number of rabies cases associated with wild species, especially those transmitted by vampire bats, seems to be increasing and the patterns of occurrence of this disease are also changing [

 <xref rid="B64-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. This may be due to four main causes, two (1 &amp; 2) associated with increased reporting and diagnosis and two (3 &amp; 4) associated with changes to vampire bats demography and distribution: (1) an increase in cases may be due to improved disease reportingâ€”the frequency with which the inhabitants of rural areas reported cases has increased but it could indicate that the incidence of rabies has not changed and only the ability to compile these reports has been improved; (2) diagnostic techniques have progressed in viral identification and typing, allowing identification of the true reservoir host of a rabies virus; (3) it is possible that vampire bats, which besides dogs, are the most frequently reported source of human rabies, are increasing and expanding their populations due to augmented habitat fragmentation caused by changes in the land use and farming in the tropics and incurring a higher frequency of contact between human and reservoirs [
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]; (4) climate changes are playing a major role, more than previously considered, in the distribution and abundance of reservoir species and the frequency of outbreaks, this factor may be dominant if it is considered that vampire bats are restricted by low temperatures in their environment and shelter [
 <xref rid="B67-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Each of these, either individually or in combination, could have increased the reported number of human infections with rabies virus of vampire bat origin. Additionally, we have witnessed the presence of rabies variants proceeding from vampire bats in cattle located over 2800 meters above sea level, in places where the disease was not recorded previously, e.g., Tutotepec municipality in Hidalgo State of Mexico, confirming the progress of the disease [
