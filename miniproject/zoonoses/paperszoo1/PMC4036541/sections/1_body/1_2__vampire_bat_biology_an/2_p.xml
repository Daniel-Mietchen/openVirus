<p>Vampire bats feed at night and prefer moonless nights to avoid detection by prey animals. The common vampire bat has a number of adaptations for blood-feeding that enhance its ability to transmit rabies virus. Firstly, the species feeds on a wide range of hosts, including humans, although will preferentially feed on large livestock such as cattle and horses. The teeth of

The wound is sufficiently deep to induce profuse bleeding. Clotting is prevented by secretion of anticoagulant in saliva that is channeled down a groove on the dorsal surface of the tongue. Finally, the species forms colonies (
