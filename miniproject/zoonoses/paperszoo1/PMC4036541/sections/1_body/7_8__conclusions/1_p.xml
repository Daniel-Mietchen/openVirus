<p>Reports of both livestock and human cases of rabies are increasing, mainly due to the continuing encroachment of human populations into areas occupied by vampire bats and there is now strong evidence that the range of vampire bats is also increasing. It is possible that vampire bats could move further north and into the United States, bringing with them the risk of rabies virus transmission to humans and livestock. Fossils of vampire bats have been found in a number of US states from warmer periods in earth history [

 <italic>D. rotundus</italic> to move north and introduce another rabies variant into US wildlife [

 <xref rid="B24-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] have suggested that the efforts aimed at reducing spillover through viral elimination must likely be spatially coordinated with a view to defining and synchronizing transmission dynamics within enzootic regions. Whilst control methods such as habitat destruction and indiscriminant use of anticoagulants have been used for decades, there is little evidence that they have achieved anything other than short-term respite in limited areas. Rabies in vampire bats persists and new strategies are needed that succeed in reducing the incidence of disease transmission without further destruction of bats.
