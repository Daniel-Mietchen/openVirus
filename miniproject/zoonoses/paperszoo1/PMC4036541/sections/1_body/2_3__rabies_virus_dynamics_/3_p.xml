<p>Rabies in vampire bats has been investigated through experimental infection. Moreno and Baer [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] inoculated captive 
 <italic>D. rotundus</italic> bats with a vampire bat-derived virus by the intracranial (IC), intramuscular (IM) and sub-cutaneous (SC) routes. Disease development was dependent on inoculation route and virus dose with IC inoculation inducing rabies in all recipients, whereas only a high virus dose (&gt;562 mouse intracerebral lethal dose 
 <sub>50</sub>) caused disease in the majority of bats inoculated by other routes. Virus was detected in both salivary glands and saliva from bats that developed rabies. Later studies have provided descriptions of rabies in vampire bats. The initial sign in captive bats is a decrease in blood consumption [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] leading to dehydration. No aggression was observed although neurological signs included wing paralysis, tremors and difficulty in walking [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. RABV distribution in naturally infected bats is predominantly in neurological tissue followed by the tongue, associated with the presence of salivary glands [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This is similar to the virus distribution observed for related lyssaviruses in European insectivorous bats [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. There appears to be little difference between the pathology of rabies infection in vampire bats and other mammals.
