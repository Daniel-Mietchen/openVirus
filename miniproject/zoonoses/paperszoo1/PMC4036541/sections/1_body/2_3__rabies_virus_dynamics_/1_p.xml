<p>Several studies describing the epidemiology of rabies virus within populations of vampire bats suggest that the virus infects many individuals; some die and others survive exposure, demonstrable by the presence of antibody against the virus. The disease disappears from the bat population in time and does not return until a sufficient number of susceptible bats have re-entered the population [

 <xref rid="B24-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. They concluded that the probability of developing a lethal infection upon exposure to rabies is quite low for vampire bats (~10%), and it is more likely that most exposures are subclinical and immunizing. This enables long term viral persistence in colonies of a species with a slow reproductive rate by a high frequency of immunizing exposures. The authors also highlighted the role of immigration in the dynamics of rabies virus within the vampire populations as the method of virus spread that leads to sporadic but lethal vampire bat rabies virus infection. Frequent interactions among bats from different colonies are necessary to maintain the chain of transmission. Similarly, high seroprevalence to rabies virus in other bat species suggests that frequent survival after exposure may be a general feature of bat rabies, nevertheless incubation and infectious periods remain an important unknown.
