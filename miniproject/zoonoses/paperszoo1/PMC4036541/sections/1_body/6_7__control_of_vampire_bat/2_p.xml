<p>The impact of vampire predation on livestock is such that a number of control methods have been used. The most dramatic and destructive is that of colony destruction that in extreme cases has included the dynamiting of caves [

Furthermore, other occupants of the cave system are destroyed. It can also lead to dispersal of colonies if not carried out effectively, and may lead to the movement of the problem to another area. More recent studies suggest a critical role for immigration between bat colonies indicating that current culling practices, often reacting to outbreaks in livestock, when haphazardly implemented are unlikely to eliminate rabies virus. Whilst programs targeting specific colonies may limit local spillover from bats to humans or domestic animals, culling could have the opposite of the intended effect on rabies transmission by means of increasing the movement due to freeing up space or disturbance-mediated dispersal [
