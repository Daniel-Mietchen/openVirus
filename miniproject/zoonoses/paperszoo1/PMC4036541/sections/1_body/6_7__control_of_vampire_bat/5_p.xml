 <xref rid="B13-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reported that culling campaigns in Peru over a three year period failed to reduce rabies virus seroprevalence and were perhaps counterproductive for disease control. This could imply that juvenile and sub-adult bats are more important for disease transmission than adults as these were targeted for removal. They also demonstrated that exposure to RABV was ubiquitous across geographically widespread vampire bat populations, and was at best only weakly related to bat colony size, and tended to increase following sporadic culling. This suggests that to control vampire bat populations, by capturing and treating bats with anticoagulants, only provides a temporary respite from disease transmission and that the disease rapidly returns. More studies on vampire bat population dynamics and the application of new technologies for population control e.g., reproductive control using phytoestrogens proposed by Serrano 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B72-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] should be considered as an alternative to successful control of the disease. From a wider ecological perspective, when bats that die from anticoagulant treatment become prey to other carnivores or scavengers, this can then cause secondary death of wild fauna [
