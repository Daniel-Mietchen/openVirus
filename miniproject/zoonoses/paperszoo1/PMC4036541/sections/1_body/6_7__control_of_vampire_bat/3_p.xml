<p>More targeted methods of control include the capture of vampire bats and coating the animal with Vaseline containing an anticoagulant such as Warfarin. The bat is then released and through mutual grooming spreads the anticoagulant throughout the colony leading to the death of its members. A disadvantage of this approach is that often bat species other than 
 <italic>D. rotundus</italic> are treated and destroyed. A variation of this approach is to coat the walls of roosts with anticoagulant although this again can lead to indiscriminant killing of other bat species and the anticoagulant can persist in the environment for years. An alternative is to inject cattle with low levels of anticoagulant that has no effect on livestock and does not affect the suitability of meat for the food chain but is of sufficient strength to be lethal to vampire bats. A variation of this approach is to apply the anticoagulant to fresh wounds in a paste formulation, relying on the behavior of the vampire bats to return to a prior prey location. This approach is more costly although it is specifically targeted at vampire bats. If protection of rabies is the main concern then vaccination of cattle is effective but again is costly and not always adopted by farmers.
