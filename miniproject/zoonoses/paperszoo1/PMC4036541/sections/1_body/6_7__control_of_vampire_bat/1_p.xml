<p>The observation of vampire rabies movement suggests that a landscape is covered in a network of interacting bat colonies, which include maternity roosts and satellite male roosts. Interactions are frequent, often daily, and can include behavior such as social grooming and blood-meal sharing [
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. This enables the rapid dissemination of rabies to a population by an infected individual. This knowledge has led to the implementation of rabies control based on destruction of vampire bats. Fornes and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] described a migratory epidemic in north-east Argentina that was first reported in 1959 and moved at an average rate of 40 km per year in a southwesterly direction. The wavefront increased in length over time. In an attempt to halt this, the authors identified a 1500 km
 <sup>2</sup> control zone where vampire roosts were located almost exclusively in wells. These wells were sealed and the bats inside destroyed by cyanide gas. One hundred and sixty nine wells were found of which 45 were occupied. One hundred and twenty eight wells were gassed and 363 bats were known to have been killed. Testing of 208 carcasses identified two as positive for rabies. A subsequent census one month later confirmed a dramatic reduction (&gt;95%) in the vampire bat population. Further surveillance did not detect any rabies cases in cattle within the control area but some cases were reported to the south east of this zone bringing into question the long-term efficacy of this strategy when dealing with a highly mobile host species.
