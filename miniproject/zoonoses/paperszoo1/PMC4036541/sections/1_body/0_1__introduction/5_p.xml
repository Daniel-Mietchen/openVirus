<p>Bovine rabies in Latin America is commonly called derriengue, a Spanish word for a fatal paralytic disease [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The infected animals exhibit signs of restlessness or excitement with sudden onset of hind limb paralysis. This progresses to the fore limbs. Overt salivation is commonly observed but is believed to be due to difficulties in swallowing rather than excess saliva production. Emaciation in animals that survive for any length of time is observed but the disease is invariably fatal.
