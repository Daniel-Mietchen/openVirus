<p>Vampire bats preferentially prey on livestock [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Livestock and horses are generally larger than indigenous wildlife prey species, are more abundant and tend to stay in the same location for extended periods. Once a colony of vampire bats has located a herd of animals, they are then able to return to the same herd on subsequent nights. This is particularly true for cattle. The introduction of cattle, and other livestock species, during the post-Columbian conquest provided the vampire bat with an abundant food supply [

This in turn has contributed to an increase in the number and size of vampire bat colonies, and enlarged the population that can act as a reservoir for rabies virus. Deforestation, a consequence of land clearance for logging and modification for agriculture has simultaneously reduced the numbers of natural prey species and brought vampire bats into contact with livestock and man.
