<p>Until the introduction of virus typing by monoclonal antibodies, it was impossible to distinguish between rabies viruses isolated from infected brain material. Typing, using this method, allows the differentiation of viruses based on the binding, or not, of panels of monoclonal antibodies directed against the virus nucleoprotein [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] or glycoprotein. This approach has been applied to rabies viruses found in the Americas initially to discriminate between those viruses found in different sylvatic species including bats [
