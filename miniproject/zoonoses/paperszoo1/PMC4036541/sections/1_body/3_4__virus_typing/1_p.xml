<p>The rabies virus genome is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome approximately 12,000 base pairs in length. This contains five discrete coding sequences that encode the structural proteins, nucleoprotein, matrix and glycoprotein, and non-structural proteins, phosphoprotein and RNA-dependent polymerase. All lyssaviruses contain this simple genomic structure [

The main benefit of virus typing methods for investigating vampire bat rabies is the identification of the source of infection in humans and livestock in the absence of records of either a bat bite or vampire bat activity in a particular area.
