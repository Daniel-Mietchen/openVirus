<p>The ability to associate a particular virus lineage with a particular reservoir host has greatly assisted in revealing the interrelationships between rabies virus and New World bats. Analysis of RABVs in North American insectivorous bats indicate that particular lineages are associated with particular bat species, possibly through adaptation to the host, and that transmission between species is rare or rarely detected [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, the feeding method of vampires greatly increases the opportunity for cross-species transmission of virus. Vampire and frugivorous bats were observed to utilize the same roost locations in Mexico [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] so it is highly likely that transmission events between the two could occur and indeed rabies transmission between vampire and frugivorous bats have frequently been reported [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In Argentina rabies viruses isolated from frugivorous bats (
 <italic>Artibeus lituratus</italic>) were identified to be a variant associated with hematophagous bats through the use of monoclonal antibody panels. In Brazil it has been demonstrated that rabies viruses isolated from Brazilian frugivorous bats (
 <italic>Artibeus</italic> spp.) were phylogenetically characterized as the vampire-bat related RABV [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Also in Brazil, Albas and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] found that amongst rabid bats, AgV-3, normally associated with populations of 
 <italic>D. rotundus</italic>, was found in 71.4% (15/21) of non-haematophagus bat species sampled. AgV-3 was also identified in 90.9% (10/11) of the frugivorous bats 
 <italic>Artibeus lituratus</italic> and 50% of the insectivorous bats (one 
 <italic>Lasiurus blossevillii</italic>, one 
 <italic>Molossus molossus</italic>, one 
 <italic>Eptesicus furinalis</italic>, and three 
 <italic>Lasiurus ega</italic>), and the nectivorous Pallas’s long-tongued bat (
 <italic>Glossophaga soricina</italic>). The genetic variant related to haematophagous bats was identified in 75.8% (22/29) of the studied samples. Those results were also observed in studies with samples isolated from bats from the state of São Paulo and other Brazilian regions. An intensive investigation of vampire bat rabies in Peru and neighboring countries identified four discrete lineages [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In addition to genetic variation, there was also a degree of geographical separation although some lineages appear to occupy the same areas and this may reflect the presence of multiple infected colonies. The evidence suggests that vampire bats are highly effective at transmitting RABV to other bat species although an alternative interpretation might be that the AgV-3 is not entirely specific to vampire bats and could be transmitted within non-vampire bat species.
