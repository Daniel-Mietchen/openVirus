<p>Comparison of genomic sequences in order to discriminate rabies viruses began in the early 1990s [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and has expanded dramatically to infer virus variation across time and space. Sequence comparison to generate phylogenies, often represented in the form of a phylogenetic tree, has enabled fine discrimination of rabies viruses. Molecular epidemiology of rabies virus has transformed the understanding of the virus and its relationship to a range of reservoirs including the spread of fox rabies [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], dog rabies [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and bat rabies [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Different fragments of the RABV genome have been used for phylogenetic analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-01911-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Most studies focus on a partial fragment [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] or the complete nucleoprotein coding sequence [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Other sequences selected include the phosphoprotein gene [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] or the glycoprotein-L protein intergenic region [
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. There is no consensus on the most appropriate fragment of the rabies virus genome to use and different regions of the genome appear to give similar results [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].
