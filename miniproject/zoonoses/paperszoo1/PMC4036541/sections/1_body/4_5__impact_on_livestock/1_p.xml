It has been conjectured that the European conquest of the New World had a major impact on the vampire bat due to the introduction of livestock, which proved a highly accessible target for vampire predation. Vampire bats show a preference for livestock, particularly larger animals such as cattle, horse and sheep because they tend to remain inactive and stationary at night, in contrast to indigenous wildlife. Also livestock herds tend to remain in the same location and vampires are capable of relocating the same site over many nights. The direct effect of vampire bat predation is to weaken individual animals, especially juveniles, if the animal is subject to repeated attacks over a short period. This in turn can lead to increasing susceptibility to other diseases. Wounds can be attacked by screw-worm flies (
