<p>Bats have been associated with a large range of zoonotic viruses [
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-06-01911" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, the most severe disease transmitted to livestock by vampire bats is rabies. This is a persistent problem throughout Latin America. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="viruses-06-01911-t002">Table 2</xref> shows that the major burden of bovine rabies due to vampire bats is found in Brazil although the numbers from 2002 are considerably lower at 1321 than the 5900 recorded in 1982. This high number of rabies cases from Brazil reflects the large numbers of livestock in the country. Total bovine rabies cases peaked in 1983 at 7959 but reduced dramatically to below 1000 cases in 1989.
