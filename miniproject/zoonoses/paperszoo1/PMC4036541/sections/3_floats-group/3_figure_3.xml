 <caption>
  <p>Schematic of the rabies virus genome showing transcription of the five genes to form the nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, matrix, glycoprotein and polymerase or L gene. Sections of the genome that are commonly used for phylogenetic analysis of rabies viruses are indicated: (1) Complete nucleoprotein coding sequence; (2) partial nucleoprotein coding sequence; (3) nucleoprotein-phosphoprotein intergenic region; (4) complete glycoprotein coding sequence; (5) glycoprotein-L intergenic region. </p>
