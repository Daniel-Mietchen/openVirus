  <p>Design of oligonucleotides for henipavirus N-gene- (a) and P-gene- (b) specific microsphere array assays. Representative virus sequences are HeV (NC_001906), NiV-Malaysia (NC_002728), and NiV-Bangladesh (AY988601). Sequence gaps (sequences not displayed) outside target regions are indicated by //. Regions of sequence identity are marked by dash (-) and differences are marked (

   </sup>) in the primer target regions. PCR primers forward (D-358) and reverse (D-368) are flanking the 375 nucleotide N-gene amplicon, and PCR primers forward (D-550) and reverse (D-551) are flanking the 97 nucleotide P-gene amplicon. Only the gene-specific target sequences and not the TAG extensions are displayed for TSPE primers (D-676, D-679, D-680, and D-641). All TSPE primers were designed to extend in forward orientation.
