  <p>Diagnostic performance characteristics of microsphere array assays. Accuracy of microsphere array assays specific for the henipa N-gene (a, b) and henipa P-gene (c, d) was determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (a, c) using qPCR assay as reference standard. Distribution of positive (1) and negative (0) values are shown (b, d).</p>
