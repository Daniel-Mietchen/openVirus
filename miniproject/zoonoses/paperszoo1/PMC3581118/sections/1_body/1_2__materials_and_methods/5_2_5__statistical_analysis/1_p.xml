<p>Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel 2007 and MedCal Version 12.3.0.0. ROC curve analysis was performed using 77 positive and 61 negative samples by qPCR for the henipa N- and P-gene microsphere array assay. For this analysis infected and noninfected horses were given the statuses 1 and 0, respectively. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) was 0.948 for the henipa N (at cutoff &gt; 488MFI) and 0.893 for the P-gene microsphere array assay (at a cut-off of &gt; 523MFI). In the ROC analysis, values of 0.9 &lt; AUC &lt; 1 are considered highly accurate. A perfect test with a Se and Sp of 100% would have an AUC of 1 and be in the upper left corner of the graph [

An interactive dot diagram was plotted using results of the henipa N- and P-gene microsphere array assays in relation to the infected (1) and noninfected (0) category, to show false negative and false positive results at cut-offs with highest combined Se and Sp.
