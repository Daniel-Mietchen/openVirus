<p>A HeV N-gene-specific qPCR assay [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] was used for comparative assessment of the microsphere assays. Assay conditions and oligonucleotides were as described in the paper. Cut-off values were cycle threshold (CT) ≤ 40 for positive and CT ≥ 45 for negative. Results with CT values between 40 and 45 were deemed indeterminate.
