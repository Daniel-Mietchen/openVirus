<p>For ROC curve analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), all of the samples positive in the N-gene henipa-specific microsphere assay were also positive in the HeV specific N-gene assay and none of these were found to be positive in the NiV-specific N-gene assay. HeV-specific positive and negative values in all assays were generally well separated, so changes from optimal cutoff values did not significantly change results in a ROC curve analysis (results not shown). For the N-gene henipa-specific assay the optimal ROC curve calculated cutoff MFI = 488 yielded sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) readings of 92.2 (95% CI 83.8–97.1) and 98.4 (95% CI 91.2–100.0), respectively (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(b)</xref>). For the P-gene henipa-specific assay the calculated optimal cutoff MFI 523 gave an Se of 84.4 (95% CI 74.4–91.7) and an Sp of 98.3 (95% CI 90.9–100.0) (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(c)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(d)</xref>). The analysis of Sp and Se data for the HeV-specific assay showed near identical results to the generic henipa N-gene assay (data not shown). The ROC curve determined that negative cut-offs for all four assays were also found to exceed the highest MFI values obtained in an analysis of 40 presumed HeV negative horse swab samples in each assay. Direct comparison of all assays by ROC curve analysis using qPCR assay as reference standard identified the Henipa and HeV N-gene assays as the best performers for HeV detection. Assay accuracy for the henipa N, HeV-N and henipa P-gene assays was 0.941, 0.940, and 0.874, respectively, for samples 
 <italic>n</italic> = 96 samples (qPCR confirmed), increasing to 0.948, 0.946, and 0.893 for 
 <italic>n</italic> = 136 samples including 40 presumed negative samples unconfirmed by qPCR.
