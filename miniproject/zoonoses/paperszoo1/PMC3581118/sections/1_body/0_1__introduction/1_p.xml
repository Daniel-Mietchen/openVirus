<p>Bats harbour a wide range of viruses that have been implicated in spill over events into other mammalian hosts resulting in highly virulent and often fatal zoonoses. Henipa-, filo-, lyssa-, and coronaviruses are some of the most notable examples [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The henipaviruses HeV and NiV are bat-borne paramyxoviruses which have been responsible for severe disease outbreaks in humans, horses, and pigs [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. HeV was first identified in Australia in 1994 as the cause of fatal infection in horses and humans [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The closely related NiV was subsequently identified as the causative agent of infections in pigs and humans in Malaysia in 1998-99 [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The fruit bat (
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> spp.) is the only known natural reservoir of these two viruses. NiV infections in humans have been identified in several countries including Malaysia, Singapore, Bangladesh, and India with mortality up to and exceeding 75% in some of these epidemics [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Evidence for this virus or henipa-like viruses in bat populations in other South-East Asian locations have also been provided [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Henipa-like genomic sequences have also been detected in African bats [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Cedar paramyxovirus (CedPV), a novel henipa-like virus, was recently isolated in Australia [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. HeV is endemic in Australian 
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> bats and can spread directly from bats to horses, causing severe disease. Human HeV infection has so far only resulted from close contact with the blood, body fluids, and tissues of infected horses. Although bats appear to be unaffected by HeV there is a high case-fatality rate in both humans and horses and spill-over events from bats to horses are occurring with increasing regularity [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The wide range of viruses and their enormous genome sequence variation and evolution pose a challenge to the development of molecular diagnostic assays. Although next generation sequencing can identify viruses without any prior knowledge of their sequence [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], this approach is still not practical for screening larger numbers of samples in a diagnostic context. Various combinations of conventional PCR and sequencing, or qPCR, have been used for virus identification [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Highly conserved genes and sequences within, or across, virus species in combination with degenerate PCR primer sequences have broadened the range of viruses detectable by a single PCR [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The nature of these generic PCR assays necessitates the use of highly degenerate primers which can lead to a reduction in sensitivity and still requires confirmation of any resulting PCR products by DNA sequencing. Nevertheless, qPCR is highly specific, sensitive, and suitable for automation and screening of large sample numbers. However, the limited multiplexing capability of qPCR, typically no more than 2-3 combined assays, requires the setup of various and frequently, constituently different qPCR reactions when screening for multiple viruses. Microsphere suspension array assays offer advantages over qPCR in the level of readily achievable multiplexing. This allows for the simultaneous screening of many targets (up to 100 markers in the Luminex system) in a single reaction and has become a valuable tool for investigation of disease syndromes. Various assay panels for nucleic acid detection have been developed for medical or veterinary applications, including respiratory viral diseases [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], gastroenteritis pathogens [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], cystic fibrosis [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], biothreat agents [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and vesicular diseases of livestock [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of the regions of interest forms the first step of these assays. Proprietary polystyrene microspheres that contain dyes displaying distinct spectral characteristics form the substrate for these assays. Luminex MagPlex-TAG microspheres (Luminex Corporation) contain unique 24 nucleotide DNA “antiTAG” sequences covalently coupled to their surface. This facilitates hybridization of specifically amplified and labeled products containing complementary “TAG” sequences and allows identification by association with particular microsphere sets in a flow cytometry-based detection system. Microsphere suspension array assays can be designed as a modular system and combined into assay panels of increasing complexity to increase the range for detection of different viruses.
