<p>In addition to shifting the locus of research, work like Fuentes's transforms its topography. Mapping the dynamic zones of macaques–human overlap, Fuentes (
 <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) jettisons categories of natural, frontier, and domestic space. This relational approach to viral space is critical. First, because the conditions that trigger pathogenic exchange are multifaceted and persistent. Moreover, recent work in genetics suggest that zoonoses may only emerge and become established in human populations after repeated, unsuccessful, transmissions—or processes of what Wolfe et al. (
 <xref rid="b126" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) term “viral chatter.”

 <xref rid="b108" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), arising from particular configurations of social, biotic, and material conditions, through “naturecultural corridors”—as Fuentes puts it (
