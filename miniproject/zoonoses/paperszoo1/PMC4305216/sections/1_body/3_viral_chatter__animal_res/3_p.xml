<p>The intertwined processes of resource extraction, political instability, and food scarcity clearly have a significant impact on why and how people hunt and eat potentially infectious animals (Leach and Hewlett 
 <xref rid="b75" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). A few qualitatively inclined studies have extended those insights to explore the social organization of bushmeat markets (Bowen-Jones et al. 
 <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Tee et al. 
 <xref rid="b113" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and the specific way ways in which animals are handled, priced, and sold (East et al. 
 <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Mendelson et al. 
 <xref rid="b86" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; van Vliet and Mbazza 
 <xref rid="b115" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Wilkie and Carpenter 
 <xref rid="b123" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). However, these studies are analytically constrained by their normative orientation: Because hunting is understood primarily as a risk to public health (and biodiversity), the symbolic significances, social relations, and affective dimensions of killing, butchering, and eating wild animals are generally left unexplored.
