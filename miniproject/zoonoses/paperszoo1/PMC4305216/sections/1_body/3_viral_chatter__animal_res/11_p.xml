<p>Consider the recent research by Leroy et al. (
 <xref rid="b76" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) into an Ebola outbreak in the DRC in the spring of 2007. In an effort to reconstruct the primary transmission event, the team began their search with the first confirmed Ebola death: a 55-year-old woman, who lived in one of an agglomeration of 10 villages that constituted the epicenter of the epidemic. They discovered that the village where she lived—like others in the region—had a “twin” village, about a three-to four-hour walk into the forest. Products of post-independence welfare policies, village settlements in the DRC were erected along the main road to facilitate access to public services. However, the population never fully relocated from their original dwellings, continuing to use their former homes as a base for hunting and agriculture. These twin villages also serve as the base for another population: each spring, a large number of bats (including two of the three species capable of carrying Ebola) come to feed on the palm tree nuts of an abandoned colonial-era palm oil plantation nearby.
