<p>The study of hunting practices thus demands an integration of ecological, economic, symbolic, and post-structuralist perspectives (Giles-Vernick and Rupp

 <xref rid="b107" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>), the effort of these new anthropological theorizations is, rather, to explore the “consubstantiality” between animal behaviors and human culture (Croll et al. 
 <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). Scrambling conventional oppositions between traditional and modern, protection and predation, nature and culture, in these accounts, animals are understood as “selves” (Kohn

 <xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), or “kin” (Fausto 
 <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and hunting is construed as a form of sexual seduction (Willerslev 
 <xref rid="b124" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), “progeneration” (Brightman 
 <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>) or a mode of ontological transformation (Brightman et al.
