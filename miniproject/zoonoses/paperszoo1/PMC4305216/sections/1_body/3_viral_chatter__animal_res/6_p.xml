<p>We cannot do justice to the theoretical diversity or conceptual thickness of this literature here, but let us point to two key contributions it can make to an anthropology of VHF. The first point relates to the inextricable and mutual entanglement of species: “In episodes of hunting” writes Tim Ingold, “the trails of human and animal cross and … each leaves bearing something of the substance of the other” (Ingold

However, when the social dimensions of transmission become the focus of study, the nonhuman forms of agency involved in pathogen exchange disappear. Understanding animals as co-participants rather than as vessels of disease could go a long way toward re-perceiving the varied encounters that lead to transmission.
