<p>There is reasonable consensus that fruit bats are reservoirs for Ebola and Marburg, while the multimammate rat carries Lassa. Outbreaks of Ebola and Marburg have generally involved hunting and butchering non-human primates, which, like humans, can become hosts for the virus. However, there have been cases of infection through handling other dead animals including antelopes and porcupines.
