<p>In all three diseases, symptoms are diverse, ranging from high temperature, diarrhea, lethargy, shivering and aches, respiratory, and gastric problems. This variability poses diagnostic challenges; the frequency with which Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa are confused with malaria, influenza, or other diseases endemic to the area complicates prognosis (Kuhn
