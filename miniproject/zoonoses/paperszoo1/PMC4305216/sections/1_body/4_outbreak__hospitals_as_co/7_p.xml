<p>Existing work in medical anthropology, especially around the material artifacts of institutionalized medicine, provides a powerful example of the potential insights gained from an ethnographic sensibility to the co-production of medical and social contexts. For example, medical anthropologists have documented the ways in which the use of protective materials (such as gloves) in hospital settings can be influenced by a range of factors including prior relationships, fear of infection, and the desire to appear to be a modern medical practitioner. Work that one of the authors carried out in Kenya (Brown 
 <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>:22) documented that, when in short supply, protective gear was sometimes used for long periods of time, and to care for many patients, thus protecting health staff but increasing the risk of infection. Meanwhile, health workers managing a Marburg epidemic in Uige, Angola, were less inclined to wear protective clothing when nursing family members and fellow health workers than when nursing other kinds of patients, despite awareness of the risks involved (Borchert et al.
