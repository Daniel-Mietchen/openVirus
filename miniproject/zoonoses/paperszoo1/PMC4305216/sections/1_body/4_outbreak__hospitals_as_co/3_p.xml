<p>Moving beyond a notion of the hospital as a space within which ever-more protective barriers are erected to distance clinical care from everyday life, a logic exemplified by the image above, a spatialized ethnographic engagement draws attention to the divergent practices of care and protection that shape institutional spaces.

Placing such insights within fine-grained ethnographic accounts of the institutional histories and symbolic meanings of clinical spaces would further nuance our understanding of transmission dynamics.
