<p>For some time, hospital ethnographers have criticized understandings of hospitals as sites formed primarily by the culture of biomedicine. Building on post-structuralist spatial logics (e.g., Ingold 
 <xref rid="b58" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Massey 
 <xref rid="b83" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), they have developed rich descriptions of the diverse socioâ€“spatial practices that shape medical institutions (Brown

 <xref rid="b111" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Considered alongside recent anthropological analyses of

 <xref rid="b122" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), these resources help underline the relevance of recent theoretical approaches in anthropology for understanding the dynamic encounters between people, institutional spaces, and nonhumans that can transform hotspots into sites for viral amplification (see Figure
