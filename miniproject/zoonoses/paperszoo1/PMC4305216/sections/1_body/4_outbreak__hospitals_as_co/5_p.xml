<p>Much of this social science literature reinforces an analytical separation between the community and the hospital. Like research on bushmeat consumption, community-focused research has prioritized local beliefs and practices, detailing disease classification and burial practices (see also Boumandouki et al. 
 <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Lamunu et al. 
 <xref rid="b71" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>:31). Hospital-based research, in contrast, has focused on infection control and isolation, including fears of contagion and the protocols of hospital burial (Guimard et al. 
 <xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Jeffs et al. 
 <xref rid="b61" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Lamunu et al. 
 <xref rid="b71" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Okware et al. 
 <xref rid="b96" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Only a very small number of accounts describe the clinical management of outbreaks from the perspective of the international scientists organizing these interventions (Guimard et al. 
 <xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Jeffs et al. 
 <xref rid="b61" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; KerstiÃ«n and Matthys 
 <xref rid="b65" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) or the indigenous health workers providing patient care (Borchert et al. 
 <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Guimard et al. 
 <xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>).
