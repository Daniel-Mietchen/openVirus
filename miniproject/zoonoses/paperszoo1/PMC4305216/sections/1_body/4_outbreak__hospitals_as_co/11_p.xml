<p>Our program for future research extends these analytical frameworks. Conceptualizing the hotspot in the hospital gives empirical priority to the ways in which clinical spaces and objects dynamically emerge through medical encounters. Like the monkey park, hospitals are a composite of diverse and divergent interactions; the materiality of medical therapies, instruments, or diseases is brought into being through diverse socio–spatial practices (Mol 
 <xref rid="b93" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>:5). Take gloves for example: A standard tool of barrier nursing, gloves are used to prevent contamination of caregivers and patients; their effectiveness hinges on their rapid disposal. But in situations where the availability of medical instruments is erratic, gloves continue to perform modern care and appropriate practice, even when used repeatedly. Further, when nursing a family member or even a friend, the restraints gloves place on intimacy can be more important than the barriers they provide against contagion; during these interactions, they become something else entirely—a form of social distance, a mechanism of detachment.
