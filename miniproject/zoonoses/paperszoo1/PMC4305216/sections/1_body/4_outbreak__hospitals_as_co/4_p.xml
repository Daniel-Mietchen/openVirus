<p>Understandably, high numbers of hospital fatalities, the isolation of infected patients, and the use of full-body protective garb can produce considerable unease. In a number of outbreak situations, patients fled hospitals and refused to refer loved ones for treatment (Guimard et al. 
 <xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Partly in response to this sort of behavior, a central theme of the socialâ€“scientific literature on secondary transmission has been to reflect on the lessons learned from past outbreaks and to restore faith in hospitals as sites of emergency care. Some studies have focused on the challenges of disease management, communicating health warnings, monitoring cemeteries, and constructing isolation wards (e.g., Jeffs et al. 
 <xref rid="b61" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Roddy et al. 
 <xref rid="b106" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), often drawing attention to the rumors that circulate around interventions and impede public health and hospital-based attempts to manage epidemics (Borchert et al.

Surveys, focus groups, and structured interviews have been used to ascertain the perspective of these people as well as experiences of stigma faced by those who survive (De Roo et al.
