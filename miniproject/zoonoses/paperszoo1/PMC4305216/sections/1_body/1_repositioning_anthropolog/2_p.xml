<p>These studies have not only succeeded in improving the effectiveness of VHF management but also in normalizing the inclusion of anthropological perspectives in public health interventions during an epidemic (Leach

The work focuses almost exclusively on interactions between humans and on the impact of cultural practices, such as caregiving, burial, and local etiologies on disease management. As a result, this body of research largely omits social engagements with material, institutional, and animal worlds. Such accounts reflect a lingering tradition in anthropology, particularly within the study of medicine and disease, to label only certain parts of human life as “social,” thus excluding critical dimensions of practice from ethnographic analysis (see Mol
