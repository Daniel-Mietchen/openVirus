<p>In contrast, this article elaborates a concern with global political economy through an ethnographic engagement with intimate encounters. We employ the hotspot as an analytical tool to mark out sites where different variants of human–animal–nonhuman entanglements facilitate the movement of pathogens. In disease ecology, the notion of the hotspot has been developed as a way of interrogating the spatial heterogeneity of pathogen transmission, drawing attention to sites where transmission is amplified through particular characteristics of individuals, populations and/or environments within dense relational webs (DeGroote et al.

An analysis of the hotspot foregrounds the varied and disproportionate nature of transmission by analyzing the role of “super spreaders”—the Typhoid Marys and Broad Street Pumps—within ecological contexts that transform disease dynamics and create the conditions for outbreak (Lloyd-Smith et al.
