<p>Recent inquiries into the discourses, technologies, and institutional practices of biosecurity provide another entry point into the study of VHF. Informed by the work of Michel Foucault, this strand of research begins precisely with the technical and logistical dimensions of VHF response that a focus on traditional culture tends to bracket out (e.g., Bass

 <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Briggs 
 <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Leach 
 <xref rid="b73" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). These approaches provide considerable insight into the geopolitical underpinnings of VHF surveillance—how, for instance, the technologies and agendas of global health are shaped by the war on terror (Collier et al. 
 <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) or by changing imaginaries of “global health” (King 
 <xref rid="b66" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Wald 
 <xref rid="b118" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). However, in training their analysis on the rhetorics and ideologies of “emergence” they do not offer much purchase on the everyday texture of VHF transmission.
