<p>Our theorization of the hotspot brings together the analytical advances of multi-species anthropology (e.g., Haraway 
 <xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Kirksey and Helmreich 
 <xref rid="b68" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Raffles 
 <xref rid="b102" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), post-structuralist approaches to space (e.g., Low 
 <xref rid="b81" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Massey 
 <xref rid="b83" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), and studies in material culture (e.g., Appadurai 
 <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Miller 
 <xref rid="b91" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Bringing together this suite of critical resources also provides an opportunity to revisit literature in the anthropology of environment, medical geography, and cultural ecology concerned with the spatial dimensions of human health and behavior (Dunn 
 <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">1968</xref>; Meade 
 <xref rid="b84" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>; Pavlovskii 
 <xref rid="b98" ref-type="bibr">1966</xref>). Although their foci differ, these scholars share a concern with the matrix of human and non-human relations that constitute social life and use these entanglements to trouble traditional categories of analysis. We draw on these varied intellectual projects to better apprehend the dynamics of VHF transmission.
