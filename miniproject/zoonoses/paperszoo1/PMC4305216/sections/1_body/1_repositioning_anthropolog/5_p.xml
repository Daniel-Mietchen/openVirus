<p>Our approach to VHF develops this concern with the multiple and intersecting spatio–temporal processes that shape transmission. But rather than model those dynamics or map assemblages, we seek to open them to ethnographic scrutiny. The analytical task is partly one of empirical extension: An anthropology of the hotspot investigates social practice within a series of biotic and material encounters—giving equal ethnographic weight, say, to experiences with illness and the construction of grain stores (a welcoming home for rats). The greater conceptual challenge is to do justice to the characteristics of the hotspot that defy scalar logics—the interpenetration of environmental transformation and immunological responses and the intricate and contingent assemblage of animal behaviors, food shortages, and global health policy (Hinchliffe
