<p>Studying the hotspot ethnographically locates transmission within dynamics that may include ecological abundance and economic scarcity, social proximity and administrative distance, convergence and fragmentation, excess and lack. But futher, as we describe in greater depth below, it shifts focus away from establishing causal patterns and instead to the persistent and shifting spatial, material, and historical co-presences that shape viral amplification. The hotspot does not provide the context of transmission, but is rather a “context in action” (Lezaun and Woolgar
