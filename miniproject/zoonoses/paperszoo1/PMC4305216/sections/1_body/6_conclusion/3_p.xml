<p>Finally, by bringing together sites and practices traditionally held apart within and beyond anthropology, the hotspot opens up possibilities for new forms of collaboration between anthropologists, ecologists, and disease managers. Conceptualizing expertise as falling into discrete domains—bat bodies and ape behavior, the genetic make-up of a virus and the rate of deforestation, hunting practices and hospital hygiene—has considerable limitations. We hope that extending the ethnographic scope of engagements with VHF will also enable a rethinking of the terms of interdisciplinary exchange. A robust multi-dimensional approach to public health interventions rests on drawing together distinct ways of knowing rather than integrating different objects of knowledge. This collaborative zone is, perhaps itself a hotspot, where ideas can move between hosts as they approximate (or make proximate) their differing knowledge practices.</p>
