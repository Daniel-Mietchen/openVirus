<p>In this article, we have sought to mark out a terrain for future ethnographic engagements with VHF by drawing on insights from multispecies ethnography, studies in material culture, and post-structuralist understandings of space. Through greater attention to the social and material interpenetration of “risky” spaces—hospitals, homes, the bush, the market—during and outside of outbreak situations—we can develop richer accounts about the spread of VHF across sites and scales of encounter. The theoretical concept of the hotspot provides a heuristic to explore the divergent and complex forms of material proximity that encourage viral movement, and is indicative of ways in which these different anthropological conversations might be made relevant to public health.</p>
