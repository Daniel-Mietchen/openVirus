<p>The distinct human, animal, political, and institutional practices that shape hotspots mark out both the differences of these arenas and their entangled material and historical proximities. The purpose of researching the hotspot ethnographically is not to arrive at a more precise explanation of an outbreakâ€”a more complete picture of how, where, and when a virus moved across bodies and space. Rather, in eschewing the assumption of a stable and singular context of disease, an ethnography of the hotspot would elucidate the interactivity of pathogenic things and places through processes of transmission.</p>
