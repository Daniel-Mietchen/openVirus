<p>This is where the hotspot provides analytical mileage. The concept captures the complex relationality of VHF: the heterogeneous interactions between individuals, populations, and environments that lead to an outbreak. It elaborates these contextures across multiple scales, but without flattening them into a static network of connection. The hotspot denotes a thickening of fields; a layering of the relational possibilities and intensities that occasion transmission. For what is at issue is not simply that there are many different factors—ecological, economic, social, and political—that trigger and shape the spread of disease. Rather, outbreaks are the product of latent relations, the contingent convergence of pathogenic potentials. The hotspot does not stabilize an outbreak narrative but rather draws attention to the sudden, ephemeral, and material concurrences between humans, animals, non-humans, institutions, and pasts that occasion contagion. It is not a means of prospectively or retrospectively specifying the factors that might lead (or have led) to transmission, but a way of alerting us to the radical and contingent relationality through which outbreaks emerge.</p>
