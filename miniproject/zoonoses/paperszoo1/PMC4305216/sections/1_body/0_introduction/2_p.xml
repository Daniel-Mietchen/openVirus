<p>Despite the prominent place of VHF outbreaks in Africa in the popular imagination, Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa fevers have, in large part, eluded anthropological analysis. Arguably, the dearth of ethnographic data on VHFs is due to the challenges of conducting fieldwork in an epidemic—both in terms of the risk to the anthropologist and the coincidence entailed in “being there” when an outbreak occurs. As in other emergency settings, the urgency for immediate action to control VHFs runs counter to the demands of a time-consuming and slow-paced research methodology.</p>
