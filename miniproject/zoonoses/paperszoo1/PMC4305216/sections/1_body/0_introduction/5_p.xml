<p>Staking out that terrain is only a first step. To come to grips with the significance of viral encounters—their virulence and their social meaning—requires not simply more ethnography or a contextualization of existing knowledge but a reconceptualization of the anthropological field of analysis. Borrowing a term from disease ecology and building on anthropological efforts to describe the interactions between different diseases within specific environmental and socioeconomic contexts (e.g., Singer 
 <xref rid="b108" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), we offer the 
 <italic>hotspot</italic> as a possible heuristic for analyzing the complex relationalities that drive VHF transmission. While VHF refers to a disease category, the hotspot speaks to the temporary convergence of rainfall, political designs, cat populations, armed conflict, economic strategies, agricultural techniques, built environments, and practices of care that create the conditions for disease communicability. The hotspot draws on an ecological imaginary that takes us past the singular moment of viral contact into ‘the assemblages of diseases’ and their attendant medical geographies (Audy 
 <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">1954</xref>:962) shaped by diverse social and ecological contexts (e.g., Dunn and Janes 
 <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Herring and Swedlund 
 <xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) but remains anchored by an ethnographic preoccupation with the intimate textures of transmission. In short, as opposed to what Patricia Wald terms an “outbreak narrative” or “the formulaic plot that begins with the identification of emerging infection, [and] includes a discussion of the global networks throughout which it travels” (2008:2), the hotspot speaks to the mundane interactions that create the conditions of pathogenic possibility.
