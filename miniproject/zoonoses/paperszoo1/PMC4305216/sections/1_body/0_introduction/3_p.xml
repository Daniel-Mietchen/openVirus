<p>Similar investigative constraints inform the substance and scope of this article. Our arguments do not draw from ethnographic fieldwork during an outbreak but rather from the experience of devising a program for collaborative research into the dynamics and management of VHFs in sub-Saharan Africa. Our efforts to delineate an ethnographic contribution that would both support and extend the activities of our colleagues—biologists, ecologists, virologists, mathematical modelers, and public health experts—prompted reflection on the potential of our discipline to analytically cut across the diverse lives, materials, places, and practices that influence transmission dynamics. 
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">4</xref> This article develops those insights into a theoretical framework for future anthropological studies of VHFs.
