<p>We elaborate this approach in five sections. We begin by summarizing existing anthropological research into VHFs and suggest areas for methodological development. We then briefly outline the virology of VHFs: the human–animal interactions that lead to what is referred to as “primary transmission” and the forms of contact between humans and between humans and fomites (inanimate objects or substances capable of transmitting the virus) that account for “secondary transmission.” The distinction between primary and secondary transmission cues the discussions in the third and fourth sections, where we situate these two routes in social space and in so doing hint at the possibility of a symmetrical analysis.</p>
