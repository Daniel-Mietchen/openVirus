<p>The problems that define the global health agenda are linked to transnational determinates: urbanization, migration, war, market integration, environmental degradation, and climate change. The scale and pace of these processes, their extraterritorial distribution, and political dislocation create the conditions for new and/or drug-resistant pathogenic strains, threatening explosive pandemics and persistent plagues (Farmer

 <xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Perhaps the most feared of these emerging diseases are viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs)—a broad class of zoonotic infections present in diverse settings. We focus on three VHFs found in sub-Saharan Africa: Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa fevers.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref> These VHFs are highly pathogenic, contagious, and, according to post–September 11 U.S. policy, potential bioterrorist agents (Polesky and Bhatia

 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2">2</xref> Although few experts believe it likely that these viruses will trigger wide-scale outbreaks, the potential of VHFs to cross species boundaries with little warning continues to fuel apocalyptic visions of viruses raging from remote African villages to global metropolises, killing millions in a matter of days (Wolfe
