<p>Our argument proceeds by bringing together the extensive, but highly fragmented, social science literature on VHFs and examining these contributions alongside the few but influential anthropological investigations on VHF outbreaks. To date, what epidemiologists call secondary transmission (human to human) has received far greater empirical attention than primary transmission (animal to human); however, scholarship on either topic is ethnographically thin by anthropological standards. Synthesizing insights from a range of qualitatively inclined sources—social science journals, papers in agricultural studies, NGO reports, ecological surveys, public health guidelines, memoirs, and even brief asides in epidemiological articles—and critically reading them against relevant anthropological research offers a way of “thickening” existing literature.
