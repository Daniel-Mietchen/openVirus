<p>For our interaction studies, we used NS1 proteins of influenza viruses that are not able to bind CPSF30. This facilitates the interpretation of the results, as their expression is not associated with inhibition of general host protein expression. However, we have also shown that the NS1 proteins of the Tx91 and Pan99 strains, which were previously shown to interact with CPSF30
