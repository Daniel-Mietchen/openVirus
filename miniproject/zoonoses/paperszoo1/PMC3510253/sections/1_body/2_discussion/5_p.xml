<p>The NS1 mutant E96A/E97A was previously reported to lack human TRIM25 binding but retained dsRNA binding 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Gack2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Our results showed that the E96A/E97A NS1 mutant, but not the R38A/K41A mutant, efficiently interacted with mouse Riplet, suggesting that the region in NS1 important for dsRNA binding is needed for interaction with mouse Riplet. Alternatively, the interaction between NS1 and mouse Riplet could be mediated by viral RNA.
