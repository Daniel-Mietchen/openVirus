<p>Our work raises an important question: why does NS1 target Riplet instead of TRIM25 in mouse cells? Our results combined with previous studies

 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> suggest that although both TRIM25 and Riplet contribute to optimal activation of both mouse and human RIG-I, their requirement might be different in human and mouse cells. Our experiments in 
 <italic>TRIM25 −/−</italic> cells showed that whereas human RIG-I 2CARD ubiquitination is undetectable in 
 <italic>TRIM25 −/−</italic> cells, mouse RIG-I 2CARD showed residual ubiquitination under these conditions. In addition, knockdown of endogenous Riplet in mouse cells strongly decreased RIG-I full-length ubiquitination. Taken together, this suggests that while TRIM25 is the primary E3 ligase for human RIG-I ubiquitination, in mouse other ubiquitin E3 ligases including Riplet may play a crucial role for RIG-I ubiquitination-dependent activation. Under this scenario, in mouse cells NS1 must target Riplet for efficient inhibition of RIG-I signaling (

The mechanistic differences by how influenza virus NS1 inhibits the RIG-I pathway in human and mouse cells indicate that caution should be used to appropriately interpret future experiments on host responses during influenza virus infection using the mouse model.
