<p>Furthermore, our interaction studies showed that an avian NS1 protein (HK156) strongly and preferentially interacted with chicken TRIM25. Although RIG-I has been reported to be absent in chicken cells 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Barber1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, the fact that avian NS1 efficiently interacted with chicken TRIM25 and that the HK156 virus was a poor inducer of IFN in chicken cells, suggests that this interaction is likely to be functional. In addition, we observed higher levels of IFN induction in chicken cells by SwTx98 recombinant virus correlating with the inability of its NS1 protein to bind chicken TRIM25. Knockdown of TRIM25 in chicken cells resulted in reduced IFN-Î² induction in infected cells, further evidencing that TRIM25 is active and that NS1 targets its function in chicken cells. Importantly, there are no Riplet sequences reported for the chicken or duck genomes, suggesting that influenza A viruses that are maintained in avian species have adapted to coexist with their host by targeting TRIM25, but not Riplet (
