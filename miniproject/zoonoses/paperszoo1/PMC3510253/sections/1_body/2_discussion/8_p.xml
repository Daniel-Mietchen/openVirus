<p>Our study also identified two NS1 proteins from human viruses (Tx91 and Pan99) which efficiently bound to human Riplet. Furthermore, a recombinant virus expressing the Tx91 NS1 protein was more efficient in inhibiting endogenous RIG-I ubiquitination and IFN induction in human cells as compared to PR8 WT virus, whose NS1 protein does not bind human Riplet. These results are in agreement with the high capacity of Tx91 virus to inhibit the antiviral state in human dendritic cells
