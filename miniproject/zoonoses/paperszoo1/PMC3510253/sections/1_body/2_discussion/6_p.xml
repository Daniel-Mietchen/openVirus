<p>In our previous study 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Gack2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, we also showed that the PR8 recombinant virus carrying the E96A/E97A NS1 mutant was able to induce IFN in WT and 
 <italic>TRIM25 +/−</italic> MEFs, but it lost this IFN-inducing capacity in 
 <italic>TRIM25 −/−</italic> cells. In contrast, the R38A/K41A NS1 recombinant virus and a PR8 virus lacking NS1 (ΔNS1 PR8 virus) retained some IFN-inducing capacity in 
 <italic>TRIM25 −/−</italic> cells 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Gack2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Although we cannot completely rule out that in our experiments a low affinity interaction between NS1 and mouse TRIM25 undetectable in our system occurs, the fact that the E96A/E97A mutant virus was able to repress the residual IFN induction in 
 <italic>TRIM25 −/−</italic> cells 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Gack2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> implies that this virus can, at least in part, block IFN induction in mouse in a TRIM25-independent manner. This probably occurs by binding dsRNA and/or by interacting with other host factors including mouse Riplet.
