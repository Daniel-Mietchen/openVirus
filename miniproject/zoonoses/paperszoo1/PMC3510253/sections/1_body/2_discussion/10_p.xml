<p>Taken together, our work suggests that influenza viruses can readily adapt to circumvent the type-I IFN system in different host species by targeting host-specific proteins involved in IFN induction. It stresses the importance of host-specific signaling pathways and immune responses when choosing animal models for studying influenza pathogenicity. Understanding the changes that viruses undergo during adaptation may provide us with better tools to predict potential future pandemics and develop vaccines and antivirals.</p>
