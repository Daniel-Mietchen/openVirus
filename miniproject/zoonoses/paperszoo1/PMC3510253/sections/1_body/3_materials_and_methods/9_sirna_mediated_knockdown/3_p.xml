<p>Knockdown of endogenous TRIM25 in chicken LMH cells (hepatocellular carcinoma cell line), seeded in 24-well plates, was achieved by transfection of a siRNA specific for chTRIM25 
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′-GCGAGAUUUGCUGAGAGCUGAGUUU-3′</named-content> (Invitrogen). As control, LMH cells were transfected with a non-targeting control sequence 
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′-AAGGACGCUGAGGCCUAAUCCUGUU-3′</named-content> (Invitrogen).
