<p>Transient knockdown of endogenous Riplet in mouse Hepa 1.6 and MEF cells, seeded in 6-well plates, was achieved by transfection of siGenome SMARTpool siRNA specific for mouse Riplet (Dharmacon) with Lipofectamine and Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A final concentration of 600 nM of mouse Riplet SMARTpool siRNA, or 600 nM of siGenome non-targeting siRNA (Dharmacon) was used per well. Riplet knockdown efficiency was determined by RT-PCR using specific primers.</p>
