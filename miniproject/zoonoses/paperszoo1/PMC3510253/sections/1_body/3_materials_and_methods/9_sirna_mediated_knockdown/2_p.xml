<p>Knockdown of endogenous human TRIM25 and Riplet in A549 cells was performed in 24-well plates by transfection with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). 10 picomols of siGenome SMARTpool siRNA specific for human TRIM25 or Riplet, or non-targeting control siRNA (Dharmacon) was used. 40 h later, cells were infected with the different influenza viruses at an MOI of 0.1 for 36 h. Cells were then harvested for qPCR analysis.</p>
