<p>Interferon bioassays were conducted as described previously 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Gack2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), seeded in 12-well plates, were infected with the indicated isogenic influenza viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2. At 12 h postinfection, supernatants were harvested and 2-fold dilutions of the influenza virus supernatants prepared. Diluted supernatants were then applied to bioassay using immortalized mouse fibroblast (L929) cells; At 20 h post-treatment, L929 cells were infected with VSV-GFP at an MOI of 2. GFP fluorescence was determined by fluorescence plate reader. Fluorescence values are reported on the y-axis as relative fluorescence units.
