<p>Rescue plasmids encoding the NS segments of A/Swine/Texas/4199-2/98 and A/Hong Kong/156/1997, A/Texas/36/1991 and A/Panama/2007/1999 were generated by cloning the cDNA into the ambisense rescue plasmid pDZ 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Quinlivan1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. The rescue plasmid encoding A/California/4/2009 NS was described previously 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Manicassamy1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Isogenic influenza A viruses (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) harboring the NS segment of A/Swine/Texas/4199-2/98 or A/Hong Kong/156/1997 were rescued by reverse genetics as described elsewhere

 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Fodor1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. The A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 viruses expressing the NS1 R38A/K41A or NS1 E96A/E97A mutant were described previously 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Gack2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. All viruses were amplified in 8-day old, specific pathogen-free embryonated hen's eggs (Charles River Laboratories; North Franklin, CT).
