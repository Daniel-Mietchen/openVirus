<p>HEK293T, Hepa1.6 and MEF cells were lysed in NP40 buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% [v/v] NP40 and protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]) or RIPA buffer (50 mM TRIS-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% [v/v] NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]). GST pull-down and immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Gack1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. For immunoblotting, proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P Millipore or BioRad Laboratories). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-V5 (1∶2,000) (Invitrogen), anti-Flag (1∶5,000) (Sigma), anti-HA (1∶5,000) (Sigma), anti-GST (1∶2,000) (Sigma), anti-TRIM25 (monoclonal; 1∶2,000) (BD Biosciences), anti-TRIM25 (polyclonal; 1∶1,000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-RIG-I (1∶1,000) (Alme-1, Alexis), anti-NS1 (1∶2000) 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Gack2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, anti-β-actin (Abcam; Cambridge, MA). Immunoblots were developed with the following secondary antibodies: ECL anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugated whole antibody from donkey, and ECL anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugated whole antibody from sheep (GE Healthcare; Buckinghamshire, England). The proteins were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce).
