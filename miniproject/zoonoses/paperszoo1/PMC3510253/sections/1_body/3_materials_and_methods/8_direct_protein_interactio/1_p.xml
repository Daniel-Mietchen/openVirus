<p>Recombinant human TRIM25 (described in 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Gack1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>) and mouse TRIM25 purified from XL1blue bacteria as amino-terminal Maltose-Binding Protein (MBP) and carboxy-terminal Flag fusion proteins (MBP-h/mTRIM25-Flag) were incubated with bacteria-produced recombinant GST or GST-NS1 (PR8) in 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% NP40. TRIM25-NS1 protein complexes were then precipitated with Amylose agarose resin (New England Biolabs), and the binding reaction mix was incubated for 4 h at 4Â°C. Precipitated protein complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining.
