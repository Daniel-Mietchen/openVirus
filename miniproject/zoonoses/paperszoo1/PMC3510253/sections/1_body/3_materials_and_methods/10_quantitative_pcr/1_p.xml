<p>Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and subjected to DNAse digestion with Turbo DNase (Ambion). Reverse transcription was performed using the high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Real-time RT-PCR was performed in 384-well plates in triplicate using gene-specific primers and Lightcycler480 SYBR green I master mix (Roche) in a Roche LightCycler 480. Threshold cycles were calculated using the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> derivative max value of every amplification curve. Relative mRNA abundances were calculated using the ΔΔCt method
