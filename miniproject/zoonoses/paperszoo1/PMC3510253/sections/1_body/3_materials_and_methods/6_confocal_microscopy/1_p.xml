<p>HeLa cells were seeded into Lab-Tek II 8-well chamber slides (CC2 Glass slide, Nunc; Rochester, NY). After 12–16 h, plasmids harboring V5-tagged TRIM25, Myc-mRiplet, and/or NS1 plasmids were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at a ratio 1∶1. Six hours posttransfection the medium was changed. 24 h later, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with methanol-acetone (1∶1), permeabilized with 0.5% NP-40 (v/v) in PBS, and blocked with 0.5% BSA 0.2% fish gelatin in PBS. Cells were stained with anti-V5 or anti-Myc and anti-NS1 antibodies as well as DAPI. Secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa-fluor 488 and Alexa-fluor 555 (Invitrogen) were used to visualize the proteins. Images were taken on a Leica SP5 DM confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) at a magnification of 63×. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed at the MSSM-Microscopy Shared Resource Facility.</p>
