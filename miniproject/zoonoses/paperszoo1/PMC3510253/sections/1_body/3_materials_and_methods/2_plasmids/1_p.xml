<p>Mammalian expression constructs for untagged NS1 under the control of the chicken β-actin promoter (pCAGGS vector 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Niwa1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>) have been described previously for A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) and R38A/K41A mutant NS1 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Talon1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>), A/Swine/Texas/4199-2/98 (Sw/Tx/98), A/Puerto Rico/8/34 E96A/E97A mutant, and A/Hong Kong/156/1997 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Gack2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, and GST-PR8 and A/California/04/09 NS1 (Cal04) 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Hale2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Human TRIM25-V5, human RIG-I and human GST-RIG-I 2CARD were described in 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Gack2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Mouse TRIM25 was cloned from murine LA-4 cells by Superscript III one-step RT-PCR (Invitrogen) with forward primer (
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′GAATTCACCATGGGCAAACCGATTCCGAACCCGCTGCTGGGCCTGGATAGCACCGCGGAGCTGAATCCTCTGGCC-3′</named-content>) and reverse primer (
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′CCTCTCTATCTGCTCCAAATAGGGATCC-3′</named-content>). The forward primer includes an EcoRI site and V5 sequence, and the reverse primer includes a BamHI site. V5-tagged mouse TRIM25 cDNA was then subcloned into the EcoRI/BglII sites of the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS. Chicken TRIM25 was cloned from primary chicken embryo fibroblasts by Superscript III one-step RT-PCR with forward primer (
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′- GAATTCACCATGGGCAAACCGATTCCGAACCCGCTGCTGGGCCTGGATAGCACCGCGACGTTGACCAAAGCTCAGTC-3′</named-content>) and reverse primer (
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′- GGCACTGTTCTCTCTCTCTGGTAACTCGAG-3′</named-content>). The forward primer includes an EcoRI site and V5 sequence, and the reverse primer includes a XhoI site. V5-tagged chicken TRIM25 cDNA was then subcloned into the same sites of pCAGGS. For the generation of V5-tagged human/mouse TRIM25 chimera, the coiled-coil region of TRIM25 (aa191–379) was amplified using human TRIM25-V5 plasmid as template, and then ligated into the BstBI sites of the mouse TRIM25 sequence in the pCAGGS vector. The Myc/DDK-tagged pCMV6 mouse Riplet was purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD). The reporter plasmid carrying the firefly luciferase (FF-Luc) gene under the control of the IFN-β promoter (p125Luc) was kindly provided by Takashi Fujita (Kyoto University, Japan) 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Yoneyama1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. The reporter plasmid carrying the 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase gene (REN-Luc/pRL-TK) was purchased from Promega, WI. All sequences were verified by sequencing.
