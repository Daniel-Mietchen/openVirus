<p>Hepa1.6 cells, WT MEFs and 
 <italic>TRIM25 −/−</italic> MEFs were transfected in 24-well plates (Falcon, Becton Dickinson, NJ) with 50 ng of IFN-β reporter plasmid, 20 ng of Renilla luciferase and 10 ng NS1 plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 at a ratio 1∶2. 24 h later, cells were lysed and dual-luciferase assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Luciferase values were normalized to Renilla values, and the fold induction was calculated as the ratio of SeV-stimulated samples, or samples transfected with inducing plasmid versus samples transfected with empty plasmid (no stimulation).
