<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, NS1-PR8 readily bound exogenously expressed mRiplet in HEK293T cells in the presence or absence of SeV infection. We also observed an efficient interaction of NS1 with mRiplet in Hepa1.6 cells infected with the PR8 strain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Immunofluorescence assays further showed that, as seen with human TRIM25, co-expressed mRiplet re-localized NS1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm; approximately 90% of the cells exhibited primarily cytoplasmic NS1 (
