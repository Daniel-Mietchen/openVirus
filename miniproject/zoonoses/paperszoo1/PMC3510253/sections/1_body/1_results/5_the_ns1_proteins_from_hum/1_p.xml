<p>Mice are not a natural host of influenza viruses, but the fact that all NS1 proteins tested interacted with mouse Riplet, including non-mouse adapted NS1 proteins (avian or swine) suggests that this is a conserved evasion mechanism across influenza viruses. Therefore, we tested if human Riplet interacts with the different NS1 proteins in the context of viral infection. Interestingly, the NS1 from human influenza viruses (Tx91 and Pan99) interacted with human Riplet (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g008">Figure 8A</xref>), suggesting that the capacity of NS1 binding to mouse Riplet might reflect an interaction of NS1 with Riplet derived from its specific host. To further demonstrate that the interaction of NS1 with human Riplet is biologically relevant, we compared the capacity of Tx91-NS1 and PR8-NS1 recombinant viruses to inhibit the ubiquitination of human RIG-I (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). We reasoned that Tx91-NS1 that binds both hTRIM25 and hRiplet, should be more efficient in inhibiting RIG-I ubiquitination (and IFN induction) than PR8-NS1 shown to bind only hTRIM25. As predicted, Tx91-NS1 recombinant virus was more efficient in inhibiting human RIG-I ubiquitination as compared to PR8-NS1 virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). Accordingly, Tx91-NS1 recombinant virus induced significantly lower levels of IFN-β mRNA as compared to PR8 virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). Finally, we analyzed IFN-β production in PR8- and Tx91-infected A549 cells upon knockdown of TRIM25, Riplet or both (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g008">Figures 8D and 8E</xref>). siRNA-mediated knockdown reduced TRIM25 and Riplet mRNA levels by approximately 90% and 80%, respectively. Furthermore, the knockdown was highly specific, as targeting TRIM25 did not reduce Riplet mRNA levels and

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g008">Figure 8D</xref>). Silencing of endogenous TRIM25 in PR8-infected cells resulted in a slight but not significant decrease of IFN-β induction as compared to cells transfected with non-silencing control siRNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). In contrast, IFN induction by PR8 was significantly reduced in Riplet-knockdown cells as compared to controls, and almost to the same extent as the levels induced by the Tx91 virus in control cells. These results suggest that while PR8 inhibits IFN induction by targeting TRIM25, the residual IFN induction (not inhibited by the virus) depends mostly on Riplet. Conversely, knockdown of either TRIM25 or Riplet did not have a significant effect on IFN induction in Tx91-infected cells. A significant reduction in IFN-β mRNA levels was only observed in cells in which both TRIM25 and Riplet were silenced (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that both TRIM25 and Riplet are important for IFN-β production in human cells upon influenza virus infection. Furthermore, while PR8-NS1 mainly targets TRIM25 in human cells, Tx91-NS1 interacts with and suppresses both TRIM25 and Riplet for the inhibition of IFN production in human cells.
