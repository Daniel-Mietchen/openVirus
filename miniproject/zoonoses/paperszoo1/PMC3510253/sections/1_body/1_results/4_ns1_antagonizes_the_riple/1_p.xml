<p>We next asked whether NS1 specifically suppresses the Riplet-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-I in murine cells. For this, we examined the endogenous RIG-I ubiquitination in murine Hepa1.6 cells that were transfected with empty vector or Flag-mRiplet together with or without NS1-PR8 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). This showed that exogenous expression of mRiplet markedly enhanced the ubiquitination of endogenous RIG-I, and this ubiquitination was potently suppressed by co-expression of NS1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Consistent with this, ectopic expression of mRiplet led to a 4.6-fold increase of mRIG-I-induced IFN-Î² promoter activation, and this RIG-I activation was inhibited almost to basal levels by co-expressed NS1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Finally, we sought to determine the role of endogenous Riplet in mouse RIG-I ubiquitination, and also addressed whether NS1 specifically antagonizes the mRiplet-induced RIG-I ubiquitination. For this, we examined the ubiquitination of RIG-I in Hepa1.6 cells in which endogenous Riplet was silenced using specific siRNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). 78% knockdown efficiency was achieved as determined by RT-PCR analysis compared to non-silencing control siRNA (data not shown). Specific knockdown of endogenous Riplet strongly decreased endogenous RIG-I ubiquitination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Furthermore, co-expressed NS1 efficiently blocked the ubiquitination of RIG-I in cells transfected with non-silencing control siRNA, while NS1 had no effect on the residual ubiquitination of RIG-I observed in Riplet-knockdown cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). These results collectively demonstrate that Riplet is an important ubiquitin E3 ligase for mouse RIG-I, and that NS1 specifically targets Riplet to inhibit RIG-I ubiquitination in murine cells.
