<p>To further demonstrate that Riplet contributes to the establishment of an efficient antiviral response against influenza virus, we silenced endogenous Riplet in WT or 
 <italic>TRIM25 −/−</italic> MEFs using specific siRNA, and assessed influenza PR8 virus replication (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g007">Figures 7D–7F</xref>). The knockdown of mRiplet was confirmed by RT-PCR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). Infection of 
 <italic>TRIM25 −/−</italic> cells with PR8 virus resulted in higher plaque forming units (PFU) as compared with WT MEF cells, underscoring the important role of TRIM25 for an efficient antiviral response in mouse. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous Riplet in both WT and 
 <italic>TRIM25 −/−</italic> cells yielded significantly higher levels of viral replication compared to transfection of non-silencing siRNA, with the strongest effect observed in 
 <italic>TRIM25 −/−</italic> MEFs in which Riplet was silenced (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). The increased virus replication in Riplet-knockdown MEFs correlated with increased NS1 protein levels in these cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g007">Figure 7F</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that both Riplet and TRIM25 contribute to an effective antiviral response in mouse.
