<p>Finally, we examined the ability of NS1-PR8 to inhibit IFN-β promoter activation in WT MEFs or 
 <italic>TRIM25 −/−</italic> MEFs. As expected, NS1 inhibited SeV-induced IFN-β promoter activation in WT MEFs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). 
 <italic>TRIM25 −/−</italic> MEFs showed a markedly reduced IFN-β promoter activity upon SeV infection as compared to WT MEFs; however there was still detectable IFN-β induction by SeV stimulation. This residual IFN-β induction in 
 <italic>TRIM25 −/−</italic> MEFs was further suppressed by exogenous NS1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g005">Figure 5F</xref>), demonstrating that NS1 inhibits the IFN induction in mouse cells by a TRIM25 independent mechanism.
