<p>Consistent with our previous results 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Gack2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, NS1-PR8 potently inhibited the ubiquitination of GST-fused human RIG-I 2CARD (GST-hRIG-I 2CARD) in HEK293T cells in a dose-dependent manner. In striking contrast, NS1 did not block the ubiquitination of mouse GST-RIG-I 2CARD (GST-mRIG-I 2CARD) in Hepa1.6 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, we analyzed the effect of NS1 on the Sendai virus (SeV)-induced ubiquitination of full-length RIG-I in human HEK293T and murine Hepa1.6 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, exogenously expressed NS1-PR8 effectively suppressed the ubiquitination of full-length RIG-I in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). These results collectively suggest that while NS1 efficiently inhibits the CARD ubiquitination of human RIG-I, it suppresses the ubiquitination of mouse RIG-I by acting on its C-terminal region.
