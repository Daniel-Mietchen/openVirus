<p>Lys172 in the CARDs of human RIG-I (hRIG-I) is essential for RIG-I ubiquitination and activation by TRIM25 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Gack1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, this residue is not conserved in mouse RIG-I (mRIG-I) (Supplemental 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003059.s002">Figure S2</xref>), raising the question whether mRIG-I is ubiquitinated by mTRIM25 as previously reported to occur for human RIG-I. Strikingly, ubiquitination of GST-h2CARD was undetectable in 
 <italic>TRIM25 −/−</italic> MEFs, whereas it was robustly ubiquitinated in wild-type (WT) MEFs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, GST-m2CARD showed a decreased but still detectable ubiquitination in 
 <italic>TRIM25 −/−</italic> MEFs compared to WT MEFs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Reconstitution of 
 <italic>TRIM25 −/−</italic> MEFs with mouse or human TRIM25 showed an increase in both human and mouse RIG-I 2CARD ubiquitination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating that mTRIM25 is active and is able to ubiquitinate the mouse RIG-I CARDs under these conditions at a different Lys residue/s. Interestingly, NS1 inhibited the hTRIM25-dependent ubiquitination of human or mouse RIG-I 2CARD but was unable to inhibit mTRIM25-dependent ubiquitination of human or mouse RIG-I 2CARD (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). In support of this, NS1 co-immunoprecipitated with RIG-I 2CARD only when hTRIM25 was present, but not in the presence of ectopically expressed mTRIM25 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Since NS1 potently inhibited the ubiquitination of full-length mRIG-I (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), we next tested if NS1-PR8 interacts with endogenous RIG-I in non-complemented 
 <italic>TRIM25 −/−</italic> MEFs, or in 
 <italic>TRIM25 −/−</italic> MEFs reconstituted with either human or mouse TRIM25 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). This showed that NS1 readily co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous RIG-I in 
 <italic>TRIM25 −/−</italic> MEFs, and this interaction was further increased in the presence of exogenous human but not mouse TRIM25 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Furthermore, exogenously expressed NS1-PR8 strongly suppressed the SeV-induced ubiquitination of endogenous RIG-I in 
 <italic>TRIM25 −/−</italic> cells in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g005">Figure 5E</xref>), indicating that NS1 binds to mouse RIG-I and inhibits its ubiquitination in a TRIM25-independent manner. We next determined the ubiquitination of endogenous RIG-I in WT and 
 <italic>TRIM25 −/−</italic> MEFs upon PR8 virus infection (Supplemental 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003059.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). This showed that RIG-I ubiquitination was decreased in 
 <italic>TRIM25 −/−</italic> MEFs compared to WT MEFs. Furthermore, PR8 infection markedly reduced the ubiquitination of endogenous RIG-I in both WT MEFs and 
 <italic>TRIM25 −/−</italic> MEFs (Supplemental 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003059.s004">Figure S4A</xref>).
