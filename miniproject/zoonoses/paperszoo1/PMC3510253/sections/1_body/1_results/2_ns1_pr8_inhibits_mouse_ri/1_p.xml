<p>Influenza A viruses lacking functional NS1 proteins induce a robust IFN response, and thus replicate poorly in immunocompetent mice, indicating that NS1 inhibits induction of IFN in mice

 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Gack2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, the same mechanism cannot apply to mouse cells, as NS1 does not interact with mouse TRIM25. In order to gain more insights on the impact of NS1 on mouse RIG-I activation we examined the effect of NS1 on the ubiquitination of human or mouse RIG-I 2CARD in human HEK293T or mouse Hepa1.6 cells (
