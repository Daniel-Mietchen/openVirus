<p>Collectively, these results demonstrate that human TRIM25 is the major ubiquitin E3 ligase for human RIG-I 2CARD and that NS1 inhibits its activity. Our results further indicate that in mouse cells there is an alternative ubiquitin E3 ligase that cooperates with TRIM25 for full activation of mouse RIG-I, and that this alternative ubiquitin E3 ligase is probably targeted by NS1.</p>
