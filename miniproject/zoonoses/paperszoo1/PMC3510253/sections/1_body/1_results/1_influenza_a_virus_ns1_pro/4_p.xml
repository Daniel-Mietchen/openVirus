<p>We next tested whether the inability of the NS1 proteins to bind mTRIM25 correlates with their IFN-inducing activities in mouse cells. For this, we infected murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) with the different NS1 recombinant viruses. IFN-Î² mRNA induction was then determined by qPCR, and IFN protein levels were measured by bioassay (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), all NS1 recombinant viruses induced very low amounts of IFN in MEFs as compared to the R38A/K41A mutant virus, suggesting that NS1 does not require binding to TRIM25 for suppressing IFN induction in murine cells. Binding of NS1 to CPSF30 could also not account for this inhibitory activity in MEFs, as all of these NS1 proteins are deficient in inhibiting CPSF30 and thus general gene expression
