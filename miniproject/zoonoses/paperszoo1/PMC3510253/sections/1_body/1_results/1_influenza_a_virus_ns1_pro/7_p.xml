<p>As previously reported 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Gack2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, overexpressed NS1 localizes primarily to the nucleus with a minor cytoplasmic component; however, co-expressed hTRIM25 led to a marked increase of NS1 cytoplasmic localization, indicative of hTRIM25-NS1 interaction. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g003">Figures 3C and 3D</xref>, ectopic expression of hTRIM25 or mChimT25
 <sub>h191â€“379</sub> markedly re-localized NS1 to the cytoplasm, where they extensively co-localized (92% and 80% of cells with cytoplasmic NS1, respectively). In contrast, co-expression of mTRIM25 that did not interact with NS1 showed only a minor effect on NS1 sub-cellular localization (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g003">Figures 3C and 3D</xref>). These results collectively demonstrate that amino acid changes in the CCD region of mouse TRIM25 are responsible for the loss of interaction with NS1.
