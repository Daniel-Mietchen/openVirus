<p>Consistent with our previous results 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Gack2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) studies in transfected HEK293T cells showed that all tested NS1 proteins efficiently interacted with human TRIM25 (hTRIM25) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, chicken TRIM25 (chTRIM25) bound strongly to NS1-HK156, whereas only a weak or no interaction with chTRIM25 was observed for NS1 from PR8 or Cal04 and SwTx98, respectively (
