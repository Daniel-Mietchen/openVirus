<p>It has been suggested that chicken lacks a functional RIG-I gene 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Barber1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. We thus asked whether chTRIM25 is important for IFN-β induction upon IAV infection, and further tested if the chTRIM25-NS1 interaction is functional. To this end, we silenced endogenous TRIM25 in chicken LMH cells and measured IFN-β mRNA expression upon viral infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g001">Figures 1B–1D</xref>). Specifically, we used recombinant A/PR/8/34 viruses expressing NS1 proteins from PR8, SwTx98, and HK156, which showed differential binding to chTRIM25, as well as a PR8 recombinant virus expressing the NS1 mutant R38A/K41A, known to be deficient in IFN antagonism due to its abolished dsRNA and hTRIM25 binding ability

 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Talon1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Approximately 87% knockdown of chTRIM25 mRNA levels was achieved as determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Compared to mock-infected control cells, IFN-β mRNA was highly up-regulated (∼1500-fold) upon infection with the NS1 mutant R38A/K41A virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This IFN-β induction was significantly reduced in TRIM25-knockdown LMH cells, suggesting that TRIM25 is indeed functional in chicken cells. In addition, IFN-β induction upon infection with PR8, SwTx98 and HK156 recombinant viruses inversely correlated with the ability of their NS1 proteins to bind chTRIM25 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). While PR8 and HK156 were poor inducers of IFN-β mRNA, infection with SwTx98 virus, whose NS1 protein did not bind chTRIM25, resulted in ∼15-fold IFN-β induction. Furthermore, the IFN-β induction by SwTx98 virus was reduced to almost basal levels in TRIM25-knockdown cells, indicating that this virus induces IFN-β gene expression in chicken cells by a mechanism mostly dependent on TRIM25 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). To exclude that the low levels of IFN production induced by the PR8 and HK156 viruses are due to inefficient replication in LMH cells, we measured the mRNA levels of viral M1 by qPCR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). All viruses replicated well, and although only minor differences were observed, the levels of M1 mRNA inversely correlated with the IFN-β inducing activity of these viruses. This suggests that TRIM25 also plays an important role in establishing an antiviral response in chicken cells.
