<p>The CCDs of human and mouse TRIM25 proteins share only 56% identity at the amino acid level (aa 180–450) with major differences between aa 350–400. To test if these amino acid changes in TRIM25 CCD are responsible for the difference in NS1 binding we generated a human/mouse chimeric TRIM25 protein containing amino acids 191–379 of hTRIM25 (mChimT25
 <sub>h191–379</sub>) and analyzed its ability to interact with NS1-PR8 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g003">Figures 3A and 3B</xref>). Co-IP experiments showed that while mTRIM25 did not interact with NS1, hTRIM25 and the mChimT25
 <sub>h191–379</sub> efficiently bound NS1 (
