<p>Mice are frequently used as a model to study influenza pathogenesis. It is therefore important to understand the detailed mechanisms by which influenza virus escapes the immune response in this particular host. Thus, we first sought to confirm the lack of NS1 interaction with mTRIM25. To rule out that the inability of NS1 to bind to mTRIM25 was due to the absence of a co-factor required for NS1-TRIM25-interaction in human cells, we tested the binding of NS1-PR8 to endogenous TRIM25 in PR8-infected human HEK293T and murine Hepa1.6 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). NS1 efficiently interacted with endogenous TRIM25 in HEK293T cells, whereas it did not bind to endogenous TRIM25 in Hepa1.6 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003059-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We also observed an efficient interaction of ectopically expressed NS1 with exogenous hTRIM25, but not with mTRIM25, in HEK293T and Hepa1.6 cells (
