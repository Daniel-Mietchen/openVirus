<p>Given that mammalian and avian TRIM25 proteins show significant differences in their CCD (Supplemental

 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Gack2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, we tested the ability of NS1 encoded by human (A/California/04/09 [Cal04]), avian (A/Hong Kong/156/1997 [HK156]), swine (A/Swine/Texas/4199-2/98 [SwTx98]) and mouse-adapted (A/Puerto Rico/8/34 [PR8]) influenza A viruses to interact with TRIM25 orthologues. To facilitate these studies, we used NS1 proteins that lack the ability to bind CPSF30 and therefore are unable to block general host gene expression
