<p>In this study, we examined the ability of NS1 encoded by human (Cal04), avian (HK156), swine (SwTx98), and mouse (PR8) adapted influenza A viruses to interact with TRIM25 orthologues from mammalian and avian species, and the impact that this interaction has in regulating the RIG-I-mediated type-I IFN response. We found that while NS1 efficiently inhibits TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination and activation in human cells, in murine cells NS1 targets the ubiquitin E3 ligase Riplet to suppress RIG-I ubiquitination and signal transducing activity. Furthermore, we identified that the NS1 proteins of human viruses have evolved to bind and antagonize both human TRIM25 and human Riplet for the potent inhibition of the RIG-I-mediated IFN response.</p>
