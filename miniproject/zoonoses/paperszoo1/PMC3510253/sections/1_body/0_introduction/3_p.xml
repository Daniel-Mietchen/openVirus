<p>Type-I IFNs and other pro-inflammatory cytokines are produced when host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as nucleic acids or other structural components of the microbe

 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Baum1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. RIG-I is composed of two N-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs), a central DExD/H box helicase/ATPase, and a C-terminal regulatory domain (CTD/RD). Under normal conditions, RIG-I is in an inactive, closed conformation. Upon RNA recognition, exposure of the N-terminal CARDs of human RIG-I leads to Lys63-linked ubiquitination on Lys172 induced by tripartite motif 25 (TRIM25) ubiquitin E3 ligase. The ubiquitinated CARDs then allow RIG-I binding to MAVS (also called IPS-1, Cardif, or VISA) and thereby downstream signaling for IRF3 phosphorylation and type-I IFN production
