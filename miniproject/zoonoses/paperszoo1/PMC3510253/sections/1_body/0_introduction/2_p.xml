<p>IAV is an enveloped virus that harbors a negative-strand RNA genome encoding eleven different proteins from 8 separate segments 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Palese1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Individual viral proteins play critical roles in species-specific pathogenicity. For example, the hemagglutinin (HA) protein which binds in a species-dependent manner to sialic acid on host cell membranes; the neuraminidase (NA) protein which is important for viral release; and the polymerase components (PA, PB1, PB2) which are important for efficient replication 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Medina1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The non-structural protein 1 (NS1), which is the product of the smallest RNA segment, acts as a virulence factor by inhibiting host immune responses

 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Krug1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. An important host innate immune mechanism is the production of type-I interferons (IFNs), which can establish an antiviral state by up-regulating interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) that interfere with distinct steps in the viral life cycle
