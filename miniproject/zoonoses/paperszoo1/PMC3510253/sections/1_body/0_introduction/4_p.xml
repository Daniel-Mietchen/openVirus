<p>Many viruses are equipped with specialized mechanisms to suppress the host type-I IFN system. Influenza A viruses through their NS1 protein can inhibit type-I IFN production by various mechanisms, including inhibition of RIG-I

 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Opitz1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and, in some cases suppressing general host gene expression by targeting the 30 kDa subunit of cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF30)

 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Twu1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The importance of this mechanism of antagonism is further supported by the fact that some highly pathogenic viruses encode NS1 proteins that are more efficient in suppressing the host antiviral response. For example, the NS1 protein of the highly pathogenic 1918 virus blocked the expression of IFN-regulated genes more efficiently than the NS1 from influenza A/WSN/33 virus
