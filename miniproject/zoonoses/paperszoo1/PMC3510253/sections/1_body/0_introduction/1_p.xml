<p>Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are highly infectious pathogens that have caused major pandemics and annual epidemics with serious economic and health consequences

 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Molinari1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. IAVs are naturally maintained in avian species but they also circulate in humans, horses, dogs and pigs 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Taubenberger1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Although multigenic host range restrictions exist, a combination of viral determinants can ultimately allow a virus to establish infection in a specific host 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Basler1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This is particularly important because, although the current highly pathogenic avian IAVs that have been transmitted to humans lack the ability to spread from human to human, there is current concern that these avian viruses may adapt and develop the ability to spread efficiently among humans. In this respect, recent studies have demonstrated that only a few mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) allow for transmissibility of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses in ferrets

 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Imai1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Moreover, pigs can be infected with human and avian viruses and provide an environment for reassortment and the generation of new influenza virus strains capable of human transmission 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Therefore, it is essential to better understand the mechanisms that allow influenza viruses to adapt to a new host species, in order to predict and protect from future cross-species transmission.
