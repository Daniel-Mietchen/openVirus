<p>We have recently uncovered the mechanism of RIG-I inhibition by NS1 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Gack2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. NS1 binds to the central coiled-coil (CCD) region of TRIM25 ubiquitin E3 ligase, blocking its oligomerization and enzymatic activity to induce Lys63-linked ubiquitination of the RIG-I CARDs. NS1 thereby inhibits RIG-I CARD-dependent downstream signaling 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Gack2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. However there are differences in PRR signaling components of different species that could impact NS1 immunosuppressive function. For example, mouse RIG-I lacks Lys172, which has been previously shown to be essential for ubiquitination-dependent activation of human RIG-I 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Gack1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In addition, it appears that chicken lacks a functional RIG-I gene 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Barber1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. This host specificity in the RIG-I antiviral signaling pathway may provide a barrier for new incoming viruses, which in turn will need to adapt to inhibit these host-specific immune responses.
