  <title>NS1 proteins from human influenza strains bind and inhibit human Riplet.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) HEK293T cells were transfected with empty vector or HA-tagged human Riplet (HA-hRiplet). At 30 h posttransfection, cells were either mock-treated, or infected with the indicated recombinant A/PR/8/34 viruses at an MOI of 2. 18 h later, WCLs were subjected to IP with anti-HA antibody, followed by immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Tx91 recombinant virus suppresses the endogenous RIG-I ubiquitination more potently than PR8 virus. HEK293T cells, that had been transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin, were either mock-treated, or infected with ΔNS1 PR8, PR8 WT, or Tx91-NS1 recombinant virus at an MOI of 2 for 18 h. WCLs were subjected to IP with anti-RIG-I antibody, followed by IB with anti-HA or anti-RIG-I antibody. Expression of HA-ubiquitin, viral NS1, and Actin was further determined in the WCLs. (
   <bold>C</bold>) A549 cells were infected with PR8-NS1 or Tx91-NS1 recombinant virus at an MOI of 0.1. Cells were collected at the indicated time points and IFN-β mRNA was measured by qPCR. (
   <bold>D and E</bold>) A549 cells were transiently transfected with non-silencing control siRNA (si.C), or with siRNA specific for TRIM25 (si.TRIM25), Riplet (si.Riplet), or both. At 40 h posttransfection, cells were infected with PR8 WT or Tx91 recombinant virus at an MOI of 2 for 30 h. The mRNA levels of TRIM25 and Riplet were measured by qPCR for analyzing their knockdown efficiency (
   <bold>D</bold>). Furthermore, IFN-β mRNA levels were assessed by qPCR (
   <bold>E</bold>).
