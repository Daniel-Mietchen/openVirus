  <title>Chimeric mouse TRIM25 containing the CCD of human TRIM25 recovers NS1 binding.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) Schematic representations of human TRIM25 (hT25), mouse TRIM25 (mT25) and the mouse/human TRIM25 chimera (mChimT25
   <sub>h191–379</sub>). Numbers indicate amino acid. (
   <bold>B</bold>) WCLs of HEK293T cells, that had been transfected with empty vector, V5-hTRIM25, V5-mTRIM25 or V5-mChimT25
   <sub>h191–379</sub> together with NS1-PR8, were subjected to IP with anti-V5 antibody, followed by IB with anti-NS1. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Localization of NS1-PR8 in HeLa cells determined by confocal microscopy. At 30 h posttransfection with NS1-PR8 alone, NS1-PR8 together with V5-hTRIM25, V5-mTRIM25, or V5-mChimT25
   <sub>h191–379</sub>, HeLa cells were stained with anti-NS1 (green), anti-V5 (red) and DAPI (nucleus, blue). (
   <bold>D</bold>) Quantification of cytoplasmic NS1 localization from (C). From three independent experiments, 50 cells with expression of NS1 alone or NS1 together with hTRIM25, mTRIM25 or mChimT25
   <sub>h191–379</sub>, respectively, were counted and the percentage of cells with cytoplasmic NS1 is shown, ***p&lt;0.001 by Fisher's exact test.
