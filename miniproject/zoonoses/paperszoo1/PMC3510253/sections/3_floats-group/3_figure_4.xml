  <title>NS1 inhibits the ubiquitination of full-length RIG-I but not that of RIG-I 2CARD in murine cells.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) Human HEK293T (
   <bold>left</bold>) or mouse Hepa 1.6 (
   <bold>right</bold>) cells were transfected with human GST-RIG-I 2CARD (GST-hRIG-I 2CARD) (
   <bold>left</bold>) or mouse GST-RIG-I 2CARD (GST-mRIG-I 2CARD) (
   <bold>right</bold>) and increasing amounts of NS1-PR8 (
   <bold>left and right</bold>). At 40 h posttransfection, WCLs were subjected to GST-pulldown (GST-PD), followed by IB with anti-GST antibody. Arrow heads indicate ubiquitinated bands. Arrow indicates non-ubiquitinated 2CARD. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Human HEK293T (
   <bold>left</bold>) or mouse Hepa1.6 (
   <bold>right</bold>) cells were transfected with Flag-tagged human RIG-I (Flag-hRIG-I) or Myc-tagged mouse RIG-I (Myc-mRIG-I) respectively, together with empty vector or HA-ubiquitin and increasing amounts of NS1-PR8. At 24 h posttransfection, cells were infected with SeV (10 HA units/ml) for 10 h. WCLs were subjected to IP with anti-Flag (
   <bold>left</bold>) or anti-Myc (
   <bold>right</bold>), followed by IB with the indicated antibodies.
