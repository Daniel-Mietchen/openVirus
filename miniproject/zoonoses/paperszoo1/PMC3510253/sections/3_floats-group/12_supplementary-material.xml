   <bold> MEFs.</bold> WT and 
   <italic>TRIM25 −/−</italic> MEFs were either mock-treated or infected with PR8 (MOI of 2) for 18 h. WCLs were subjected to IP with anti-RIG-I antibody, followed by IB with anti-Ub or anti-RIG-I antibody. 
   <bold>(B) Interaction of NS1 with mouse Riplet.</bold> WCLs of mouse Hepa1.6 cells transfected with empty vector or Myc-tagged mouse Riplet (Myc-mRiplet) together with NS1-PR8, NS1-Cal04 or NS1-HK156 were subjected to IP with anti-Myc antibody, followed by IB with anti-NS1 or anti-Myc. 
   <bold>(C) The NS1 E96A/E97A mutant but not the R38A/K41A mutant interacts with mouse Riplet.</bold> At 30 h posttransfection with empty vector or Myc-tagged mouse Riplet (Myc-mRiplet) together with NS1-PR8 R38A/K41A or E96A/E97A mutant, HEK293T WCLs were subjected to IP with anti-Myc antibody, followed by IB with anti-NS1 antibody.
