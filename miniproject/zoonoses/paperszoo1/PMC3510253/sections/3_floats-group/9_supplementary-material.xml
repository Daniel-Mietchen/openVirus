   <bold>Amino acid sequence alignment of TRIM25 and NS1 proteins used in our study.</bold> (
   <bold>A</bold>) Protein sequence alignment of the CCD of human (aa 211–353), mouse (aa 210–351), and chicken (214–355) TRIM25 proteins. The amino acid sequence of the TRIM25 CCDs was aligned using the Jalview software 
   <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Waterhouse1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Amino acids in dark blue are conserved in the three sequences. Amino acids in light blue are identical in 2 out of 3 sequences. The predicted helical secondary structure, quality and consensus sequence are depicted under the alignments. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Protein sequence alignment of NS1 from human (A/California/04/09 [Cal04]), avian (A/Hong Kong/156/1997 [HK156]), swine (A/Swine/Texas/4199-2/98 [SwTx98]) and mouse-adapted (A/Puerto Rico/8/34 [PR8]) viruses. The amino acid sequence of cloned NS1 proteins was aligned using ClustalW2 (

Asterisks (*) indicate positions which have a single, fully conserved residue. Colons (:) indicate conservation between groups of strongly similar properties, and periods (.) indicate conservation between groups of weakly similar properties. The residues important for RNA binding and TRIM25 interaction are highlighted in blue and red, respectively 
   <xref rid="ppat.1003059-Gack2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Positions highlighted in grey indicate non-conserved amino acids.
