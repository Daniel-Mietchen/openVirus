<p>Previous studies applied the GARP (Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Production) species distribution modelling approach (
 <xref rid="bib119" ref-type="bibr">Stockwell and Peters, 1999</xref>) to the locations of 12 Ebola outbreaks in humans between 1976 and 2002 to map the likely distribution of Ebola viruses (
 <xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">Peterson et al., 2004a</xref>) and as a mechanism to identify potential reservoir hosts (
 <xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr">Peterson et al., 2004b</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib102" ref-type="bibr">Peterson et al., 2007</xref>). Here we update and improve the maps of the zoonotic transmission niche of EVD by: (i) incorporating more recent outbreak data from outside the formerly predicted niche of EVD; (ii) integrating for the first time data on outbreaks in primates and the occurrence of the virus in the suspected Old World fruit bat (OWFB) reservoirs; (iii) using new satellite-derived information on bespoke environmental covariates from Africa, including new distribution maps of the OWFB; and (iv) using new increasingly flexible niche mapping techniques in the modelling framework. To elucidate the relevance of these maps for transmission, we have also calculated the population at risk of primary spillover outbreaks from the zoonotic niche of EVD in Africa, and we investigated the changing nature of the populations within this niche.
