<p>This paper aims to define the areas suitable for zoonotic transmission of 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> (i.e., those routes defined in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> excluding human-to-human transmission) through species distribution modelling techniques. The fundamental niche of a species can be conceptualised as the confluence of environmental conditions that support its presence in a particular location (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Franklin, 2009</xref>). Species distribution models quantitatively describe this niche based on known occurrence records of the organism and their associated environmental conditions, enabling predictions of the likely geographic distribution of the species in other regions (
