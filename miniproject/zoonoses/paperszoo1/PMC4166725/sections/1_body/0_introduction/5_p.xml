<p>Humans represent a dead-end host for the virus, with only stuttering chains of transmission reported between humans in the majority of previous outbreaks (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Chowell et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Legrand et al., 2007</xref>) and no indication that humans can reintroduce the virus back into reservoir species (
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Karesh et al., 2012</xref>). The incubation period in humans ranges from two days to three weeks, after which a variety of clinical symptoms arise, affecting multiple organs of the body. At the peak of illness, haemorrhaging shock and widespread tissue damage can occur and can eventually lead to death within 6â€“16 days (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Feldmann and Geisbert, 2011</xref>). Human-to-human transmission is mainly through direct unprotected contact with infected individuals and cadavers, with infectious particles detected in a number of different body fluids (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Feldmann and Geisbert, 2011</xref>). The typical outbreak profile is defined by an index individual that has recently come into contact with the blood of another mammal through either hunting or the butchering of animal carcasses (
 <xref rid="bib108" ref-type="bibr">Pourrut et al., 2005</xref>). Whilst it has been difficult to identify the zoonotic source for the index cases of some outbreaks, a recurring theme of hunting and handling bushmeat is suspected (

 <xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Leroy et al., 2009</xref>). For some outbreaks, including the most recent, the initial source of zoonotic transmission has not been identified. In subsequent human-to-human transmission, the highest risk activities are those that bring humans into close contact with infected individuals. These include medical settings where insufficient infection control precautions have been taken, as well as home care and funeral preparations carried out by families or close friends (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Baron et al., 1983</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Georges et al., 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Boumandouki et al., 2005</xref>). As the conditions required for transmission are culturally and contextually dependent, opportunities for sustained transmission are highly heterogeneously distributed. Typically, chains of infection do not exceed three or four sequential transmission events, although occasionally (and particularly in the early stages of infection) a single individual may be responsible for directly infecting a large number of others (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Brady et al., 2014</xref>). In the outbreak in Gabon in 1996, a single person was responsible for infecting ten other individuals (
 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Milleliri et al., 2004</xref>) whilst in the 1995 outbreak in the DRC, thirty five cases resulted from one individual (
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 1999</xref>). Secondary transmission can be restricted by effective case detection and isolation measures (
 <xref rid="bib113" ref-type="bibr">Shoemaker et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib143" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2014c</xref>). Where this cannot be achieved, either due to a lack of infrastructure, poor understanding of the disease, or distrust of medical practices, secondary cases can continue to occur (
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Larkin, 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Hewlett et al., 2005</xref>). As the number of infections grows, the ability of healthcare systems to control the further spread diminishes and the risk of a large outbreak increases.
