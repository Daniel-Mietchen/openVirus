<p>Initial analysis suggested that the viruses isolated from the current outbreak, originating in Guinea, formed a separate clade within the five 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> species (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Baize et al., 2014</xref>). Subsequent re-analysis of the same sequences however, indicated that these isolates instead nest within the 
 <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic> lineage (
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Dudas and Rambaut, 2014</xref>), and diverged from Central Africa strains approximately ten years ago (
