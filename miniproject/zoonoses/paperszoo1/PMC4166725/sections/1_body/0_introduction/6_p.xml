<p>The recent outbreak in Guinea and surrounding countries indicate that the previous paradigm for Ebola outbreaks is shifting (

 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Chan, 2014</xref>). The last 40 years of EVD outbreaks were accompanied by considerable changes in demographic patterns throughout Africa. There has been a large increase in population size coupled with increasing urbanisation (

 <xref rid="bib136" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) which have been clearly demonstrated to influence disease transmission over different temporal and spatial scales (

 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Daszak, 2000</xref>), while changes in human mobility and connectivity will likely have profound impacts on the dispersion of Ebola cases during outbreaks. These conditions are thought to have a major role in setting the stage for the current outbreak.
