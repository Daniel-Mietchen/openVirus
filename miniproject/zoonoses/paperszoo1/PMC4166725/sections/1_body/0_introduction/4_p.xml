<p>Which reservoir species are responsible for maintaining Ebola transmission between outbreaks is not well understood (
 <xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr">Peterson et al., 2004b</xref>), but over the last decade significant progress has been made in narrowing down the list of likely hosts (
 <xref rid="bib102" ref-type="bibr">Peterson et al., 2007</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Primates have long been known to harbour filoviral infections, with the first Marburg strains identified in African green monkeys in 1967 (
 <xref rid="bib114" ref-type="bibr">Siegert et al., 1967</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Beer et al., 1999</xref>). Significant mortality has also been reported in wild primate populations across Africa, most notably in gorilla (
 <italic>Gorilla gorilla</italic>) and chimpanzee (
 <italic>Pan troglodytes</italic>) populations (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Formenty et al., 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib110" ref-type="bibr">Rouquet et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Bermejo et al., 2006</xref>). The high case fatality rates recorded in the great apes combined with their declining populations and limited geographical range, indicate they are likely dead-end hosts for the virus and not reservoir species (
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Groseth et al., 2007</xref>). A large survey of small mammals in and around Gabon identified three species of bats which were infected with Ebola virusesâ€”
 <italic>Hypsignathus monstrosus</italic>, 
 <italic>Epomops franqueti</italic> and 
 <italic>Myonycetris torquata</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Leroy et al., 2005</xref>). Subsequent serological surveys (
 <xref rid="bib109" ref-type="bibr">Pourrut et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Hayman et al., 2010</xref>) and evidence linking the potential source of human outbreaks to bats (
 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Leroy et al., 2009</xref>) lend support to the hypothesis of a bat reservoir. This, coupled with repeated detection of 
 <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> in the fruit bat 
 <italic>Rousettus aegypticus</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib124" ref-type="bibr">Towner et al., 2009</xref>) and the only isolations of 
 <italic>Cuevavirus</italic> also from bats (specifically 
 <italic>Llovia virus</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">Negredo et al., 2011</xref>]), all support the suspicion that Chiroptera play an important role in the natural life-cycle of the filoviruses.
