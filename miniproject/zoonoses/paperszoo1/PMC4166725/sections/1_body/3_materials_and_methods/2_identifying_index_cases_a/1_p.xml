<p>Tables detailing proven outbreaks of Ebola virus, initially sourced from the scientific literature (
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Kuhn, 2008</xref>) and from health reporting organisations (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">CDC, 2014</xref>), were used to coordinate searches of the formal scientific literature using Web of Science and PubMed for each specific outbreak. Relevant papers were abstracted and where possible outbreak-specific epidemiological surveys were sourced. The citations in these references were obtained in order to reconstruct the outbreak in detail and to identify the most probable index case. Index cases were defined as any human infection resulting from interaction with non-human sources of the disease. Some of these cases arose from presumed interactions with zoonotic reservoirs or hosts, such as primates and other mammals during hunting trips (

 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Leroy et al., 2009</xref>). Any cases arising from existing human infections are considered as secondary infections rather than index cases. Similar to methodology employed elsewhere (
 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Messina et al., 2014</xref>), the site, or supposed site, of this zoonotic transmission event was geopositioned using Google Earth. For locations where precise geographic information (e.g., geographic coordinates of a hunting camp) was provided by the authors, these were used. Where precise geographic information could not be accurately geopositioned, a geographic area (termed a polygon) was defined covering the reported region. In several cases only the first reported patient could be identified, with the source of infection unknown. With these outbreaks the location of the first patient was geopositioned under the assumption that an initial zoonotic spillover event occurred in the vicinity of this location. In two outbreaks multiple independent zoonotic transmission events were identified (WHO, 2003; 
 <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">Nkoghe et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib108" ref-type="bibr">Pourrut et al., 2005</xref>), and each unique event was geopositioned and included in the model as separate entities.
