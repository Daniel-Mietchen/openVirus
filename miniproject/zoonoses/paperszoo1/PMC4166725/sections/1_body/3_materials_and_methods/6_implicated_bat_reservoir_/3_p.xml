<p>The occurrence database was then used to train separate boosted regression tree species distribution models (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Elith et al., 2008</xref>) to predict the likely distribution of each of these suspected reservoir species. For each model, occurrence records for the target species (
 <italic>H. monstrosus</italic>, n = 67; 
 <italic>E. franqueti</italic>, n = 120; and 
 <italic>M. torquata</italic>, n = 52) were considered presence records and occurrence records of all other species were used as background records. This procedure is designed to account for the potentially biasing effect of spatial variation in recording of Megachiroptera occurrences (
