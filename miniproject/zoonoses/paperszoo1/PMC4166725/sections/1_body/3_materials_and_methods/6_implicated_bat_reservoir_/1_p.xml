<p>Over recent years, significant research has been undertaken in investigating the role bats have to play in the transmission cycle of Ebola viruses (
 <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Olival and Hayman, 2014</xref>) and evidence of asymptomatic infection in fruit bats has been documented to varying extents (
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Leroy et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib107" ref-type="bibr">Pourrut et al., 2007</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib109" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Hayman et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Hayman et al., 2012</xref>). In order to incorporate this potential driver of Ebola virus transmission into the model we developed predicted distribution maps for three species of fruit bat implicated as primary reservoirs of the disease: 
 <italic>Hypsignathus monstrosus</italic>, 
 <italic>Epomops franqueti</italic> and 
 <italic>Myonycteris torquata</italic>. The evidence was strongest for these three species having a reservoir role as Ebola virus RNA (all nested within the 
 <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic> phylogeny [
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Leroy et al., 2005</xref>]) has been detected in all three. Whilst a handful of other bat species have been found to be seropositive, no further viral isolations have been recorded (
