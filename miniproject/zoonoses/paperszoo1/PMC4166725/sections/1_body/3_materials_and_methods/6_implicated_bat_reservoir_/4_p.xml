<p>For each species we ran fifty submodels each trained to a randomly selected bootstrap of this dataset, subject to the constraint that each bootstrap contained a minimum of 10 occurrence and 10 background records. Each submodel was fitted using the gbm.step subroutine (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Elith et al., 2008</xref>) in the dismo R package. In each submodel the background records were down weighted so that the weighted sum of presence records equalled the weighted sum of background records (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Barbet-Massin et al., 2012</xref>) in order to maximise the discrimination capacity of the model. We generated a prediction map from each of these submodels and calculated both the mean prediction and 95% confidence interval around the prediction for each 5 km Ã— 5 km pixel for each species.
