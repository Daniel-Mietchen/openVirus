<p>Whilst expert opinion range maps for these species exist (
 <xref rid="bib111" ref-type="bibr">Schipper et al., 2008</xref>), there is some disagreement with independently-sourced occurrence data (all archived in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility). As a result, a predictive modelling approach was used to create a continuous surface of habitat suitability for these species which we then included as a predictor in the model. Occurrence data for all Megachiroptera in Africa was extracted from GBIF (
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">GBIF, 2014</xref>) using the R packages dismo (
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Hijmans et al., 2014</xref>) and taxize (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Chamberlain et al., 2014</xref>). To remove apparently erroneous records in the GBIF archive all occurrence records more than 100 km from the species known ranges, as determined by expert-opinion range maps (
 <xref rid="bib111" ref-type="bibr">Schipper et al., 2008</xref>), were excluded, as were duplicate records and those located in the ocean. This resulted in a total dataset of 1341 unique occurrence records.
