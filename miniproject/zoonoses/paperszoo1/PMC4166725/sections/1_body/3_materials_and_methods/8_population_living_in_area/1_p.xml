<p>In order to identify areas which are likely to be at risk of transmission of 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> from zoonotic reservoir hosts to humans, the continuous map of the predicted environmental suitability for zoonotic transmission (shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) was converted into a binary map classifying pixels as either at risk or not at risk. A pixel was assumed to be at risk if its predicted environmental suitability for zoonotic Ebola virus transmission was greater than 0.673, the lowest suitability value predicted at the locations of known transmission to humans (point records of human index cases). Countries containing at least one at-risk pixel are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>â€”those countries that previously report an index case were defined as Set 1; countries with at least one at-risk pixel with no previous index cases of EVD were categorised as Set 2. The number of people living in at-risk areas in each of these countries was calculated by summing the estimated population of at-risk pixels using population density maps from the AfriPop project (

 <xref rid="bib150" ref-type="bibr">WorldPop, 2014</xref>) and the proportion of those living in urban, periurban and rural areas was evaluated using the Global Rural Urban Mapping Project (
