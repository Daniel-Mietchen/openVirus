<p>We are in the midst of a public health emergency that will likely last for many more months (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Chan, 2014</xref>) and which has brought EVD to global attention. We emphasise that the maps of zoonotic transmission presented here do not enable assessment of secondary transmission rates in human populations, but they do act as an evidenced-based indicator of locations with potential for future zoonotic transmission and thus outbreaks. Interestingly, early reports of another independent zoonotic outbreak in the DRC (
 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">MSF, 2014</xref>) are in predicted at-risk areas. An improved understanding of the spatial extent of the zoonotic niche can only help future efforts in biosurveillance.
