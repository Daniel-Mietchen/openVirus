<p>There are several other zoonotic viral haemorrhagic fevers (for example 
 <italic>Marburgvirus</italic>, Lassa fever, hantaviral infections and arenaviruses) that are of similar public health and biosecurity concern (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bannister, 2010</xref>), due to their high virulence and mortality and their potential to cause outbreaks and spread internationally. Despite this their geographical distributions are poorly understood (
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Hay et al., 2013a</xref>). Many of the methods applied here can be adapted to these diseases and improve our geographical understanding of the risk presented by these pathogens.
