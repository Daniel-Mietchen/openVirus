<p>We have focussed on reanalysing the zoonotic niche for EVD transmission and the characterisation of the populations at risk to improve the landscape in which future risk and impact of EVD outbreaks can be discussed. During the current emergency much of the work will concentrate on routes of secondary transmission in the human populationâ€”conceptually the red arrow of the H box in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. An important task is to stratify the risk of EVD spread both within and between countries and identify the most likely pathways of spread for characterisation and surveillance. Our next priority therefore is to investigate aspects of secondary human-to-human transmission by documenting the rate of geographic spread of EVD during the past and ongoing epidemics to help understand changes in these patterns in the historical record. Simulating these movements in a real landscape of population movement patterns, inferred from population movements assessed by mobile phones and other data (

 <xref rid="bib116" ref-type="bibr">Simini et al., 2013</xref>) is a logical next step, and can be used in future targeting of interventions and potential new treatments for both the current and future outbreaks (
