<p>The remote and isolated nature of Ebola zoonotic transmission events, paired with the relatively poor diagnostics and understanding of the disease transmission routes in early outbreaks, mean that under-reporting of previous outbreaks is probable. An increasing understanding and description of a broader range of symptoms used in case definitions of EVD (
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Leroy et al., 2000</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Feldmann and Geisbert, 2011</xref>) also increase the possibility that past outbreaks may have been misattributed to different diseases (
 <xref rid="bib123" ref-type="bibr">Tignor et al., 1993</xref>). This poor detectability of EVD also clearly limits capacity to accurately identify the locations and transmission routes of index cases (
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Heymann et al., 1980</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Baize et al., 2014</xref>). We must assume, as has been done previously (
 <xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">Peterson et al., 2004a</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2008</xref>), that the first reported cases are representative of the true location of the index cases. Where possible we have represented this geographic uncertainty by attributing the index case to a wide-area polygon which then incorporated this uncertainty into the mapping process (see ‘Materials and methods’).
