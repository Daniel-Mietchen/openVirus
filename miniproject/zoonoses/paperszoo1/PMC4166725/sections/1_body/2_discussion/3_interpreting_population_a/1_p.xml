<p>It is important to appreciate that this zoonotic niche map delineates areas in which populations are at-risk of zoonotic transmission of EVD (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). It does not predict the likelihood of EVD spillover, the likelihood of an outbreak establishing, or its subsequent rate of spread within a population. Increasing human encroachment and certain cultural practices sometimes linked with poverty, such as bushmeat hunting, result in increasing exposure of humans to animals which may harbour diseases including Ebola (

 <xref rid="bib147" ref-type="bibr">Wolfe et al., 2005</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib148" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Increasing human population may accelerate the degree of risk through these processes but spatially refined information on these factors is not available comprehensively. It is hoped that as the understanding of the risk factors for zoonotic transmission of
