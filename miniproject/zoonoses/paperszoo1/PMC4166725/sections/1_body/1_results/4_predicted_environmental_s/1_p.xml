<p>The predicted environmental niche for zoonotic transmission of EVD is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. All countries with observed index cases of EVD (n = 7, hereafter Set 1) have areas of the highest environmental suitability (see list in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In addition, areas of high environmental suitability for zoonotic transmission are predicted in a further 15 countries where, to date, index cases of the four African species of 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> have not been recorded. These are Nigeria, Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), Ghana, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Angola, Tanzania, Togo, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Burundi, Equatorial Guinea, Madagascar and Malawi (hereafter Set 2).
