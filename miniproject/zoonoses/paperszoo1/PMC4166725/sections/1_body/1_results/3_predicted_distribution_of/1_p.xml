<p>Three species of bats, 
 <italic>Hypsignathus monstrosus</italic>, 
 <italic>Myonycteris torquata</italic> and 
 <italic>Epomops franqueti</italic>, were identified as the most likely candidates to be reservoir species for Ebola viruses due to high seroprevalence and the isolation of RNA closely related to 
 <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Leroy et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Olival and Hayman, 2014</xref>). In total, 239 locations were identified from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) (
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">GBIF, 2014</xref>): 67 for 
 <italic>H. monstrosus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), 52 for 
 <italic>M. torquata</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and 120 for 
 <italic>E. franqueti</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Distribution models for all three species demonstrated predictive skill (indicated by an area under the curve (AUC) greater than 0.5) as follows: 
 <italic>H. monstrosus</italic> AUC 0.63 ± 0.04; 
 <italic>M. torquata</italic> AUC = 0.59 ± 0.04; 
 <italic>E. franqueti</italic> AUC = 0.58 ± 0.03, n = 50 submodels for all three species. In addition, each species was broadly predicted within its considered expert opinion range (

 <xref rid="bib111" ref-type="bibr">Schipper et al., 2008</xref>). The marginal effect plots (not shown) were strongly influenced by land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation (as measured by the enhanced vegetation index [EVI]). The predicted combined distribution of these species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), covers West and Central Africa, specifically the moist forests of the northeastern, western and central Congo basin, and Guinea, as well as the Congolian coastal forest ecoregions (
