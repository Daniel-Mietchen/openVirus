<p>A paper on the Ebola epidemic is current and warrants fast tracking. However this manuscript is not addressing the key challenges and issues adequately, and unless authors can address this I don't think the manuscript in its current form is acceptable. 
 <italic>The important issues relate to risk</italic>, the ethics relating to experimental drugs, and containment efforts.
