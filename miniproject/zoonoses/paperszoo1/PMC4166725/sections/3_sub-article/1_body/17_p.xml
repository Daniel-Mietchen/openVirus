 <italic>Pan paniscus</italic>). Using a combination of mapping, Jaccard overlapping coefficients and binary regressions, the study determined how each disease correlated with the extent of occurrence of, and the areas occupied by, bonobos. Ebola, Monkeypox and Trypanosomiasis were each reported within the area of occupancy of bonobos. 
 <italic>Their results suggest that large rivers may have prevented Ebola from spreading into the range of bonobos.</italic>
