<p>1) As someone involved in both the research and operational aspects of medical intervention in West Africa, I find nothing at all new about what is stated in this paper. In essence, what the authors are remarking is that population growth (and demographic changes), mobility, and poor public health infrastructure are risk factors for EVD. The new (ish) component of this paper is that they have done a good job of synthesizing diverse datasets into a clear and understandable way to present this information for a general scientific audience.</p>
