<p>We thank the reviewer for the critique, but we respectfully disagree. One key improvement is the updated risk map incorporating not just the more recent human outbreaks over previous publications, but also expanding the consideration of the niche of EVD to include infections across the Ebola transmission cycle. In addition, we have provided an evidence base for the changing demographic and socioeconomic situations in both Set 1 and Set 2 countries and indicate that in the future there is an increased likelihood of secondary transmission (in the absence of intervention) from any primary zoonotic transmission event. We are unaware of a previous quantitative assessment of these changes and therefore believe this to be a novel contribution. We have however reduced the prominence of these sections, particularly in the Discussion and Abstract in response to the review comments and editorial guidance.</p>
