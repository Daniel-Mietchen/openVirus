<p>We agree that the absence of reservoirs would mean an absence of the disease in humans. However, there is imperfect knowledge on which organisms are the true hosts of Ebola and even for those species that we strongly suspect of being reservoirs there is only poor distributional information available. This can be seen by comparing GBIF data to the expert opinion range maps of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. As a result, for the three bat species that we include, we represented their distribution as a continuous surface of habitat suitability rather than a binary presence or absence. We subsequently incorporated this information into the EVD model and threshold human risk based on known human cases instead. We have clarified this in the manuscript as follows:
