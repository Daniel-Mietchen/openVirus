<p>We thank the reviewer for their comments. Our primary goal here was to map the zoonotic niche by using data from all outbreaks. We have already provided some of the analysis requested by the reviewer, in particular running a model iteration with the most recent outbreak excluded. The model trained using index cases before 2013 predicted risk within Guinea and very close to the reported index case for the 2013 outbreak. Similarly, all previous index cases occur within or near to areas of predicted highest risk. We highlight the section specific to Guinea and have added statements to clarify.</p>
