<p>We agree with the reviewer that modelling secondary spread is important, and it is currently the focus of further work. We believe that it is important to refine our understanding of the risk of zoonotic transmission and believe we have outlined this clearly and consistently throughout the manuscript, and not made any claims about direct spread modelling. Anything concerning secondary transmission is in relation to the changing nature of humans living in areas at-risk, but not directly related to the potential magnitude of a specific outbreak. We have strengthened various parts of the manuscript to reflect the differences in approach that primary transmission and secondary transmission necessitate as detailed in the response to Reviewer 7.</p>
