 <italic>1) I do not understand how the information on travel patterns falls in the scope of this paper. If the travel patterns between countries potentially at risk were used in the models, please clarify in methods descriptions. If they were not used, I suggest considering leaving this only in discussion, or perhaps developing a follow-up manuscript of the international risks. The same comment applies to the comparison of the health systems strengths</italic>.
