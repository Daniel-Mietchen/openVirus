<p>Many interesting points were raised and we hope that any concerns have been suitably addressed in this revision. There have been early reports of another outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo apparently arising from an independent zoonotic transmission event. At this time there is insufficient information to include this new outbreak in the model as precise information for the index case has not been reported, however we make reference to this in the conclusion and highlight that the locations of reported cases are within an area predicted to be at risk of zoonotic transmission. Consequently, addition of this data point would be unlikely to affect the current model predictions.</p>
