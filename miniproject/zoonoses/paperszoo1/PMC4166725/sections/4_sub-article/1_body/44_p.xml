<p>We have followed previous feedback from our last submission to 
 <italic>eLife</italic> to provide a summary of the methods within the manuscript rather than a technical appendix. We therefore reference previous work, including “A working guide to Boosted Regression Trees” (outlining the core methodology) and disease-specific applications of this approach (for dengue, leishmaniasis and malaria vectors). We have now also uploaded the source code for this analysis to Github and provided a link to this in the paper. If directed to do so by the editors, we can provide more details on specific sections of the paper.
