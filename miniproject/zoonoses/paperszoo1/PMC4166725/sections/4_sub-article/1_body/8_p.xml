<p>This research is primarily focused on the impact of zoonotic transmission to humans, and the environmental data and occurrences from animal populations were used to supplement our understanding of this distribution. The nature of human and bonobo disease interaction is unclear, and we only included in the modelling framework the three bat species for which the evidence for being reservoir species is greatest. Gorillas and chimpanzees are suspected dead-end hosts, and therefore these animals were not considered in the same manner. Since bats are not restricted by physical landmarks in the same way as primates, we did not include this aspect in our analysis. It is hoped that our work in addressing zoonotic transmission risk will aid future research by others into primate risk.</p>
