<p>We agree with the reviewer that all these features are important, but have to respectfully disagree that the issues raised are important within the context of this work. We explain throughout the article that this work concerns primary transmission events and not secondary outbreaks, and therefore experimental drugs and containment efforts are not immediately relevant. In order to better clarify this distinction, we have amended the text in the discussion and incorporated references to drug development within the text, tying this to secondary transmission modelling.</p>
