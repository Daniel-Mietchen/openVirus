<p>Despite the large widespread distribution of HEV-shedding pigs and the possible role of farmed pigs as the main virus reservoir, the number of human hepatitis E cases in Europe remains low, suggesting inefficient virus transmission or lower pathogenicity of swine g3 strains than of g1 strains for humans. Because g3 HEV is common in pigs but rare in humans, humans are postulated to not be a main host for g3 virus replication (
