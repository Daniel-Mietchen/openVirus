<p>For proper results interpretation, we considered 4 signals: 1) target virus, 2) SPCV, 3) target IAC, and 4) SPCV IAC (

 </xref>). With cycle threshold (C
 <sub>t</sub>) 
 <underline>&lt;</underline>45, independently of corresponding IAC C
 <sub>t</sub>, the PCR result was considered positive. With C
 <sub>t</sub>
 <underline>&gt;</underline>45 and corresponding IAC C
 <sub>t</sub>
 <underline>&lt;</underline>45, results were interpreted as negative. When both targets and corresponding IACs showed C
 <sub>t</sub>
 <underline>&gt;</underline>45, reactions were considered failed. When 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>1 replicate target assay (HEV or PAdV) was positive, the sample was considered positive. Absence of SPCV and its IAC signals indicated preamplification processes (virus concentration and extraction) failure (
