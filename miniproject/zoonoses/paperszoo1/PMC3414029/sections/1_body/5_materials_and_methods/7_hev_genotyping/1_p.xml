<p>Positive HEV samples were sequence-analyzed amplifying 2 ORF2 regions (348- and 121-bp fragments) (

The 5 shorter 100-bp fragments (3 fecal samples in Italy and 1 liver and meat sample in Czech Republic) were used only to identify genotype or confirm longer sequences. The 11 longer sequences (300 bp) from 4 fecal samples in Italy (GenBank accession nos. JN861803, JN861804, JN861805, JN861806) and 7 sequences from 5 sausages and 2 environmental swabs in Spain (GenBank accession nos. JN903913, JN903914, JN903915, JN903916, JN903917, JN903918, JN903919) also were used for HEV genotyping and subgenotyping. We performed phylogenetic analyses with Bionumerics v6 (Applied Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium) by using the neighbor-joining method with 1,000 replicates with Kimura-2 correction factor.
