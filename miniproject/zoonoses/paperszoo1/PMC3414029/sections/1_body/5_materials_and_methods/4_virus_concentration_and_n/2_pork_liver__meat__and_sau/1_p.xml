<p>Liver and meat or sausage samples were collected (1 cm
 <sup>3</sup> from 3 different locations) and stored in sterile plastic bags. According to the method of Bouwknegt et al. (

 </xref>), samples were finely chopped and homogenized in an RNase-free mortar with 4 mL of Buffer RLT (RNeasy Midi Kit, QIAGEN) containing 1:100 β-mercaptoethanol. A total of 250 mg homogenate was transferred into microcentrifuge tubes containing 1 mL RLT buffer, 2.5 g sterile 1-mm zirconia beads (BioSpec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK, USA), and 10 μL SPCV (4.7 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>). Tubes were applied to a mechanical disruptor (Ribolyser-Cell-Disrupter, Hybaid Ltd., Ashford, UK) for two 40-s/4-m s
 <sup>–1</sup> cycles. After centrifugation (10,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic>, 20 min, 2×), 800 µL of resulting supernatants were immediately processed by RNeasy Midi Kit or freeze-stored. Nucleic acid extracts (300 µL) were assayed immediately or freeze-stored.
