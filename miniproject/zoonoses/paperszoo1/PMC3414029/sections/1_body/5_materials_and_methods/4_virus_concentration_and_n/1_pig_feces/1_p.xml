<p>Feces (&gt;1 g) were collected aseptically. A total of 250 mg of sample in 15-mL centrifuge tubes were suspended in 2.25 mL phosphate-buffered saline containing gentamycin (10 mg/mL), and 10 μL SPCV (4.7 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>) was added. Suspensions were vortexed for 60 s and centrifuged at 3,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min. Supernatants were immediately used for nucleic acid isolation or stored at –70°C. Nucleic acid was extracted by using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Final elution was performed 2× with 50 µL elution buffer, resulting in a 100-µL nucleic acid extract, for immediate testing or −70°C storage.
