<p>Workers’ hands and surfaces were sampled by using sterile moistened swabs, and samples were stored in 5 mL of 10 mg mL
 <sup>–1</sup> gentamicin-containing phosphate-buffered saline in plastic tubes. Unwashed hands were sampled immediately before lunch or afternoon coffee break. For surfaces, 10-cm
 <sup>2</sup> areas were rubbed. Liquids were decanted from swab containers into 50-mL centrifuge tubes containing 10 μL SPCV (4.7 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>). Suspensions were vortexed and centrifuged (3,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic>, 5 min), and supernatants were used immediately or freeze-stored. Nucleic acids were extracted by NucliSENS miniMAG Kit (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France) and eluted 2× with 50 µL elution buffer.
