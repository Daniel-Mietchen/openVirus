 </xref>) and included IACs. Reactions contained 1× RNA UltraSense reaction mix (Life Technologies), 0.25 µM primers, 0.1 µM probe HEV-P (FAM-labeled), 50 nM IAC probe (VIC-labeled), 1× ROX reference dye, 1 µL RNA UltraSense enzyme mix, and 300 HEV IAC copies. Ten microliters of nucleic acid extracts were added to 20 µL final volumes. Thermocycling conditions were 15 min at 50°C and 2 min at 95°C, followed by 45 cycles of 10 s at 95°C, 20 s at 55°C, and 15 s at 72°C.
