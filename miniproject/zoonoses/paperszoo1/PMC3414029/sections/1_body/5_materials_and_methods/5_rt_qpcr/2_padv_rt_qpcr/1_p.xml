 </xref>), including IACs and a carryover contamination prevention system using uracil-N-glycosylase (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Manheim, Germany). Reactions contained 1× TaqMan Universal PCR Master-Mix (Life Technologies, Branchburg, NJ, USA), 0.9 µM primers, 0.225 µM PAdV TaqMan probe (FAM-labeled), 50 nM IAC probe (VIC-labeled), and 100 copies of PAdV IAC. Ten microliters of nucleic acid extract were added to 25-µL final reaction volumes. Thermocycling conditions were 2 min at 50°C and 10 min at 95°C, followed by 45 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C.
