 </xref>), including IACs. Reaction contained 1× RNA UltraSense reaction mix, 0.2 µM primers, 0.2 µM probe minor groove binder–open reading frame (ORF) 1/ORF2 (FAM-labeled), 50 nM IAC probe (VIC-labeled), 1× ROX reference dye, 1 µL RNA UltraSense enzyme mix, and 600 MNV-1 IAC copies. Ten microliters of nucleic acid extract were added (final reaction volume 20 µL). Thermocycling conditions were 15 min at 50°C and 2 min at 95°C, followed by 45 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C.
