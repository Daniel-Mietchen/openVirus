<p>Shorter sequences (121 bp, ORF2) also were obtained (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">
  <italic>33</italic>
 </xref>) from 3 fecal samples in Italy (100% identity), and 2 additional identical sequences were obtained from liver and meat at a slaughterhouse in Czech Republic. All were confirmed as g3 swine HEV, but further subtyping was not possible because of short sequence length.
