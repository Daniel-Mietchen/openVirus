<p>HEV-positive samples were genotyped and sequenced to determine possible animal or human origin of the virus. A total of 9 samples (4 from Italy, 5 from Spain) yielded ≈300-bp sequences and were compared with HEV sequences in public databases. All HEVs belonged to g3. The 4 HEV-positive samples (HEVSwITFAE09BO10, HEVSwITFAE18BO10, HEVSwITFAE22BO10, HEVSwITFAE11BO10) in feces from slaughterhouses in Italy originated from the same herd and belonged to subtype g3c, sharing 99.4%–100% identical nucleotides. Three of 5 sequences from sausage in Spain belonged to subtype g3f (HEVSwESSAU56, HEVSwESSAU57, HEVSwESSAU60), whereas 2 additional g3 strains (HEVSwESSAU64, HEVSwESSAU66; 99.5% identity) could not be assigned to specific subtypes (

Two sequences from swabs collected in Spain (HEVSwESADHOC4A, HEVSwESADHOC5A) also belonged to g3f, showing 100% reciprocal nucleotide identity and 89% identity with g3f strains from sausages. Sequences for g3 subtypes from Italy and Spain exhibited 
 <underline>&lt;</underline>85% nucleotide identity, suggesting circulation of different strains in these countries.
