<p>We collected 41 surface swabs from working surfaces, meat mincers, knives, and other working items at the 3 pork production chain sites. Overall, swab samples were positive for either HEV (11 [27%] of 41) or PAdV (6 [15%] of 41) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). HEV-positive samples were found more frequently at slaughterhouse (6 of 10) than at processing and points of sale (4 [21%] of 19 and 1 [8%] of 12, respectively) sites, and PAdV was found only in slaughterhouse samples (6 of 10). At slaughterhouses, positive swabs (3 knives, 2 floor, 1 belt surface) contained both HEV and PAdV, indicating potential fecal contamination during slaughtering steps, whereas 0 of 5 HEV-positive samples at processing and points of sale sites was positive for PAdV, disproving possible fecal cross-contamination during later production phases (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). A total of 20 swab samples were taken from workersâ€™ hands, gloves, or aprons along the production chain. Overall results were similar to those for working surfaces in slaughtering premises; in fact, 5 (71%) of 7 samples were positive for both HEV and PAdV. Moreover, PAdV was detected in 1 of 2 HEV-positive samples at processing sites (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Finally, HEV or PAdV was detected in 1 (8%) of 12 toilet swab samples collected at points of sale. The 6 Czech Republic slaughterhouse effluent samples were negative for both PAdV and HEV.
