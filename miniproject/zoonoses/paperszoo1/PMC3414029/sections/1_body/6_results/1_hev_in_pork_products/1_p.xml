<p>We detected HEV RNA in all pork production chain sites in investigated countries, with some differences (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Overall, HEV RNA was detected in 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>1 samples (feces, liver, meat) from 36 (32%) of 113 pigs examined at slaughterhouses for which all sample types were collected (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). HEV RNA was detected frequently in slaughterhouse samples in Italy and Spain, i.e., 18 (53%) positive samples from 34 animals and 15 (38%) of 39, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), whereas in Czech Republic, HEV RNA prevalence at slaughterhouses was remarkably lower, i.e., 3 (8%) positive samples from 40 animals. Pig feces showed highest HEV RNA presence (27%), followed by liver (4%) and meat (3%) (
