<p>To evaluate possible fecal contamination, PAdV DNA presence (

  <italic>34</italic>
 </xref>) was determined for all samples assayed for HEV. PAdV was highly prevalent in feces (90%â€“98%) in investigated countries (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). None of 112 liver samples were PAdV positive, and only 1 of 112 meat samples was PAdV positive, in Italy. In addition, 4 (1%) of 313 sausages (2 from Spain, 1 each from Czech Republic and Italy) were positive for PAdV (
