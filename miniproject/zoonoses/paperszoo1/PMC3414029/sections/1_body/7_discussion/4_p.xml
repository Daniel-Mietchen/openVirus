<p>Lower HEV shedding by pigs in Czech Republic might reflect different farming methods, such as animal housing and separation, herd size, slaughtering age, and/or environmental factors that possibly influence infectious HEV persistence, spread, and transmission. Previous data from Czech Republic (

However, that study did not examine HEV fecal shedding, and pigs were only 2â€“3 months of age. Furthermore, varying prevalence of HEV in pig feces also has been reported in Italy and Spain (
