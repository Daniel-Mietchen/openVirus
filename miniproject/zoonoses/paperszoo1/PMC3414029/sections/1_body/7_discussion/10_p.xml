<p>PAdV detection in 1 meat sample and 4 sausages also indicates some fecal contamination during slaughtering, which was, however, similarly low in all countries. PAdV and HEV were not present in the same sausage samples from Spain, and PAdV was detected in fewer samples than was HEV (2 vs. 6), which argues against potential higher risks for fecal contamination in the food chain in Spain. The higher HEV prevalence in sausage in Spain than in Italy or Czech Republic is unclear and deserves further investigation.</p>
