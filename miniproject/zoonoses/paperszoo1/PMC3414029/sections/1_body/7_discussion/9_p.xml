<p>Three of 112 pork meat samples tested were positive for HEV and 1 for only PAdV (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). We have no proof of HEV replication in muscle, and finding HEV RNA in pork products probably reflects endogenous HEV particles in infected liver and/or viremic blood (

 </xref>). Although liver and bile are usually removed before processing, the HEV genome sporadically detected in meat most likely represents cross-contamination of carcasses during slaughtering, which suggests a need for worker training.
