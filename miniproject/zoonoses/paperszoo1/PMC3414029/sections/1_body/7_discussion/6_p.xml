<p>We confirm broad HEV circulation within pig farms and HEV RNA in livers and other pork products (

 </xref>) but somewhat less than in the United States (11%) (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">
  <italic>17</italic>
 </xref>). HEV RNA was present in meat samples only in Czech Republic and Italy (3% and 6%, respectively), whereas sausages were HEV positive only in Spain (6%). This finding might result from low sample numbers but also could reflect different methods for final product preparation by using different meat blends, fat, or liver intentionally or after unintentional cross-contamination.
