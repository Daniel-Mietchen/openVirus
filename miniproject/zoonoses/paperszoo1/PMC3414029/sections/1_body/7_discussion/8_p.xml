<p>PAdV has been confirmed as a suitable indicator of swine fecal contamination during pork production (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">

 </xref>). Although most pig feces in our study were PAdV positive (90%â€“98%), PAdV was never detected in liver and detected only occasionally in pork meat (1/33 samples in Italy) or sausage (4/313 samples, all 3 countries). Comparing HEV and PAdV findings, risks for cross-contamination of pork products with swine feces during preparation appear to be low but not absent.
