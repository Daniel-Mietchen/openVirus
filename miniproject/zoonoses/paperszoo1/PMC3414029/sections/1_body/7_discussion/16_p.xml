<p>We cannot exclude the possibility that in some pork products HEV was infectious. However, HEV infectious dose for humans is unknown, and viral load in pork might not be sufficient to infect humans efficiently. Storage, processing, and blending of meat from HEV-positive and -negative animals (e.g., sausage) might substantially decrease risks for foodborne infection, possibly explaining why HEV food transmission in Europe seems relatively inefficient. However, consumers should eat only pork that has been thoroughly cooked, particularly liver, and avoid cross-contamination of surfaces and other food by handling pork products, especially offal.</p>
