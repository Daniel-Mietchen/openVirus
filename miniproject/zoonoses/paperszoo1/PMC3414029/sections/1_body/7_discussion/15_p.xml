<p>In conclusion, our study indicates that HEV is present throughout the pork production chain and that processing does not substantially abate endogenous virus. Consequently, consumers might purchase pork products that contain detectable HEV genome in up to 6.0% of instances, independent of source and country of origin, probably unrelated to fecal contamination during pork processing.</p>
