<p>In the cutting/slicing/chopping areas, we did not detect PAdV in fecal samples. However, HEV detection on hands and surfaces indicates that endogenous HEV can be spread during cutting of liver and meat in industrial premises, requiring cross-contamination control measures. Limited handling might instead explain the single detection of HEV on a butcherâ€™s bench at point of sale.</p>
