<p>Marginal likelihood estimates of the model fit of these different predictors suggested that RABV spatial dynamics are best described by road distances (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1001166-t002">Table 2</xref>). This was consistent across both countries and again supports human-assisted dispersal of rabies-infected dogs. As expected by their high correlation, geographical distances provided only a marginally lower fit compared to road distances. Only the population surface provided inconsistent results between both countries; whereas this model competes with road distances in Algeria, the population surface did not provide a good fit to the Moroccan data (Figure S2 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001166.s001">Supporting Information S1</xref>). Although accessibility did not seem to explain RABV diffusion as well, we note that all samples were obtained from relatively accessible parts of Morocco and Algeria.
