<p>To quantify and compare the dissemination process with previous results, we estimated the rate of RABV gene flow among the sampled isolates using ‘Markov jump’ counts 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Minin1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> of location state transitions and their reward-associated distances between locations across each branch. The posterior average rate of viral gene flow among localities estimated for Algeria was 26 km/yr (95% highest probability density interval: 18–34) and 33 (23–43) km/yr based on great circle distances and road distances, respectively. Somewhat higher viral gene flow rate estimates were obtained for Morocco with 42 (26–58) km/yr and 51 (34–72) km/yr for great circle distances and road distances, respectively. We note that the rates of viral gene flow estimated here are highly dependent of the scale of sampling such that comparison may only prove useful at the same geographic scale. However, these estimates were 2.7 to 4.4 times higher than those recorded in established enzootic situations in wildlife animals 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Biek1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, again suggestive of human-mediated transmission. Although it is theoretically possible that these relatively high rates reflect epidemic waves periodically moving through this geographical region 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Hampson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, particularly since similar rates have been observed in wild carnivores during epidemic spread 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Biek1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Bourhy2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, such waves were not observed in the geographical areas studied here and where the virus appears to be largely enzootic.
