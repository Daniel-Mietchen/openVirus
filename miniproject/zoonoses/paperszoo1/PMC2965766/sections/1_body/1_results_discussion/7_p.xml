<p>The rates of viral gene flow we estimate among the sampled isolates from Algeria and Morocco contrast with those of spatial RABV movement in an African dog population that should experience very limited human-mediated dissemination of rabid dogs 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Hampson2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In this case, the spatial dispersal of single RABV infections was estimated to be predominantly less than 2 km (and always smaller than 20 km). Considering that the average incubation period of RABV is between 22 to 29 days

 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Zinsstag1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, it is clear that such long distances as those recorded in our study could only be achieved with at least some human intervention. To investigate more formally how the RABV distribution we observe in Algeria and Morocco contrasts with the patterns of spread we would expect from transmission dynamics in African dogs alone (i.e. without human intervention), we simulated a phylogeodynamic process based on epidemiological parameters obtained from detailed analyses of rabies transmission biology

 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Hampson2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In particular, we considered epidemiologically informed virus movement over all evolutionary histories in the posterior distribution resulting from our phylodynamic inference (see Supplementary Information). In our spatial simulation we analyze cases in which (i) each new infection takes a random direction in continuous space, or (ii) subsequent infections consistently take the same direction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001166-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Although the latter may not be very realistic, it should resemble virus movement along roads. For both Algeria and Morocco, spatial diffusion is initiated at the centre of the sampling locations, such that the process has the largest probability to cover these locations 
 <italic>a priori</italic>. When assuming up to one year of movement these simulations clearly show that RABV could not have spread to the same extent as shown by the current sampling in Algeria and Morocco if the virus was simply being transmitted by dog dispersal alone. Even if we enforce a year of successive RABV transmissions in the same direction, which is highly implausible given the observed dynamics of dog RABV in a local setting 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Hampson2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, the simulations still do not attain the observed spatial RABV spread. In addition, the distances realized by dispersal in random directions along branches less than 2 years were all less than 60 km, which is far more restricted than estimated for the real data (
