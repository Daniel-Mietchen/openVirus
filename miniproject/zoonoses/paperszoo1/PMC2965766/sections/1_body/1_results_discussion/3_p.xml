<p>To identify the factors that may explain RABV spread, we incorporated several potential predictors as relative diffusion rates among each pair of locations, and tested these against equal rates of diffusion. Specifically, we considered geographical distances (great-circle distances), human population size, road distances and spatial accessibility measures. Road distances were derived from transport network data (

More detailed landscape features, which may imply multiple, direct and indirect pathways connecting the different localities sampled in this study, were represented by accessibility data. These data reflect the travel time to the nearest major city using road/track-based travel

 <italic>r</italic> = 0.61). We employed circuit theory to translate the accessibility landscape into an origin-destination distance matrix (the so-called ‘isolation by resistance model’)

We also tested a simple gravity model of viral spread that, in the absence of real dog population sizes for the locations involved, was based on human population sizes for the discrete as a proxy. Finally, we also used population sizes in a landscape approach, similar to accessibility measures, to construct a population surface matrix
