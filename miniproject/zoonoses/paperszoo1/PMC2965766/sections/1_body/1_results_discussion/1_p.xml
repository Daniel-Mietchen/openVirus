<p>We first inferred the evolutionary history of 287 RABV sequences (3080 nt; encompassing the whole N, P and intergenic G-L region) sampled from Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and the Spanish territories from North Africa (Ceuta and Melilla) between 1986 and 2008. All these viruses are assigned to the Africa 1 genotype (relevant epidemiological information for all RABV isolates analysed in this study is presented in Table S1 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001166.s001">Supporting Information S1</xref>). We estimated the timescale of this evolutionary history using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach

The most recent common ancestor of all the North African RABV sampled here was estimated to have existed between 1878â€“1945, supporting previous suggestions that dog RABV was periodically responsible for local sporadic epidemics in the middle of the 19th century

 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Bourhy2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> as these would not respect geo-political boundaries. Indeed, we found only a few exceptions to the country-specific clustering, such as two Algerian sequences within the Moroccan clade and four Moroccan sequences in the Algerian clade. The Africa 1 clade is therefore consistent with the general phylogeographic pattern observed for dog RABV at reasonably large geographic scales; a series of spatially distinct clusters that experience relatively little contact among them
