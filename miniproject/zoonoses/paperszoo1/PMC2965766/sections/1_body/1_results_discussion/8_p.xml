<p>Rabies is a prime example of an infectious disease in which dispersal can be exacerbated by animal movement mediated by humans. This is illustrated by raccoon rabies in Virginia, USA

Importantly, our study allows us to quantify rates of viral gene flow among sampled dog isolates (between 18 and 72 km/yr) in a mixed geographic and socio-economic landscape, such as those characterized by Algeria and Morocco where there is currently little dog vaccination. In addition, our analysis suggests that the human-mediated dispersal of infected dogs is likely to continue to play a major role in the transmission of RABV in geographical areas where it has been present for many years. Indeed, our observations of administrative borders that restrict a relatively fluid pattern of spread, the occasional long-distance movement of viruses to particular countries, and the fit between spatial dynamics and road distances, all point to the displacement of rabies-infected dogs by humans.
