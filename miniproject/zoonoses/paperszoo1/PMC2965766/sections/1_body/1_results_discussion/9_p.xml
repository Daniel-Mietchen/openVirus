<p>Understanding the frequency and distance of movements of potentially infected animals is of paramount importance in predicting the spread of viral infections

In particular, that humans mediate the transmission of RABV among dogs in North Africa requires that intervention procedures are implemented more rapidly than in situations in which humans play little or no role in viral transmission. The high cost associated with surveillance underscores the importance of sampling design and the development of cost-effective monitoring and testing approaches

By integrating spatial dynamics with temporal inferences, the Bayesian analysis utilized here constitutes a powerful new tool that may complement traditional epidemiological methods in studying the effects of human behaviour on the evolution of zoonotic viruses.
