<p>To analyze intra-country patterns of viral transmission in more detail, we considered a stochastic diffusion process among the 20 (Algeria) and 28 (Morocco) sampling localities for which most data were available (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001166.s001">Supporting Information S1</xref>). We quantified the degree of spatial admixture using a modified Association Index (AI, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Lemey1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>), and by summarizing the number of inferred transitions to each location within Algeria and Morocco (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1001166-t001">Table 1</xref>) based on an analysis in which rates of diffusion between each pair of locations were estimated. Although these analyses reveal that there is still significant spatial structure within each country (p&lt;0.001), the AIs are considerably higher (0.67 [0.62–0.73] and 0.55 [0.51–0.63] for Algeria and Morocco, respectively) than those found for rabies at a larger spatial scale (e.g., 0.087 [0.043–0.132] for the Africa 2 lineage in Central and West Africa) 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Lemey1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, indicating weaker spatial structure at the within-country level. The summaries of transitions to each location generally identify multiple independent introductions of viruses in each location from which several samples were obtained (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1001166-t001">Table 1</xref>). Overall, the number of independent transitions to densely sampled locations is lower in Morocco than Algeria, in agreement with the lower AI for Morocco. Taken together with the strong spatial structure across countries, these results suggest that a relatively fluid RABV diffusion process within countries is restricted by geopolitical boundaries at larger scales.
