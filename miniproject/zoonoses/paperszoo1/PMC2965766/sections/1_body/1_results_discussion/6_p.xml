<p>The occasional mixing of sequences from different locations at the tips of the inferred tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001166-g001">Figure 1</xref>) is suggestive of long distance spread in relatively little time (6 months to one year). To quantify such rapid and long distance spread, we summarized the posterior distribution of distances covered along individual branches (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001166-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We focused on branches along which inferred location state changes occurred in a time period of less than 1 year, and between 1 and 2 years. As a control, we analysed the branches without inferred state changes; as expected these all had negligible Markov jump count distances (not shown). Across the posterior distribution of trees, we observed between 5 and 13 branches per tree that have a time length less than 2 years and cover a distance of more than 200 km, and 12 to 13 branches that cover a distance of about 100 km (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001166-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Importantly, our ability to clearly detect long-distance movement is limited to branches representing short evolutionary times; longer branches could also harbour such events, providing an explanation for the relatively high average rates of viral gene flow.
