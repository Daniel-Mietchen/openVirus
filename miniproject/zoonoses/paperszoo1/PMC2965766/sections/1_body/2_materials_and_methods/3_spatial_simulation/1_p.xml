<p>To contrast the spatial distribution of our rabies samples in Algeria and Morocco with the patterns of spread we would expect from local transmission dynamics in African dogs as the sole maintenance population, we performed a simulation analysis that integrates phylodynamic and epidemiological parameters. Specifically, we consider a spatial process based on epidemiological parameters obtained from a detailed analysis of rabies transmission biology in African dogs 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Hampson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and simulate virus movement accordingly over all evolutionary histories in the posterior distribution resulting from our phylodynamic inference. The latter characterizes the successful ancestral transmission history of the viruses we sampled and provides a time-scale for the spatial process we would like to simulate.
