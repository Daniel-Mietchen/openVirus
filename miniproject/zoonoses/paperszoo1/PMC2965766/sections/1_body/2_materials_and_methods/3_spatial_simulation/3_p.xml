<p>This simulation procedure yields location realizations in continuous space for all tips and all trees in the posterior distribution. We summarize this spatial distribution using two-dimensional contours. Because the spatial simulation for each tree in the posterior distribution may cover a different area, it is important to note that the contour representing the process over all trees depicts the maximum area that can be covered for the set of epidemiological parameters we consider.</p>
