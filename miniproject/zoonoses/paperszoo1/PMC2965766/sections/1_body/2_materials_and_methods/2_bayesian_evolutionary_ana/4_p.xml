<p>To quantify the dissemination process, we estimated the rate of rabies spread among the sampled isolates using ‘Markov jump’ counts 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Minin1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> of location state transitions for all possible states along the phylogeny. Markov jump counts measure the expected number of transitions along each branch conditional on the observed data. By multiplying the expected number of transitions between each pair of locations by the geographical distance between these two locations, we arrive at the expected distance travelled within the time elapsed on each branch. This approach, implemented in BEAGLE 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Suchard1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> a library that can be used in conjunction with BEAST), integrates over all uncertainty in the evolutionary tree and offers a degree of robustness to model misspecification
