<p>To investigate the evolutionary relationships and time to common ancestry among RABV lineages circulating in north Africa, we reconstructed the phylogenetic history for the entire data set using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis implemented in the BEAST package 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Drummond1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. BEAST incorporates sampling time information to estimate evolutionary rates and a posterior distribution of time-scaled trees. We employed a GTR model of nucleotide substitution with gamma-distributed rate variation among sites and a relaxed (uncorrelated log-normal) molecular clock model 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Drummond2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. We specified a Bayesian skyline plot model as flexible tree prior 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Drummond3" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. All chains were run for a sufficient length and convergence was diagnosed using Tracer (

Evolutionary history was summarized using an annotated Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) phylogenetic tree. Posterior probability values provide an assessment of the degree of support for each node on the tree.
