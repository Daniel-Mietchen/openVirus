<p>As an additional component in the fully probabilitistic Bayesian inference framework, we consider a discretized diffusion process among the sampling locations in both countries, formalized as a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) model 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Lemey1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. A CTMC is fully characterized using a matrix that describes the rate of movement from location state 
 <italic>i</italic> to 
 <italic>j</italic> for every pair of locations. To efficiently estimate the diffusion process from a single observation (a single location realization for each sequence), we restrict the parameterization to a sparse set of rates that adequately explains the phylogeographic dispersal process using Bayesian Stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS). This BSSVS procedure also allows us to employ Bayes factor testing in the identification of the most parsimonious description of the diffusion process 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Lemey1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. We used a modified Association Index (AI) to assess the degree of spatial structure in the phylogeographic data 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Lemey1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This reports the posterior distribution of association values relative to those obtained by randomizing the tip locations. In addition, we summarize the number of transitions to each sampling location in the posterior tree distribution based on the location realizations at the nodes. The latter provide a conservative estimate of the number of independent introductions in each location.
