<p>To reconstruct the spatial dynamics of dog-associated RABV spread and investigate the role of different diffusion predictors in shaping the epidemic in both Morocco and Algeria, we extracted two data sets with their specific spatial and temporal co-ordinates: (i) A total of 117 Algerian sequences (3080 nt) collected from dogs in 20 cities over 7 years (from 2001 to 2008), and (ii) a total of 133 Moroccan sequences (3080 nt) sampled from dogs in 28 cities between 2004 and 2008. For all these isolates precise dates (month) of sampling and geographical localities (city) are available (Table S2 in
