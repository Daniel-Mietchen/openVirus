<p>To test different scenarios of phylogeographic diffusion, we fix the CTMC relative rate parameters to the normalized pairwise location measures that represent different diffusion predictors and perform Bayesian model selection using marginal likelihood approximations 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Suchard2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. We consider; (i) geographical distances, specifically great-circle distances that represent the shortest path on the surface of the Earth between two points, (ii) human population size, obtained from

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001166.s001">Supporting Information S1</xref>, rates between each pair of locations were fixed to the normalized products of the population sizes), (iii) road distances, (iv) a gravity model, (v) spatial accessibility, and (vi) ‘population conductivity’ measures. The accessibility estimates are derived from a range of spatial data sets, road type and network data 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, satellite derived and cover information, settlement database locations and sizes, and satellite derived topography. They are combined to create a ‘friction surface’ where each 1×1 km square represents the difficulty (or travel time) in crossing it. These estimates provide a representation of the difficulty in travel between all the locations. Using a circuit theory approach, an origin-destination distance matrix was estimated from this accessibility landscape 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-McRae1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. A simple gravity model was constructed by fixing the rates to the normalized product of the population sizes divided by the great circle distance between the locations involved. As an alternative, population sizes were also mapped in a landscape (Figure S2 in
