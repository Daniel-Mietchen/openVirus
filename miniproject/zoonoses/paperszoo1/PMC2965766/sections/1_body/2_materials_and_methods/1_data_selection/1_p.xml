<p>The Office of Veterinary Public Health Services of the different countries coordinates follow-up per animal bites. The respective state health departments (in conjunction with qualified laboratories that they designate) conduct all collection, observations, and euthanization (if necessary) of animals suspected of rabies, according to established national standardized protocols. A total of 287 isolates sampled from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Spain (Ceuta and Melilla) were collected by the authors within the framework of these qualified laboratories, and sequenced. These samples were collected from dead animals suspected of rabies so that submission for laboratory rabies diagnosis is mandatory. Spatial co-ordinates and time of sampling, covering a period of 22 years (1986â€“2007), were available for the majority of these isolates. Relevant epidemiological information and GenBank accession numbers for all RABV isolates analysed in this study are presented in Table S1 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001166.s001">Supporting Information S1</xref>. All the locations sampled in this study experienced cases every year. As such, our sampling does not focus on areas that have been free of rabies in the recent past.
