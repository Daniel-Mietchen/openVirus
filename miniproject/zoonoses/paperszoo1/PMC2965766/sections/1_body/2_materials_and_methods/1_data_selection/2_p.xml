<p>To perform a reliable evolutionary analysis of dog RABV circulating in North Africa, we aimed at selecting a genetic region with sufficient phylogenetic information. To this end, we sequenced a total of 3080 nt encompassing the N, P and intergenic G-L region. Total RNA from the original brain samples was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCRs and sequencing reactions were performed as described previously

 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Kissi1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. All sequences obtained have been deposited in GenBank (accession numbers GU798102â€“GU798962).
