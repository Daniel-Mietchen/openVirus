<p>Every year approximately 55,000 people die from rabies 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Knobel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Over 99% of these deaths occur in developing countries where rabies virus (RABV; negative-sense RNA virus, family 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>) is endemic in the domestic dog 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Cleaveland1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Rabies has been neglected across much of Asia and Africa, despite becoming an increasing problem in the recent decades

 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Nel1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, the currently circulating dog rabies virus is thought to have emerged during the 19th and 20th centuries

 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Talbi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Despite the importance of dogs as vectors for human rabies, little is known about the spatial and temporal dynamics of rabies in this major reservoir species, or the processes responsible for its maintenance in specific geographic localities. In particular, the role of human activities in mediating the spread of dog RABV is unclear, nor is it known how landscape characteristics, including human infrastructures such as roads, affect RABV dispersal within dog populations. However, such information is critical to revealing the determinants of RABV transmission and hence for its control in the domestic dog.
