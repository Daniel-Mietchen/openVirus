<p>We used a recently developed probabilistic approach 
 <xref rid="ppat.1001166-Lemey1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> to determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of dog RABV transmission from a large-scale gene sequence study. We encode different phylogeographic scenarios of viral spread, as well as different landscape features, in a model-based approach, and choose among these models in a quantitatively rigorous fashion. Our focus was on dog populations in North Africa where RABV has been endemic for more than a century, and our key aim was to determine how ecological, anthropogenic and evolutionary dynamics shape the spatial distribution and spread of this important zoonotic pathogen
