  <title>Spatial simulation based on the inferred evolutionary histories and epidemiological parameters of rabies spread in Algeria (A) and Morocco (B).</title>
  <p>We report the simulated spread using contours represented under the form of polygons. Different contours represent different simulation scenarios: for time = 0.25 to time = 1.0, we force the virus to move consistently in the same direction for successive transmissions during a time period of three months to one year. The dark green contour in the centre represents simulated spread with each infection taking a new and random direction, while the increasingly lighter ones represent time = 0.25 to time = 1.0.</p>
