 <caption>
  <title>MCC tree of 287 sequences of the Africa 1 clade, estimated from the N, P and G-L genes and intergenic regions of dog RABV, and showing the spatial structure of the viral lineages.</title>
  <p>Branches are colored according to the locations of viral sampling. Branch lengths are estimated in time units (years) as indicated by the time bar. Posterior clade probability values (&gt;0.9) are shown for key nodes. Although Melilla and Ceuta are considered Spanish locations they are in fact Moroccan enclaves. As such they do not represent virus dispersal across the strait of Gibraltar.</p>
