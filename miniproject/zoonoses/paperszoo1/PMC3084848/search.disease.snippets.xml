  <result pre="years of age were more likely to be identified at" exact="influenza" post="sentinel points than females, while this relationship was reversed"/>
  <result pre="as in some developing countries. The M/F ratios for seasonal" exact="influenza" post="also differ by sex and age (figure 2A). In"/>
  <result pre="higher age standardized death rates in males during the 1918" exact="influenza" post="pandemic, along with a selection effect which had a"/>
  <result pre="mortality by sex. The selection effect was that those with" exact="tuberculosis" post="(TB) in 1918 were more likely than others to"/>
  <result pre="were more likely than others to die of influenza, and" exact="tuberculosis" post="morbidity at the time was higher in males than"/>
  <result pre="and poorly understood. To implement effective measures against future novel" exact="infectious disease" post="outbreaks, differences in morbidity and mortality rates among age"/>
  <result pre="M/F ratio is amplified for pdmH1N1 infection compared to seasonal" exact="influenza" post="except in the 20â€&quot;29 year age group. Questions may"/>
