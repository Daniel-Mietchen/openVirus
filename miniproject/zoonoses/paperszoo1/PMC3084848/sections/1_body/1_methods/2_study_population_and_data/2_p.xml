<p>The first case of pdmH1N1 infection in Japan was reported on May 9, 2009. In total, 5038 cases of pdmH1N1 infection had been confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) by July 23, 2009 
 <xref rid="pone.0019409-Carr1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. From July 24, 2009, surveillance has continued by the routine ILI surveillance system 
 <xref rid="pone.0019409-National1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Data from these sites are based on clinical diagnosis, although part of them also use rapid influenza antigen detection tests, where the sensitivity to pdmH1N1 is comparable with that of the seasonal influenza A/H1N1

 <xref rid="pone.0019409-Ministry1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Sensitivity of rapid antigen tests was 53.5â€“77% in Kobe and Osaka, Japan during the first month of the pandemic 
 <xref rid="pone.0019409-Ministry1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Almost all the patients with ILI were considered to be infected with the pdmH1N1 virus, based on analyses of isolated viruses 
 <xref rid="pone.0019409-National1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Surveillance data from the 31
 <sup>st</sup> week of 2009 (July 24, 2009) to the 12
 <sup>th</sup> week of 2010 (March 28, 2010) were used in the current study. The cumulative number of pdmH1N1 cases in the study period was 2024367. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019409-t001">Table 1</xref> summarizes the patient data for pdmH1N1 influenza infection with respect to sex and age. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019409-t002">Table 2</xref> lists the influenza patient data for 2005, the year with the largest number of reported cases of influenza between 2000 and 2008.
