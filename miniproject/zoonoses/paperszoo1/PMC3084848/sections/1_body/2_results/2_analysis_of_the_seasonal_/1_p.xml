<p>The patient data for seasonal influenza and pdmH1N1 infections were compared with respect to sex and age. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019409-g002">Figure 2A</xref> shows the number of seasonal influenza cases (per 100,000) in males and females as well as the M/F ratio in 2005. Two peaks in the number of cases (per 100,000) are observed: the first peak occurs in the age group of &lt;10 years, i.e., five and four years of age for boys and girls, respectively. The second peak occurs in the age group 30 to 39 years of age with a higher number of females than males in that group.
