 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019409-g002">Figure 2B</xref> shows the number of pdmH1N1 cases in males and females as well as the M/F ratio. As in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019409-g002">figure 2A</xref>, the majority of reported patients infected with the pdmH1N1 virus are &lt;20 years old, and there are more total cases in males than females. However, compared with seasonal influenza, the difference between the male and female subpopulations is more pronounced. The first peak is seen at age 7 years for both boys and girls. Under 20 years of age, the M/F ratio is again &gt;1, but the M/F ratio for pdmH1N1 is higher than for seasonal influenza (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019409-g002">figure 2C</xref>). In adults 20 to 79 years of age, the M/F ratio is &lt;1 and the M/F ratio for pdmH1N1 is lower than the M/F ratios for seasonal influenza in people over the age of 40 years (
