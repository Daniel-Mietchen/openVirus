 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019409-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows the dynamics of influenza infections in Japan over the last decade. It is clear that the infection dynamics in year 2009 (bold solid line) had a different configuration from those in previous years (thin lines): The number of patients with pdmH1N1 started to increase in summer, reached its peak in late November (Nov. 23â€“29), and gradually decreased thereafter, whereas seasonal influenza typically had its peaks between January and March. All the cases of ILI reported from the 31
 <sup>st</sup> week of 2009 to the 12
 <sup>th</sup> week of 2010 were considered to be infection with the pdmH1N1 virus.
