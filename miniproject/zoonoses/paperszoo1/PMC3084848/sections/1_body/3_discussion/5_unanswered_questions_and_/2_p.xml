<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019409-g002">figure 2C</xref>, the sex-related difference measured by M/F ratio is amplified for pdmH1N1 infection compared to seasonal influenza except in the 20â€“29 year age group. Questions may arise as to why the configurations of seasonal influenza and pdmH1N1 shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019409-g002">figures 2A and 2B</xref> are so different and why the sex-related difference is more evident for pdmH1N1 infection than for seasonal influenza infections between 2000 to 2008 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019409-g002">figure 2C</xref>). While our data may be confounded by possible variation in patterns of seeking medical care among different age and sex categories, it is unlikely that such variation would be emphasized exclusively in the case of pdmH1N1. One explanation for these findings may be that almost all people lacked or had only weak immunity against the pdmH1N1 virus at the start of the 2009 outbreak, as well as the pdmH1N1 virus being more contagious than seasonal influenza viruses (although it has lower pathogenicity) 
 <xref rid="pone.0019409-World1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Thus, the number of cases is higher in age/sex groups that have weaker immunities, more clinical infections and/or higher levels of exposure.
