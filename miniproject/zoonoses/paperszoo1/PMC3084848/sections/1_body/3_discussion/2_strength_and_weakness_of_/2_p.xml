<p>The present study had several limitations. The sentinel points are not (necessarily) chosen to represent the age distribution of Japanese population and simply encompass about 10% of clinics in Japan. It is impossible to estimate the morbidity rate for the Japanese population because the numbers of cases are reported from the selected sentinel points, not from screening the entire population 
 <xref rid="pone.0019409-National1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, as shown in the appendix, it is possible to estimate age-specific M/F ratios for morbidity. Since the clinical surveillance is based on individuals presenting with ILI, it does not capture asymptomatic or mild infections
