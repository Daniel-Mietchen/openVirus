<p>This paper is the first to discuss the morbidity rate of pdmH1N1 infection in terms of both sex and age. We speculate that infection dynamics might depend on differences in immunity as well as social activities that are influenced by age and gender 
 <xref rid="pone.0019409-Departments1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. As mentioned previously, the influences of sex and age on viral infections may be confounded by social roles and activities 
 <xref rid="pone.0019409-Departments1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. According to a WHO report, human activities are reflective of age and gender, e.g. many young children attend day-care centers or kindergartens, slightly older children go to elementary schools, and teenagers attend classes and participate in club activities at high school 
 <xref rid="pone.0019409-Departments1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Adult women may be more exposed to infectious pathogens through their caretaker roles within the family, and this may lead to a higher risk of infection for adult females than for adult males 
 <xref rid="pone.0019409-Departments1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Given these different types of activities, the rates of exposure to the pdmH1N1 virus could be expected to differ across age groups and by sex. If we assume equal levels of immunity in male and female adults, a significant difference in infection risks might indicate differences in exposure to the pathogen
