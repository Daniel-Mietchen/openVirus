<p>The M/F ratios for seasonal influenza also differ by sex and age (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019409-g002">figure 2A</xref>). In the case of infants and children, where we assume that exposure to pathogens is equal and the probability of visiting sentinel points are equal for both sexes, it is speculated that the observed difference in M/F ratio may reflect a true difference in morbidity rates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019409-g002">figures 2A and 2B</xref>). We assume parents seek health care equally for sons and daughters, based on the similar levels of immunization for boys and girls. In 2008, male to female immunization ratios of measles-rubella combination vaccine were 0.997 (95% CI 0.993–1.000) for 1 year old, 0.991 (0.987–0.995) for preschool age (5–6 years), 0.987 (0.983–0.991) for 13 years and 0.948 (0.944–0.951) for 18 years of age

 <xref rid="pone.0019409-Engler1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Since immunity generally increases with age, it might be possible that by adulthood, immunity in males “catches up” to that in females
