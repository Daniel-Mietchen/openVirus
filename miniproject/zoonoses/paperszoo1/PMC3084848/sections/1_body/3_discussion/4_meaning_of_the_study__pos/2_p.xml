<p>In fact, the total number of male inpatients with pdmH1N1 was nearly twice that of female inpatients (9305 vs. 5409) 
 <xref rid="pone.0019409-National1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Approximately 87% (12,807 out of 14,714) of the total number of inpatients with pdmH1N1 were &lt;20 years of age, while the female population included 54 pregnant women. At first glance, the male preponderance of cases would suggest that males of any age were more susceptible to the virus. The significance of the present study is that it examines pdmH1N1 morbidity not only with respect to sex but also age. If the differences among age groups had not been investigated, the reversed relationship in patients â‰¥20 years of age would have been overlooked, and the true complexity of pdmH1N1infection patterns would not have been appreciated.
