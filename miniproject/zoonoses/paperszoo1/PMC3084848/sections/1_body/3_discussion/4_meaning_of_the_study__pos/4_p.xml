<p>The clinical significance of the different M/F ratios at different ages varies. In the age group &lt; 20 years, a relatively small difference in morbidity rate (6.5–15.8%) nevertheless translates to a large difference in the actual number of patients. By contrast, the sex-related difference is relatively large in adults (43% at 30–39 years for example) yet the difference in the actual number of patients is small.</p>
