<p>A major proportion of people affected by pdmH1N1 were under 20 years of age, and the M/F ratio in this group was greater than 1. We assume the rate of seeking medical care is equal for males and females in this age category. For most of these people, decisions about seeking care will be made on their behalf by parents or guardians, and there is no evidence that adults in Japan display gender-based bias when seeking care for children. Rather, documentation of similar immunization rates between boys and girls would suggest a lack of bias 
 <xref rid="pone.0019409-Portal1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. We therefore suggest that more males of this age developed pdmH1N1 than females.
