<p>It is unsurprising that sex and age would both play a role in infection patterns. Sex-determined differences in susceptibility to infections are well documented; females seem to mount more vigorous immune responses and have higher resistance to bacterial and viral infections in general 
 <xref rid="pone.0019409-Picone1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Vaccination studies have documented that adverse effects from vaccination against pdmH1N1 were reported in 554 males and 1,339 females, including 33 pregnant women, as of the 52
 <sup>nd</sup> week of 2009. About 80% of these cases were &lt;50 years of age 
 <xref rid="pone.0019409-National1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. On the other hand, more deaths related to vaccination were reported in males (72 males vs. 32 females), 95% of whom (99/104 cases) were &gt;60 years of age 
 <xref rid="pone.0019409-National1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Humoral immune responses to vaccines are higher in females than in males, but females report more severe local and systemic adverse reactions 
 <xref rid="pone.0019409-Engler1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The mechanisms underlying sex-specific differences in immune development and sex-related differences in susceptibility to infection and vaccination efficacy remain ill-defined and poorly understood. To implement effective measures against future novel infectious disease outbreaks, differences in morbidity and mortality rates among age groups and between the sexes will need to be considered, as well as the age- and sex-specific dynamics of infection.
