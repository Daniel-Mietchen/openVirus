 <xref rid="pone.0019409-Noymer1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> described higher age standardized death rates in males during the 1918 influenza pandemic, along with a selection effect which had a strong and long-lasting effect on differential mortality by sex. The selection effect was that those with tuberculosis (TB) in 1918 were more likely than others to die of influenza, and tuberculosis morbidity at the time was higher in males than in females. This factor is unlikely to be an issue today due to the much lower morbidity rates for TB in current Japanese society (19.0 per 100,000 as of 2009)
