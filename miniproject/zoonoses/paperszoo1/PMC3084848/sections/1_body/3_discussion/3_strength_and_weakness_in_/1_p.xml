<p>This paper compares the morbidity rate for pdmH1N1 infection in terms of both sex and age through M/F ratios, an analysis which has not been previously performed by other papers on this topic. Wang et al estimated that the asymptomatic ratio of the pdmH1N1 infection to be 75% but did not mention any difference in morbidity rate between sexes or among age groups

 <xref rid="pone.0019409-Lessler1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, none of these studies mention differences between sexes or among age groups except for Odaira et al 
 <xref rid="pone.0019409-Odaira1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Odaira reported that household SAR in siblings was significantly higher (16.4%) than in parents (2.4%) 
 <xref rid="pone.0019409-Odaira1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The difference in SAR between parents and siblings was attributed to their behavior; i.e., greater contact between siblings and less satisfactory countermeasures for infection control. It would be useful, given the results of the present study, to examine household SAR with respect to sex and age.
