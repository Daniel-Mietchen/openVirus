<p>In preparing for novel infectious diseases, analysis of pdmH1N1 cases provides valuable information, as almost the entire population lacked immunity to this strain at the start of the 2009 outbreak. As a result, differences in pdmH1N1 morbidity rates with respect to sex and age could be evaluated without the confounding influence of herd immunity. In contrast, cyclical outbreaks of seasonal influenza and other common infectious diseases cannot be studied in this way, because in the usual community-acquired infectious diseases, the levels of cumulative herd immunity are likely to vary with sex and age 
 <xref rid="pone.0019409-Glezen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, thus confounding the analysis. The aims of the present paper are twofold: to describe the dynamics of pdmH1N1 infection and to clarify the differences in morbidity rates with regard to age and sex from an epidemiological viewpoint.
