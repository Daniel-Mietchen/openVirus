<p>Differences in sex-based transmission have been reported for several diseases. In a study of blood donors &lt;20 years of age (i.e. before sexually transmitted diseases are likely), infection with human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), a retrovirus causing adult T-cell leukemia 
 <xref rid="pone.0019409-Miyoshi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, was detected more frequently in males than in females 
 <xref rid="pone.0019409-Eshima1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. This may be regarded as a sex-based difference in vertical infection of HTLV-I through breast milk, and it suggests that immunity is more mature in female infants than in male infants. Another study showed that when a mother is exposed to respiratory syncytial virus, sons are twice as likely to have respiratory syncytial virus detected as daughters 
 <xref rid="pone.0019409-Stensballe1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In adults, humoral immune responses to vaccines are higher in females than in males, but females report more severe local and systemic adverse reactions 
 <xref rid="pone.0019409-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0019409-Engler1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Despite these examples, however, the underlying sex-specific differences in immune development are generally ill-defined and poorly understood.
