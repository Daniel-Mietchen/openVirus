  <title>The number of cases (per 100,000 population) of influenza and the M/F ratio reported from sentinel points in Japan.</title>
  <p>The number of cases (left axis) and the M/F ratio (right axis) for seasonal influenza in 2005 (A) and for pdmH1N1 influenza in 2009 (B) reported from the sentinel points are illustrated. M/F ratios associated with pdmH1N1 (2009, solid bold line) and seasonal influenza (2000â€“2008, thin lines) are compared (C). 95% confidence intervals for M/F ratios are indicated by error bars. Horizontal lines indicate M/F ratio of 1. *: Significance with the Bonferroni's correction (
