<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0028027-t001">Table 1</xref>, a total of 208 pH1N1 outbreaks were reported from May 2009 to April 2011. Most outbreaks (205/208, 98.6%) occurred in the first epidemic year from May 2009 to April 2010, whereas only 3 outbreaks (1.4%) were found in the second epidemic year from May 2010 to April 2011. The frequency of outbreaks (average number of pH1N1 outbreaks/month) in the second epidemic year was 0.25, which was significantly lower than that (17.08) in the first epidemic year (

The scale (average attack rate/outbreak) and duration (average days/outbreak) of pH1N1 influenza in the second epidemic year were 2.13% and 18.57 days, respectively, which were significantly lower or shorter than those (9.82% and 26.48 days) in the first epidemic year (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). However, the frequency, scale and duration of pH1N1 influenza outbreaks in the second epidemic year were similar to those of seasonal influenza outbreaks (
 <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05), suggesting that pH1N1 influenza had most likely become a seasonal influenza in the second epidemic year in Guangzhou.
