<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028027-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, in the first epidemic year, the epidemic of pH1N1 influenza started at June 2009 and lasted to April 2010, but mainly occurred in autumn/winter season from October to December and peaked in November 2009. In the second epidemic year, the major epidemic of pH1N1 influenza occurred in winter/spring seasons from January to April 2011 and peaked in March. Compared to seasonal influenza, which occurred in spring (B subtype) and summer (H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes) seasons (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028027-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), epidemics of pH1N1 influenza seems to occur preferably in cold seasons. It should be noted, however, that the peak of pH1N1 epidemic had prolonged from November 2009 in the first epidemic year to March 2011 in the second epidemic year, suggesting a tendency that season of pH1N1 influenza epidemic may probably further shift to spring/summer seasons. Interestingly, seasonal influenza H1N1 virus was a predominant subtype resulting in the epidemic of influenza in the pre-epidemic year from May to August 2008, but became a subordinate subtype of epidemic of seasonal influenza in summer of 2009 and disappeared completely thereafter. Instead, pN1N1 virus, as a subordinate subtype, was co-circulating with seasonal influenza H3N2 virus in summer season. The information suggested that pH1N1 will probably replace the traditional seasonal influenza H1N1 and result in seasonal influenza in coming years in Guangzhou.
