<p>A total of 81 severe pH1N1 cases were reported during the surveillance period, of which 16 died. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028027-g001">Fig 1</xref>, in the first epidemic year, the severe disease rate (% of patients progressed to severe disease) and fatality rate (deaths/10000) in pH1N1 influenza patients were 0.37% (77/20885) and 7.18 per 10000 (15/20885), respectively, whereas both decreased to 0.02% (4/17188) and 0.58 per 10000 (1/17188) in the second epidemic year. Both were significantly lower than those of pH1N1 influenza in the first epidemic year (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05), but similar to those of seasonal influenza during the same period (
 <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05). Fatal cases and severe appeared in each age group ranging from 1 to 71 years old. In age groups of 0∼5, 6∼15, 16∼25, 26∼40, 41∼59 and 60∼ years, the fatal cases /severe cases/total cases were 6/27/2565, 1/6/18084, 3/14/11716, 2/13/3793, 4/17/1686, 0/4/229, respectively. The death rate of severe cases did not show significant difference between these age groups (
 <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05). Also, no pregnant patients were found in severe and fatal cases (data not shown). More than half of severe pH1N1 cases (43/81) had at least one pre-existing chronic disease. Potential risk factors of pre-existing chronic diseases associated with death were further analyzed using univariate analysis based on 77 severe cases reported in the first epidemic years (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0028027-t002">Table 2</xref>). The results showed that chronic pulmonary diseases were the risk factor associated with the death of severe pH1N1 influenza (OR = 6.00, 95%CI = 1.70–21.22), whereas no other chronic diseases were found to be associated with the death. In the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> epidemic year, only 4 pH1N1 severe cases were reported and one of them dead and the fatal case also had pre-existing chronic pulmonary disease.
