<p>Taken together, the information has suggested that pH1N1 influenza virus may probably replace the traditional seasonal influenza H1N1 resulting in seasonal influenza in coming years in Guangzhou. However, it is needed to be further confirmed in future years. Thus, we will continue our surveillance of pH1N1, practically in virological surveillance to monitor potential possible virus variations due to the viral gene mutations and reassortments.</p>
