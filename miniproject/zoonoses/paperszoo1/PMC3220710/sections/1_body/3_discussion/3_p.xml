<p>Our results also showed that, in Guangzhou, seasonal influenza occurred in spring (B subtype) and summer (H1N1 and/or H3N2 subtypes) seasons annually, whereas pH1N1 influenza mainly occurred in autumn/winter seasons from October to December 2009 in the first epidemic year (

 <xref rid="pone.0028027-Haddock1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Notably we found that the epidemic of pH1N1 influenza had prolonged to winter/spring season from January to March 2011 in the second epidemic year, showing a tendency that the epidemics of pH1N1 influenza may probably further shift to spring/summer seasons (

It is also noted that seasonal influenza H1N1 virus caused the epidemic of influenza in 2008, whereas H3N2 influenza became to be predominant in 2009 and 2010 accompanied with disappearance of seasonal influenza H1N1 after winter season of 2009.
