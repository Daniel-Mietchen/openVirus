<p>At the early stage of pH1N1 influenza spread to Guangzhou (May to June 2009), only a few persons acquired the infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028027-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), which might be attributed to the strict measures applied in Guangzhou for the control of this infectious disease. However, similar to the other countries and regions 
 <xref rid="pone.0028027-Hersh1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0028027-Roll1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, pH1N1 influenza virus was spread to the whole city and resulted in large number of outbreaks in the first epidemic year after August 2009 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0028027-t001">Table 1</xref>), which is markedly higher than previous outbreaks of seasonal influenza in Guangzhou 
 <xref rid="pone.0028027-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Consistently, the frequency, scale and duration of the outbreaks of pH1N1 influenza were significantly higher or longer than that of seasonal influenza, as we reported previously, in a boarding school the infection rate was 32% 
 <xref rid="pone.0028027-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. This might be due to the fact that pH1N1 virus was newly derived originally from swine and there was no or little immunity against the infection caused by this virus in the community of Guangzhou. However, we found that persons aged â‰¥ 60 years was only accounted for 0.60% of the total pH1N1 confirmed cases, which was similar to many other countries, such as the United States and England where less cases among people over 60 was also observed

 <xref rid="pone.0028027-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, which needs further study.
