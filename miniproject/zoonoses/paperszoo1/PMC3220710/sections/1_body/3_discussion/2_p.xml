 <xref rid="pone.0028027-Torres1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, in Guangzhou, severe disease and fatality rates of pH1N1 influenza in the first epidemic year were significantly higher than those of seasonal influenza (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028027-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), but significantly lower than the initial epidemic estimate 
 <xref rid="pone.0028027-Fraser1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, it is different from previous reports that age, pregnancy, diabetes and obesity might be risk factors associated with severe and fatal cases of pHN1 influenza

 <xref rid="pone.0028027-Webb1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, our results did not show significant association between these factors and severe/fatal cases of pH1N1 in Guangzhou (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0028027-t002">Table 2</xref>). Nevertheless, our results showed that, over half of severe cases had pre-existing chronic diseases, of which chronic pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases were more common, and only chronic pulmonary disease was the risk factor associated with the death of severe pH1N1 influenza. This is consistent with previous studies on seasonal influenza and some recent studies on pH1N1 influenza 
 <xref rid="pone.0028027-Kirakli1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0028027-Pebody1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0028027-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Our surveillance showed that features of pH1N1 influenza in the second epidemic year had been changed as follows: (1) Outbreaks of pH1N1 influenza reduced significantly from 205 in the first epidemic year to 3 in the second epidemic year. (2) The frequency, scale and duration of pH1N1 outbreaks in the second epidemic year were significantly lower or shorter than those in the first epidemic year. (3) Severe disease and fatality rates of pH1N1 influenza in the second epidemic year were significantly lower than those in the first epidemic year. These features of pH1N1 influenza in the second epidemic year are similar to those of seasonal influenza but significantly different from those of pH1N1 influenza in the first year. These changes of pH1N1 influenza in the second epidemic year may probably be attributed to part of the population in Guangzhou had experienced pH1N1 influenza in the first epidemic year or received pH1N1 influenza vaccination which was started in Guangzhou from October 2009 
 <xref rid="pone.0028027-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Although it has been reported that vaccination of 2009 pH1N1 influenza was effective 
 <xref rid="pone.0028027-Girard1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, it has been reported that some persons were still infected by pH1N1 virus after they received the vaccination 
 <xref rid="pone.0028027-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. This may be due to: (1) as we have reported, over half of recovered patients and vaccinated persons would have lost sufficient immunity against the recurrence of the viral infection after half a year (17); and (2) influenza virus genome can mutate rapidly to escape the host immunity. Recently, similar changes in pH1N1 influenza epidemics are also reported by other groups 
 <xref rid="pone.0028027-Louie1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Therefore, we may conclude that pH1N1 no longer caused a pandemic after the first epidemic year and had likely become a seasonal influenza in Guangzhou, China.
