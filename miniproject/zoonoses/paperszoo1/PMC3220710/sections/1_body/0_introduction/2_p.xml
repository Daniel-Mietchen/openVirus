Considering that pH1N1 influenza was inevitable to spread to Guangzhou, we conducted a surveillance system of pH1N1 influenza in early May 2009 in Guangzhou, before the first imported pH1N1 influenza case (from the US) in China was reported on 18 May 2009. Subsequently, we reported the first confirmed native pH1N1 case
