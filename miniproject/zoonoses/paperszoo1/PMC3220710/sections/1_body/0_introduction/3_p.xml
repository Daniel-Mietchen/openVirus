<p>Although WHO declared that the new H1N1 virus has largely run its course and the world has been moving into the post-pandemic period on 10 August 2010 
 <xref rid="pone.0028027-WHO2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, we continued our surveillance of pH1N1 influenza in Guangzhou and analyzed the data based on information provided by four general surveillance hospitals and twelve regional CDC during the two-years surveillance period from May 2009 to April 2011. Large numbers of studies/investigations on epidemiology and clinical features of the first epidemic year of pH1N1 influenza from 2009 to 2010 have been reported

 <xref rid="pone.0028027-Bandaranayake1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In this paper, we described the information obtained from a two years surveillance of pH1N1 influenza in Guangzhou from May 2009 to April 2011, and compared with those of traditional seasonal influenza in order to detect the epidemic tendency of pH1N1 and assist public health control measures.
