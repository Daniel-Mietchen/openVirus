<p>Data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software (version 11.5, SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). χ
 <sup>2</sup> test and/or Fisher exact test were/was used to compare proportions of different groups. T test was used to compare the difference between the groups. Binary logistic regression was employed to explore risk factors potentially associated with fatal pH1N1 cases, of which different pre-existing chronic diseases were considered as the independent variables. The progressions of severe pH1N1 cases were considered as the dependent variation, with 0 for recovered developing into mild pH1N1 patients and 1 for dead patients. For all analysis, 
 <italic>P</italic> values ≤ 0.05 were regarded as significant.
