<p>We set out to determine whether the epidemiology of human cases of HPAI H5N1 follows temporal patterns similar to seasonal influenza, aiming to provide this data to increase prevention and control measures among poultry and public health prevention messages about vigilance near birds during seasons with higher risk of human infections. We investigated seasonal patterns in the occurrence of human cases of HPAI H5N1 using a comprehensive data set comprising all confirmed, symptomatic cases published in the literature since the initial 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong. We assessed hemisphere as a potential moderator of seasonal patterns, since seasonal incidence patterns due to weather changes could be dependent on hemisphere. Due to the tilt of the Earth's rotational axis, seasonal weather patterns are reversed between the Northern and Southern hemispheres, with Equatorial regions showing less seasonal variation
