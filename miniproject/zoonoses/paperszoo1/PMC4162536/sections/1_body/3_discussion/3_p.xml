<p>Our research has limitations. Standards of surveillance and reporting of HPAI H5N1 cases vary by country and locality, potentially introducing sampling bias

 <xref rid="pone.0106171-Murakami1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Also, given the higher occurrence of infection with H5N1 in poultry in the winter, surveillance may be more rigorous in these high-risk months. Case reports in the literature were of inconsistent quality and almost never followed standardized reporting guidelines such as the WHO Clinical Case Summary Form 
 <xref rid="pone.0106171-World3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Since we were interested in the illness onset of human cases, and only sporadic clusters of limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission have occurred to date, we did not distinguish between transmission modality (zoonotic or human-to-human).
