<p>We compiled our dataset of 611 cases through a systematic search of all published human cases of HPAI H5N1, then investigated seasonal incidence patterns in human infections with HPAI H5N1 viruses and explored hemisphere as a potential moderator of seasonal fluctuations in case incidence. We find that the occurrence of human cases of HPAI H5N1 worldwide is more than three times higher during winter and spring periods combined than in fall and summer months combined. The winter peak in case occurrence persists across 15 countries occupying six diverse climate groups.</p>
