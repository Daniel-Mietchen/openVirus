<p>Additionally, we find that hemisphere does not significantly moderate the relationship between season and case incidence. However, as most human cases of HPAI H5N1 to date have occurred in the Northern Hemisphere and no cases have been reported in the Southern Hemisphere, fully assessing the role of hemisphere was not possible, and power to test the interaction was inherently limited due to the relatively small number of cases and affected countries. Another possible limitation is the regression assumption that cases occur independently; however, for a rare disease such as HPAI H5N1 occurring in geographically- and temporally-separated regions, any violation of this assumption is likely inconsequential.</p>
