<p>To our knowledge, our work represents the most comprehensive analysis of global seasonal patterns in all known human HPAI H5N1 cases to date. We found robust peaks in case occurrence during winter and spring months. Prioritizing prevention and control activities among poultry and targeting public health messaging to reduce poultry exposures during winter and spring months may help to reduce zoonotic transmission of HPAI H5N1 virus in resource-limited settings. Contingent on viral sampling in poultry markets and continuous veterinary surveillance, the public could be advised on the relatively lower risk of visiting live poultry markets during periods of the year with lower case occurrence. Additionally, in countries with existing poultry vaccination programs, such as Egypt, a well-matched poultry vaccine could be administered strategically before peak seasonality.</p>
