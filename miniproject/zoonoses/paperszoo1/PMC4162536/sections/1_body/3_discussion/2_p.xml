<p>These robust seasonal differences in the frequency of human HPAI H5N1 virus infections mirror previous research on virus isolate patterns in avian vectors. Surveillance data indicate that the yield of HPAI H5N1 viruses among aquatic and terrestrial poultry in mainland China is highest during winter

 <xref rid="pone.0106171-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and space-time cluster analyses show that worldwide HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in wild waterfowl peak in winter and early spring (Octoberâ€“March) 
 <xref rid="pone.0106171-Si1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. These HPAI H5N1 outbreaks were associated with migration patterns of wild birds and may contribute to the strong seasonal occurrence pattern in human HPAI H5N1 cases. Our results are also consistent with prior research showing improved influenza virus transmission in cold and dry conditions, such as those characterizing winter weather in many climates

 <xref rid="pone.0106171-Shaman1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Finally, given known associations between human case occurrence and local poultry outbreaks, our findings may reflect seasonal variations in human-poultry contact, for example in live markets and agriculture
