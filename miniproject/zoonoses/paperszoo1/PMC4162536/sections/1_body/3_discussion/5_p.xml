<p>We defined climate types using average regional climate patterns, but were not able to model day-by-day local weather fluctuations that may influence HPAI H5N1 viral transmission. A promising direction for future research, therefore, is to develop finer-grained incidence models of climate incorporating local weather at the time of infection. Modeling factors known to alter influenza virus transmission, such as humidity and temperature, would likely improve predictive power and elucidate the role of climate. Future research could also investigate other possible mechanisms for the observed seasonal patterns, such as variations in poultry industry and trade activities.</p>
