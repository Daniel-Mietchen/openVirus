<p>For each case, we extracted data on location (country and city) and date (month and year) of illness onset. We created a season variable based on month of case occurrence (defining summer as June–August, fall as September–November, winter as December–February, and spring as March–May). Based on country, we also defined a hemisphere variable (Northern or Equatorial; no Southern Hemisphere cases have been reported to date).</p>
