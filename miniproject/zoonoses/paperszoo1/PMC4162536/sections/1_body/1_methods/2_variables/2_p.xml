<p>We defined a climate variable characterizing the predominant climate of the patient's city or region. We used the Köppen-Geiger climate classification map, which assigns one of 31 classifications incorporating three dimensions of climate: main climate (equatorial, arid, warm temperate, snow, polar), precipitation, and temperature 
 <xref rid="pone.0106171-Kottek1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The map is based on extensive data from the second half of the 20
 <sup>th</sup> century, collected by the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre at the German Weather Service and the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia. For a small number of cases missing city or region data, but occurring in a country with a clearly predominant climate (n = 7), we imputed the country's predominant climate.
