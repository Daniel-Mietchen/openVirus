<p>Negative binomial regression is a generalization of the Poisson model that allows a variance term to be fit to the data independent of the mean term, thus better modeling over-dispersion

 <xref rid="pone.0106171-VerHoef1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. We note, however, that because Model 1 includes only orthogonal categorical factors, the maximum likelihood estimation process of any generalized linear model (GLM) in this case reduces mathematically to fitting separate means to each disjoint subset (defined by seasons). Thus, here, the choice of GLM is consequential only to the fitted standard errors and resulting p-values, not to the coefficients or predicted values.
