  <label>(3)</label>
 </disp-formula>where 
 <italic>Y</italic> is case frequency, 
 <italic>b</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is the intercept, 
 <italic>x
  <sub>s</sub>
 </italic> is season (summer, fall, winter, spring) and 
 <italic>x
  <sub>h</sub>
 </italic> is hemisphere (Northern, Equatorial). Thus, Model (1) allows us to assess the existence of seasonal patterns. We computed the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for fall, winter, and spring relative to summer by exponentiating their regression coefficients. Analogously to relative risk, the IRR represents the predicted multiplicative increase in event frequency for a covariate versus the reference level. That is, an IRR of 2 represents a twofold increase in event rate. As a secondary, post-hoc analysis, we used Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) 
 <xref rid="pone.0106171-Akaike1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, a measure of fit-complexity tradeoff, and the likelihood-ratio test to compare Model (1) to Models (2) and (3), allowing us to assess the presence of a main effect of hemisphere and interaction of season with hemisphere. AIC is an entropy-based measure that decreases as the model becomes simpler (fewer parameters) and better-fitting (higher log-likelihood): thus, models with lower AIC are preferable.
