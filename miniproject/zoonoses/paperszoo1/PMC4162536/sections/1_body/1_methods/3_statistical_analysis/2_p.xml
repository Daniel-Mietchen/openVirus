<p>We first computed the proportion of cases occurring in each season. To assess significance of seasonal incidence patterns and to consider hemisphere as a moderator, we modeled case incidence using negative binomial regression. While the more common Poisson regression model is a canonical choice for modeling rare event occurrence, it relies on the assumption that the mean and variance of event frequency per unit time are equal. A common violation of this distributional assumption occurs when event frequency is over-dispersed: that is, the variance greatly exceeds the mean
