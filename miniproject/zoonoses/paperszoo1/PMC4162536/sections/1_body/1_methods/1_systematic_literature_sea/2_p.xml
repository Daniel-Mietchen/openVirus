<p>We then reviewed articles published in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar using keywords “H5N1” and “human” or “humans.” We included articles in any language published between January 1, 1997 (the year of the initial Hong Kong outbreak) and April 19, 2013. We included articles describing confirmed or possible human cases of HPAI H5N1 virus infection. We defined confirmed cases as those meeting WHO reporting criteria: isolation of HPAI H5N1 virus, a positive result by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of clinical specimens using H5-specific primers and probes, an elevated H5-specific antibody titer of ≥1∶80 (or equivalent using the WHO protocol), or at least a fourfold rise in H5N1 virus neutralization antibody titer in paired sera 
 <xref rid="pone.0106171-World2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. We defined possible cases as those lacking laboratory confirmation but exhibiting symptoms and having known exposure to a confirmed human case. Due to limited availability of data on other modes of transmission (such as via consumption of raw poultry meat or exposure to feces-contaminated environments), this definition is more restrictive than the WHO definitions of suspected and probable cases. Two independent reviewers (RP, MM) assessed each article for these inclusion criteria; a third reviewer (NK) resolved disagreements.
