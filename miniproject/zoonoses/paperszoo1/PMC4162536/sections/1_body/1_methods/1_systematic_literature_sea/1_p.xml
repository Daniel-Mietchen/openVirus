<p>To compile a dataset of laboratory-confirmed and possible human cases of HPAI H5N1 worldwide, we systematically searched four databases: PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and the World Health Organization Global Alert and Response compilation (WHO GAR) 
 <xref rid="pone.0106171-World1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. We created an initial dataset using cases published in the WHO GAR website, which includes cases reported since November 2003. We assumed laboratory confirmation satisfying the WHO reporting standard for all such cases, although specific clinical laboratory data were not provided.
