<p>Model (2), incorporating a main effect of hemisphere, and Model (3), incorporating an interaction of season with hemisphere, were not significantly better-fitting than model (1) (likelihood-ratio test: chi-square  = 2.16, df = 1, p = 0.14 and chi-square  = 2.82, df = 4, p = 0.59, respectively). Model (1) had comparable AIC (367.90) to Model (2) (367.74) and lower AIC than Model (3) (373.08). Thus, the season-only model adequately described seasonal variation; incorporating a main effect or interaction with hemisphere did not significantly improve fit. Model fit is summarized in
