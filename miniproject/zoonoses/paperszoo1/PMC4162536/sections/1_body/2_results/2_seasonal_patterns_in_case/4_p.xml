 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106171-g003">Figure 3b</xref> displays case incidence by season and climate. By visual inspection, the winter peak in case occurrence relative to summer and fall is robust across all six climate types. Case frequency in the spring appears more variable by climate group: three climate types (Arid/desert/hot summer, Equatorial/fully humid, and Equatorial/monsoonal) show some increase in frequency in spring relative to summer and fall, while the remaining three (Warm temperate/winter dry/hot summer, Equatorial/winter dry, and Other) do not show a spring peak in case occurrence.
