<p>As expected, a classical Poisson model was overdispersed (residual deviance  = 1221.98, df = 60, p&lt;0.001; also see

 <xref rid="pone.0106171-UCLA1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and yielded artificially low p-values. The negative binomial model appeared to resolve the poor fit due to overdispersion (residual deviance  = 65.40, df = 60; p = 0.29). 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0106171-t003">Table 3</xref> displays regression results for Models (1)–(3). Based on Model (1), case occurrence is higher in winter vs. summer (IRR = 4.45, p = 0.03) and marginally higher in spring vs. summer (IRR = 2.77, p = 0.13), but not in fall vs. summer (IRR = 1.33, p = 0.68).
