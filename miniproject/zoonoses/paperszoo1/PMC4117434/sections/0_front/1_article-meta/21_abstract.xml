  <title>Background</title>
  <p>To date, 
   <italic>Alphavirus</italic> infections and their most prominent member, chikungunya fever, a viral disease which first became apparent in Tanzania in 1953, have been very little investigated in regions without epidemic occurrence. Few data exist on burden of disease and socio-economic and environmental covariates disposing to infection.

 <sec>
  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>A cross-sectional seroprevalence study was undertaken in 1,215 persons from Mbeya region, South-Western Tanzania, to determine the seroprevalence of anti-
   <italic>Alphavirus</italic> IgG antibodies, and to investigate associated risk factors.
  </p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Results</title>
  <p>18% of 1,215 samples were positive for 
   <italic>Alphavirus</italic> IgG. Seropositivity was associated with participant age, low to intermediate elevation, flat terrain and with IgG positivity for Rift Valley fever, 
   <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, and rickettsiae of the spotted fever group. When comparing the geographical distribution of 
   <italic>Alphavirus</italic> seropositivity to that of Rift Valley fever, it was obvious that 
   <italic>Alphaviruses</italic> had spread more widely throughout the study area, while Rift Valley fever was concentrated along the shore of Lake Malawi.

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>
   <italic>Alphavirus</italic> infections may contribute significantly to the febrile disease burden in the study area, and are associated with several arthropod-borne infections. Their spread seems only limited by factors affecting mosquitoes, and seems less restricted than that of Rift Valley fever.
