 <title>Author Summary</title>
 <p>The origin of febrile disease is often difficult to diagnose. In tropical countries, viral infections that are transmitted by arthropods include, among others, 
  <italic>Alphavirus</italic> infections (e.g. chikungunya fever), dengue, West Nile, Yellow Fever and Rift Valley fever. In malaria endemic areas, these diseases are often mis-diagnosed and treated as malaria. Our study examined serum samples from 1,215 participants of a population survey from the Mbeya region, south-western Tanzania, for antibodies against 
  <italic>Alphaviruses</italic> of the Semliki forest group as a sign of past infection. We found 18% of study participants positive, a surprisingly high number which points to a hitherto undetected circulation of 
  <italic>Alphaviruses</italic> in the region. Among examined risk factors, even terrain, low to moderate elevation and participant age were associated with antibody positivity. Comparison with the distribution of Rift Valley fever seropositivity showed that 
  <italic>Alphaviruses</italic> are more widely distributed throughout the study area, while Rift Valley fever seems to occur in a limited area close to Lake Malawi only.
