<p>We found a significant association of anti-
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> IgG status with elevation above sea level, with significantly higher seroprevalence in the strata below 1,198 m, both in uni-variable and multi-variable analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002979-g002">fig. 2</xref>). The median elevation of the Kyela site is 487 m (Interquartile range IQR 483 m–514 m), and that of Igurusi is 1,193 m (IQR 1,156–1,205 m). Not only elevation, but also slope of the terrain was negatively associated with seropositivity in uni- and multi-variable analysis, even when adjusted for age and elevation (PR 0.86 per degree, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.95, p = 0.004), with the highest anti-
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> IgG prevalence occurring on terrain with a slope of less than ∼1.6° (
