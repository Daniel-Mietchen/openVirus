<p>Several social, economic and behavioural factors showed significant association in uni-variable analysis but were rendered non-significant in multi-variable analysis when adjusting for age, elevation and slope of terrain. Factors associated with higher anti-
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> IgG prevalence in uni-variable analysis included a lower socio-economic status, lower population density, higher vegetation density and higher land surface temperatures, especially night temperatures. Also, bed net ownership and higher frequency of use, which occurred in areas with higher mosquito burdens, were associated with a higher seropositivity in uni-variable analysis. Anti-
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> IgG status was not associated with animal ownership, including cattle, sheep, goats and chicken (data not shown).
