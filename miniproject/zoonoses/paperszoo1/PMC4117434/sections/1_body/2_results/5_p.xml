<p>Next, we analysed correlations between anti-
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> IgG status and other infectious diseases throughout the survey. Uni-variable analyses showed significant positive associations of anti-
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> IgG with 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria RDT positivity, antibody positivity for spotted fever group rickettsiae (SFG) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002979-Heinrich1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, and any of the tested 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0002979-t002">table 2</xref>). In separate models for each of these pathogens, that were adjusted for age, elevation and slope of terrain, a significant positive association was retained for SFG IgG, 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> IgG and RVFV IgG, while the association with 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> disappeared. A comparison of the spatial distribution of RVFV IgG and anti-
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> IgG shows that for both viruses, Kyela site has the highest seroprevalences, but a wider occurrence is seen for anti-
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> IgG when compared to RVFV IgG (
