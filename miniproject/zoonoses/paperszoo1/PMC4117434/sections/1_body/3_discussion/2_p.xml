<p>This analysis of the seroprevalence for 
 <italic>Alphaviruses</italic> adds to the picture of arthropod-borne infectious diseases in our study population. Together with previous reports on RVFV, rickettsiae of the typhus group and spotted fever group, we are demonstrating comparably high seroprevalences which could be caused by considerable exposure of the population to arthropod-borne infections other than malaria
