<p>A similar association exists between bednet ownership and anti-
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> IgG. Bednet ownership is not homogenous over the study area, but more frequent in areas of higher malaria transmission, which in our data are characterised by low elevation and even terrain, favouring standing surface water as mosquito breeding grounds. This not only supports 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> but also other mosquito species, so the use of bednets can be seen as a proxy for general abundance of mosquitoes – hence the positive association in uni-variable analysis. When corrected for elevation and slope of terrain, the association with bednets disappeared – showing that in malaria endemic areas, bednet ownership neither favours nor protects against 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> infection. This may point towards a diurnally active vector such as 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp., against which bednets do not protect.
