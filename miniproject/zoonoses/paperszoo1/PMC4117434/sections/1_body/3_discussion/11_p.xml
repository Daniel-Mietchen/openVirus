<p>In summary, our data suggest that CHIKV or a closely related 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> like o′nyong′nyong virus is circulating in the study area. If this virus causes disease, it could be an important cause of febrile illnesses in the region, and may be currently underdiagnosed. The linear relation of seropositivity to age suggests endemic rather than epidemic cycling, opposed to a study from Kenya where seropositivity was linked by the authors to epidemic exposure 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002979-Mease1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Kenya was reportedly affected by past CHIKV outbreaks, while there are no reports of outbreaks from our study area. A study from northern Tanzania reported acute CHIKV infection in 7.9% of febrile hospitalized patients, demonstrating that CHIKV circulates between epidemics in the country and may well be responsible for the seroprevalences in our study
