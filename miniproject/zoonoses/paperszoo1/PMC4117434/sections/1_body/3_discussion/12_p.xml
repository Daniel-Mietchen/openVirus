<p>The power of our statements is further limited by the stratified nature of our study cohort, which results in prevalence levels slightly different from the general population. Further, the serological method used does not allow distinguishing between different 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> species, and only gives information on cumulative lifetime infection risk. Therefore, prospective studies are needed to establish the rate of acute fever caused by CHIKV or other 
 <italic>Alphaviruses</italic> in febrile patients. If the infecting 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> is shown to be CHIKV or another 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> of human medical importance these results should lead to a re-assessment of the local diagnostic algorithm for febrile illnesses, to take into account the endemic presence of the causative 
 <italic>Alphavirus(es)</italic> in the area. These studies would also have to answer the question whether endemic strains do have a reduced pathogenicity, and have evaded detection by not causing the typical symptoms.
