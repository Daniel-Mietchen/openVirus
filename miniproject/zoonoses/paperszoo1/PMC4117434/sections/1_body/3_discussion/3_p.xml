<p>Acute 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> infections such as chikungunya fever are neither known nor regularly diagnosed in the health facilities in the region, and might be overlooked by medical staff as a possible causative agent for febrile illness, leading to presentation at the health facility. Febrile disease in the area is mostly regarded as malaria by treating clinicians, despite the fact that our survey showed a marked reduction of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection since the introduction of artemether - lumefantrine as first line therapy in 2006 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002979-Froeschl1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Therefore, the awareness for zoonoses as a possible underlying cause of febrile illness should be increased.
