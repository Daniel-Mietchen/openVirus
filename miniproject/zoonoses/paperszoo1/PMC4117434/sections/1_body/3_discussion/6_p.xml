<p>Comparisons with our data on spread of other mosquito-borne infections, namely RVF, 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria, and the tick-borne spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae, produce interesting findings. The uni-variable association of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> to anti-
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> IgG disappears when adjusting for age, elevation and slope, suggesting that this association was due to factors supporting the breeding of the different mosquito vectors alike. We did not test to distinguish between anti-CHIKV IgG and o′nyong′nyong virus IgG due to lack of capacities to perform the neutralization test, so it is possible that the seroprevalence is caused by more than one virus.
