<p>In the current study we present high rates of IgG antibodies against an 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>. Cross reactions mainly occur in IFAT between antibodies against CHIKV and other viruses of the Semliki-Forest virus complex of 
 <italic>Alphaviruses</italic>, while cross reactivities against the Venezuelan equine, the Eastern equine and the Western equine encephalitis group are rare and low (≥4 titer steps; Dobler, unpublished observations). Therefore we assume that cross reactions may mainly occur between Semliki Forest complex viruses like O′nyong nyong virus or Semliki Forest virus. Other non-African Semliki-Forest virus complex viruses, like Ross River virus or Mayaro virus do not seem to be responsible for the antibodies as the inhabitants of the areas tested did not leave the region. However, we cannot exclude that a so far unknown 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> of the Semliki Forest virus complex is circulating and may cause infection with or without clinical symptoms. The question can only be answered by virus detection by isolation or molecular detection and characterization of genome parts.
