<p>Climate has been consistently pointed out as one of the major determinants for the distribution of vector borne diseases. Although lower larval rearing temperatures result in increased likelihood of adult female mosquitoes becoming infected with CHIKV or other arboviruses in laboratory experiments

 <xref rid="pntd.0002979-Turell1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, it is higher temperatures which are generally linked to more efficient disease transmission in laboratory and epidemiological investigations 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002979-Turell2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. However, the temperature variables examined here dropped out of the multi-variable model due to lack of multi-variable significance, with the elevation variable obviously producing a better fit than the satellite-measured land surface temperatures. In La Reunion, the spread of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> has been found to be limited to elevations &lt;1200 m in summer 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002979-Delatte1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>; in Gharwal/India, spread was limited to &lt;1.400 m. This corresponds well with the drop in seroprevalence in strata above 1197 m (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0002979-t001">table 1</xref>). We still assume that temperature is the causal limiting factor in higher elevations, not other elevation-dependent factors such as radiation or atmospheric pressure. It should thus be kept in mind that our elevation results should not be generalized to predict infection risk in other climatic settings.
