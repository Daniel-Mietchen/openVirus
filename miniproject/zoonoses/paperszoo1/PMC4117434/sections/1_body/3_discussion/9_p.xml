<p>SFG rickettsiae and 
 <italic>Alphaviruses</italic> are transmitted by completely different vectors (cattle ticks and mosquitoes respectively), therefore the reason for the observed association is not clear. Rural living conditions, defined by low population density and long distances to roads, was a risk factor in our analysis of SFG rickettsia IgG 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002979-Heinrich2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Others authors also found this to be a risk factor for anti-
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> IgG 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002979-Kuniholm1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, so it is possible that rural conditions are the factor which increases the risk for both of these diseases which do not have much else in common.
