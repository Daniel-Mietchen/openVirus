<p>Interesting are the differences in geographical spread of anti-
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> IgG versus RVFV IgG in our population. Anti-
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> IgG is more evenly distributed in the two Kyela sub-sites, and is also common in other sites. RVFV IgG on the other hand concentrates along the shore of Lake Malawi and nearby watercourses. The preferred occurrence of RVFV along water bodies has been demonstrated in other settings as well 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002979-Soti1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, but does not seem to apply to anti-
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> IgG positivity in our setting. This observation may imply that the vectors of RVFV in Kyela region are floodwater mosquito species and therefore need the shore of Lake Malawi, whilst the vectors of the 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> may show an anthropophilic behaviour. The strong affinity to water, which applies for RVFV, but not for the 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>, may also be related to a higher density of cattle as RVFV reservoir hosts along the water, or with the transovarial transmission of RVFV in diapausing 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes along waterbodies 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002979-Pepin1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. It is also possible that RVFV requires a temperature optimum as suggested by our previous work, with a direct correlation with higher minimum temperatures, lower maximum temperatures, and positive influence of dense vegetation, conditions that are fulfilled mainly at the lakeshore 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002979-Heinrich1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The causative 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>, despite probably limited to a smaller number of vector species compared to RVFV, seems to be less specific in terms of ecological conditions and seems to show a more anthropophilic behaviour, leading to a wider spread of the virus throughout the study area.
