<p>Despite this increased research interest, the role of CHIKV as well as other 
 <italic>Alphaviruses</italic> in endemic regions, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, remains unclear. Recent studies concentrated mainly on areas of the latest CHIKV pandemic. The disease burden and the epidemiology in local populations not affected by the devastating outbreak in 2004â€“2007 is largely unknown. In a small study in Guinea, arboviruses as causative agent for febrile disease were identified by neutralization assays in 63% of 47 patients 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002979-Jentes1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. 17% of these had acute CHIKV infections. In a clinical study conducted in Northern Tanzania with 870 febrile patients, PCR-confirmed acute CHIKV infections were diagnosed in 7.9% of all cases 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002979-Hertz1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, surveillance of other 
 <italic>Alphaviruses</italic> is even less developed as most of these studies are targeting CHIKV using PCR. A serosurvey in rural Kenya revealed a seropositivity prevalence of 34% for anti-
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> IgG, which was not associated with age, indicating frequently occurring smaller epidemics rather than endemic cycling 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002979-Mease1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Although CHIKV is expected as the main pathogen, other 
 <italic>Alphaviruses</italic> cannot be excluded since a broadly cross-reactive ELISA was used.
