<p>Since the 1960s, especially CHIKV was repeatedly isolated throughout African and Asian countries 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002979-Powers1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, and small outbreaks were frequently reported. The virus gained notoriety, when in the years 2004–2007 an outbreak was noticed of so far unknown dimension. Starting in Kenya, a severe epidemic hit the islands of the Indian Ocean in 2005/2006, with nearly 280.000 people infected on the island of La Reunion alone
