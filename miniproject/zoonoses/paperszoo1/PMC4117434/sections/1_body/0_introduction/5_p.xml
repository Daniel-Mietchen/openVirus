<p>In this study we aimed to assess the epidemiological patterns of 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> infections in the Mbeya Region in Tanzania, by measuring seroprevalence in 1215 individuals participating in an epidemiological survey in the Region. This region was not affected by the 2004â€“2007 outbreak, and diagnosis or laboratory verification of acute chikungunya fever or other 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> infection does not occur locally. The survey gave us the opportunity to study the role of this pathogen genus and its dependence on certain social and ecological factors in an endemic transmission cycle in a typical local setting.
