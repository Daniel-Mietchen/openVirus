<p>To characterize the socio-economic situation of each household, the head of each household was asked for the following information during each annual EMINI visit: Presence/absence of different items in the household (clock or watch, radio, television, mobile telephone, refrigerator, hand cart, bicycle, motor cycle, car, savings account), sources of energy and drinking water, materials used to build the main house, number of persons per room in the household and availability and type of latrine used.
