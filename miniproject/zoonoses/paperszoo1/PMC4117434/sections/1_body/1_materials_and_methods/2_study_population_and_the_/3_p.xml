<p>For this sub-study, we stratified the 17,872 participants, who had provided a blood sample during the second EMINI survey in 2007/2008, by age, gender, altitude of residence and ownership of domestic mammals. To be able to assess factors of interest that were identified in the literature but might have been underrepresented in the study population, we employed disproportionate random sampling with equal participant numbers for each stratum to identify 1.226 samples from participants above the age of 5 years to be tested for IgG antibodies against
