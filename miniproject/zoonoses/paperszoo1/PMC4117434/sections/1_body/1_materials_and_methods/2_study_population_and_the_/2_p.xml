<p>In preparation of the EMINI survey, a census of the entire population in nine geographically distinct and ecologically different sites of the Mbeya Region was carried out. Study sites were selected to reflect the wide range of different conditions within the region in terms of elevation, population density and development (urban versus rural). Basic information regarding the households and their inhabitants was collected and all household positions were recorded with handheld GPS receivers. Ten percent of the surveyed households were then chosen by geographically stratified random selection for inclusion into the EMINI survey, to obtain a representative sample of the population from each site. The resulting EMINI cohort included all consenting participants of 4,283 households. Over the following five years annual visits at the same time of the year were conducted, during which structured interviews with all household members were performed, and blood, urine and stool specimens collected.</p>
