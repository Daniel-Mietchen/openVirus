<p>The EMINI population survey had the objective to create the infrastructure to 
 <bold>E</bold>valuate and 
 <bold>M</bold>onitor the 
 <bold>I</bold>mpact of 
 <bold>N</bold>ew 
 <bold>I</bold>nterventions in the Mbeya Region of south-western Tanzania. Financed by the European Union over five years (2006 to 2011), the strengthening of the local health infrastructure and the establishment of a cohort which could be followed up on an annual basis created a platform on which the impact of improved health care infrastructure and new interventions could be monitored and evaluated. Embedded into the EMINI project were several focused studies such as this sub-study, which determined seroprevalences for a number of tropical arthropod-borne diseases.
