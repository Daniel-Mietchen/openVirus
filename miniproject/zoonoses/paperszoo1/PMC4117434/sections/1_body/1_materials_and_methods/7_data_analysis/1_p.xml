<p>Stata statistics software (version 12, Statacorp, College Station, TX, USA) was used for all statistical analyses, and Manifold System 8.0 Professional Edition (Manifold Net Ltd, Carson City, NV) was used for processing of geographical data and to produce maps. In order to identify possible risk factors for anti-

Initial uni-variable models for all factors that we deemed as possibly related to CHIKV infection were used to identify variables with a uni-variable p-value &lt; = 0.1 for further multi-variable evaluation. Stepwise backward and forward regression, the Akaike and Bayes information criterion and various assessments of model-fit were used to identify the best multi-variable model, where only variables with a multi-variable p-value &lt;0.1 were retained.
