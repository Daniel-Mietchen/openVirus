<p>Detection of anti-
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> IgG, anti-Yellow fever virus IgG, anti-dengue 1–4 virus IgG, and anti-West Nile virus IgG on bio-banked samples were performed as described previously for Rift Valley fever virus (RVfV) IgG 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002979-Heinrich1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. A commercially available biochip (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany), containing infected and non-infected Vero E6 cells or only non-infected Vero E6 cells (negative control), was used for indirect immunfluorescence testing (IIFT), following a standard protocol. All serum samples were heat-inactivated and diluted tenfold prior to testing. Further dilutions of positive sera were carried out in the range of 1∶20 to 1∶640. A rabbit anti-human IgG FITC-labelled antibody (DAKO, Hamburg, Germany) served as conjugate. To decrease the known subjectivity of reading IIFT results to the best objective level, fluorescence microscopy was carried out independently by two experienced observers. In case of discrepancies (positive vs. negative; difference &gt;1 titer step) the testing was repeated. A sample was classified as positive, if at a screening dilution of 1∶20 a typical fine granular cytoplasmatic fluorescence was detected in around 20% of the cells on the positive field of the biochip with a typical location and morphology of infected cells, while no signal was detectable in the negative field. IIFT was repeated in case of indeterminate results, i.e. in cases where samples differed clearly from the negative control but did not match the criterion “positive”. Ultimately, 1,215 definitive results were available from the selected samples.
