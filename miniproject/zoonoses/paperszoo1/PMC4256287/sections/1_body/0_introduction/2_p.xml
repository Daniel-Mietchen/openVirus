<p>In November 2012, an outbreak of human psittacosis affecting six staff members occurred at the New Territories North Animal Management Centre (NTNAMC) in Hong Kong 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003318-Centre1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The human outbreak was preceded by an outbreak of avian chlamydiosis among the detained Mealy Parrots (
 <italic>Amazona farinose</italic>). Although birds in the tropical and sub-tropical areas are commonly infected with 
 <italic>C. psittaci</italic>, most infected birds are asymptomatic

 <italic>C. psittaci</italic> and viruses has been reported in outbreaks of avian species

 <xref rid="pntd.0003318-Loock1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, no virus-bacterium co-infection of implicated avian species has ever been reported in outbreaks of human psittacosis. In this study, we sought to investigate viruses that cause avian co-infection, which may have led to this outbreak of psittacosis.
