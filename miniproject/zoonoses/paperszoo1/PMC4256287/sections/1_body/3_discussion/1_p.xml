<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a co-infection of psittacine birds with avian adenovirus and 
 <italic>C. psittaci</italic> associated with an outbreak of human psittacosis. In this study, we have identified a novel adenovirus that was most closely related to Duck adenovirus A of the 
 <italic>Atadenovirus</italic> genus in the epidemiologically linked Mealy Parrots. In contrast, this novel adenovirus was not identified in any of the healthy parrots and other detained animals without 
 <italic>C. psittaci</italic> infection. Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 antigen was detected in lung and liver tissue cells using immunostaining, which indicated active viral replication instead of latent infection. A positive correlation between adenovirus viral loads with 
 <italic>C. psittaci</italic> bacterial loads was observed in lung specimens, which suggested a possible synergistic interaction between adenovirus and 
 <italic>C. psittaci</italic> in disease pathogenesis.
