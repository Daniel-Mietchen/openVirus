<p>Besides the genomic G+C content, there are several unusual genomic features in the Psittacine adenovirus HKU1. Firstly, a second viral protein, fiber-2, is present in our novel adenovirus, but not in any other 
 <italic>Atadenovirus</italic>. The fiber-2 protein has also been found in the 
 <italic>Aviadenovirus</italic>, like the fowl adenovirus. Since fiber proteins are responsible for binding to cellular receptor, it has been postulated that the presence of different fiber proteins may determine the tropism of the adenovirus 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003318-Roelvink1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. It remains to be determined whether the fiber-2 protein is important for the virus to infect psittacine hosts. Another interesting feature is the predicted CCU start codon of the IVa2 protein. The annotation is made on the basis of sequence conservation among other adenoviral IVa2 proteins, and the lack of an in-frame ATG in its vicinity. The function of the non-canonical CCU start codon may be augmented by the presence of an upstream Kozak sequence 
 <named-content content-type="gene">ACCACC</named-content>. The use of CCU as the start codon is rare in other organisms, but has been reported in psittacine viruses. The other notable genomic feature in the Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 is the intron between the two exons of 33K, which usually overlaps with coding sequences in other adenoviruses, but not in the present case.
