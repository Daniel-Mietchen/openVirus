<p>In birds, many adenoviral infections are subclinical, but some infections can lead to severe disease

 <xref rid="pntd.0003318-McFerran1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Previous studies have suggested that avian adenoviruses may cause immunosuppression in birds. 
 <italic>Aviadenovirus</italic> can lead to immunosuppressive disease, such as the hydropericardium syndrome. Fowl adenovirus and chicken anemia virus co-infection causes much more severe disease than either virus alone 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003318-Toro1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Avian adenoviruses have been shown to directly infect lymphocytes and dendritic cells in the spleen 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003318-GomezVillamandos1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and causes depletion of lymphocytes 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003318-Schonewille1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003318-Saifuddin1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Fowl adenovirus 1 has been shown to affect antibody response of chicks to 
 <italic>Brucella abortus</italic>
 <xref rid="pntd.0003318-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. We speculate that our novel adenovirus may have caused immunosuppression among the infected parrots, and therefore a larger number of Mealy Parrots were infected by 
 <italic>C. psittaci</italic> with a higher bacterial load, leading to a higher chance of zoonotic transmission to humans. Other studies have also proposed that reovirus and avian pneumovirus infection may cause immunosuppression leading to avian chlamydiosis 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003318-Perpinan1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003318-Loock1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Experimental infection showed that avian pneumovirus could exacerbate acute 
 <italic>C. psittaci</italic> infection in turkeys 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003318-Loock1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Alternatively, in a report demonstrating adenovirus-
 <italic>C. psittaci</italic> co-infection in a parakeet using electron microscopy and antigen detection without molecular confirmation, Desmidt M 
 <italic>et al</italic> proposed that 
 <italic>C. psittaci</italic> could cause immunosuppression, which can lead to reactivation of latent adenovirus infection 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003318-Desmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, no further studies have been performed to verify this hypothesis.
