<p>Current ICTV guidance on adenovirus taxonomy specifies species designation by phylogenetic distance, host range, DNA hybridization, nucleotide composition, cross-neutralization and gene organization at the right end of the viral genome 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003318-International1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. With the exception of nucleotide composition and cross-neutralization, for which no data are available, our data and analysis of the Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 are consistent with it being a novel member of the genus 
 <italic>Atadenovirus</italic>. Notably, the genome of the Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 has a higher G+C content than other 
 <italic>Atadenovirus</italic> genomes, which might be viewed as a feature against its designation as a novel 
 <italic>Atadenovirus</italic>. Indeed, the high A+T content of the first few identified 
 <italic>Atadenoviruses</italic> was considered characteristic among adenoviruses and was the basis for naming the genus. Nonetheless, the snake adenovirus 1, a member of the 
 <italic>Atadenovirus</italic>, has a genomic G+C content of 50.2%, which is lower than but comparable to the G+C content of 53.5% for the Psittacine adenovirus HKU1. Hence, we consider that the high genomic G+C content of the present Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 is not a major contraindication to its inclusion in the genus 
 <italic>Atadenovirus</italic>.
