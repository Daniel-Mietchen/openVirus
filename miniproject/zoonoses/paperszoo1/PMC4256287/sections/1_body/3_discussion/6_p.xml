 <xref rid="pntd.0003318-Perpinan1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Infectious bursal disease virus and chicken anaemia virus can cause immunosuppression, leading to secondary bacterial infection such as bacterial chondronecrosis with osteomyelitis 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003318-McNamee1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. However, it is unclear whether co-infection in birds can increase the risk of transmission of avian pathogens to humans. Our investigation suggested that the novel Psittacine adenovirus may have been associated with immunosuppression among infected birds, leading to higher 
 <italic>C. psittaci</italic> bacterial loads in the lungs of psittacine birds, and hence increasing the risk of infection in exposed humans.
