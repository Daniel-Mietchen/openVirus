<p>Adenovirus viral load testing was performed on tissue and cloacal swab specimens from the infected birds. The 
 <italic>C. psittaci</italic> bacterial load was positively correlated with adenovirus viral load in the lung (r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.4053; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0897) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003318-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining targeting the Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 fiber protein was performed for bird 2 and bird 3. Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 antigen was detected in the lung and liver tissue cells of bird 2 but not bird 3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003318-g001">Fig. 1D–1I</xref>). Viral culture was negative for seven cloacal swabs, three lung samples, two liver samples and two kidney samples, which were positive for adenovirus PCR.
