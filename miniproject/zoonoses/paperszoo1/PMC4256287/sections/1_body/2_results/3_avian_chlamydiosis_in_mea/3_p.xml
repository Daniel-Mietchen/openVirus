<p>Eight other parrots detained during the outbreak were retrieved for microbiological testing (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003318-t003">Table 3</xref>), in which seven were euthanized because they developed disease and one died. Seven out of eight parrots (87.5%) were positive for 
 <italic>C. psittaci</italic>. All eight parrots were positive for adenovirus by one-step consensus PCR but not the nested PCR. All other viruses were negative by consensus PCR screening. Blood samples were not available from infected parrots for testing. Forty-one additional specimens from 18 healthy parrots unrelated to the outbreak were negative for 
 <italic>C. psittaci</italic> or adenovirus (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003318-t003">Table 3</xref>). Among parrots, there was a significant association between the presence of adenovirus and 
 <italic>C. psittaci</italic> (
 <italic>C. psittaci</italic> was present in 7/8 adenovirus-positive parrots vs. 0/18 adenovirus-negative parrots, 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001 by Fisher exact test). Moreover, fecal samples taken from 25 other detained mammals, reptiles and avians in NTNAMC during the outbreak were negative for both adenovirus and 
 <italic>C. psittaci</italic>.
