<p>The patient was a 55-year-old male artisan working at the NTNAMC. He presented after four days of dyspnea and two days of hemoptysis. Chest radiograph showed bilateral patchy consolidation. Blood test showed neutrophilia and elevated liver enzymes with alanine transaminase of 51 U/L. He was put on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation for respiratory failure. Bronchoalveolar lavage tested positive for 
 <italic>C. psittaci</italic> and rhinovirus by PCR and reverse transcriptase-PCR respectively. Direct fluorescent antigen detection and viral culture did not reveal other viral co-pathogens. Paired serology, collected 18 days apart (on days 2 and 20 after hospitalization), showed a rise of 
 <italic>C. psittaci</italic> IgG titer from &lt;32 to 128 by microimmunofluorescence assay, but there was no increase in adenovirus or other respiratory virus antibody titer. The patient recovered with oral doxycycline. He had contact with birds, monkeys, iguanas and snakes at the NTNAMC within one month of symptom onset.
