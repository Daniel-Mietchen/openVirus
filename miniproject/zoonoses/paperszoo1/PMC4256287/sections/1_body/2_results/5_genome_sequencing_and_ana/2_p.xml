<p>Pairwise amino acid sequence comparison of the major conserved adenoviral genes of this novel adenovirus showed that they were most similar to 
 <italic>Atadenovirus</italic>, with pairwise amino acid identities of 50.3–54.0% for the DNA polymerase, 64.6–70.7% for the penton protein, and 66.1–74.0% for the hexon protein (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003318-t005">Table 5</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis of the hexon, penton and DNA polymerase amino acid sequences consistently showed clustering of the novel adenovirus with viruses in the genus 
 <italic>Atadenovirus</italic>, most closely related to sequences from Duck adenovirus A (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003318-g005">Fig. 5A–5C</xref>). The fiber-2 protein amino acid sequence of the novel adenovirus was most closely related to that of Fowl adenovirus C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003318-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). 
 <italic>In silico</italic> DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) using GGDC 2.0 was also performed to estimate genomic DNA similarity between the novel adenovirus and other adenoviruses. However, the estimated DDH values were at the lower limit of analysis (12.5% for formula 1, and 0% for formulae 2 and 3), which suggested that the genomic DNA sequences are too dissimilar for DDH analysis.
