<p>Whole viral genome sequencing was performed on three samples positive for adenovirus. Nucleotide sequences of the adenovirus genomes in the three samples were fully identical. The full-length genomic sequence is 31,735 bp in length, with a G+C content of 53.5%. Inverted terminal repeat (ITR) regions of 44 bp at both ends of the genome are complementary to each other. The viral genome contains 23 ORFs with sequence similarity to known adenoviral genes (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003318-t004">Table 4</xref>). Additionally, six ORFs, ranging from 381 to 741 bp were identified at the 3â€² end of the genome. While lacking significant sequence similarity to known adenoviral sequences, they were predicted to have coding potential by fgenesV0. The genome organization of this novel virus most closely resembles that of 
 <italic>Atadenovirus</italic>, with minor variations. Similar to Duck adenovirus A, the novel adenovirus lacks LH1, LH2 and LH3, which distinguishes it from the bovine adenovirus E, bovine adenovirus D and ovine adenovirus D. Similar to other 
 <italic>Atadenovirus</italic>, the novel virus possesses a DNA polymerase, terminal protein and DNA-binding protein for DNA replication; the E1B small T-antigen, IVa2 and 52K proteins for DNA encapsidation; and the IIIa, penton protein/III, core protein 1/pVII, core protein 2/pX, pVI protein, hexon protein, endopeptidase/protease, 100K, pVIII protein and fiber protein for the formation and structure of the virion 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003318-Davison1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The novel adenovirus has two fiber proteins. Notably, the fiber-2 protein (or short fiber) is not found in any 
 <italic>Atadenovirus</italic>, but can be found in 
 <italic>Aviadenovirus</italic>. As in other adenoviruses, a putative splicing site was identified in the pTP gene. Recombination analysis by bootscanning showed possible phylogenetic incongruence in small regions of the viral genome (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003318-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), but further examination by phylogenetic analysis of the corresponding regions did not reveal convincing evidence of recombination.
