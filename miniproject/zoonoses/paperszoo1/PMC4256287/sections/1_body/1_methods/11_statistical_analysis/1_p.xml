<p>Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0. Correlation of 
 <italic>C. psittaci</italic> bacterial load and adenovirus viral load was determined using linear regression analysis. For statistical calculation, 50% of the lower detection limit (6,000 copies/ml for 
 <italic>C. psittaci</italic> and 600 copies/ml for adenovirus) was assigned to specimens that tested negative. Log-transformed viral loads were used for statistical analysis.
