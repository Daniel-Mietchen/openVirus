<p>Tissue and cloacal swab samples of the Mealy Parrots were screened by consensus primers for common respiratory viral agents including influenza virus, coronavirus, infectious bursal disease virus, beak and feather disease virus, hepatitis E virus and the virus families

 <xref rid="pntd.0003318-To2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. For adenovirus, we used a nested PCR as reported previously 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003318-Wellehan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and a single-step consensus PCR using primers designed by performing multiple alignments of pol genes of adenovirus and related sequences available in NCBI GenBank (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003318-t001">Table 1</xref>). The PCR products were gel purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Both strands of the PCR products were sequenced twice with an ABI Prism 3130
 <italic>xl</italic> DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California), using the PCR primers. The sequences of the PCR products were compared with known sequences by BLAST analysis against the NCBI database. For quantification of Psittacine adenovirus HKU1, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) with specific primers was performed using LightCycler 96 system (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003318-t001">Table 1</xref>). Standards were included for quantification and no false-positive results were observed in the negative controls. The lower limit of detection was 10 copies per reaction (1200 copies/ml of viral transport medium).
