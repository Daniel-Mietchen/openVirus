  <title>Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree showing the relationship of Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 to other adenoviruses inferred from A) hexon protein, B) penton protein and C) polymerase protein, D) fiber-2 protein.</title>
  <p>The trees were constructed using PHYML version 3 under the best-fit protein evolution model as selected by ProtTest 3. The bootstrap values were calculated from 1,000 trees. (AdV, adenovirus; BAdV, bovine adenovirus; BtAdV, bat adenovirus; CAdV, canine adenovirus; DAdV, duck adenovirus; FAdV, fowl adenovirus; FrAdV, frog adenovirus; GoAdV, goose adenovirus; MAdV, murine adenovirus; OAdV, ovine adenovirus; PAdV; porcine adenovirus; PiAdV, pigeon adenovirus; RAdV, raptor adenovirus; SAdV, simian adenovirus; SnAdV, snake adenovirus; SPSAdV; south polar skua adenovirus; TAdV; turkey adenovirus).</p>
