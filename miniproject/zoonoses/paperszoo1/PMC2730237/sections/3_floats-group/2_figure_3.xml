  <p>The winter-spring precipitation totals estimated for each year in Durango, 1540–1548 (top), 1571–1579 (middle). Compared with the Palmer drought index, southwestern USA 1988–1995 (bottom). A tenfold increase in deer mice was witnessed in the southwestern USA during the 1993 outbreak, a year of abundant precipitation following a prolonged drought. The similar dry-wet pattern reconstructed for the 1545 epidemic of cocoliztli may have impacted the population dynamics of the suspected rodent host to aggravate the epidemic.</p>
