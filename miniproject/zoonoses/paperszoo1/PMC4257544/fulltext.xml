We developed a novel, simple and effective compartmental modeling framework for transmissions among (wild and domestic) birds as well as from birds to human, to infer important epidemiological quantifiers, such as basic reproduction number for bird epidemic, bird-to-human infection rate and turning points of the epidemics, for the epidemic via human H7N9 case onset data and to acquire useful information regarding the bird-to-human transmission dynamics. Estimated basic reproduction number for infections among birds is 4.10 and the mean daily number of human infections per infected bird is 3.16*10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> [3.08*10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>, 3.23*10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>]. The turning point of 2013 H7N9 epidemic is pinpointed at April 16 for bird infections and at April 9 for bird-to-human transmissions. Our result reveals very low level of bird-to-human infections, thus indicating minimal risk of widespread bird-to-human infections of H7N9 virus during the outbreak. Moreover, the turning point of the human epidemic, pinpointed at shortly after the implementation of full-scale control and intervention measures initiated in early April, further highlights the impact of timely actions on ending the outbreak. This is the first study where both the bird and human components of an avian influenza epidemic can be quantified using only the human case data.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding support came from the National Science Council, Taiwan (YHH), the Natural Science Foundation of China (JF and JL), the International Development Research Centre (JW), the Canada Research Chair Program (JW), and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (JW).

H7N9 infection in humans could cause severe illness with high mortality. Since October of 2013, sporadic cases continued to be reported in China and Hong Kong, SAR. Fortunately, there has been no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission so far <xref rid="pone.0111834-Uyeki1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, with only one report of probable person-to-person transmission <xref rid="pone.0111834-Qi1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>A major obstacle in the ascertainment of an avian influenza epidemic is that the evidence we observe, i.e., the human cases, is only the final outcome of the bird-human transmission process. That is, when human avian influenza cases such as the 1997 H5N1 and the 2013 H7N9 outbreaks occur, we know that there had been at the same time an epidemic among birds, but we generally are not able to observe it, especially in instances of avian influenza, where asymptomatic or mild avian diseases in wild birds and even domestic poultry occur routinely but are not closely monitored, or perhaps not even observable as in the case of wild birds. We only know it when it becomes human-transmissible. Therefore, the profound challenge is to attempt to infer information regarding the epidemic within the bird population from our observations of human infections and, subsequently, to obtain useful knowledge on the process of bird-to-human transmission.</p><p>In this work we propose a bird-human epidemic model with two parts to describe the dynamical relationship between the epidemic in bird population and the subsequent bird-to-human infections. The first part of the model is a modified SIR compartmental model adopted to describe the transmission among birds; the second is a simple single-equation model for the increase in the cumulative number of infected humans due to infection transmitted by infected birds. Our modeling approach allows us to infer important information regarding the bird epidemic via the model parameters for the bird population that are epidemiologically important. With these results, we can then acquire useful knowledge regarding the dynamics of bird-to-human transmissions. There have been numerous previous modeling studies on avian influenza epidemic of humans (e.g., <xref rid="pone.0111834-Ferguson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0111834-Chowell1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>), or on the bird epidemic only <xref rid="pone.0111834-LeMenach1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0111834-Tiensin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Some theoretical studies also consider both the bird and human epidemics but mainly focusing on human infections <xref rid="pone.0111834-Iwami1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0111834-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Some recent studies on 2013 H7N9 have included both birds and human infections in their models, but with the purpose to quantify the human transmission parameters only (e.g., <xref rid="pone.0111834-Nishiura1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0111834-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>). In our work, we are able to estimate the basic reproduction number for infections among birds and the mean number of human infections per infected bird per day. To our best knowledge, this is the first study where a bird-human avian influenza epidemic can be ascertained through the modeling of both the bird and human parts of the epidemic and, more importantly, quantified through the use of human case data only.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Data</title><p>We make use of the human H7N9 case data by onset date from February 19 to May 30, 2013 and made public by the World Health Organization (WHO) <xref rid="pone.0111834-World1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, to estimate the model parameter values, including the basic reproduction number <xref rid="pone.0111834-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> of the bird epidemic and final bird outbreak size. Note that 10 of the 132 confirmed cases during this time period did not have a date of onset; therefore the data we fitted contains 122 cases.</p><sec id="s2a1"><title>Transmission dynamics among birds</title><p>We stratify the total number (<italic>N</italic>(t)) of birds, &#x0201c;actually&#x0201d; vulnerable for the disease transmission at time <italic>t</italic>, into two classes: actually susceptible (<italic>S</italic>(t)) and infected (<italic>I</italic>(t)). Here we introduce the class of &#x0201c;actually at risk&#x0201d; susceptibles for birds that will be exposed to the virus during the entire epidemic under consideration (at &#x0201c;actual&#x0201d; risk for infection), which is consistent with the underlying idea of the Richards model <xref rid="pone.0111834-Richards1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> which we utilize in our modeling construction (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Mathematical Details</xref> section), where by definition only (eventually) infected population is considered. The introduction of this novel modeling construction is also critical for the purpose of its application to avian influenza modeling, since it is quite conceivable that a large number of birds (especially wild ones) were not exposed to the virus, but we do not have any information regarding its size. This definition of S(t) is different from the &#x0201c;susceptible&#x0201d; birds defined in the classical SIR model where (majority) susceptible birds may not be actually exposed to the virus. Therefore, the initial size of this actually at risk susceptible class is unknown and it is one of the parameters to be estimated. In what follows, we will use total bird population &#x0201c;actually at risk&#x0201d; at time t for N(t) and &#x0201c;actually&#x0201d; susceptibles at time t for S(t), but simply infected birds I(t) for sake of brevity. Detailed model description is given in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Mathematical Details</xref> section.</p><p>Assuming that the birth and natural death of birds are balanced during the disease outbreak period (that is, the bird population remains at a constant level if there is no disease), we have the Kermack-McKendrick model (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Mathematical Details</xref> section) to describe disease transmission in birds, with the density-dependent transmission rate (<italic>&#x003b2;/N</italic>), and the removal rate (<italic>&#x003b4;</italic>). An important feature of our proposed model is that the &#x0201c;actually at risk&#x0201d; total bird population <italic>N</italic>(t) (again, we emphasize this is the total bird population to be involved in the disease transmission during the entire epidemic under consideration) can be determined, via a close form (analytic expression), from the initial numbers of the compartment sizes (<italic>S</italic>(0)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;<italic>S</italic>

<sub>0</sub>) at the beginning of the bird infection outbreak and from the aforementioned parameters (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Mathematical Details</xref> section for details). Hence &#x0201c;removal&#x0201d; in our model refers to all removal from the actually infected bird population, including disease-induced death, recovery (although infected birds often exhibits only mild or no symptoms), or culling after April 5.</p><p>Since disease transmission is assumed to depend on the actually at risk total bird population size which varies in time, we define the time-varying reproduction number, or "running basic reproduction number" <xref rid="pone.0111834-Brauer1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> for birds, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0111834.e001.jpg"/></inline-formula> by<disp-formula id="pone.0111834.e002"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0111834.e002.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>which gives the number of secondary infections caused by a single infected bird in the population at time <italic>t</italic>.

Moreover, there is no evidence indicating that either human-to-human or human-to-bird infection had occurred. Thus, the cumulative number of human H7N9 cases by infected birds, <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic>, can be simply modeled (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Mathematical Details</xref> section) so the increase rate of the infected human individuals is proportional to the number of the infected birds, with the proportionality constant (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0111834.e006.jpg"/></inline-formula>)-the daily human infection rate per infected bird.

Furthermore, a modeling study on 2013 H7N9 <xref rid="pone.0111834-Nishiura1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> proposes that the mean generation time of the bird-human transmission to be 2&#x02013;4 days. Therefore, our result of turning point for reporting of human cases on April 9 indicates that the turning point for actual human infections had occurred 2&#x02013;4 days before April 9 but most likely after April 5.</p><p>It is interesting to note that on April 5, the Chinese Ministry of Health (MOH) announced full-scale measures to prevent spread of the novel virus infections <xref rid="pone.0111834-National1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In particular, the live poultry market in the affected areas was closed temporarily with culling of geese, chickens, ducks and pigeons, and spraying of disinfectant in the surrounding areas <xref rid="pone.0111834-Xinhua1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. A total of 20,536 chickens, ducks, geese and pigeons from Huhuai Agricultural Products Wholesale Market in Shanghai alone were reported to have been slaughtered by April 5 after the H7N9 bird flu virus was detected from samples of pigeons in the market <xref rid="pone.0111834-Xinhua2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The swift responses after the identification of the novel virus on March 29 and the subsequent full-scale control measures after April 5 seemed to have a direct and almost immediate impact on human infections, in the following days, leading to a decrease in clinical cases around April 9. This may be attributable to swift human response and behavior change by the populace in reaction to government implementation of interventions measures. In comparison, the turning point for bird infections occurred one week later, on April 16. Since one could propose that much of the bird infections occurred among wild birds, it is reasonable to propose that culling of <italic>domestic birds</italic> and closing of live poultry farm did not have an immediate impact on infections among wild birds, but perhaps contributed to its turning point one week later.

<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0111834.e010.jpg"/></inline-formula>, the basic reproducing number for H7N9 epidemic <italic>in bird population</italic> or the secondary number of infections in birds by one new infected bird entering in a previously disease-free bird population, is found to be 4.10, showing considerable potential of the disease to spread among birds. In contrast, the exceedingly low bird-to-human daily infection rate <italic>&#x003b2;<sub>H</sub></italic> of 0.0000316 seems to indicate that, even when an epidemic did occur in the bird population, the risk for human infection, whether directly from bird to human or indirectly through environmental contamination, is extremely low, assuming that there were no human-to-human transmission. Note that in this work we had assumed that there is neither human-to-human nor human-to-bird infection during the outbreak, since there is no evidence indicating such occurrences. If there had indeed been any human-to-human transmission of H7N9 virus occurring among the reported cases, as some studies had assumed <xref rid="pone.0111834-Chowell1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111834-Nishiura1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, inferred <xref rid="pone.0111834-Kucharski1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, or proposed <xref rid="pone.0111834-Qi1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111834-Xiao1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <italic>&#x003b2;<sub>H</sub></italic> would have been even lower to account for less bird-to-human infections. Moreover, for modeling consideration, if there had been human-to-human infections, then <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0111834.e044">Equation (17</xref>) would need to be modified to account for human infections, perhaps with an added human susceptible class. This would lead to a far more complicated model with more parameters to estimate, e.g., human-to-human infection rate, and hence shall be left for future research.</p><p>We also note that culling measure implemented after April 5 was really a pre-emptive measure to remove the infective birds, and the susceptible birds from future exposure to infection. Therefore, this effect is indeed modeled in our setting since <italic>S(0)</italic> (or <italic>S<sub>0</sub></italic>), the initial "at risk" population size, would be much bigger without this culling. It is important to note that <italic>S(0)</italic> is the initial population size of the birds which would be exposed to infection during the entire course of the epidemic, including the phase when culling was implemented.</p><p>In the affected Zhejiang-Jiangsu-Shanghai region, where there are over 170 million inhabitants and perhaps similarly large number of wild and domestic birds (if not significantly more if we also include migratory birds), 0.07% of the bird samples were found to be H7N9-positive by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture <xref rid="pone.0111834-Ministry1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Hence our estimate of total at-risk bird population that were eventually infected, N<sub>0</sub>, of 764 477 is quite reasonable. However, only 132 cases (less than 1 in one million) were diagnosed during that time. This indicates a wide-spread bird epidemic but significantly smaller human epidemic. This is consistent with our conclusion.</p><p>The main difficulty in ascertaining avian influenza outbreak in humans, especially one where majority of the cases were caused by bird-to-human infections, comes from the fact that very little is known of the bird epidemic; e.g., the bird population size, the number of infected birds, types of birds that are being infected, and the composition of the birds (domestic/poultry birds, local wild birds, migratory birds, etc.) Consequently, the key contribution and novelty of our work is that we are able to extract important information regarding the epidemiology (including bird-to-bird basic reproduction number and bird-to-human infection rate) of avian influenza epidemic among birds via our modeling using only human case data, which is important to our understanding and efforts for prevention of avian influenza outbreaks that includes mitigation of bird epidemic.</p><p>Our estimates of the basic reproduction number for the bird outbreak and the bird-to-human daily infection rate suggest that, even with the wide-spread H7N9 infections in bird population, the threat to human population is currently not particularly severe and can be effectively averted through swift and efficient control measures. Although the resulting high mortality of the infected persons requires our most diligent efforts to prevent as much as possible the occurrence of loss in lives, and perhaps more importantly, to continue monitoring any sign of future emergence and escalation in H7N9 human cases in case a human-to-human transmissible mutation occurs in the virus, especially as more cases of human H7N9 cases have been reported since the fall of 2013, in the Zhejiang-Jiangsu-Shanghai region and many other provinces along the southeast coast of China <xref rid="pone.0111834-World2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>A limitation of our study is the fact that ten of the human cases during the time interval under study have no date of onset and therefore were deleted from the fitted data, which might lead to some estimation error. However, the number of cases deleted is less than 10% of the dataset and hence is not likely cause a major discrepancy in the qualitative results. As a final note, our model does not incorporate control measures explicitly, which requires a far more complicated model, and much more detailed data typically difficult to gather. However, we suggest that the timing of the turning points obtained through our modeling might reflect the impact of the control measures implemented. For this H7N9 epidemic with specific routes of transmission and limited infections, a network model might be a useful tool for inferring the impact of culling as well as the closing of poultry market <xref rid="pone.0111834-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, for such an endeavor substantially more detailed data are critically needed to carry out such a modeling study, namely, complete information on the social networking of the infected individuals and, for avian influenza outbreak, their exposure-related activities (with poultry, domestic and wild birds, and environment) that potentially might have led to their infections, which unfortunately are not readily available.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Mathematical Details</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Kermack-McKendrick model with actually at risk (for infection) bird population</title><p>We adopt the classical Kermack-McKendrick SIR model to describe disease transmission in birds:<disp-formula id="pone.0111834.e011"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0111834.e011.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>where the prime means derivative with respect to time <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0111834.e012.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <italic>&#x003b2;/N</italic> is the density-dependent transmission rate, and <italic>&#x003b4;</italic> is the removal rate (including disease-induced death and culling) Recall that S is the size of the &#x0201c;actually&#x0201d; susceptible bird population.</p><p>According to <xref rid="pone.0111834-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, we may see that the initial value problem of system (3) can be decoupled.
