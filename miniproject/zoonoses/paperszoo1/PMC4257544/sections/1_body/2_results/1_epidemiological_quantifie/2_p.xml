 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Mathematical Details</xref> section. From the model fit for the bird-human epidemic model, we can also make use of the resulting parameter estimates to compute other epidemiologically meaningful parameter values. The turning point for the bird infections was 55.96 days (or the 56th day) after February 19, or April 16 (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111834-t001">Table 1</xref>).
