<p>We first fit the human H7N9 case data to the cumulative human cases using the Richards model growth function (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0111834.e007">Equation (2</xref>)) to obtain model estimates for the turning point 
 <italic>t
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic> and the case number K
 <sub>H</sub> of the Richards model growth function (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111834-g002">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111834-t001">Table 1</xref>). The turning point for the human case reporting, at 48.94 days (95% CI: [48.51, 49.37]) or the 49
 <sup>th</sup> day after the start of outbreak on February 19, is pinpointed at April 9; while the estimate for the outbreak case number K
 <sub>H</sub> is 120.4 [119.6, 121.2], exactly the same as the WHO data if rounded off to the next integer.
