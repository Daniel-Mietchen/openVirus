<p>We observe that the infections among birds began to turn for the better on the same day (April 9) as a similar downward turn occurring in the reporting of human cases. The estimated median incubation period in 23 confirmed H7N9 human cases for whom detailed data on animal and environmental exposures was reported to be 6 days (range: 1 to 10) 
 <xref rid="pone.0111834-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Furthermore, a modeling study on 2013 H7N9 
 <xref rid="pone.0111834-Nishiura1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> proposes that the mean generation time of the bird-human transmission to be 2–4 days. Therefore, our result of turning point for reporting of human cases on April 9 indicates that the turning point for actual human infections had occurred 2–4 days before April 9 but most likely after April 5.
