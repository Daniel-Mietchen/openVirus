<p>We also note that culling measure implemented after April 5 was really a pre-emptive measure to remove the infective birds, and the susceptible birds from future exposure to infection. Therefore, this effect is indeed modeled in our setting since 
 <italic>S(0)</italic> (or 
 <italic>S
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic>), the initial "at risk" population size, would be much bigger without this culling. It is important to note that 
 <italic>S(0)</italic> is the initial population size of the birds which would be exposed to infection during the entire course of the epidemic, including the phase when culling was implemented.
