<p>In this work we propose a bird-human epidemic model with two parts to describe the dynamical relationship between the epidemic in bird population and the subsequent bird-to-human infections. The first part of the model is a modified SIR compartmental model adopted to describe the transmission among birds; the second is a simple single-equation model for the increase in the cumulative number of infected humans due to infection transmitted by infected birds. Our modeling approach allows us to infer important information regarding the bird epidemic via the model parameters for the bird population that are epidemiologically important. With these results, we can then acquire useful knowledge regarding the dynamics of bird-to-human transmissions. There have been numerous previous modeling studies on avian influenza epidemic of humans (e.g., 
 <xref rid="pone.0111834-Ferguson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0111834-Chowell1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>), or on the bird epidemic only 
 <xref rid="pone.0111834-LeMenach1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0111834-Tiensin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Some theoretical studies also consider both the bird and human epidemics but mainly focusing on human infections 
 <xref rid="pone.0111834-Iwami1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0111834-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Some recent studies on 2013 H7N9 have included both birds and human infections in their models, but with the purpose to quantify the human transmission parameters only (e.g., 
 <xref rid="pone.0111834-Nishiura1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0111834-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>). In our work, we are able to estimate the basic reproduction number for infections among birds and the mean number of human infections per infected bird per day. To our best knowledge, this is the first study where a bird-human avian influenza epidemic can be ascertained through the modeling of both the bird and human parts of the epidemic and, more importantly, quantified through the use of human case data only.
