<p>Assuming that the birth and natural death of birds are balanced during the disease outbreak period (that is, the bird population remains at a constant level if there is no disease), we have the Kermack-McKendrick model (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Mathematical Details</xref> section) to describe disease transmission in birds, with the density-dependent transmission rate (
 <italic>β/N</italic>), and the removal rate (
 <italic>δ</italic>). An important feature of our proposed model is that the “actually at risk” total bird population 
 <italic>N</italic>(t) (again, we emphasize this is the total bird population to be involved in the disease transmission during the entire epidemic under consideration) can be determined, via a close form (analytic expression), from the initial numbers of the compartment sizes (
 <italic>S</italic>(0) = 
 <italic>S</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, 
 <italic>I</italic>(0) = 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and 
 <italic>N</italic>(0) = 
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>) at the beginning of the bird infection outbreak and from the aforementioned parameters (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Mathematical Details</xref> section for details). Hence “removal” in our model refers to all removal from the actually infected bird population, including disease-induced death, recovery (although infected birds often exhibits only mild or no symptoms), or culling after April 5.
