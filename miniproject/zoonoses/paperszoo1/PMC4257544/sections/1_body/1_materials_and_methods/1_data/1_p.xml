<p>We make use of the human H7N9 case data by onset date from February 19 to May 30, 2013 and made public by the World Health Organization (WHO) 
 <xref rid="pone.0111834-World1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, to estimate the model parameter values, including the basic reproduction number 
 <xref rid="pone.0111834-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> of the bird epidemic and final bird outbreak size. Note that 10 of the 132 confirmed cases during this time period did not have a date of onset; therefore the data we fitted contains 122 cases.
