<p>The human population susceptible to the H7N9 virus is assumed to remain at a constant level during the early stage of outbreak. Moreover, there is no evidence indicating that either human-to-human or human-to-bird infection had occurred. Thus, the cumulative number of human H7N9 cases by infected birds,

  <sub>H</sub>

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Mathematical Details</xref> section) so the increase rate of the infected human individuals is proportional to the number of the infected birds, with the proportionality constant (

 </inline-formula>)-the daily human infection rate per infected bird. Integration of this simple model establishes a link between the cumulative number of H7N9-infected humans and the total number of birds. See 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Mathematical Details</xref> section for more details. For illustration, the bird-human model diagram is provided in
