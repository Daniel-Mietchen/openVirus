<p>To model the initial stage of an outbreak, it is natural to assume that initially there are no recovered birds, i.e., 
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 
 <italic>S</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>+
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>. Consequently, we may describe the bird-human epidemic, respectively, as a system of two coupled equations, one for the bird epidemic and the other for human outbreak. In this coupled system, there are five parameters to be estimated: 
 <italic>δ</italic>, 
 <italic>β</italic>, 
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, 
 <italic>I
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic>, and 
 <italic>β
  <sub>H</sub>
 </italic>. The first four parameters enable us to quantify the outbreak among bird population, while the last term is the bird-to-human infection rate.
