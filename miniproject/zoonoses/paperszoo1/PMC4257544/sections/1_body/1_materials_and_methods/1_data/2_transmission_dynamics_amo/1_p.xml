<p>We stratify the total number (
 <italic>N</italic>(t)) of birds, “actually” vulnerable for the disease transmission at time 
 <italic>t</italic>, into two classes: actually susceptible (
 <italic>S</italic>(t)) and infected (
 <italic>I</italic>(t)). Here we introduce the class of “actually at risk” susceptibles for birds that will be exposed to the virus during the entire epidemic under consideration (at “actual” risk for infection), which is consistent with the underlying idea of the Richards model 
 <xref rid="pone.0111834-Richards1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> which we utilize in our modeling construction (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Mathematical Details</xref> section), where by definition only (eventually) infected population is considered. The introduction of this novel modeling construction is also critical for the purpose of its application to avian influenza modeling, since it is quite conceivable that a large number of birds (especially wild ones) were not exposed to the virus, but we do not have any information regarding its size. This definition of S(t) is different from the “susceptible” birds defined in the classical SIR model where (majority) susceptible birds may not be actually exposed to the virus. Therefore, the initial size of this actually at risk susceptible class is unknown and it is one of the parameters to be estimated. In what follows, we will use total bird population “actually at risk” at time t for N(t) and “actually” susceptibles at time t for S(t), but simply infected birds I(t) for sake of brevity. Detailed model description is given in the 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Mathematical Details</xref> section.
