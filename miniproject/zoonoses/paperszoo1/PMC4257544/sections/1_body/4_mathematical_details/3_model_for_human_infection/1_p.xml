<p>The cumulative number of human H7N9 cases by infected birds, 
 <italic>I
  <sub>H</sub>

 <disp-formula id="pone.0111834.e044">
  <graphic xlink:href="pone.0111834.e044.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
  <label>(17)</label>
 </disp-formula>where 
 <inline-formula>
  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0111834.e045.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula> denotes the infected bird population at time t and 
 <inline-formula>
  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0111834.e046.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula> is the daily number of human infection per infected bird. Note also that our model for human epidemic (17) considers only those with onset (as the human case data is by onset date), which is reasonable if we assume that, for H7N9, humans have no infectivity before onset of symptoms.
