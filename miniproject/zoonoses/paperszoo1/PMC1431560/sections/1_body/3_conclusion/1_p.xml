As new human pathogens emerge, much focus is placed on viral evolution in the newly infected hosts, such as adaptive mutations that facilitate robust replication and pathogenesis. However, our studies of SIVsm demonstrate that an important source of viral variation and thus adaptive potential can be found within the viral populations of individual reservoir host animals. This extensive intra-animal viral variation, which is likely key to facilitating cross-species transmission events, may be a common zoonotic signature among diverse emergent pathogens.
