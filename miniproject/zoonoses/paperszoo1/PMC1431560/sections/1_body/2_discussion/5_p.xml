<p>Comparison of our SIVsm plasma RNA-derived V1V2 sequences and a set of HIV-1 envelope sequences obtained from proviral DNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], while not the ideal comparison, demonstrates that natural SIVsm V1V2 diversity is as great, if not greater than that observed in HIV-1-infected humans. Since average pairwise diversity is an indirect measure of viral effective population size [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>], these results suggest that an equivalent number of target cells are infected in both SM and human immunodeficiency virus infections. The similar levels of viral variation may also indicate that selective forces acting on 
 <italic>env </italic>V1V2 are comparable in both SIVsm-infected natural mangabey reservoir hosts and in HIV-infected humans. A caveat of these SIV and HIV sequence comparisons is that this protein is quite divergent between the two viruses, and it is possible that this region of 
 <italic>env </italic>could be under different functional and immune selection pressures in the two hosts.
