<p>In contrast to 
 <italic>env</italic>, SIVsm 
 <italic>gag </italic>p27 was under strong purifying selection in infected SMs. Temporal analyses of 
 <italic>gag </italic>p27 demonstrated no evidence of the fixation of specific aa substitutions, suggesting that 
 <italic>gag </italic>p27 is not the target of strong selective pressures such as those that might be expected if anti-Gag cellular immune responses were present. These observations corroborate our findings that natural SM hosts mount limited cellular immune responses to SIV infection [
