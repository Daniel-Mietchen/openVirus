<p>Beyond aa sequence variation, the extensive glycosylation of the HIV and SIV envelope glycoprotein is thought to reduce protein epitope exposure and to facilitate viral evasion of antibody neutralization [

The neutralization resistant SIVmac239 strain contains 8 predicted glycosylation sequences in the same region, while some other macaque-adapted SIVs appear to have fewer N-glyc sites, especially in the V1 region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Thus, like SIVcpz in a naturally infected chimpanzee [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>], SIVsm appears to be highly glycosylated in naturally infected SMs. Presumably, continually evolving antibody responses in these natural hosts maintain a highly glycosylated surface protein, albeit without effectively suppressing virus replication. Our observation of an inverse relationship between N-glyc site density and SIVsm V1V2 sequence diversity might result from the more highly glycosylated viral variants being better shielded from the diversifying selection pressures of anti-SIV antibodies than less glycosylated variants, as recently suggested for HIV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Thus, antibody-mediated pressures on the SIVsm envelope glycoprotein appear to exist in this natural host reservoir species, and serve to continually select for adaptations in envelope sequence and structure.
