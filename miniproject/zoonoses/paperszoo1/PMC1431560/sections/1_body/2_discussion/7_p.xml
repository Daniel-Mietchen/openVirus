<p>The observation that high-level virus replication and extensive sequence diversification do not harm SMs is consistent with the notion that the direct effects of SIV replication are not sufficient to explain AIDS [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. Instead, our studies of natural host responses to infection indicate that indirect mechanisms, such as host inflammatory immune responses elicited by virus infection, likely play a role in the development of AIDS in new non-natural hosts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Because the humoral immune responses in naturally infected SMs do not significantly suppress virus replication, they may actually serve to promote the continuous selection of 
 <italic>env </italic>sequences and structures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. This helps to explain how the unique SIV/HIV Env structure has evolved in lower primates, resulting in a virus that is extremely difficult to neutralize [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. This continuous diversifying selection pressure likely also serves to generate variants with expanded cell tropisms that are well suited to adapt to new host cellular environments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. For instance, a spectrum of variant SIV Env conformations with differing requirements for the levels of CD4 on target cells might help to breach species differences in CD4 molecules, which are generally not as well conserved as the viral co-receptors such as CCR5 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>]. Thus, high viral variability and recombination within a natural reservoir host or host population will increase the likelihood that variants with the ability to replicate in new host species exist. The ongoing intra-host diversification of human-adapted RNA viruses, such as HIV and hepatitis C virus, enables these viruses to continually respond to changing pressures, such as those imposed by immune responses and antiviral therapies, making treatment of these human diseases a formidable challenge [
