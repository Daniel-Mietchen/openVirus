<p>As V1V2 is primarily a target of the antibody response, it will be important to more thoroughly characterize in natural hosts SIVsm variation in viral genome regions known to encode multiple cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes in non-natural hosts (such as humans and macaques). Such studies could help to elucidate the selective pressures exerted by the natural host on other genome regions and inform us as to the potential for genetic plasticity in viral genes that are targeted by current CTL-focused HIV vaccine strategies.</p>
