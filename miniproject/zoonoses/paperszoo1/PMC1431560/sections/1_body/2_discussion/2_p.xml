<p>Positive selection in V1V2 appears to explain the observed 
 <italic>env </italic>diversification. Specific sites in V1 were consistently selected for in four of the five animals. Our results agree with other studies of SIV and HIV selection, in which dN-dS was consistently greater than 0 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. However, the majority of previous studies of nonpathogenic SIV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>] calculated dN and dS by averaging over all sites, obscuring variation in selective pressure between aa sites. In addition to positive selection in V1V2, we detected temporal shifts in SIVsm populations, some of which involved the gain or loss of N-glyc sites.
