<p>The cumulative number of nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) nucleotide substitutions was estimated using 
 <bold>SNAP</bold>, Synonymous/Non-synonymous Analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>] which calculates rates of nucleotide substitution based on the method of Nei and Gojobori [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">92</xref>], and incorporating a statistic developed in Ota and Nei [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>]. Viral diversity at each time point was determined by calculating the pairwise nucleotide distances for each of the clones using the method of Tamura and Nei [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">94</xref>], and pairwise amino acid distances using the Gamma distance method in the program MEGA 2.1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">95</xref>]. Average dN and dS were calculated using the modified Nei-Gojobori method in MEGA 2.1. Phylogenetic trees constructed with synonymous or nonsynonymous sites only were constructed in MEGA 2.1 using distance methods, incorporating the Tamura-Nei model of nucleotide substitution with gamma-distributed rates. All statistics were computed using SYSTAT 10.
