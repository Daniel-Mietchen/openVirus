<p>Sequences were aligned using the program CLUSTAL X [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>], followed by manual adjustment using MacClade 4.0 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>] and BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>]. Non-aligned regions of length variation in V1 and V2 were removed (corresponding to nucleotides 6932â€“6974), and sequences containing internal stop codons or frame shifts were also excluded from analysis as these are thought to be PCR artifacts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>].
