<p>For tree construction, the Modeltest program [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>] was used to construct and evaluate the DNA substitution models used. Based on the Modeltest results phylogenetic analysis on sequences obtained from successive time points during the acute infection was performed by maximum likelihood (ML) using the program Treefinder [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>]. The general-time-reversible model, which allows for rate variation between sites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>], was used, and the shape parameter (Î±) of the gamma distribution used in this model was estimated, as were base frequencies and substitution rate parameters. Bootstrap support was determined with 1,000 resamplings of the ML tree using distance methods in PAUP4.0b10*, incorporating the estimated rate parameters. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from all clones obtained from V1V2 and 
 <italic>gag </italic>and also separately on V1V2 and 
 <italic>gag </italic>sequences obtained from each animal at each time point by maximum likelihood (ML) using the program Treefinder.
