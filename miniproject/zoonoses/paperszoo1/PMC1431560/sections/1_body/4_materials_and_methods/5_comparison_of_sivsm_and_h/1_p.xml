 <italic>Env </italic>nt sequences from 9 patients of a study of 10 HIV-infected patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] were compared to our SIVsm 
 <italic>env </italic>data with respect to nt diversity, sequence length variation, and predicted N-linked glycosylation site diversity. For V1V2 nt diversity comparisons, sequences from both SMs and patients were aligned and stripped of gaps. Pair-wise estimates of intra-host nt diversity were calculated using Mega 2.1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">96</xref>]. For sequence length variation, alignments (including gaps) of both SIVsm and HIV-1 were pared down to the V1V2 region as defined by the flanking regions of extreme conservation. For this test, homology of each amino acid site was not as important as the overall homology of the region. Mean-squared error variance was determined by ANOVA in R [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>] for both glycosylation density and sequence length in each species at each time point. Variances were compared manually using an F
 <sub>max </sub>test.
