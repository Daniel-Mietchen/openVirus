<p>PCR products from each sample were run on a 1.5% low-melt agarose gel. The resulting 425 bp V1V2 or 421 bp 
 <italic>gag </italic>product was extracted and cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector (TOPO TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen). From Rodrigo et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>] it was determined that if 2500 copies of viral RNA are used in the RT-PCR reaction, 20 clones picked from the PCR product will be unique. Therefore, approximately 20 clones from V1V2 and 10 from 
 <italic>gag </italic>(due to lower expected diversity in this conserved gene) at each time point and each animal were randomly selected and sequenced using the M13F and M13R primers using the dye terminator cycle sequencing method with an MJ Research automated sequencer.
