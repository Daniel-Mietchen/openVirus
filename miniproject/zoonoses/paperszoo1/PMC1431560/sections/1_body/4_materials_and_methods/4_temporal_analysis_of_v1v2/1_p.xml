<p>In order to show that viral populations do not vary randomly through time, random trees of all variants from each animal were generated and the number of matching time-point sequences that formed a monophyletic clade was counted for each random tree. For the random trees, the number of matching time-point sequences that comprise a monophyletic group are Poisson distributed. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to compare our observed trees with those built from randomly sampled sequences.</p>
