<p>Five age-matched, naturally SIV-infected SMs from the colony at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Atlanta, GA were chosen for study. Individual animals were between 8 and 12 years of age and were estimated to have been infected for approximately 3 to 9 years, based on available HIV-2 seroconversion data. Thus, all animals were born in, and acquired their SIVsmm infection in, captivity. Group housing of the animals confounds identification of potential donor-recipient pairs. Plasma from animals FQi, FJo, FFj, FDo, and FBo was obtained on 3-13-99, 5-12-99, and 5-10-01 and viral RNA was extracted and quantified using a real-time RT-PCR assay designed to quantitatively detect the diverse SIVsmm variants [

Viral RNA was diluted such that approximately 2500 copies of viral RNA were used in a Superscript™ First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA.), following the protocol provided, primed by random hexamers. 2 μL of cDNA from the RT-PCR was used for PCR amplification of both

 <italic>gag </italic>p27 with Qiagen HotStar Taq (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA.). The 
 <italic>env </italic>V1V2 region was amplified with the forward primer V1V2DF (5'-TTTGATGCNTGGAAYAAYAC-3') corresponding to bp 6774–6792 of the SIVsmmH4 genome (GenBank accession no. 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="X14307" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">X14307</ext-link>), and the reverse primer V1V2DR (5'-CATAGCATCCCARTARTGCTT-3') corresponding to bp 7217–7238 of the SIVsmmH4 genome. The primer pair amplified a 421 bp fragment spanning the V1–V2 hypervariable region of envelope. The 
 <italic>gag </italic>region was amplified using shortgagF1 (5'TTAAGTCCAAGAACATTAAATGC-3') and shortgagR (5'GTAGAACCTGTCTACATAGCT-3') which correspond to bp 1493–1515 and 19371957 of SIVsmmH4, respectively, yielding a 421 bp product of the 5' end of the p27 capsid protein. Primers were designed by choosing highly conserved regions from an alignment of all SIV and HIV2 
 <italic>env </italic>and 
 <italic>gag </italic>sequences from the HIV sequence database [

A final extension time was carried out for 5 min. at 72°C. No-template controls and negative controls from the RNA extraction were used in each set of reactions, both RT and PCR, to ensure that no cross contamination occurred at either step. RT-PCR sensitivity was determined to be = 500 copies per reaction.
