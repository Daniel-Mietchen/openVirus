<p>Studies of zoonotic RNA virus diversity have not focused on the variation that already exists in the source reservoir hosts; rather, the focus has largely been on the genetic variation and specific adaptive mutations that are observed in the newly emerged human pathogen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. While adaptive mutations are critical for efficient host-to-host propagation in the newly-infected species, viral diversity that is already extant in reservoir hosts is another important source of the genetic variation necessary for successful cross-species transmission. Here we describe extraordinarily high intra-host SIVsm 
 <italic>env </italic>V1V2 diversity in naturally infected SMs, maintained by its high replication rate and positive selection most likely mediated by antibody responses. Ongoing evolution of an extremely mutable SIV 
 <italic>env </italic>in the natural host explains the ease with which these lentiviruses can adapt to divergent host cellular environments and evade Ab responses in new host species.
