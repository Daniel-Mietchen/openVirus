<p>Most newly emerging human pathogens are zoonotic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], yet little is known about the natural reservoirs from which these zoonoses emerge. RNA viruses, due to their extraordinary genomic variability, have been particularly capable of establishing infection in new host species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. As examples, the transfer of avian influenza A [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and rodent hantavirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] from their natural reservoirs to create novel human outbreaks has been documented on several occasions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Nonetheless, successful breaching of the host range barrier is relatively rare, with self-sustaining outbreaks in a new host species presumably requiring multiple mutational events. Two different simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) from Central African chimpanzees and West African sooty mangabeys (SM) are inferred to have been transferred to humans by several independent zoonotic events, resulting in the introduction to humans of HIV-1 and HIV-2, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Although phylogenetic analyses of SIV sequences reveal considerable viral genetic diversity between different infected individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the magnitude of intra-animal viral diversity, the substrate for selection in cross-species transmission events, has not been studied. Furthermore, the mechanisms and tempo of the generation of viral variation in natural reservoir hosts are poorly understood.
