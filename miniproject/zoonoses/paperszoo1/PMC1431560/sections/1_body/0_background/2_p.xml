<p>Over 40 different species of African non-human primates harbor the CD4+ T cell tropic lentiviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In these natural reservoir hosts, the SIVs do not cause AIDS, despite high viremia. Disease only develops upon transmission of SIV to new non-natural hosts such as humans or Asian macaques [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Although SIV-infected SMs are highly viremic, they manifest far lower levels of aberrant immune activation and apoptosis than are seen in pathogenic SIV and HIV infections and maintain preserved T lymphocyte populations and regenerative capacity [
