<p>Variation in the viral surface proteins of zoonotic viruses is likely key to the ability of these agents to engage new host cell receptors and gain a foothold in new species. For influenza virus, amino acid changes and changes in glycosylation patterns in the viral hemagglutinin affect receptor binding specificity and host range [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. For the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) discreet variations in the spike protein are proposed to be important for viral tropism and animal-to-human transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The HIV and SIV envelope (Env) proteins are extraordinarily genetically variable and highly glycosylated. HIV Env has evolved to tolerate considerable aa sequence flexibility, including variation in N-glyc sites, and to conformationally shield key receptor-binding domains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This genetic and functional flexibility enables Env to escape from antibody responses and to utilize different co-receptors to gain efficient entry into target cells [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In our studies of the adaptation of SIVsm from a naturally infected SM to a new simian host (rhesus macaques) we observed that one of three phylogenetically distinct 
 <italic>env </italic>variants could replicate to high levels in the newly infected macaques. These variants encoded a shorter variable region 1 loop and lacked two specific N-linked glycosylation sites (N-glyc sites) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The pre-existence of viral 
 <italic>env </italic>variants in naturally infected SMs that are capable of replicating to high levels in a new host species pointed to the importance of SIVsm diversity in the reservoir host in enabling cross-species transmission.
