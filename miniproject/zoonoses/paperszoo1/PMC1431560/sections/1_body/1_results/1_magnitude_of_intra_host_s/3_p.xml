<p>To characterize the overall evolutionary dynamics of natural SIV variation, we built maximum likelihood trees of both 
 <italic>env </italic>V1V2 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) and 
 <italic>gag </italic>p27 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) sequences. The SIVsm variants from each SM formed distinct clades in both genes, and the 
 <italic>env </italic>and 
 <italic>gag </italic>trees showed the same relationship between virus populations of the 5 animals. These results demonstrate that each host harbors a phylogenetically distinct population of SIVs, presumably as the result of infection with distinct viral populations and subsequent host-specific viral evolution.
