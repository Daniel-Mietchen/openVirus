<p>Five naturally SIV-infected SMs (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) were sampled three times over a 2-year period. Viral RNA in plasma obtained in 3/99, 5/99, and 5/01 was measured by a real-time RT-PCR assay designed to quantitatively detect the diverse SIVsm variants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Time points were chosen so that evolution could be assessed over both shorter and longer time intervals. Viral load averaged 1.5 Ã— 10
 <sup>6 </sup>SIV RNA copies/ml plasma, and fluctuated modestly over the 2-year period (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). No clinical signs of AIDS were observed in any of the infected SMs over the study period.
