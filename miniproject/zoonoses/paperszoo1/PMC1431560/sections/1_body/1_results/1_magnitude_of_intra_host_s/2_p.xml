<p>Multiple V1V2 
 <italic>env </italic>clones (range 15–29) and p27 
 <italic>gag </italic>clones (range 5–19) were sampled from each animal at each time point (Genbank Accession numbers 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AY733102" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">AY733102</ext-link>-

 <italic>Env </italic>and 
 <italic>gag </italic>were chosen for analysis since they were thought to represent the extremes of diversity in SIV populations. These genes also differ in how the immune system detects them, with 
 <italic>env </italic>V1V2 being exposed primarily to neutralizing antibodies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and 
 <italic>gag </italic>p27 being recognized mostly through cellular immune responses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The number of individual viral sequences analyzed (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) combined with the sampling of variants over a short time interval (2 months) and a longer time interval (2 years) exceeds that reported in previous studies of SIV diversity in natural hosts [
