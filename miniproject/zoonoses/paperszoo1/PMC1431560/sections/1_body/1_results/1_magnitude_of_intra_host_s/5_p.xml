<p>Pairwise nt and aa diversity was calculated after removing regions of uncertain homology (gap-stripping) in V1, such that the values obtained for intra-host diversity represent minimum values. Average pairwise aa diversity was high in 
 <italic>env </italic>V1V2 (average: 5.6%, range: 0 and 37.7%; Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and low in 
 <italic>gag </italic>p27 (average 1%; range: 0 and 7.1%, data not shown). The minimal diversity detected in 
 <italic>gag</italic>, which was amplified under identical conditions, confirms that the observed V1V2 diversity is not the result of PCR-introduced mutation. In individual animals, the magnitude of nt and aa diversity did not change significantly over the 2-year observation period (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). However, there appeared to be animal-to-animal variation in the extent of V1V2 diversity, with animals FFj and FDo exhibiting lower V1V2 nt and aa diversity than FJo and FBo (ANOVA p &lt; 0.01, with Bonferroni adjustment). Nt and aa diversity were not correlated with viremia, suggesting that mechanisms other than or in addition to the magnitude of virus replication determine the extent of viral diversity. We cannot rule out that reduced diversity in FFj and FDo are the result of infection with less diverse virus populations.
