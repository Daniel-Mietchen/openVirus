<p>The translated 
 <italic>env </italic>aa sequences (FJo, Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; data from all animals can be obtained from THV) demonstrate significant V1V2 heterogeneity, including heterogeneity in numerous predicted N-glyc sites (NXS/T, where X can be any aa but proline). Considerable V1 length variations were observed (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and for example, Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), such that alignment of this region required manual adjustment, and may not represent precise homology. There were no trends in V1V2 sequence length variation over time (data not shown). 
 <italic>Gag </italic>aa alignments (available from THV) showed significantly less aa variation reflecting its highly conserved nature.
