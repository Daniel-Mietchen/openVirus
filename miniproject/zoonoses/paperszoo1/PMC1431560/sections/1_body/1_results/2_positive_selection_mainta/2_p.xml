<p>Temporal phylogenetic structure in V1V2 suggested that continual V1V2 diversification was occurring. To look for evidence of positive selection, dN and dS were calculated at each site and averaged over a 3-codon sliding window for VIV2 (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) or 30-codon sliding window for p27 (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). These results confirmed that dN-dS&gt;0 (p = 0.003, t-test) in V1 (aa's 25â€“55) in all animals, indicating positive selection. For p27, the same test showed that dS&gt;dN along this gene (t-test, p &lt; 0.001), indicating that purifying selection limits its diversity. V1 was consistently found to be under significant positive selection in all animals, except FFj (data not shown). By contrast, the few aa changes in p27 sequences in the different animals over time appeared random in nature except for a single partially fixed mutation in FDo.
