<p>Although the magnitude of sequence diversity did not change over time, it was likely that 
 <italic>env </italic>sequences at later time points had diverged from those sampled earlier. To investigate the temporal pattern of sequence evolution within each animal, all available samples from all three time-points for each animal were pooled and analyzed by maximum likelihood (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>; FQi). Sixteen of the nineteen (85%) bootstrap-supported clades from FQi contain variants from a single time point only. This pattern was repeatable amongst variants from all other animals; 100%, 80%, 69%, and 63% of bootstrap supported clades consisted of a single time point in animals FDo, FFj, FJo, and FBo, respectively. In an analysis of random trees, the number of matching time-point sequences that comprise a monophyletic group showed a Poisson distribution; 86% of variants did not form monophyletic clades with any other matching time-point variant (i.e., these sequences stood alone). Thus, the observed temporal clustering of SIVsm viral populations does not occur by chance alone (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p &lt; 0.01).
