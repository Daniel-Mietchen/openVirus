<p>V1V2 clones from the five SMs contained variable numbers of N-glyc sites, ranging from 3 to 10. The average number of N-glyc sites among all animals was 7.2. There was no clear pattern of increased or decreased V1V2 
 <italic>env </italic>glycosylation with time. However, the mean number of N-glyc sites for FFj and FDo (7.8 and 8.2, respectively) was significantly higher than the other animals (average between 6.5 and 6.9; ANOVA, Tukey B, p &lt; 0.001). An additional N-glyc site is found in V1 in the majority of sequences in FFj and FDo at position 45, but not in the other animals. There was also a smaller range of N-glyc sites per set of sequences in FFj and FDo (6–9) compared to other animals (3–10). As described, the FDo and FFj SIVsm populations were less diverse and had lower average dN compared to the virus populations found in the other 3 animals (Table
