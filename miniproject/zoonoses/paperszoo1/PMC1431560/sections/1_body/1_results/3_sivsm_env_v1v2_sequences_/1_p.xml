<p>Up to 10 N-glyc sites are contained within the SIVsm V1V2 regions sequenced in this study. In multiple locations overlapping consensus motifs (aa's 42–44, 52–54, and 95–107) are present, such that the exact site of glycosylation varies (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These overlapping consensus motifs are in particularly diverse regions of V1V2 and in regions of strong positive selection.
