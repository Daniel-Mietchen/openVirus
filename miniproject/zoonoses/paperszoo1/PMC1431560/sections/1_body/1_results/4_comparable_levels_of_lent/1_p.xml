<p>Diversification of the HIV genome in humans underlies its success in evading pharmacologic and immunologic selection pressures, and likely facilitates human-to-human transmission events. It has also been suggested that extensive virus diversification actually drives disease progression and the destruction of the immune system [

 <italic>env </italic>aa sequences from proviral DNA representing 9 untreated, chronically HIV-infected humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] were compared to our plasma RNA-derived SIVsm 
 <italic>env </italic>data. Two time points were chosen from both the SM and the human dataset so that the interval between observations was approximately 2.5 years.
