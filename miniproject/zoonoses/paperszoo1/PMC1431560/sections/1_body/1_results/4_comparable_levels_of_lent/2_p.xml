<p>For the comparison of nucleotide sequence diversity, homologous regions surrounding V1V2 were aligned and gap-stripped. Average pairwise nucleotide diversity was calculated separately in each host at both time points (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Measures of SIVsm and HIV-1 nt diversity were not significantly different from each other within each time point (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>; p &gt; 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). Thus SIVsm V1V2 sequence diversity in the natural SM host is at least as great as, if not greater than that observed in HIV-1-infected humans, especially given that the archival nature of proviral sequences may overestimate the diversity of the actively replicating viral RNA population [
