 <italic>Env </italic>adapts not only through raw nt sequence variability, but also through variation in both sequence length and N-glyc site density and position. Substantial changes in these phenotypic parameters will affect the ability of 
 <italic>env </italic>to utilize different co-receptors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], evade neutralizing antibodies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] and establish new infections in na√Øve hosts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. To elucidate differences in SIVsm and HIV-1 V1V2 sequence length and N-glyc site density variation, a pooled estimate of variance within each species was compared. Neither the variances of sequence length nor glycosylation density differed significantly between species at time point 1 although although humans had a greater variance in both parameters at time point 2 (F
 <sub>max </sub>test, p &lt; 0.01). The variance of sequence length of SIVsm V1 decreased between the two time points (F
 <sub>max </sub>test, p &lt; 0.005) suggesting that the magnitude of selection in SMs shifts over time, while in humans the variance remained stable (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). The variation in glycosylation density (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D-E</xref>) remained relatively stable over time within both species except for a slight but non-significant expansion of variance in humans at time point 2.
