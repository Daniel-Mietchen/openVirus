<p>With regard to epidemiological parameters of Hendra virus, we assumed (1) a transmission rate of 0.0000476, (2) a viral latency (incubation) period lasting 6 days after infection, followed by (3) an infectious period lasting 7 days 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Plowright1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, as well as (4) a period of immunity for pups birthed by infectious or recovered mothers lasting from 4 to 6 months, with most pups losing maternal immunity by 5 months of age

 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Plowright2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. We calibrated the contact rate such that a population with 95% susceptible individuals at the beginning of an epidemic (at the appearance of the first infectious individual) would attain a maximum of 60% infectious individuals during the epidemic 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Field4" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. We assumed: (1) recrudescence occurs stochastically in females during pregnancy and early lactation 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Breed1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>; (2) the individual becomes infectious immediately upon recrudescence (i.e., there is no latency period); and (3) the same individual can recrudesce only once within any given reproductive period. We modelled different rates of recrudescence consistent with current hypotheses in the scientific literature
