<p>Finally, we evaluated the relative sensitivity of the epidemiological dynamics of our model to changes in the values of important parameters, and the robustness of these responses to the manner in which epidemics were initiated (via recrudescence or immigration). Sensitivity analysis 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Saltelli1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> focused on determining the response of the magnitude and duration of epidemics to variation in (1) initial population size, (2) initial proportion of recovered individuals in the population, (3) duration of latency period, (4) duration of infectious period, (5) duration of maternal immunity period, (6) disease transmission rate, and (7) recrudescence rate. Except for disease transmission rate and recrudescence rate, we selected the range of values used for the various parameters (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0080430-t001">Table 1</xref>) to correspond to the ranges reported in 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Plowright1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0080430-t001">Table 1</xref>). We varied disease transmission rate between 2.0E-5 (the lower end of the range reported in 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Plowright1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>) and 0.001, and we varied recrudescence rate over this same range. Robustness analysis consisted of comparing the relative sensitivities of two versions of the model to changes in the values of these parameters. The first version assumed epidemics were initiated by recrudescence and the second assumed epidemics were initiated by introducing one infectious immigrant into the population on a randomly-chosen day of the year (assuming no recrudescence). For each sensitivity analysis, we once again ran three Monte Carlo simulations for each parameter combination.
