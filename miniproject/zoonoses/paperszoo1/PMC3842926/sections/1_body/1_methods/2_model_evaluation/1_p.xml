<p>To evaluate the usefulness of the model in exploring the possible role of recrudescence in the persistence of Hendra virus, we confirmed the ability of the model to simulate adequately the basic life cycle pattern of individuals (breeding, pregnancy, birth, lactation, and pup dependency), the resulting seasonal patterns, the stage-class structure of the population (pups, juveniles, sub-adults, adults), and the stable age-class distribution, implicitly under constant environmental conditions which would result in long-term stability in population size. We imposed the basic life cycle pattern via fixed rules coded into the model, and seasonal patterns in age structure shifts appeared as a direct result of individual life cycles. The ability of the model to generate appropriate demographic patterns was a prerequisite for the subsequent representation and explanation of disease dynamics. For this phase of model evaluation we ran three Monte Carlo simulations using baseline parameter values (see model description in
