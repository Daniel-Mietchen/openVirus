<p>After confirming the ability of our model to produce and explain differences in the magnitudes and durations of Hendra epidemics based on the life cycle of flying-foxes and the epidemiology of Hendra virus in a manner consistent with current knowledge, we used the model to explore the possible role of recrudescence in generating recurring epidemics in an isolated population under a variety of scenarios. In one series of simulations, we varied recrudescent rates from one simulation to the next with the rate set at either 1.0E-5 or 5.0E-5 or 0.001. In a second series, we varied the frequency of occurrence of recrudescence such that a year with a high recrudescence rate (0.001) was followed by from 1 to 19 consecutive years with no recrudescence. For each series of simulations, we once again ran three Monte Carlo simulations for each scenario and recorded the magnitudes and durations of the resulting epidemics. We set all parameters other than those controlling recrudescence to their baseline values, and initialized each of these simulations with 95% of the population consisting of susceptible individuals.</p>
