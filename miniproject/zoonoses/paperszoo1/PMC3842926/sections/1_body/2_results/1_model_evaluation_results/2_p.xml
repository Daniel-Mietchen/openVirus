<p>Magnitudes and durations of simulated epidemics were consistent with observations that the primary factor limiting infections was the number of susceptible individuals rather than the number of infectious individuals

 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Calisher1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, and were qualitatively similar to the dynamics of local epidemics produced by the model in 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Plowright1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. That is, depletion of the pool of susceptible individuals led to local viral extinction, with the magnitudes of epidemics decreasing (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080430-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), the time lag between initial infection and peak infection increasing (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080430-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), and the durations of epidemics decreasing (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080430-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>) with increasing proportions of recovered (hence, decreasing proportions of susceptible) individuals in the population at the time of initial infection. The model in 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Plowright1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> suggested that the threshold proportion of susceptible individuals required for disease invasion into their simulated population was approximately 0.3. Our simulations suggested that the pathogen could not sustain itself within the host population if the proportion of susceptible individuals was less than approximately 0.2 (proportion of recovered individuals &gt;0.8) at the time of invasion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080430-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), that the time from initial infection to peak infection increased exponentially as the proportion of susceptible individuals at the time of invasion approached this threshold (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080430-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), and that the proportion of infectious individuals within the population would not reach 0.1 unless the proportion of susceptible individuals at the time of invasion exceeded approximately 0.4 (proportion of recovered individuals &lt;0.6) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080430-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Once again, although these behaviours are fundamental consequences of the SEIR-model paradigm dynamics, which we imposed via fixed rules coded into the model, confirmation of the ability of the model to generate these patterns was a prerequisite for subsequent applications of the model.
