<p>The basic life cycle pattern of breeding, pregnancy, and the resulting births (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080430-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), as well as the seasonal fluctuations in stage-class structure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080430-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>) were similar to those reported in field studies 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Field4" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Eby1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Markus1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-ParryJones1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The simulated stable age-class distribution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080430-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) was qualitatively similar to that observed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Divljan1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, with differences most likely resulting from the age-specificity and year-to-year variability of mortality rates in the field, and sizes of the simulated populations remaining relatively stable.
