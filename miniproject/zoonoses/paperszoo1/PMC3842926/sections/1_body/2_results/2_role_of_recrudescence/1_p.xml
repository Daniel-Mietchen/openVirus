<p>Results of simulations exploring the role of recrudescence suggested that magnitudes and durations of initial and subsequent epidemics remained essentially the same as recrudescent rates were increased from 5.0E-5 to 0.001, with these rates producing an initial epidemic that infected about 60% of the population with subsequent annual epidemics infecting about 2% of the population. During the initial epidemics, infection levels remained above 10% for about 2 weeks, whereas during subsequent epidemics infection levels remained above 2% for about 3 weeks. With a recrudescent rate of 1.0E-5, initial epidemics also infected about 60% of the population and remained above 10% for about 2 weeks. However, the initial epidemic could occur in any of the first 4 or 5 years, or not occur at all during a 20-year simulation, and was never followed by subsequent epidemics. Results of simulations in which we increased the number of years between recrudescence events suggested the magnitudes of epidemics increased at a decreasing rate from slightly less than 10% to about 60% of the population infected as the number of years between events increased from one to 13, and remained at about 60% as the number of years between events increased from 13 to 20 (

The time that infection levels remained above 10% increased at a decreasing rate from 11 to 15 days as the number of years between events increased from two to five, and remained at 15 as the number of years between events increased from five to 20 (
