<p>An alternative hypothesis, which to our knowledge has not been tested within a quantitative framework, is that endemic infection occurs via viral latency and recrudescence. Two recent studies have indicated an endemic pattern of Hendra virus infection in flying-fox populations, suggesting that the infection dynamics of this novel paramyxovirus may differ from the acute, self-limiting, episodic pattern observed with other paramyxoviruses (e.g. measles virus, phocine distemper virus, rinderpest virus)

 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Field5" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In contrast to the expected episodic infection pattern, Breed et al. 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Breed1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> found that the seroprevalence of Hendra virus in a spectacled flying-fox (
 <italic>Pteropus conspicillatus</italic>) population in northern Australia gradually increased over a two-year period, suggesting infection was endemic in the population over the study period. The authors found that age, pregnancy, and lactation were significant risk factors for a detectable neutralizing antibody response. Further, two recent papers suggest recrudescence as the only plausible explanation of henipavirus infection in discrete flying-fox populations. Rahman et al. reported recrudescing infection and subsequent transmission in a captive colony of 
 <italic>Pteropus vampyrus</italic> in Malaysia 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Rahman1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and Peel et al. reported henipavirus serologic findings in the fruit-bat 
 <italic>Eidolon helvum</italic> on an isolated island in the Gulf of Ghana that also support viral recrudescence 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Peel1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Thus, an increasing number of studies suggest another mode of henipavirus persistence may exist.
