<p>Recrudescing henipavirus infections have been reported in humans, although infectiousness following recrudescence has not been described. Field and Kung 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Field3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> noted that henipavirus infection in humans has been associated with viral latency and subsequent recrudescence. In addition, apparent recrudescence has been reported in flying-foxes, with evident bat-to-bat transmission following recrudescence 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Breed1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. These findings suggest infectiousness following recrudescence in flying-foxes, but not in humans, a scenario not unexpected given the likely different pathogenesis and immune dynamics in the natural host and in spillover hosts. Persistence of other viral diseases such as measles has been associated with population heterogeneity (age structure, social structure) and population spatial structure (metapopulations existing in spatially discrete patches) 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Glass1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Merler1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Population heterogeneity facilitates the persistence of infection if different population segments are infected at different times. Population spatial structure facilitates the persistence of infection if local infections in spatially-discrete patches die out sequentially rather than simultaneously and allow reinfections to occur through migration between patches.
