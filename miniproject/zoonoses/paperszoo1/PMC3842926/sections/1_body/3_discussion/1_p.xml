<p>The work reported here shows that recrudescence provides an explanation for the persistence of Hendra virus infections in an isolated flying-fox population (as indicated in 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Breed1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Field5" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>). Previously, metapopulation models of the presence of Hendra virus in flying fox populations had provided the most coherent explanation of the patterns of infections observed 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Plowright1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Plowright3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. We do not suggest that recrudescence is more important than transmission via immigration in initiating local epidemics or that the two mechanisms are mutually exclusive. We suggest that recrudescence provides a plausible mechanism of Hendra virus persistence in flying-fox populations, and in addition, a parsimonious model for maintenance of Hendra virus in populations that are ecologically isolated.
