<p>Hendra virus could be maintained in an isolated flying-fox population indefinitely via periodic recrudescence in a manner such as to be indistinguishable from maintenance via periodic immigration of infected individuals. The magnitude and duration of simulated epidemics initiated by either mechanism of infection depended on the proportion of susceptible individuals in the population at initiation of the epidemic. This is consistent with theory 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and has been reported in earlier field studies of flying-foxes 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Plowright1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Field4" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and in pigs with another henipavirus, Nipah virus 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Pulliam1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The magnitudes of our simulated epidemics appeared to increase almost linearly with the length of time between recrudescent events. The variability in magnitudes of epidemics after any given recovery period was accounted for primarily by annual variation in cohort sizes (numbers of pups born) and hence, annual variation (lagged one year) in recruitment of susceptible individuals into the population. However, after relatively long periods with no new infections in the population, the dwindling number of potentially recrudescent individuals became the factor limiting the initiation of an epidemic.
