<p>In addition to recrudescence providing a plausible mechanism of Hendra virus persistence in flying-fox populations, it also plausibly explains the often observed ‘pattern’ of equine cases, namely temporal clustering over spatially disparate locations. While this pattern is likely associated with a suite of ecological, climatic and other factors, the presence of virus obviously represents the ‘necessary’ component within an epidemiological ‘necessary and sufficient’ causality paradigm. Twenty-eight of the 42 incidents of Hendra virus infection in horses reported to date have occurred in June (8), July (13), or August (7) 
 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Biosecurity1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Our results suggest that recrudescence in a single female sometime during pregnancy would be sufficient to precipitate a pulse of infection in the preceding year's pups (≈10% of the population) and other susceptible individuals in the colony, with the peak infection prevalence occurring during one of these months, even if an epidemic had passed through the population the previous year. Were this scenario to occur in disparate colonies, it would facilitate disparate equine cases clustered in time. Thus, to the extent that risk of infection in horses is related to viral prevalence in flying-foxes, post-recrudescence pulses of infectious flying-foxes provide a plausible causal mechanism for the observed pattern of infection in horses.
