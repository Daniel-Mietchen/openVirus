  <p>Phylogenetic tree of hantaviruses from rodents in Inner Mongolia, China, 2003–2006. The tree is based on partial sequences of the small (S) segment (nt 620–999 for Seoul virus [SEOV] and nt 614–993 for Hantaan virus [HTNV]). PHYLIP program package (3.65) (
   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html</ext-link>) was used to construct the phylogenetic trees by using the neighbor-joining (NJ) and the maximum likelihood (ML) methods with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The tree constructed by using the ML method had a similar topology as that constructed by using the NJ method (data not shown). Bootstrap values were calculated from 1,000 replicates; only the values &gt;50% are shown at the branch nodes. The sequence of Sin Nombre virus (SNV) was used as the outgroup. Partial S segment sequences recovered from 
   <italic>A. agrarius</italic> field mice trapped in the Hulunbeier District were designated as HulunbeierAa58, HulunbeierAa78, HulunbeierAa90, and HulunbeierAa118; partial S segment sequences from 
   <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> rats trapped in the Huhehaote District were designated as HuhehaoteRn-; and those from 
   <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> rats trapped in the Bayannaoer District were designated as BayannaoerRn14, BayannaoerRn42, BayannaoerRn86, BayannaoerRn98, and BayannaoerRn116. Sequences obtained in this study are shown in 
   <bold>boldface</bold>. All nucleotide sequence data reported here are available in GenBank (accession nos. FJ514504–FJ514546). The GenBank accession nos. of the other partial S segment sequences are SNV/NM H10 (L25748), HTNV/76-118 (M14626), HTNV/CFC94-2 (X95077), HTNV/CJAp93 (EF208953), HTNV/Bao14 (AB127998), HTNV/A9 (AF329390), HTNV/Hu (AB027111), HTNV/Z10 (AF18498), HTNV/Q32 (AB027097), HTNV/SN7 (AF288657), HTNV/84Fli (AY017064); SEOV/NY039 (EF210131), SEOV/Gou3 (AF288651), SEOV/QH367 (DQ081717), SEOV/SR11 (M34881), SEOV/Tchoupitoulas (AF329389), SEOV/IR461(AF329388), SEOV/BJFT01 (DQ519033), SEOV/L99 (AF488708), SEOV/R22 (AF488707), SEOV/Bjhd01 (AY627049), SEOV/K24-V2 (AF288655), SEOV/Z37 (F187082), SEOV/ZT10 (AY766368), and SEOV/Hb8610 (AF288643). Scale bar indicates genetic distance.
