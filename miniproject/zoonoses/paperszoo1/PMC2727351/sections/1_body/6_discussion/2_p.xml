<p>The occurrence and epidemics of HFRS are influenced by both natural (e.g., ecological) and occupational factors (

 <italic>A. agrarius</italic> mouse is a species that most frequently carries the hantavirus antigen in this area (

 </xref>). On the other hand, housing conditions for most farmers in the Hulunbeier District are poorer than in neighboring areas because of the relatively slow development of the local economy in this district. Thus, the local natural conditions, which support a high density of rodents and a high prevalence of hantavirus(es), as well as the generally low socioeconomic status of the Hulunbeier District, could contribute to the high numbers of HFRS cases in this district.
