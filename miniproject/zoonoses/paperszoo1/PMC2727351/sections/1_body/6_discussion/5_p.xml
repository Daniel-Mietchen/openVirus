<p>Of host species, 
 <italic>A. agrarius</italic> mice carried hantavirus antigens most frequently in the Hulunbeier District, whereas 
 <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> rats were the predominant carriers in the central and western parts of Inner Mongolia (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>), where 
 <italic>A. agrarius</italic> mice have never been found because of this speciesâ€™ desert ecosystem (

 <italic>A. agrarius</italic> mice in the Hulunbeier District and SEOV in 
 <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> rats in the Huhehaote and Bayannaoer Districts. In addition, the peak of HFRS associated with 
 <italic>A. agrarius</italic> mice occurred in the winter, whereas HFRS associated with 
 <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> rats occurred mainly in the spring (
