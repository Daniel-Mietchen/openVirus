<p>In this study, we analyzed hantavirus disease in Inner Mongolia, including death resulting from it and its geographic distribution and dynamics. We also carried out epizootiologic surveys and defined causative agent(s) of hantavirus disease outbreaks in the western parts of the region. Our results suggested that HTNV, associated with striped field mice (
 <italic>A. agrarius</italic>), was mainly responsible for HFRS cases in northeastern Inner Mongolia; SEOV, associated with Norway rats (
 <italic>R. norvegicus</italic>), caused outbreaks in the central and western parts of Inner Mongolia.
