<p>As expected, partial S segment sequences recovered from 
 <italic>A. agrarius</italic> mice were more closely related to HTNV (sequence identities 79.2%â€“98.9%) than to other known hantaviruses. On the phylogenetic tree, 4 strains recovered from 
 <italic>A. agrarius</italic> mice belonged to 2 lineages (A and B) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The sequences HulunbeierAa78, HulunbeierAa90, and HulunbeierAa118 showed a closer evolutionary relationship to strain Bao14 isolated from 
 <italic>A.</italic>
 <italic>agrarius</italic> mice trapped in the neighboring province of Heilongjiang (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">
  <italic>8</italic>
 </xref>) and to strain CJAp93 isolated from 
 <italic>A.</italic>
 <italic>peninsulae</italic> mice captured in Jilin Province (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">
  <italic>19</italic>
 </xref>). The sequence HulunbeierAa58 clustered together with strain A9 isolated from 
 <italic>A. agrarius</italic> mice from Jiangsu Province and strain Hu isolated from a person in the Hubei Province (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">
  <italic>8</italic>
