<p>All sequences recovered from 
 <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> rats showed higher identity to SEOV (80.2%–99.5%) than to HTNV or other hantavirus types. These sequences were closely related to each other, with 92.5%–99.9% sequence identity. The partial S sequences from 
 <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> rats from the Huhehaote District formed 2 clusters (marked C and D, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Although the C cluster included only sequences from the Huhehaote District, the D cluster included sequences from both the Huhehaote and Bayannaoer Districts and also included sequences from the Chinese strains K24 (from Zhejiang Province), Hb8610 (from Shanxi Province), L99 (from Jiangxi Province), and R22 (from Henan Province) (

 <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> rats from the Bayannaoer District belonged to cluster D, suggesting that SEOV variants causing the HFRS outbreak in the Bayannaoer District are genetically very close to those from the Huhehaote District.
