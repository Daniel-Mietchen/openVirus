<p>To establish molecular epidemiologic links between hantaviruses in rodents and HFRS outbreaks in central, western, and northeastern Inner Mongolia, we recovered partial S segment sequences (nt 463–1025 for HTNV; nt 584–1019 for SEOV) from the rodent tissue samples and subjected them to genetic analysis. Four of 13 hantaviral antigen–positive mice (
 <italic>A. agrarius</italic>) from the Hulunbeiere District, 34 of 38 hantaviral antigen–positive rats (
 <italic>R. norvegicus)</italic> from the Huhehaote District, and 5 of 8 hantaviral antigen–positive rats (
 <italic>R. norvegicus)</italic> from the Bayannaoer District were found positive by reverse transcription–PCR. The hantaviral sequences recovered from these rodents were designated respectively as HulunbeierAa-, HuhehaoteRn-, and BayannaoerRn- (

 <italic>M. meriidanus</italic> gerbils were unsuccessful. In addition, KHAV–specific partial S segment sequences were amplified earlier from 5 voles of species
