<p>From spring 2003 through autumn 2006, 1,466 rodents belonging to 11 species were trapped in the fields and residential areas of Inner Mongolia (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Of that total, 529 were trapped in the Hulunbeier District, 15 (13 
 <italic>A. agrarius</italic> and 2 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>peninsulae</italic> field mice) of which were found by indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay to be positive for hantavirus antigens. Of the 594 rodents trapped in the Huhehaote District, 38 
 <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> rats were positive. In the Bayannaoer District, 343 rodents were trapped, among which 8 
 <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> rats and 8 
 <italic>Meriones meridianus</italic> gerbils were found to be positive. The identification of hantavirus antigens in 
 <italic>M. meridianus</italic> gerbils suggests that this rodent species is a new carrier and may carry additional unidentified hantavirus(es).
