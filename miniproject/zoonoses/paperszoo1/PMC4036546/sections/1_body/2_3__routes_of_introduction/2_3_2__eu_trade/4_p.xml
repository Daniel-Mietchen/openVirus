<p>Trade of infected animals for non-food purposes could also pose a risk of viral introduction. MARV has been identified in the African Green Monkey (
 <italic>Cercopithecus aethiops</italic>), which have historically been traded for research purposes. There is considerable movement of horses around the world, primarily for sporting events. Horses are known to be susceptible to HeV with infections in Australia [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], but to date there have been no reported cases of NiV in horses. Pet travel could also be a risk as the pets could potentially be infected with bat-borne zoonotic viruses in endemic countries. Recently a kitten, infected with rabies virus, entered France from Morocco demonstrating that such events can occur, even though the accompanying certificate of good health did not meet the regulatory provisions for the import of domestic carnivores from Morocco [
 <xref rid="B113-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Data from TRACES suggests that movement of live animals such as pets between NiV or MARV countries (as defined in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-02084-f002">Figure 2</xref>) and the EU are primarily animals not considered a risk of carrying the viruses (e.g., tropical fish) [
 <xref rid="B114-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. However, there are a number of movements of cats and dogs. An experimental infection study of two cats with the Malaysian strain of NiV found that they started to develop clinical symptoms after five days [
 <xref rid="B96-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. One cat developed acute clinical disease while the other recovered. Virus was recovered from the tonsils and urine up to eight days post inoculation. While a very small sample size, and being aware that the experimental challenge dose is likely much higher than would be received in nature, this demonstrates that there is a potential risk of pets bringing the virus back into the EU. There is currently no quarantine regulation for third country pets, although the risk of bringing in pets from NiV and HeV areas is recognized by at least some MSs [
