<p>FaoStat databases contain details of volumes of trade between EU MSs and extra EU countries [
 <xref rid="B112-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. The EU has strong trade links with the NiV and MARV identified areas in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-02084-f002">Figure 2</xref>. While these databases show that there is little trade of pig products from NiV and MARV regions to the EU there is trade of fruit products (e.g., dates, apples, fruit juice). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-02084-f004">Figure 4</xref> shows the relative volume of trade of fruit products from these areas and EU MSs. The biggest importers from these areas are The Netherlands and the UK, with Germany having a relatively high volume from NiV areas and France from MARV areas. As with the human travel, it should be noted that some countries may act as hubs for trade products, with subsequent further distribution to other destinations.
