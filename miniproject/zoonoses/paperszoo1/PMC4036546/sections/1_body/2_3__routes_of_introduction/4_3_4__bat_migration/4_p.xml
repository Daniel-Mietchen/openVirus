<p>A review of data collected over 73 years from banding of some one million bats within Europe, provides information on which bats cross national borders [
 <xref rid="B145-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. These data suggest there are a number of European bat species which migrate seasonally in the range of a few hundred kilometers and four species that are considered long distance migrants (regularly 3000 to 4000 km in one return flight). The migration routes are generally limited to Europe, with the general trend from north-east to south-west Europe. However, there are data showing movements of 
 <italic>Nyctalus noctula</italic> from Russia into Bulgaria [
 <xref rid="B145-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>] and it is reported that 
 <italic>Pipistrellus nathusii</italic> killed in summer and autumn at German wind turbines originated from Estonia or Russia [
 <xref rid="B151-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. An occurrence of 
 <italic>Vespertilio murinus</italic> on a North Sea drilling rig confirmed that bats can fly across large bodies of sea [
 <xref rid="B152-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. This raises the question of whether migration of bats from Africa to Europe can occur, for example, across the Strait of Gibraltar. There have been studies in relation to the genetic diversity in Ibero-Moroccan bats, but this does not address the frequency of vagrant African bats flying from Morocco into southern Europe. Colonies of 
 <italic>R. aegyptiacus</italic>, known hosts of MARV, occur in Cyprus and southern Turkey. No banding studies have been done and existing knowledge is based on field observations in Europe [
 <xref rid="B145-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. In Cyprus, no long distance flights are known, but seasonal altitudinal shifts have been observed [
 <xref rid="B145-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>], which could alter contact rates with other bat species. Thus, despite the growing evidence on migration of bat species within Europe, there are no data to suggest whether migration of bats into Europe from NiV or MARV endemic areas (as outlined in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-02084-f002">Figure 2</xref>) could occur.
