<p>With regards to bat species and geographical areas relevant to NiV and MARV, in Congo a massive annual fruit bat migration takes place up the Lulua River with hunting of the bats by villagers. Direct exposure to the fruit bats may have led to an outbreak of EBOV in 2007 [
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Regular mass long-distance migrations have not been reported for 
 <italic>R. aegyptiacus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B147-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>] and a sedentary life history for 
 <italic>R. aegyptiacus</italic> is also supported by the morphological record [
 <xref rid="B148-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. In contrast, some 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> individuals migrate more than 1000 km [
 <xref rid="B145-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>], in some cases following the seasonal fluctuation in fruit abundance [
 <xref rid="B149-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. Thus, one study reported that that 16 out of 85 (22%) 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> (22%) were migratory, although 78% (69 of 85) were non-migratory [
 <xref rid="B150-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. The median travel distance of the non-migratory bats was 15 km (compared to 860 km for the migratory bats) and similar to the observed daily commuting distances of 
 <italic>R. aegyptiacus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B147-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. Based on available data and their own capture information, it was assumed that 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> has a core distribution in equatorial Africa, with migrations in the northern direction, e.g., Mauritania and Niger from May to September and towards the south e.g., Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Zambia during the months of October and December [
 <xref rid="B150-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. Thus, 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> from regions of Africa north of the Equator will generally migrate south in the autumn, away from Europe. There is no evidence to suggest that the return migration routes in the spring would take the bats north of the Sahara Desert or that bats that might accidentally fly north (instead of south) in the autumn and reach Europe.
