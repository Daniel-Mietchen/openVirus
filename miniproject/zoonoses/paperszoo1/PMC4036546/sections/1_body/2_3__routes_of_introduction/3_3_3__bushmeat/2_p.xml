<p>Hunting of wildlife for food is a widely distributed practice in many parts of the world and constitutes an important source of animal protein for some rural communities. One paper reported that 83.3% of households in Brazzaville, Congo consumed bushmeat [

Economic recession over the past 20 years has driven the commercialisation of bushmeat as a trade item; bushmeat now reaches the international markets as part of the $159 billion annual global wildlife trade. The commercial trade in bushmeat occurs across almost all of tropical Africa, Asia and the Neotropics, notably in the densely forested regions of West Africa [

 <xref rid="B125-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. The bushmeat markets across West Africa are nowadays dominated by small bodied, fast reproducing species such as rodents like the grasscutter (

 <xref rid="B126-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. There is little officially reported information on the use of bats as bushmeat, a review of 31 survey papers on bushmeat did not report anything on bats [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], but unofficial reports and eye witness accounts suggest it is not uncommon to see bats for sale in African markets. It is possible that bats do not follow a typical bushmeat commodity chain and amounts are therefore underestimated in standard bushmeat surveys [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Bats are often hunted for pre-arranged orders and regular customers rather than sale through wholesalers who may prefer to concentrate on larger animals with a higher value-to-weight ratio. One study estimates that 128,000 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> are sold each year in southern Ghana [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This involves a commodity chain stretching up to 400 km and involving multiple vendors.
