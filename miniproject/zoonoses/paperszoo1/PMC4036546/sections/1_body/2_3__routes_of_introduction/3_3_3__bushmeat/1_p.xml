<p>Bushmeat is a term used to capture a variety of raw, smoked or partially processed meat that originates from the hunting of a variety of wild animals, including bats. It is well documented that bushmeat is illegally imported into both Europe and the USA [

 <xref rid="B119-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>] and, as such, it could act as a conduit for pathogen spread. In a recent study, illegal bushmeat imported into the United States was found to contain retroviruses and/or herpesviruses [

 <xref rid="B120-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>] and in a survey on bushmeat in the USA, participants in a focus group considered bushmeat to be a wholesome healthy and safe alternative to commercially produced meat from a shop [

 <italic>R. aegyptiacus</italic> bats, MARV was not detected in muscle, brain or skin tissues collected after cardiac exsanguination [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This suggests that these tissues (including muscle) are not heavily infected, and that positive results in liver, spleen and kidney were not due to the presence of blood. If confirmed to be the case in naturally occurring infections, it could mitigate the risk of MARV infection from the consumption of bushmeat if internal organs are not eaten.
