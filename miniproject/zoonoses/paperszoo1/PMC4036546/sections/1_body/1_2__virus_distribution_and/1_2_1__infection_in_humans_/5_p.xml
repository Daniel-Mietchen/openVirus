 <bold>MARV</bold>: Since the 1967 outbreak of MARV in laboratory workers in Europe [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], outbreaks have been confined to sub-Saharan Africa, although there have been reported cases of individuals acquiring infection in Uganda and then travelling to the Netherlands [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and the USA [
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Human cases of filovirus infection in Africa have been associated with hunting fruit bats for meat and with entry to mines or caves where large populations of fruit bat species, such as 
 <italic>Rousettus aegyptiacus</italic>, are present [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. It has been suggested that human infection could be through exposure to the excretions from bats roosting in the caves [
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], although an experimental study on 
 <italic>R. aegyptiacus</italic> bats inoculated with the Hogan MARV strain (originally from the South Africa outbreak [
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]) did not detect virus in the faeces of infected bats [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. One study reported “working as a miner” as a significant risk factor for a positive antibody result to MARV, with 87% of the population who tested positive for Marburg antibodies working in the local gold mines [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. There has not been a direct food consumption transmission route reported for MARV, although index cases of filovirus infection have often had suspected contact with dead primates found in the forest, with exposure thought to occur during the butchering process [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and the hunting process, which may involve the use of shotguns, potentially causing spray of body tissue and fluids [
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].
