 <bold>NiV</bold>: Studies suggest that human outbreaks are linked to one of two distinct Nipah virus strains; NiV-Malaysia or NiV-Bangladesh [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The Malaysian strain emerged in 1998 with an outbreak in commercially farmed pigs, resulting in &gt;250 human cases reported in Malaysia and Singapore with a case-fatality rate approaching 40% [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. 
 <italic>Pteropus vampyrus</italic> and 
 <italic>Pteropus hypomelanus</italic> were subsequently identified as likely natural reservoir hosts for the virus [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In this instance, pigs were implicated as amplifier hosts with viral isolates from both sick pigs and humans showing identical nucleotide sequences [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The presence of large commercial pig farms with fruit trees in the vicinity meant that foraging bats could drop partially eaten fruit contaminated with NiV into pig farms. Pigs could then have access to this fruit and become infected with NiV [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Transmission was attributed to direct contact with infective excretions and secretions and viral spread among pig farms was due to movement of pigs [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. There were no reported incidences of human-human transmission and there have been no further acute human cases attributed to NiV-Malaysia since 1999, although relapsed and late onset cases have been reported [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Laws in Malaysia preventing fruit farming in pig farming areas may have prevented further NiV outbreaks. In contrast, there have been regular seasonal outbreaks of NiV-Bangladesh since its apparent emergence in 2001, predominantly in Bangladesh, although two outbreaks have also been reported in West Bengal, India, close to the border of Bangladesh [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Up to January 2014, there have been 304 reported human cases linked to NiV-Bangladesh with 232 deaths, giving a reported case fatality rate of 76% [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].This appears much higher than the case-fatality rate of NiV-Malaysia, although direct comparison may be complicated by various biases such as method of surveillance and reporting. While human-human transmission is considered a major pathway for human infection with this strain [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], studies in India and Bangladesh suggest the main risk factor is consumption of raw date palm sap [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Date palm sap is harvested from December through to March by cutting into the tree trunk and allowing the sap to flow overnight into an open clay pot [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Infrared camera studies have demonstrated that 
 <italic>P. giganteus</italic> bats frequently visit date palm sap trees and lick the sap during collection [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], potentially contaminating it with NiV from saliva and/or urine. Other reported risk factors for human infection include consumption of alcoholic beverages made from date palm sap [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], climbing trees and contact with other NiV infected patients [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] or animals [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. A recent study investigating the role of landscape factors in NiV spillover risk in Bangladesh [
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] found a significant correlation between NiV spillover and villages with higher human population density, more fragmented forest cover and 
 <italic>P. giganteus</italic> roost sites containing the tree species 
 <italic>Polyalithia longifolia</italic> or 
 <italic>Bombax ceiba.</italic>
