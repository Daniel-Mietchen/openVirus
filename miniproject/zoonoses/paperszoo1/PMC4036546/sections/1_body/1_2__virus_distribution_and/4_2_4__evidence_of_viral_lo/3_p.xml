 <bold>MARV</bold>: One study reported that no viraemia or presence of MARV RNA could be detected in various tissues collected from 
 <italic>R. aegyptiacus</italic> bats experimentally inoculated through oral or nasal routes [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], but subcutaneous and intraperitoneal inoculation resulted in high levels detected in plasma (10
 <sup>3</sup> to 10
 <sup>4</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL) for five to nine days post inoculation, with titres up to 10
 <sup>6.5</sup> and 10
 <sup>6.</sup>
 <sup>0</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/g in the liver and spleen respectively. Virus was also occasionally detected in lung, heart, kidney and salivary glands with loads up to 10
 <sup>5.6</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/g. Ranges for TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL of MARV in tissues of naturally-infected 
 <italic>R. aegyptiacus</italic> in Uganda have also been derived from a standard curve of diluted stock virus using Q-RT-PCR [
 <xref rid="B74-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. High values of 50,000–1,500,000 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL were obtained from liver, spleen and lung whilst values of 5–100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL were obtained from multiple tissues including blood and intestines.
