 <bold>NiV</bold>: While the studies mentioned previously demonstrate the likelihood of a continual reservoir of NiV in many countries, the actual prevalence of bats currently shedding virus may be very low. As such, data on viral load is limited. However, with the application of real-time PCR, henipavirus-related sequences ranging from 110 to 34,000 genome copies per 0.3 cm
 <sup>3</sup> and 1.8 Ã— 10
 <sup>6</sup> per mL of bat urine have been reported [
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Experimental studies have also been conducted in other animals. Titres of up to 10
 <sup>5</sup> pfu/mL from brain and basal turbinates and 10
 <sup>4</sup> pfu/mL from trachea swabs were obtained from NiV infected piglets [
 <xref rid="B96-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>], with lower levels found in lung and spleen and shedding peaks during the first week post inoculation. Titre data are also available for NiV strains from Bangladesh and Malaysia in experimentally infected rodents [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].
