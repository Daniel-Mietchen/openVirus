<p>Based on data gathered in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="viruses-06-02084-t001">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="viruses-06-02084-t002">Table 2</xref>, those countries of the world where there is evidence of recent NiV or MARV infection in humans or bats are highlighted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-02084-f002">Figure 2</xref>. We define that a country is positive for human infection only if it has had a reported human case in the last 10 years (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, since 2003). Such a period of time without a reported case suggests that while there may still be potential for a human case in the country itself, the risk of import to the EU is extremely low. Thus, Malaysia and Singapore are not considered positive for NiV and South Africa and Kenya are not considered positive for MARV. Given the issues regarding use of serological positive results as an indicator of current virus presence, we do not consider serological positive results alone to be an indication of current viral presence in bats for this analysis. Information from the IUCN red list website is used to determine the geographical range of those bat species known to have been naturally infected [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], as there is a potential for undetected viral presence in these countries. It can be seen that while recent human infections of both NiV and MARV appear to be limited in geographical range (the red areas in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-02084-f002">Figure 2</xref>), there are a number of countries where bats have been identified as having the virus, but no human infection has been reported. It is also noted that the full geographical range of these bat species is extensive and in the case of 
 <italic>R. aegyptiacus</italic> encroaches on the south-east boundary of Europe, although the range of 
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> bats is much further east. However, if species serologically positive for henipaviruses are considered then 
 <italic>M. daubentonii</italic> would be included and the geographical range would be much wider, encompassing Europe and Australia.
