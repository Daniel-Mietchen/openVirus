 <bold>MARV</bold>: Investigation of the 1975 outbreak of MARV in Germany suggested that the incubation period could be as much as nine days [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. An experimental study on the effects of MARV on the common marmoset (
 <italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic>) found that animals became febrile after 5–6 days [
 <xref rid="B102-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. An experimental study looking at MARV, Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) and Reston ebolavirus (REBOV), demonstrated survival for long periods in liquid media at both room temperature and 4 °C, with virus recoverable from glass and plastic surfaces over three weeks after the start of the experiment [
 <xref rid="B103-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Similar decay rates were found for MARV and ZEBOV, while REBOV had significantly better survival within an aerosol. Although data for survival of filoviruses on fruit are not available, a study looking at survival of poliovirus, simian rotavirus and feline calicivirus in the UK found prolonged periods of survival on fresh fruit and vegetable produce at refrigeration temperatures (4–8 °C), extending beyond the shelf life of the product [
 <xref rid="B104-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Survival at 22 °C was poorer, but some viruses remained viable for over a week. Removal of viruses using conventional chlorine washing could give more than 3 log
 <sub>10</sub> reduction, but was only &lt;1 log
 <sub>10</sub> for poliovirus. However, it should be noted that these are non-enveloped viruses, and may, therefore, have different survival properties to the enveloped filoviruses.
