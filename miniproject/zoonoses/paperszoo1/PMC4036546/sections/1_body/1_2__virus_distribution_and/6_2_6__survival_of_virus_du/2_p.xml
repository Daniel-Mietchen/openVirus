 <bold>NiV</bold>: The incubation period for NiV in humans has been reported to be as much as 10 days [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Surveillance in Bangladesh in 2013 found that among secondary cases, who had a single exposure to NiV, the delay between exposure to onset of illness ranged from 6–16 days, with a median incubation period of nine days [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The incubation period following a single intake of raw date palm sap to onset of illness varied between 2–12 days, with a median of seven days. A laboratory study on persistence of henipaviruses under various environmental conditions found that they were sensitive to pH, temperature and desiccation [
 <xref rid="B101-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. The study showed a 3–4 log
 <sub>10</sub> inactivation of henipaviruses in fruit juice (lychee, pawpaw and mango) over three to four days, although titres were still detectable after three days. There were also large variations in the half-life of the virus at different temperatures and pH values; e.g., in Mango flesh, the half-life of NiV was 0.2 hours for pH 3.5 at 37 °C but 30.3 hours for pH 5 at 22 °C. For the purpose of risk assessment it is the rate of inactivation which is important, rather than the limit of survival, which depends on the starting titre.
