 <bold>NiV</bold>: There is evidence of a seasonal pattern for spillover of NiV to humans; a review of all human outbreaks of NiV between 1998 and 2009 found that, except for the initial event in Malaysia, they all occurred in the first five months of the year [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. A longitudinal study in Thailand found the Bangladesh strain of NiV was dominant in the urine of 
 <italic>P. lylei</italic> bats, with highest recovery of RNA in May [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In two sites, the Bangladesh strain was almost exclusively detected between April and June while the Malaysian strain was found dispersed during December to June. Breeding of the bats (including mating and birthing) occurs in December to April, and may not be the only factor involved in bat transmission.
