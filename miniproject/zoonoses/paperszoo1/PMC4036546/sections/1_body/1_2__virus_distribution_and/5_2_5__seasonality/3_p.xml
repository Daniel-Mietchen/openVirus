<p>There is some evidence that pregnant and lactating 
 <italic>Pteropus scapulatus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. conspicillatus</italic> females had a significantly higher risk of HeV infection [
 <xref rid="B98-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,
 <xref rid="B100-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] resulting in a seasonal pattern due to seasonality of reproduction of these bats. A study on an orchard in New South Wales investigated the legal shooting of 
 <italic>Pteropus poliocephalus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], found that the majority of bats shot were female (ratio 1:1.75) and that 65% of these females were lactating. This suggests that pregnant and/or lactating females are more likely to be foraging for food and coming into contact with crops/orchards, which could not only be eaten by horses, but also could contribute to seasonality of human spillover for viruses such as NiV Bangladesh, for which oral transmission to humans through date palm sap is a route. The wild date palm produces sap seasonally from mid-October to mid-March and winter (December to early February) is the traditional date palm sap gathering season in Bangladesh. Outbreaks of NiV generally coincide with this season, appearing between December and May.
