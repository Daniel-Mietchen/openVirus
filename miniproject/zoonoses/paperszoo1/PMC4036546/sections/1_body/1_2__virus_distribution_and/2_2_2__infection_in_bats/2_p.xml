<p>There is a growing body of literature on the geographical distribution and range of NiV and MARV in animal species with particular reference to bats. A complicating factor in defining the range is that studies in bats typically report serological or RNA detection results, rather than detection of infectious virus. While a seropositive result is strong evidence of historical exposure to a virus, there may be cross reactivity with related viruses, precluding exact identification of the virus to which exposure has occurred, as seen for NiV and HeV in Australasia [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Detection of RNA demonstrates the presence of genetic material, but does not prove current presence of infectious virus. Additionally, there can be difficulties in using serological assays outside their original, validated scope, for example when an existing assay is used with samples from an alternative species [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Here, the absence of positive and negative control samples and “gold standard” diagnostic assays makes it hard to determine an appropriate cutoff point to distinguish between seropositive and seronegative individuals [
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. As such, positive identifications do not confirm active virus infection at the current time and, in some cases, could only be an indication of historical exposure to a related virus. In the absence of virus isolation or full genomic characterization, it cannot, therefore, be definitely confirmed whether the virus is currently present.
