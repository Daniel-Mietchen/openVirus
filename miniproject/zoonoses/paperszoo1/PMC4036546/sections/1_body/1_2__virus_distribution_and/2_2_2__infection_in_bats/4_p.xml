<p>While NiV is predominantly associated with Asia there is increasing evidence for the presence of related viruses in Africa. Paramyxovirus RNA related to HeV and NiV has been detected in Eidolon helvum bushmeat in the Republic of Congo [
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and in the faeces and urine from roosting 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> bats in Ghana [
 <xref rid="B61-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Viral concentrations were estimated to be low using RT-PCR assays [
 <xref rid="B61-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Other studies have identified henipavirus antibodies in 
 <italic>Eidolon dupreanum</italic> and 
 <italic>Pteropus rufus</italic> in Madagascar [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. A recent study combined genetic and serological analyses to determine the extent of connectivity among 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> populations across central Africa. Antibodies to henipaviruses were present in bats from all locations with henipavirus seroprevalences reported to be between 25%â€“85.7%, with an overall average of 41.6% [
 <xref rid="B71-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. However, the presence of infection on isolated islands suggested that large population size and connectivity may not be responsible for viral persistence. These studies do not confirm the specific presence of infectious NiV virus in bats in continental Africa and Madagascar, but they now constitute a reasonably substantial body of work, from a number of independent sources, which suggest increasingly strong evidence for the presence of henipaviruses in bats that have a geographical range outside of Asia and Oceania.
