 <xref ref-type="table" rid="viruses-06-02084-t001">Table 1</xref> shows a summary of reported testing for NiV in bat species. NiV is predominately associated with Asian fruit bats of the genus 
 <italic>Pteropus</italic>, which have been suggested as the natural reservoir for henipaviruses [
 <xref rid="B61-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Only a few studies have successfully isolated NiV virus from bats. Isolation has been reported from the urine of 
 <italic>P. vampyrus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B62-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and 
 <italic>P. hypomelanus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] in Malaysia and 
 <italic>P. lylei</italic> in Cambodia [
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], but at very low prevalence, with only 1/769 samples yielding a virus isolate in the Cambodia study. Such low prevalence could be a factor for the inability to isolate NiV in test samples of bats in other studies. RNA positive PCR results have been obtained for 
 <italic>P. vampyrus</italic> in Indonesia [
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and 
 <italic>P. lylei</italic> in Thailand [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], which identified both NiV-Malaysia and NiV-Bangladesh RNA sequences. NiV RNA has also been detected in 
 <italic>P. giganteus</italic> in India [
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] 
 <italic>and P. vampyrus</italic> and 
 <italic>Rousettus amplexicaudatus</italic> in East Timor [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Of particular interest to the EU is the identification of henipavirus antibodies in 
 <italic>Myotis daubentonii</italic> in China [
 <xref rid="B67-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], as this species is also found across much of Europe, although it should be noted that NiV specific RNA was not detected in this study and virus isolation was not attempted.
