<p>Bat-borne viruses with pandemic potential have been identified as the origin of a number of recent human disease outbreaks. Examples include the paramyxoviruses Nipah virus (NiV) in Malaysia and Bangladesh [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and Hendra virus (HeV) in Australia [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and the filoviruses Ebola (EBOV) and Marburg viruses (MARV) in Africa [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Bats have also been linked with the more recent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Nipah Virus, in particular, has been suggested to have pandemic potential as it is capable of limited human–human transmission and RNA viruses in general have particularly high mutation rates. A human-adapted strain of NiV, were it to emerge in Asia, could spread rapidly due to high population densities and global interconnectedness [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A large, and still increasing, number of different viruses have been isolated from bats, many of which are asymptomatic in the host and are closely related to human pathogens. These viruses have the potential for cross-species transmission (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, “spillover”) to other mammalian species, for example, MARV in monkeys [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and NiV in pigs [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and to directly or indirectly infect humans [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A recent paper describes the infection of a wildlife biologist with a novel paramyxovirus during a field trip to South Sudan and Uganda [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A recent study found that bats have, on average, significantly more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents, which are also known to host a large range of viruses [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Additionally, the authors estimated that viruses had a broader host range in bats, averaging 4.51 host species per virus. Bat-borne paramyxoviruses have been identified in various bat species across Africa, Australia, South America and Asia and recently the detection and characterization of paramyxoviruses in free-ranging European bats has also been reported [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Further to this, recent evidence places bats as tentative hosts at ancestral nodes to Paramyxoviridae and Pneumoviridae [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Bat species can have very broad geographic ranges [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and multiple species can share the same habitats and even roost sites [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Studies of 
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> bats in Australia and Asia found they could travel hundreds of kilometers between roosting sites with their home ranges extending across national boundaries and over sea [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].
