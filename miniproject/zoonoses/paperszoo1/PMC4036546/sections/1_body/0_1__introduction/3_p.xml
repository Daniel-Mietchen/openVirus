<p>While bats in the European Union (EU) are known to harbor zoonotic viruses that can be transmitted via close contact, such as the European bat Lyssaviruses 1 and 2 (EBLV1 and 2), there is currently no confirmation of the presence of viruses with pandemic potential in bats in the EU (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, at least capable of sustained humanâ€“human transmission). However, it is important to note that this should not be taken as proof of absence of such viruses, but rather that they have not been detected during surveillance of bat populations in the EU to date. Historically, the first reports of human MARV cases were in laboratory workers in Germany and Yugoslavia in 1967, through direct contact with blood from African green monkeys (

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Similarly, as of November 2013, 10 cases of MERS-CoV have been detected in Europe [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], several clusters of which represent chains of transmission in which the primary case had been infected in the Middle East. Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of similar viruses in EU bat populations, suggesting there is a risk of spillover of related viruses in the future. The first filovirus discovered in Europe that was not directly imported from an endemic area of Africa was Lloviu virus (LLOV), detected in dead insectivorous bats in massive bat die-offs in caves in Spain in 2002 [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Simultaneous bat die-offs were observed in Portugal and France, although a causal relationship between LLOV and mortality was not shown.
