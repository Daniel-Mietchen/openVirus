<p>Factors that affect the degree and rate of contact between animals and humans are important for spillover of any zoonotic emerging infectious disease. Most human outbreaks of bat-borne zoonotic diseases have been suggested to be as a consequence of human activities. For example, outbreaks of MARV in Africa have been linked to human contact with bat caves, for reasons such as mining operations [

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Deforestation has also led to bat colonies moving closer to areas inhabited by humans in search of food and roosting sites [

 <xref rid="B21-viruses-06-02084" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], in particular contact of 
 <italic>Pteropus giganteus</italic> bats with date palm sap producing trees in Bangladesh is considered a risk factor for human NiV infection [

The outbreak of NiV in Malaysia in 1998 was linked to infection of pigs via fruit bats and resulted in the culling of over one million pigs and the deaths of over 100 people [
