<p>that has been previously used in the paper outlining the TREBLE algorithm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and originates in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, this apparently natural statistic is substantially biased when the sampling times of sequences 
 <italic>i </italic>and 
 <italic>j </italic>are close. To be seen in the following derivation, this bias is the result of the time sampling error structure.
