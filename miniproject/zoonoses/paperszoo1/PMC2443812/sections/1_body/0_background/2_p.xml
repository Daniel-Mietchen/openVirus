<p>Systematic studies characterize the substitution process and substitution rate process of several classes of viral subtypes in, for example, Dengue, influenza subtype A, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the virus responsible for sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). For the last three viruses, a unique zoonotic transfer appears to co-occur with substantial changes in both the composition of nucleotides and amino acids as well as alterations in the rate of nucleotide substitution [
