<p>Precise estimates are sorely lacking for dating the emergence and divergence of viral subtypes. Improved estimates equip epidemiologists and virologists to begin to correlate these important establishing events with historical demographic changes, geographical invasions and zoonoses, the transferring of a virus from one host species to another [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. For example, archeological sequence data can furnish accurate dates and show that substantial genomic changes associate with geographical invasion and zoonosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Further, the recent availability of viral gene sequences sampled at a pace commensurate with their rate of nucleotide substitution vastly augments the ability to rigorously infer the time scale of phylogenies and hence determine the time of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for different viral types [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].
