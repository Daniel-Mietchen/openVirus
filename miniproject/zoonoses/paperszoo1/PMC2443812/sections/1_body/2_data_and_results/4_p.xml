<p>We now compare the results from pairwise rate estimates across subtypes A-H3N2 and B with those from application of the MCA to the same data. These results are summarized in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. Using the triplet method developed above, data from the hemagglutinin gene yields a pairwise rate of substitution between subtypes A-H3N2 and B,

 </sub>) ∈ {A-H3N2, B}, the date of divergence between the two subtypes is then 1905 (± 20) years. Under a molecular clock, the substitution rate for HA over both subtypes A-H3N2 and B is 3.10 (± 0.37) × 10
 <sup>-3 </sup>s/s/yr, implying a TMCRA at 1789 (± 12.5). A similar pattern emerges for the MP gene. The pairwise rate of substitution is 6.46 (± 1.31) × 10
 <sup>-3 </sup>s/s/yr, yielding a TMRCA at 1912 (± 18) years. The MCA rate of substitution is 2.13 (± 0.35) × 10
 <sup>-3 </sup>s/s/yr with a corresponding TMRCA of 1759 (± 15). Finally, for the NS gene, the pairwise rate of substitution is 7.95 (± 0.25) × 10
 <sup>-3 </sup>s/s/yr, leading to the TMRCA as 1902 (± 19) years. Under the MCA, the rate of substitution is 2.22 (± 0.38) × 10
 <sup>-3 </sup>s/s/yr with a corresponding TMCRA of 1777 (± 14). Summarizing these results, we find that the pairwise rate estimates are consistent in placing the TMRCA at approximately 1905 while the MCA rate estimates correspond to a TMRCA at approximately 1775. This discrepancy between the two sets of estimates of the TMRCA likely owes to the inability of the MCA to integrate information from the period of evolution between the two subtypes, leading to a substantial underestimate of the rate of substitution, and consequent underestimation of the date of the TMRCA.
