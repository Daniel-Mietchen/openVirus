<p>We demonstrate the advantage of our triplet estimator through analysis of influenza A-H3N2/B subtype divergence using the hemagglutinin (HA), matrix protein (MP) and non-structural (NS) genes. Each analysis is performed on 60 gene sequences constructed from 20 genomes each drawn from influenza subtypes A-H3N2, B and C. We download these data along with their dates of sampling from the Los Alamos Influenza Database [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We perform sequence alignment using ClustalX [24, version 1.8]. For consistency with previous studies of A-H3N2 HA evolution, we use the HKY model of nucleotide substitution [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We use the TREBLE algorithm, which implements a MCA, on sets of sequences solely drawn from a single subtype to derive within-subtype rates. The phylogenetic tree, generated by TREBLE, for the HA gene is depicted in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2(a)</xref>. We infer similar trees for the MP and NS genes. We calculate variances for both MCA and pairwise rate estimates using 200 bootstrap iterates. All dates are listed as years in the common era.
