<p>Consistent with previous studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], rates vary substantially both among genes and among subtypes. We record rates as a point estimate (± standard error). For the HA gene, subtype A-H3N2 shows a rate of nucleotide substitution of 3.21 (± 0.43) × 10
 <sup>-3</sup>s/s/yr. This rate is slightly lower than those recorded in previous studies although within the margin of error [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. For subtype B, the rate of nucleotide substitution is 2.31 (± 0.37) × 10
 <sup>-3</sup>s/s/yr, which is higher than previous estimates although also within the margin of error [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and for subtype C, the rate is 0.68 (± 0.18) × 10
 <sup>-3</sup>s/s/yr. For the MP gene, rates are generally lower than those for HA. The subtype A-H3N2 rate is 1.57 (± 0.38) × 10
 <sup>-4</sup>s/s/yr. The subtype B rate is 2.20 (± 0.48) × 10
 <sup>-3</sup>s/s/yr and the subtype C rate is 1.31 (± 0.33) × 10
 <sup>-3</sup>s/s/yr. Lastly, for the NS gene, the rates are similar to those of the MP gene. The subtype A-H3N2 rate is 2.14 (± 0.25) × 10
 <sup>-3</sup>s/s/yr, the subtype B rate is 1.92 (± 0.20) × 10
 <sup>-3</sup>s/s/yr, and the subtype C rate is 1.68 (± 0.51) × 10
 <sup>-3</sup>s/s/yr. Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> presents these results. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> provides histograms of the bootstrap distributions for all three genes and subtypes.
