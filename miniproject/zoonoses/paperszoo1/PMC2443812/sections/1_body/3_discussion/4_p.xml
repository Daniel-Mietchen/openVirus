<p>Assuming that the more recent estimate is correct, a subsequent question is whether or not a pandemic or epidemic associates with subtype A-H3N2/B divergence. In the twentieth century, all influenza pandemics associate with the emergence or reemergence of subtypes (A-H1N1 in 1918, A-H2N2 in 1957 and A-H3N2 in 1968). Serological analysis indicates that the 1897 pandemic was likely due to subtype A-H2N2. However, the pandemic of 1900 is of uncertain type, although it is commonly reported in the literature as being due to A-H3N2 [
