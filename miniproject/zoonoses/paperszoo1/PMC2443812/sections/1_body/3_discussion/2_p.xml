<p>For the divergence between subtypes A-H3N2 and B, previous studies using the MCA generally place a time of divergence of several hundred years ago, ranging from the 16th to early 19th centuries. Other analysis have yielded estimates of 3600 years ago [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In the current study, application of the MCA yielded estimates in the last half of the 18th century. However, applying the pairwise rate estimate developed above we find uniformly, across genes, that the divergence likely occurred in the very early 20th century. The discrepancy between these two measures is likely due to the increased modeling flexibility of the pairwise rate estimate relative to the MCA.
