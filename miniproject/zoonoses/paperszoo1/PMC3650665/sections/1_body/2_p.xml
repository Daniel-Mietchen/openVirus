<p>The H3N2 pandemic began in 1968 and was caused by a human-adapted H2N2 virus that obtained avian H3 and PB1 genes through reassortment
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The HA of both 1957 and 1968 pandemic strains are of avian origin. Unlike H2N2, the H3N2 subtype is still in circulation, however the high rate of antigenic drift of human H3 coupled with the long interval since the previous pandemic may mean that the human herd would have â€˜forgotten' the antigenic structure of the 1968 pandemic strain and therefore the reemergence of a similar strain circulating in the avian or swine reservoir could have potentially damaging consequences. Identifying such strains is of paramount value for pandemic surveillance and preparedness.
