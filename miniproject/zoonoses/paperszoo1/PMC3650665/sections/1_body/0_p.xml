<p>Influenza A viruses pose a major public health problem, causing seasonal epidemics and occasional—but devastating—global pandemics
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> which negatively impact the global economy. Until recently, influenza pandemics were thought to be associated with the introduction of new HA subtypes into the human population

The surface glycoprotein HA of the influenza A virus is the main target of the immune system and mutations on the globular head region (residues 50–230 of HA1, H3 HA numbering used) of this protein determine antigenic novelty, species adaptation, and transmission
