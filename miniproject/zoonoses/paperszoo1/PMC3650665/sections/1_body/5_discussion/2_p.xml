<p>The importance of glycosylation in antigenic site masking leading to a new pandemic cycle and viral evolution became apparent after the 2009 pandemic. It was observed that the seasonal H1N1 HA carries antigenic site-masking glycosylation sites not present in the 2009 pandemic H1N1 HA (and 1918 H1N1 HA) and the exposure of the unprotected antigenic surface is believed to be the reason underpinning the severity of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Akin to H1 subtype, the additional glycosylation sites on the recent seasonal H3 appear to have a role in antigenic site-masking. For instance, the glycosylation at position 63 masks antigenic site E, and glycosylation at sites 122, 133, and 144 protect antigenic A. The shielding nature of these glycosylation sites is evident from the gradual decline in the mutation rate of the masked antigenic sites following their appearance (

If a virus carrying a HA similar to the ones identified by this analysis makes its way into humans, it would need to evolve rapidly in response to selective pressures from vaccination and herd immunity. The ability of H3 subtype to add glycosylation sites will be a key factor enabling the virus to achieve sustained circulation in the next cycle. In contrast, a previous study

Taking these factors together, we assert that it is less likely for an avian or swine H2 virus (antigenically similar to 1957â€“58 pandemic H2N2) to gain a foothold for sustained circulation in humans when compared to H3 viruses.
