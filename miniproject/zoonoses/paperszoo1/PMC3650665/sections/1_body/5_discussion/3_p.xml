<p>The rapid antigenic drift that human H3N2 HA underwent during the early adaptation period of the virus (1968–76) appears to have slowed down after 1977 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Interestingly, this time period also coincides with the reemergence of H1N1 in the human population. The (re-) emerging H1N1 subtype could have imposed strong selective pressures on the H3N2 to stop circulating in humans after 1977. The evolution of human H3N2 HA after 1977 is characterized by glycosylation accrual, low-level site-specific antigenic changes, and variations at other non-immunodominant sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Additionally, a recent study found that the affinity of human H3 viruses for human receptors has reduced drastically since 2001
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. These observations suggest that currently circulating viruses are not as dominant as the earlier viruses. Based on this trend, one can argue that human H3N2 HA presently is “antigenically drained”, which poses a substantially high barrier to evolution via antigenic drift. However, the presence of antigenically intact H3 in avian and swine suggests that, as with 2009 H1N1 pandemic, reassortment can result in ‘resetting and shifting' the antigenicity back to that of the 1968 pandemic and hence facilitate sustained evolution of this subtype in humans.
