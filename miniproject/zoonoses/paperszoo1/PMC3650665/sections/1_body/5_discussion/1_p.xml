<p>The H3 HA of some of the recent avian strains share approximately 86% overall sequence identity with the HA of the avian progenitor of the 1968 pandemic virus (A/duck/Ukraine/1/1963), reflecting antigenic intactness within birds. Many sequences from swine, some collected as recently as 2001, were also found to have high homology with the A/duck/Ukraine/1/1963 HA, indicating avian to swine transfer. For reasons that remain unclear, the more recent swine H3 HAs (2006 and later) have diverged significantly from the 1968 pandemic H3N2 HA (

Unlike the 1918 H1N1 virus which crossed to swine soon after and remained in swine, the human H3N2 viruses have repeatedly crossed from humans to swine for some time â€“ quite possibly, this could be the reason why swine H3 viruses appear to manifest the antigenic drift that human strains underwent during this period. In fact, the AI values of human H3 in the last decade are comparable to the AI values of some swine H3 HAs of the same period; interestingly, the recent human and swine HAs show differential binding to polyclonal antibodies generated against seasonal vaccine strain (

This apparent discrepancy may be explained in part by the presence of certain key antigenic "hotspot" locations, where amino acid substitutions can lead to disproportionately large changes in antigenicity. Our observation is supported by other studies on H3 antigenic evolution
