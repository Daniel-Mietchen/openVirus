<p>To address this question in this study we measure the â€˜antigenic intactness' of HA from avian or swine species in reference to HA from the corresponding pandemic subtypes. The antigenic identity (AI) of an avian or a swine HA is defined by the percentage fraction of amino acids in the immunodominant antigenic sites that are conserved in the corresponding pandemic HA (H1, H2 and H3 subtype). The AI value varies between 0 and 100. Values closer to 100 indicate a high antigenic identity with the pandemic HA.</p>
