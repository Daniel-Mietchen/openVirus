<p>Birds are natural reservoirs for influenza A viruses and avian-adapted viruses either directly crossover to humans (through direct contact) or do so with the help of intermediate swine species. Influenza A viruses rapidly evolve (through antigenic drift) in humans as a consequence of both the complex response of human immune system and rapid geographical movement of human population. In contrast to their rapid antigenic evolution in human hosts, the antigenic evolution of influenza A viruses in avian and swine occurs at a much slower rate

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. As a consequence of these factors, the human immunity to past pandemic strains fades over time, thus enabling antigenically “intact” viruses in avian and swine species to reemerge and begin a new infection cycle in humans. For example, although H2N2 subtype does not currently circulate in the human population, viruses carrying HA that are antigenically similar to the 1957–58 pandemic H2N2 virus continue to circulate in avian species
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Among the subtypes that continue to circulate in humans (H1N1 and H3N2), the 2009 H1N1 outbreak offers a practical example of how HA from a swine strain that is antigenically similar to 1918 pandemic H1N1 HA can be reintroduced into the human population
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. The question remains of whether this trend is observed in H3N2, given that there has been a high rate of antigenic drift in human H3 subtype
