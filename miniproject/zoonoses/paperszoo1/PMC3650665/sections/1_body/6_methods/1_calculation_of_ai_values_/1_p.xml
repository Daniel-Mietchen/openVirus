<p>AI values were calculated using the characterized antigenic sites of H1, H2 and H3 HA. For H1, 128, 129, 158, 160, 162, 163, 165, 166, 167 (Sa); 156, 159, 192, 193, 196, 198 (Sb); 140, 143, 145, 169, 173, 182, 207, 224, 225, 240, 273 (Ca); 78, 79, 81, 82, 83, 122 (Cb) were used. For H2, 162, 248 (I-A); 137, 187 (I-B); 131, 222, 218 (I-C), 80, 200 (I-D); 40 (II-A), 273 (II-B) were used. For H3, 122, 133, 137, 143, 144, 145, 146 (A); 155, 186, 188, 189, 193 (B); 53, 54, 275, 278 (C); 201, 205, 207, 208, 217, 220 (D); 62,78,81,83 (E) were used. Positions are numbered according to H3 molecule. The antigenic identity (AI) of an avian or a swine HA is defined by the percentage fraction of amino acids in the dominant antigenic sites that are conserved in the corresponding pandemic HA for each of the H1 (A/South Carolina/1/18), H2 (A/Albany/6/58(H2N2)) and H3 (A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2)) subtypes.</p>
