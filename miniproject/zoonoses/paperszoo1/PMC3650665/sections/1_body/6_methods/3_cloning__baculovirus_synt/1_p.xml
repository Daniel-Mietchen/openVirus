<p>Soluble versions (lacking membrane proximal C-terminus region) of HA from representative H3N2 swine isolates A/swine/Chonburi/05CB2/2005 and A/swine/Nakhon pathom/NIAH586-2/2005 were recombinantly expressed (with C-terminal His-tag) as described previously
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. These representative H3 HAs had high AI values and the prototypic Leu226 and Ser228 residues characteristic of human-adapted H3 HAs. Briefly, recombinant baculoviruses with the HA gene were used to infect (MOI = 1) suspension cultures of Sf9 cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) cultured in BD Baculogold Max-XP SFM (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The infection was monitored and the conditioned media was harvested 3â€“4 days post-infection. The soluble HA from the harvested conditioned media was purified using Nickel affinity chromatography (HisTrap HP columns, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Eluting fractions containing HA were pooled, concentrated and buffer exchanged into 1X PBS pH 8.0 (Gibco) using 100K MWCO spin columns (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The purified protein was quantified using BCA method (Pierce).
