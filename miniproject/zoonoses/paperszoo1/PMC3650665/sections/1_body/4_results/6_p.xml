<p>The analyses presented here portend a vaccine strategy to prevent a future H3 pandemic. Among the WHO recommended vaccine strains of influenza A/H3N2 virus, A/Hong Kong/1/1968(H3N2) will be effective (AI &gt; 80%) against 505 of 581 strains (~ 87%) identified by this study, and thus could be used for the development of pandemic influenza vaccine. Surprisingly, H3N2 vaccine strains that were subsequently used are not capable of being as effective. These data suggest that a cocktail of A/Hong Kong/1/1968(H3N2) and an avian and swine strain each that represent the circulating influenza in birds and pigs can form the components of the pandemic influenza vaccine.</p>
