<p>We first applied the AI metric to human-adapted H1N1 and avian H2 subtypes for two reasons. In the former case, we tested the ability of AI values to discriminate the 1918 and 2009 pandemic HAs from the seasonal strains. In the latter case, we validated AI's potential to highlight the conservation of antigenic sites in avian H2

 <bold>Methods</bold>). The AI values clearly discriminate the reemerging swine-origin HA of 2009 H1N1 pandemic from the seasonal H1 based on the antigenic identity to the 1918 pandemic H1N1 HA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The reemerging swine-origin HA of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and those that circulated during the 1918–40 period are characterized by AI values &gt; 70% and markedly differ from the strains that circulated during 1940–2008 (varies from 48% to 77% with an average of 55%). Two ‘classical' swine viruses (data points marked by black arrows), A/New Jersey/76 (H1N1) and A/Wisconsin/4754/1994 (H1N1), isolated between 1940–2008, also have high AI value and are genetically distinct when compared to the main cluster of human influenza viruses circulating in that period. Both viruses are known to have caused human infections following pig-human interspecies transmission. The A/New Jersey/76 influenza virus is reported to have caused respiratory illness in 13 soldiers with 1 death at Fort Dix, New Jersey

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. For the H2 subtype, the HA of the avian H2 strains were compared to the 1957–58 pandemic H2N2 HA (A/Albany/6/58(H2N2)) and the antigenic sites I-A, I-B, I-C, I-D, II-A and II-B
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> characterized by hybridoma antibodies generated in BALB/c mice were used to calculate AI. Consistent with the findings of a previous report
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, the AI values indicate that the antigenic sites of the 1957–58 pandemic H2N2 HA are conserved in circulating avian H2 influenza viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>
 <bold>).</bold> In fact, the antigenic sites of the majority of avian H2 viruses in circulation are 100% identical to the 1957–58 pandemic H2N2 HA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). The conservation of antigenic sites in swine H2 influenza could not be assessed using this method due to lack of sequence information (H2N2 viruses do not circulate in swine; indeed, infection of swine with H2 viruses is rarely recorded). Similar to H1 subtype, the evolution of human H2 is characterized by steady antigenic drift leaning away from the pandemic strain. Although the majority of the viral strains that circulated during the immediate post-pandemic period 1957–68 have AI values &gt; 70%, viral strains with AI ~ 60% appeared after 1967 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). It is reasonable to expect that the AI values would have decreased further had H2 continued to circulate in human population as a seasonal virus after 1968. The above analyses using H1 and H2 subtypes suggest that viruses carrying pandemic HA-like genes can be distinguished from seasonal viruses using a cutoff value AI ~ 70%.
