<p>If a virus carrying a HA similar to any one of the 581 sequences acquires the potential to crossover into humans, it would likely have a major impact on both immune recognition and vaccine efficacy. The efficacy of the influenza vaccine in humans is thought to correlate well with the â€˜antigenic relatedness' metric (reciprocal of antigenic distance) obtained from ferret antisera hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assays
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> between the vaccine strain and the circulating epidemic strains
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. We tested the degree of correlation between the AI values and the HI-derived antigenic relatedness to: (1) assess the potential of AI in predicting vaccine-induced cross-reactive antibody responses; and (2) to evaluate the cross-protective capacity of the current vaccine strain, A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2), against potential threats. For this exercise, we analyzed three sets of ferret serum HI cross-reactivity data where amino acid sequences of the HA1 polypeptide were present. The first set contained 7 viral strains (21 pairwise comparisons) isolated from 2008 to 2010
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. The second set contained 9 viral strains (36 pairwise comparisons) isolated from 1970 to 1979
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. The third set contained 6 viral strains (15 pairwise comparisons) isolated from 1994 to 1999
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Antigenic relatedness between two viral strains based on ferret anti-serum was determined using the method described by Lee et al.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Briefly, the antigenic relatedness between two viral strains is directly proportional to the ratio of the product of the heterologous titers against each other to the product of the homologous titers. In total, 72 pairwise comparisons among 22 viruses were available for analysis. Among the 72 pairwise comparisons, 5 (7%) have an antigenic relatedness &gt; 70% (i.e., similar antigenicity), and 67 (93%) have an antigenic relatedness &lt; 70% (i.e., antigenic variant). Results indicate that the AI values have significant correlation with the HI-based antigenic relatedness metric (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Tables 1</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">2</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">3</xref>), indicating that AI values could be applied to predict vaccine-induced cross-reactive antibody responses and thus selection of vaccine strains. Particularly, antigenically related viral strains (&gt; 70%) have AI &gt; 80%, hence we employed an 80% cutoff to determine protection, or lack thereof, between a vaccine strain and a challenge viral strain. The current H3N2 vaccine strain A/Victoria/361/2011 has AI values of 92% with the seasonal viral strain A/Brisbane/10/2007, 29% with the A/Aichi/2/68, 56% with a typical H3N2 SOIV and 44% with a representative swine H3 strain from the group of swine viral strains having AI &gt; 49%. These data indicate that the current vaccine strain is unlikely to offer cross-protection against the circulating swine or SOIV viruses whatsoever. Supporting this, IgG polyclonal raised in rabbit with seasonal vaccine H3 strain (A/Brisbane/10/2007(H3N2)) preferentially bind to current seasonal H3 but have weaker affinity to a representative swine H3 (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. We recombinantly expressed HA derived from two swine isolates, A/swine/Chonburi/05CB2/2005 (H3N2) and A/swine/Nakhon pathom/NIAH586-2/2005 (H3N2), which have high AI value (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4">Table 4</xref>) and characterized their relative binding affinities to representative avian and human receptors on a glycan array platform (
 <bold>Methods</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Both swine HAs showed high affinity binding to both human and avian receptors. The high affinity human receptor-binding of these swine HAs appears to be in the same range as that of other seasonal H3 HAs characterized previously
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, and are thus capable of entering the human population either directly or via reassortment. The antigenic relationship of these HAs (AI value and glycosylation pattern) to the pandemic 1968 H3N2 HA strongly suggests that the six isolates belong to swine virus lineage and not examples of transient reverse zoonoses. Phylogenetic analysis of the 32 swine isolates revealed that majority of them fall under European and Asian swine lineages.
