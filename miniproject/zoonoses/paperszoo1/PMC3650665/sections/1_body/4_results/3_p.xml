<p>In addition to the amino acids that constitute the antigenic sites, the attachment of complex glycans at specific glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Asn-X-Thr, where X is not a Proline) is also often part of the antigenic surface. An increase or decrease in the number of N-glycosylation sites therefore critically governs the antigenic properties of HA
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. The 1968 pandemic H3 HA carries only two glycosylation sites on the globular head region (at 81 &amp; 165), whereas HA from seasonal strains carries an average of six sites (at 63, 122, 126, 133, 144, 165)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. To incorporate glycosylation in the calculation of antigenic identity, the globular head region of the avian and swine HA sequences were examined for the conservation of 1968 pandemic H3-like glycosylation pattern (
 <bold>Methods</bold>). Among the 1,103 avian and swine H3 HA sequences, 359 carried additional glycosylation sites or positional shifts and therefore were removed from further consideration. The remaining 744 HA sequences (~ 67%) were found to possess the 1968 pandemic HA-like glycosylation pattern. Out of the 744 HA sequences, strains corresponding to 449 sequences (all avian) were isolated after 2000—many as recently as 2010—and their AI value exceed 70%.
