<p>To understand the results from AI calculations in the context of the spatial relationship between glycosylation site and antigenic sites of H3 HA we constructed structural homology models of HA1 globular head of ACHI68, BRBN07 and CHIB05 HAs (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4">Table 4</xref> for strain information). These structural models of HA comprised the basic trimannosyl core of N-linked glycan attached to the glycosylation sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). From the structural comparison it is clear that antigenic shape of HA which includes antigenic sites A-E and the glycosylation pattern of HA1 from the swine strain (CHIB05) closely resembles that of the 1968 pandemic HA. Conversely, the antigenic shape of a more recent seasonal strain (BRBN07) is remarkably different from that of the pandemic strain.
