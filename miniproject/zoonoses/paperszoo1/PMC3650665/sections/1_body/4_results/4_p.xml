<p>Extrapolating from H1 and H2 pandemic scenarios, the above strains are likely to pose a threat should they acquire the mutations necessary to crossover into human population. Of note, a novel H3N8 avian influenza virus acquired the ability to infect harbor seals in New England recently
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The AI of the seal H3N8 HA is 78%, which is the habitual AI range of avian H3 influenza viruses. Given the high AI value, the history of the spread of avian influenza to humans and the fact that seal H3N8 has already acquired potential to bind sialic acid receptors that are commonly found in the mammalian respiratory tract
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, seal H3N8 virus could jump, directly or via reassortment, to humans with pandemic consequences. More recently, the CDC reported the outbreak of a triple reassortant H3N2 swine-origin influenza virus (SOIV) and released a set of sequences at Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) following this event. The HA of a prototype outbreak strain, A/Minnesota/11/2010 (referred as Minn10), shares very high homology (approx. 98%) with the HA of swine A/swine/Minnesota/7931/2007(H3N2) (SwMinn10), and has good binding and transmission properties
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Although the AI value of SwMinn10 (approx. 39%) is comparable to that of a typical seasonal H3 HA, they share very low antigenic identity between them (only 15 out of the 27 [approx. 55%] antigenic positions are conserved). More importantly, the glycosylation pattern appears to be very different between SwMinn10 and seasonal H3 HA. The SwMinn10 HA contains only three glycosylation sites in the globular head region, compared to 6 for the seasonal HA. The swine predecessor was not part of the 581 sequences identified by the analysis. This is due to its low AI value and the extra (third) glycosylation site in the head region. Although Minn10 cannot be regarded as a strain resembling the 1968 pandemic strain, the outbreak caused by this virus supports our theory that avian and swine strains that are divergent enough from the seasonal HA, both antigenically and with respect to their glycosylation pattern, need to be considered as potential threats. Consequently, based on the above observations, we relaxed the criteria used to identify potential pandemic strains and considered those HAs isolated after 2000, having matching glycosylation pattern as pandemic H3 and whose AI was equal to or greater than 49%, the maximum AI value of recent seasonal H3 (2000 or after) (
