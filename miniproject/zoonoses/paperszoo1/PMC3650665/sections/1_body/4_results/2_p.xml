<p>In the case of H3, the 5 antigenic sites (Aâ€“E)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> were used to calculate AI in reference to the prototypic pandemic strain of 1968 (A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2)). Unless stated otherwise henceforth an AI value for a given H3 HA sequence refers to its antigenic identity with the 1968 pandemic H3 HA. A total of 1,103 H3 avian and swine sequences were downloaded from the NCBI Influenza Database
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> and analyzed. Of these 1,103 sequences, 756 were of avian origin and 347 were of swine origin. The avian sequences comprised nine different subtypes (H3N1-9), and the swine sequences comprised four different subtypes (H3N1, H3N2, H3N3 and H3N8). The avian and swine H3 amino acid sequences were compared against A/Aichi/2/1968 and AI values were computed for all the sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). In addition, a total of 3,632 human-adapted H3N2 HA sequences were downloaded from the NCBI database and compared against 1968 pandemic H3 HA to enable a cross-species comparison of the antigenic drift (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The AI values and phylogeny analysis indicate that, in comparison with recent human H3, avian and swine H3 are genetically and antigenically closer to the 1968 pandemic HA. Thus, we confirmed that avian and swine H3 are indeed antigenically intact (
