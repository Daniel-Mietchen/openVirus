  <title>Glycan microarray analysis of representative H3 HAs.</title>
  <p>Dose dependent binding of A/swine/Nakhon pathom/NIAH586-2/2005 (a), and A/swine/Chonburi/05CB2/2005 (b) HAs to representative avian and human glycan receptors on the glycan array platform is shown. Both these HAs show high affinity binding to both human receptors (6′SLN-LN) and avian receptors (3′SLN-LN and 3′SLN-LN-LN).</p>
