  <title>Trends in antigenic evolution over time.</title>
  <p>Antigenic identity of HA from human, avian and swine species relative to pandemics that of note: (a) 1918–19 H1N1, (b) 1957–58 H2N2, (c) 1968–69 H3N2 plotted against time of isolation (x-axis). To generate the plots, 2, 927 human, 166 avian, 950 swine HAs of H1 subtype; 117 human and 163 avian HAs of H2 subtype; 3,632 human, 756 avian and 347 swine HAs of H3 subtype were used. The two black arrows in Fig. 1a correspond to A/New Jersey/76 (H1N1) and A/Wisconsin/4754/1994 (H1N1), both of which caused human infections following pig-human interspecies transmission and have high AI values similar to the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strains. Dotted trendlines are added to graphically display the antigenic drift in avian vs. human H2 (Fig. 1b). The slope of the avian H2 trendline is 0.0845, whereas the slope of the human H2 trendline is −1.866. The dotted horizontal line indicates cutoff AI values (70% (H1); 70% (H2); 70% &amp; 49% (H3)).The data points were jittered slightly on y-axis to avoid large overlaps (AI ~ AI + ε, where −1&lt; ε &lt;1).</p>
