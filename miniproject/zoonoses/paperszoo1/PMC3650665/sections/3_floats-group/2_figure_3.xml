  <title>Genetic, antigenic and glycosylation-pattern relatedness of 1968 pandemic H3N2 HA to seasonal, swine and avian H3 HA.</title>
  <p>(a) Sequence alignment of the expanded globular head region (residues 50–328) of the HAs listed in 
   <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4">Table 4</xref>. Antigenic sites A, B, C, D, E of H3 HA are highlighted in green, magenta, cyan, grey and yellow, respectively. In each sequence, the Asn residue associated with the N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Asn-X/Thr) is marked in red. (b) Surface rendered three-dimensional structural models of trimeric HA1 globular head of representative pandemic (
   <italic>middle</italic>), seasonal (
   <italic>right</italic>) and swine (
   <italic>left</italic>) HAs. The view of trimer is along axis perpendicular to 3-fold symmetry axis to give a complete picture of the antigenic and glycosylation sites. The homology models of HA1 chain were generated using SWISS-MODEL automated modeling server (
   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://swissmodel.expasy.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://swissmodel.expasy.org/</ext-link>) and the trimannosyl N-linked glycosylation at the sites were added in silico using GlyProt server (
   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.glycosciences.de/modeling/glyprot/php/main.php" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.glycosciences.de/modeling/glyprot/php/main.php</ext-link>). The trimeric HA1 was generated by superimposing three copies of homology-modeled glycosylated monomer with corresponding monomers in the trimer crystal structure (PDB ID: 1HGE). The antigenic sites A–E are marked on the structure. With 1968 pandemic HA as reference (antigenic sites shown in 
   <italic>red</italic>), the structural similarity of the antigenic sites in seasonal and swine HAs to the reference HA is shown in different shades of red (
   <italic>duller</italic> shade representing low similarity to 
   <italic>brighter</italic> shade representing high similarity).
