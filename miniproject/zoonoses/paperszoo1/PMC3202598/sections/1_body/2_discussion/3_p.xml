 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> was estimated, based on the assumption that there is only one 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> that is common to all flocks. However, in the field a number of factors can result in differences among flocks. First of all, there are differences between LPAI virus strains 
 <xref rid="pone.0026935-vanderGoot1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0026935-Gonzales1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, such as the amount of virus excreted by infected birds and the minimum infectious dose 
 <xref rid="pone.0026935-Capua1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Furthermore, we should also consider the differences in the characteristics of the farms and the age of the birds when the outbreak occurs. For example, the density of birds, which is mainly related to the birds' size and thus their age, can affect the contact rate among animals. Moreover, the time at which the virus enters a flock may instead influence the infectivity and/or susceptibility of the birds, which is related to their age, immunological competence and eventual stress due to intensive production cycles. Our approach took into account this variability by modelling 
 <italic>R
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic> as a probability distribution and thus allowing the transmission dynamics to vary from flock to flock. Furthermore, in our model, the sensitivity of the test was estimated together with 
 <italic>R
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic>, and the median sensitivity was 97.6%, which is fairly close to the sensitivity suggested by laboratory experience (98%). Uncertainty about test performance allowed us to better account for the fact that data came from a serosurveillance program, whose results depend on the true infectious status of the flock, the sampling scheme and the accuracy of the diagnostic assays.
