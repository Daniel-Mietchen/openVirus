<p>The simulations showed that the finding of seropositive birds does not necessarily mean that the flock is no longer infective: 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0026935-t006">Table 6</xref> shows that at the epidemic peak about 50% of the turkeys were infected, yet that 16% to 28% of the turkeys were already seropositive, indicating a period of overlap where both antigen and antibodies are detectable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026935-g003">Figure 3</xref>, grey lines). This implies that seropositive flocks may still pose a risk for other flocks; thus the enforcement of appropriate restrictions, the culling of seropositive flocks or pre-emptive slaughtering may be useful in preventing farm-to-farm transmission. On the other hand, sero-sampling for early disease detection may be difficult, because the time by which a serological sample of 10 turkeys would result in detection with 50% probability (
