<p>In our experimental data, a positive PCR result indicated the presence of viral genome in faeces, which may not be sufficient for replication and the infection of new hosts, possibly resulting in an overestimate of the length of the infectious period. For this reason, we also estimated the infectious period using the results of virus isolation assay, to assess the effect on the predicted outbreak dynamics. In fact, a positive virus isolation implies that the virus can replicate and may thus better reflect infectivity. The difference between the two tests can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0026935-t003">Table 3:</xref> for example, bird k13 tested positive to PCR from day 3 to day 15 (dataset A) but showed a detectable amount of virus only starting from day 12 (dataset B). Thus, based on virus isolation, the latent period would be longer and the infectious period shorter. However, the difference in terms of mean generation time was small: 7.9 and 10.1 days for PCR and virus isolation results, respectively. The comparison of the prevalence between the two datasets is unfair because it is based on different diagnostic tests and assumptions regarding infectivity. The important difference lies in the timing of the peak prevalence and the increase in seroprevalence, which were rather similar when comparing PCR and virus isolation data (
