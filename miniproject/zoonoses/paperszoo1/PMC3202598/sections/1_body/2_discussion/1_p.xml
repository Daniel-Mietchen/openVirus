<p>In this study, we provide quantitative information on key epidemiological parameters of LPAI dynamics in turkeys, which is the first time that this has been done using outbreak data. We first estimated the basic reproduction number of LPAI infections using the final size equation. To do so, some conditions had to be met. First, the data had to refer to a single population with homogeneous mixing. Because data from farms with multiple sheds were not stratified by shed, only the flocks consisting of a single shed were included in the analyses. Second, the seroprevalence in the samples needed to be representative of the entire flock, so that the seroprevalence in each sample could be considered to have a binomial distribution depending on the final size and the sample size. In accordance with the surveillance plan, sampled animals were randomly selected within each flock. Third, the outbreaks in the flocks had to have ended (i.e., no virus should have still been circulating). For this reason we included only flocks with negative virus tests Â±5 days from the day of serological positivity. The validity of this inclusion criterion was indicated by the lower seroprevalence in virus-positive flocks, although absolute certainty about the final size status of the flocks can never be obtained. If a virus had still been circulating in some flocks, the
