<p>Based on these assumptions, the estimated mean within-flock 
 <italic>R
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic> in the population of infected flocks was 5.5, meaning that on average an infectious bird would infect more than five susceptible animals. In an experimental study of van der Goot et al. (2003) 
 <xref rid="pone.0026935-vanderGoot1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, estimates of 
 <italic>R
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic> for LPAI H5N2 in chickens were much lower, ranging from 0.6 to 1.2. On the other hand, Gonzales et al. (2011) 
 <xref rid="pone.0026935-Gonzales1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> recently estimated 
 <italic>R
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic> for LPAI H7N1 in experimentally infected chickens to be about 4.0, demonstrating a high variability in virus transmission among different strains. Another possible explanation for the difference between our results and the estimates reported in literature could be due to differences in susceptibility between chickens and turkeys, which has been reported in comparative experimental studies 
 <xref rid="pone.0026935-Tumpey1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0026935-Dundon1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> that show that turkeys are highly susceptible to LPAI infections and that chickens are less susceptible. Lastly, the difference could also be due to differences between experimental and field conditions, as reported by Bos et al. (2010) 
 <xref rid="pone.0026935-Bos2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> for HPAI; in particular, whereas experiments take place under controlled settings, in field conditions other factors can enhance transmission, such as concurrent infections, climatic and environmental factors, and factors related to management.
