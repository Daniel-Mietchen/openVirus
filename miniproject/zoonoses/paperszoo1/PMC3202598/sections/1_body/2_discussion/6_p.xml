<p>The comparison of the three simulation models showed that the variation in 
 <italic>R
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic> among flocks plays an important role in the variation among outbreaks (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0026935-t006">Tables 6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0026935-t007">7</xref>). In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026935-g002">Figure 2</xref>, it appears that model 1, which only accounts for differences due to the stochastic process, resulted in only a limited variability in the timing of the epidemic peak (median: 43 days, 95%PCI: 39–51). Adding uncertainty related to possible variation of 
 <italic>R
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic> among flocks (model 2) resulted in a similar median estimate (45 days), yet it remarkably increased the variation (95%PCI: 28–164), as demonstrated by the much flatter density distribution of the parameter. The inclusion of further uncertainty about the parameter estimates (model 3) led to an additional widening of the interval (95%PCI: 17–235), but the difference was limited extent when compared to model 2. (

 <italic>R
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic> in the population of infected flocks are sufficiently precise, though we cannot overlook the variation in 
 <italic>R
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic> among flocks, which seems to play the most important role in the variation among infected premises.
