<p>To investigate the within-flock dynamics of LPAI viruses, we needed to know the temporal window of infectivity, defined by the mean lengths of the latent and infectious periods. Because this information was unavailable from field data, we based our estimates on earlier experimental infections with the outbreak strains. The infection status of single birds was tested by means of both PCR and virus isolation assays. If PCR results reflect infectivity (default), the infectious period of 8.2 days would be longer than that reported for chickens: 4.5 to 7.7 days for LPAI
