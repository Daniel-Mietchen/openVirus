<p>Although influenza viruses have been extensively studied, the current knowledge on the mechanisms of mutation from LPAI to HPAI is insufficient for predicting which H5 or H7 strains will mutate into an HPAI strain. Moreover, given that the molecular changes necessary for the change in virulence seem to occur at random 
 <xref rid="pone.0026935-Alexander2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, the probability that an LPAI strain will mutate into an HPAI strain depends on the extent of viral replication, which in turn is associated with the number of birds that acquire infection. Hence knowledge of the disease dynamics of LPAI viruses is important for better understanding their reversion to virulence. This knowledge can also contribute to optimizing surveillance systems and improving the effectiveness of control measures for reducing transmission and thus the number of virus replicates, reducing the probability of mutation into HPAI viruses.
