<p>Studies conducted on the disease dynamics of LPAI viruses under experimental conditions have provided rough estimates of the parameters of bird-to-bird transmission for a H5N2 LPAI 
 <xref rid="pone.0026935-vanderGoot1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and a H7N1 LPAI 
 <xref rid="pone.0026935-Gonzales1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> virus strains. For instance, the basic reproduction number (

 <sub>0</sub>), which is defined as the mean number of secondary cases per primary case in a susceptible population 
 <xref rid="pone.0026935-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and is a key epidemiological parameter, was estimated to be between 0.6 and 4.0. However, in experimental conditions it is impossible to assess the variability in transmission that occurs among flocks in field conditions. Using outbreak data, the transmission dynamics of HPAI strains have been studied by applying compartmental models and using mortality data to extrapolate the moment of virus introduction 
 <xref rid="pone.0026935-Tiensin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0026935-Bos1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, for LPAI epidemics, such data cannot be used because infections result in only mild symptoms and low mortality rates.
