<p>In the period 2000â€“2005, Italy experienced four epidemics of LPAI, all of which occurred in the north and most of which involved meat turkeys. In the present study, we used serosurveillance data from these epidemics 
 <xref rid="pone.0026935-Comin1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> to estimate the 
 <italic>R
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic> of LPAI in turkeys; this is the first time that field data have been used to evaluate the transmission dynamics of LPAI. We fitted the proportions of birds ultimately infected in 36 flocks into a hierarchical model to estimate 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and the possible variation in 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> among flocks caused by differences among farms. To obtain a more complete picture of LPAI transmission, we used experimental infection data with outbreak strains to estimate the distributions of the latent and infectious periods. These were then combined with the 
 <italic>R
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic> to simulate LPAI outbreaks, characterise the resulting dynamics, and discuss the implications for surveillance.
