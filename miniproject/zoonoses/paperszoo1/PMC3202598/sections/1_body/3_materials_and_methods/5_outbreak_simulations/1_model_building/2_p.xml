<p>The simulated outbreaks were summarized by calculating six descriptive statistics: the time of the epidemic peak 
 <italic>T
  <sub>peak</sub>
 </italic>, the peak number of infective birds 
 <italic>I
  <sub>peak</sub>
 </italic>, the seroprevalence at the epidemic peak 
 <italic>R
  <sub>peak</sub>
 </italic>, the seroprevalence at the end of the outbreak 
 <italic>R
  <sub>final</sub>
 </italic>, the time interval during which the mid-90% of the cases occur (90% incidence interval) 
 <italic>D
  <sub>90%</sub>
 </italic>, and the time by which a serological sample of 10 turkeys would result in detection with 50% probability (assuming a test sensitivity of 97.7%) 
 <italic>T
  <sub>det50</sub>
 </italic>.
