<p>Model 2 was our baseline model because it reflects the course of outbreaks and variation therein, according to our best estimate. The estimates of

To investigate the role of the virus detection assay as a further source of uncertainty, a fourth set of 1,000 simulations was performed applying model 2 to dataset B (i.e., virus isolation results).
