<p>At the 64 farms, multiple samplings had been carried out. In each flock, a median of 10 (range: 8–20) birds per sampling were considered. We considered the earliest sampling that revealed a positive serological finding and determined whether an antigen detection assay had been performed ±5 days from this finding; antigen detection had been performed on mixed samples (pools) of five birds. If the flock was negative, then the outbreak was assumed to be over, and the seroprevalence in the sample was considered to represent the proportion of the population that had been infected by the end of the outbreak (defined as the “final size”). This resulted in the identification of 36 outbreaks (
