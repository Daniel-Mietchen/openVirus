<p>The field data were provided by the intensive surveillance system which was in place during the LPAI epidemics in 2000–2001, 2002–2003, 2004 and 2005 
 <xref rid="pone.0026935-Capua2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. During and around the time of the epidemics, a total of 6,102 poultry farms were routinely visited; 495 infected premises (i.e., outbreaks) were identified; 429 (87%) of these premises reared meat turkeys. Of the 429 outbreaks, we included only those that had occurred among unvaccinated flocks (n = 204). Although it would have been interesting to have investigated the disease dynamics in vaccinated birds, this was not possible because in the vaccinated flocks only unvaccinated sentinels were sampled. To fulfil the assumption of homogeneous mixing of the animals required for the analysis, we only included those farms on which the birds were housed in a single shed (n = 64).
