<p>The model was implemented in WinBUGS software version 1.4.3; posterior distributions were obtained using the default internal Gibbs sampler

Posterior inferences were based on 30,000 iterations with a sampling lag of 10, after a burn-in of 15,000 iterations was discarded. Convergence was assessed by running multiple chains from dispersed starting values and using the Gelman-Rubin statistic.
