<p>Furthermore, the use of an imperfect diagnostic test was assumed in the detection of seroprevalence, with sensitivity modelled as a Beta distribution. This model is the result of a careful preliminary investigation in which several alternatives have been compared. The initial assumption of a single R
 <sub>0</sub> value common to all the infected flocks did not fit our field data and we thus modelled R
 <sub>0</sub> as a probability density distribution. Different hypothesis on R
 <sub>0</sub> distribution and test sensitivity were then explored and evaluated by means of the deviance information criterion (DIC)
