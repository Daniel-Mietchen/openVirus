<p>Assuming that the diagnostic test perfectly reflects infectivity, the success probability (i.e., positive test result) depends on whether or not the sample was taken during the infectious period (i.e., when the bird sheds the virus with faeces). We thus assumed 100% probability of a positive test result (
 <italic>π</italic> = 1) if the sampling day 
 <italic>D</italic> was within the infectious period and 0% probability of a positive test result (
 <italic>π</italic> = 0) if the sample was collected before or after the infectious period:
