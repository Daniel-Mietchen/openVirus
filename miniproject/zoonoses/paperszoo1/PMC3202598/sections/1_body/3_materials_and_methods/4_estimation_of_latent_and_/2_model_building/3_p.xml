<p>To have an estimate of the latent and infectious periods in the population, we built a Bayesian model to link the distributions of these periods in the population of infected birds with the test results of the 18 challenged turkeys. We noted that for each bird (k1–k18) and at each sampling day (
 <italic>D</italic> = 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15 and 20) the test result 
 <italic>y</italic> could be either positive (1) or negative (0). It follows that 
 <italic>y</italic> has a Bernoulli distribution, depending on the success probability
