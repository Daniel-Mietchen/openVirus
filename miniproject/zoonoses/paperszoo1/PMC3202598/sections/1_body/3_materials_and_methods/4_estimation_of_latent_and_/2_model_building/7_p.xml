<p>Due to the limited amount of data, it was impossible to obtain reliable estimates of LP and IP for H5N2 and H7N7 strains separately. However, preliminary investigations showed that the overall generation time was a good average of the two separately, which were not that far apart indeed. We thus decided to estimate LP and IP using all the available data, given that the further infection model will encompass enough variability to allow for different virus transmission characteristics.</p>
