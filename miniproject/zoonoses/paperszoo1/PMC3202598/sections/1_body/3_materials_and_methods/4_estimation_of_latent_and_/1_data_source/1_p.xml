<p>The data used for this analysis were taken from a vaccine trial performed in 2004 at the Italian National Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza (unpublished data). Eighteen unvaccinated commercial turkeys (i.e., the controls of the trial) were challenged with two LPAI strains at 12 weeks of age via the intranasal route. Nine birds were challenged with H5N2 LPAI virus A/TK/IT/80 and 9 birds with H7N3 LPAI virus A/TK/IT/8000/02. The infective dose was 10
 <sup>4</sup> EID
 <sub>50</sub>. For each bird, cloacal swabs were taken at day 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15 and 20 post-inoculation and tested using a real-time RT-PCR assay and virus isolation in SPF fertile eggs. The results are given in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0026935-t003">Table 3</xref>. Because of the higher sensitivity, we used the PCR results for our default analysis. However, given that a positive virus isolation may better reflect infectivity, we repeated the analysis with the virus isolation results to assess the sensitivity of this choice for the simulation output. Thus two different datasets were built: dataset A (PCR assay) and dataset B (virus isolation).
