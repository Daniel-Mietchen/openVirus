<p>We assumed that infectivity was indicated by a positive test result and that, based on individual test results (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0026935-t003">Table 3</xref>), the infectious period was preceded by a latent period. This latent period began immediately after virus inoculation (day 0) and ended at a time point (T
 <sub>1</sub>) between the last negative and the first positive test result. Consequently, the infectious period started just after the latent period and ended in the period (T
 <sub>2</sub>) between the last positive test and the subsequent negative test. For example, bird k2 in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0026935-t003">Table 3</xref> (dataset A) showed a latent period starting at day 0 and lasting to somewhere between day 3 and 5 (3&lt;T
 <sub>1</sub>&lt;5); the infectious period lasted from T
 <sub>1</sub> to between day 10 and 12 (10&lt; T
 <sub>2</sub>&lt;12). We then assumed that both the latent period (
 <italic>LP</italic>) and infectious period (
 <italic>IP</italic>) in the population of infected birds followed a gamma distribution, characterized by parameters

 <italic>ρ,</italic> as follows:
