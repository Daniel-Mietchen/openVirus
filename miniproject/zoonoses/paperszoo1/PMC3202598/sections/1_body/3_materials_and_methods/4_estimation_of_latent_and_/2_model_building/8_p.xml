<p>The model was implemented in WinBUGS software using the default internal Gibbs sampler

  <sub>I</sub>
 </italic> [i.e., Gamma(0.01,0.01)]. Posterior inferences were based on 30,000 iterations with a sampling lag of 10, after a burn-in of 15 000 iterations was discarded. Convergence was assessed by running multiple chains from dispersed starting values and using the Gelman-Rubin statistic.
