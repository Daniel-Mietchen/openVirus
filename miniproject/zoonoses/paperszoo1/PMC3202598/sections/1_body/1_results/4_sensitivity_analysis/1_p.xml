<p>To investigate the possible sources of variation in the outbreaks' descriptive statistics, we compared the above-mentioned results (obtained with the baseline model) with simulations derived from models with different levels of uncertainty (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0026935-t005">Table 5</xref>). In particular, model 1 was used to investigate only stochastic effects, model 2 (i.e., the baseline model) to investigate stochastic effects and variation in

 <sub>0</sub> among flocks, and model 3 to investigate stochastic effects, variation in

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0026935-t007">Table 7</xref>. The estimated median values obtained with model 1 were very similar to those obtained with the baseline model, though with a marked narrowing of the 95% credible intervals. This is clearly visible for the peak number of infective birds (median

  <sub>peak</sub>
 </italic>: 52.4% in model 1 versus 49.8% in model 2), for which the precision of the estimation in model 1 reached a very narrow interval (51.3%â€“53.4%). This implies that most variation in the field is due to intrinsic differences among flocks and not to stochastic effects. Obviously, model 3 added more uncertainty to the estimates, resulting in broader credible intervals; however the median results of model 3 were similar to those obtained with model 2 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0026935-t006">Tables 6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0026935-t007">7</xref>). The differences between models 2 and 3 were relatively small, indicating that more precise parameter estimates would improve the predicted dynamics of LPAI outbreaks only to a limited extent. This can also be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026935-g002">Figure 2</xref>, in which an example of the impact of the three models on the time of the epidemic peak is illustrated. Whereas the median estimates were quite similar, the higher precision of model 1 led to a sharper distribution compared to the distributions resulting from models 2 and 3, which encompassed more uncertainty.
