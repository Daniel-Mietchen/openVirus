<p>To investigate the effect of the definition of “infectious bird” on the disease dynamics, we performed additional simulations using the posterior estimates derived from virus isolation results (i.e., dataset B) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0026935-t004">Table 4</xref>). 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0026935-t007">Table 7</xref> shows the descriptive statistics of the 1,000 simulated outbreaks using model 2 and dataset B. The final size of the epidemic was the same (99.5%), yet the duration of the epidemic was longer (135 days), the epidemic peak occurred slightly earlier (41 days after infection), and the proportion of infectious birds at the epidemic peak was lower (11.3%) The different disease dynamics associated with different definitions of “infective birds” is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026935-g003">Figure 3</xref>. The different assumptions of infectivity (i.e., based upon different diagnostic assays) led to different peak prevalences; however, the timing of the peak prevalences was very close (41 versus 45 days after infection).
