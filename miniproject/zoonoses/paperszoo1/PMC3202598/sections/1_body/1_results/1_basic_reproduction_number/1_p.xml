<p>Using data from the 2000–2005 LPAI outbreaks in northern Italy, we estimated the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> based on the seroprevalence in selected flocks after the outbreaks had come to an end (referred to as the “final size”). In other words, we considered only those flocks that tested negative to antigen detection ±5 days from the earliest positive serological finding in the flock. The selected farms consisted of those with unvaccinated meat-turkey flocks housed in a single shed. This resulted in 36 selected flocks (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0026935-t001">Table 1</xref>): 27 were infected by H7N3 and 9 by H7N1 LPAI strains. The mean seroprevalence (i.e., final size) in the selected flocks was 89.3% (Exact Fisher's 95% confidence interval: 85.7–92.2), which was significantly higher than the seroprevalence in the flocks that were positive for antigen detection (i.e., 61.7%; 95%CI: 50.3–72.3, data not shown), confirming the validity of this inclusion criterion (i.e., negative for antigen detection).
