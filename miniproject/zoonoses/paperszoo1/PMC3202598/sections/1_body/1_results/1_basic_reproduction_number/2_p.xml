<p>The final size data were fitted into a Bayesian hierarchical model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026935-g001">Figure 1</xref>) to estimate the distribution of 
 <italic>R
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic> among flocks, resulting in a mean value of 5.5 (95% posterior credible interval: 3.4–18.3) and a variance of 11.3 (95%PCI: 1.7–298). The sensitivity of the diagnostic test (i.e., haemoagglutination inhibition) was estimated in the same model and was equal to 0.977 (95%PCI: 0.953–0.992) (
