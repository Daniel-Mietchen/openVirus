<p>The estimates of latent and infectious periods were calculated using a Bayesian model, and the results varied according to the definition of “infected animal”. When the definition was based on the quantity of viral genome in faeces (identified by PCR), the mean latent period was 2.9 days (95%PCI: 2.4–3.4), and the mean infectious period was 8.2 days (95%PCI: 6.5–10.6). When the definition was based on the isolation from faeces of a live virus capable of replication (detected by virus isolation), the mean latent period was 8.7 days (95%PCI: 3.9–33.8) and the mean infectious period was 2.3 days (95%PCI: 1.3–3.5) (
