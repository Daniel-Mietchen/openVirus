<p>Given that field data were not available for estimating the duration of the latent and infectious periods, we used previous data from experimental infections with outbreak strains. The data were available for 18 unvaccinated commercial turkeys challenged with two different LPAI strains (H5N2 and H7N3, 9 birds per strain) and swabbed at days 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15 and 20 post inoculation. Infectivity was tested by means of both PCR and virus isolation assays. The test results are given in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0026935-t003">Table 3</xref>. Because sensitivity was higher for PCR, compared to virus isolation assays, we used the PCR results for our default analysis. However, given that positive virus isolation may better reflect infectivity, we repeated the analysis with the virus isolation results to assess the sensitivity of this choice for the outbreak simulations described below.
