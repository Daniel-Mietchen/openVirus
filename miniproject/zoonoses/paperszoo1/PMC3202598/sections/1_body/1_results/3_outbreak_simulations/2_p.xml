<p>The descriptive statistics of the simulated outbreaks using the baseline model (model 2) are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0026935-t006">Table 6</xref>. The quoted intervals are the 2.5
 <sup>th</sup> and 97.5
 <sup>th</sup> percentiles. The duration of outbreaks (i.e., from the first to the last infected turkey) ranged from 56 to 337 days (i.e., 2 to 11 months), although 90% of the infections were observed in a period of 10–150 days. The epidemic peak (i.e., the day that the peak number of infective birds was reached) occurred at a median of 45 days after the first case, which is only 7 days after a serological sample of 10 turkeys would be detected with 50% probability (median 
 <italic>T
  <sub>det50%</sub>
 </italic> is 38 days). At the peak, a median of about 50% of the turkeys were infected, though this percentage greatly varied among farms (3% – 74%). At that time, 15.8% – 28.3% of the turkeys were already seropositive, indicating a period of overlap where both antigen and serological tests were able to detect infection. As expected, the seroprevalence at the end of the outbreak (
 <italic>R
  <sub>final</sub>
 </italic>,) (i.e., the final size) was high, even higher than 99.4% in half of the cases.
