<p>A H1N1 virus caused the first influenza pandemic in the 21st century and continues to be detected worldwide.

 </sup> In the spring of 2009, the H1N1 virus (A(H1N1)pdm09) was first detected in Mexico, after which it spread around the world in only a few months. In terms of mortality, the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was relatively mild, and preferentially affected young adults. People over 65 years of age experienced a relatively mild infection because of cross-protective immunity to the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, as this virus was antigenically similar to H1N1 viruses circulating before 1957.

 </sup> The A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was a reassortant virus that contained the NA and matrix (M) genes from the ‘Eurasian swine' influenza virus lineage, while other genes originate from a ‘triple reassortant' swine influenza virus that had previously acquired its genes upon reassortment between human, avian and (classical) swine influenza viruses.

 </sup> The fact that the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus emerged after reassortment in swine supports the hypothesis that swine can serve as a mixing vessel for the generation of new human influenza viruses.
