<p>The introduction of a new virus subtype that has not previously been circulating in the human population is referred to as antigenic shift. Antigenic shift occurs upon the introduction of an influenza A virus from the animal reservoir with or without reassortment, i.e., the mixing of genes from two (or more) animal and human influenza A viruses. While influenza viruses are continuously changing by antigenic drift, antigenic shift happens only infrequently. In the last century, four human influenza A virus pandemics have occurred, at least three of which resulted from reassortment between human and animal influenza A viruses.
