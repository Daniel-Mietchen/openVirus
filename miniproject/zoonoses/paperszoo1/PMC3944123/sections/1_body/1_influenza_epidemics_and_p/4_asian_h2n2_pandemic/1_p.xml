 </sup> During this pandemic, predominantly very young and very old individuals were affected. The H2N2 virus emerged upon reassortment between human and avian influenza viruses. The HA, NA and basic polymerase 1 (PB1) genes originated from an avian H2N2 virus and the remaining gene segments from the H1N1 virus that circulated prior to 1957.
