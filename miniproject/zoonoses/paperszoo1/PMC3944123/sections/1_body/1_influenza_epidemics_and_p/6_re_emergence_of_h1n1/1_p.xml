<p>In 1977, an influenza outbreak was detected that affected predominantly young adults. This outbreak was caused by the reintroduction of an H1N1 virus also known as the ‘Russian' H1N1 virus. This virus was genetically very similar to viruses circulating in the early 1950s and lacked years of genetic evolution, suggesting that the 1977 H1N1 virus was accidentally released from a laboratory.

 </sup> The reintroduced H1N1 virus did not replace the circulating H3N2 virus and subsequently these virus subtypes cocirculated in humans until the ‘Russian' H1N1 virus was replaced in 2009 by the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus.
