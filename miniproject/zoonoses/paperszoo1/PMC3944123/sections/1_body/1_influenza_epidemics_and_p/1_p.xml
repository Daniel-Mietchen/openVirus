<p>Influenza viruses cause annually recurrent epidemics, which result in approximately three to five million cases of severe illness and 250 000 to 500 000 deaths worldwide.

 </sup> Infection with influenza viruses results in protective immunity, which is at least in part mediated by antibodies against the viral surface glycoproteins HA and NA. During circulation in humans, the virus gradually accumulates point mutations in HA and NA, which allows the virus to escape host immunity. This phenomenon, also known as antigenic drift, explains the occurrence of seasonal influenza epidemics.
