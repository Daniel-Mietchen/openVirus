<p>Since it is impossible to predict which influenza viruses will preferentially emerge and may cause the next pandemic, it is key to continuously monitor the genetic composition of circulating influenza strains in animals and to assess their infection and transmission potential in animal models. Since multiple evolutionary trajectories could yield viruses transmissible via the airborne route between mammals, monitoring the genetic composition of virus isolates alone may be misleading and phenotypic assays should be added to surveillance studies to evaluate the threats posed by animal influenza viruses. Since virus isolates consist of quasi-species, monitoring plaque purified viruses or viruses generated from plasmid clones has to be considered for phenotypic assays. Information that reveals genetic changes which could possibly alter the virulence and transmission potential may help to better assess the risks of potential emerging influenza viruses. In addition, intervention strategies and â€˜stamping-out' procedures can be prioritized and targeted better. Whether a next pandemic will emerge only after reassortment is questionable, since airborne transmission of a wholly avian virus between mammals has now been shown to be possible for both laboratory-generated and natural avian influenza viruses.</p>
