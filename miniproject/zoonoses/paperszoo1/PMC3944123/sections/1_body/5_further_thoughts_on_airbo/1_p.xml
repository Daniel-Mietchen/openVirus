<p>The influenza virus traits that are important for airborne transmission are slowly becoming apparent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>): (i) attachment to and replication in appropriate cells of the mammalian airways, which is facilitated by the receptor binding preference of HA; (ii) increased binding via the deletion of a potential 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation site in HA; (iii) (acid) stabilization of HA; (iv) increased viral replication induced by the viral polymerase genes; and (v) virus shedding as single particles rather than aggregates, which may be facilitated by amino-acid substitutions in the HA and NA proteins.
