<p>The studies on transmission of H9N2, H5N1, H7N9 and other influenza viruses are of importance to elucidate common mechanisms of transmission of influenza viruses. The results of such work may ultimately help to better assess the risk posed by the current HPAI H5N1 and H7N9 virus epizootics for human health. Increased fundamental understanding of the contribution of specific mutations or reassortment events and their associated biological traits to transmission is urgently needed. It is important to study common biological properties of transmissible viruses rather than genetic changes in a singular virus strain, to generalize the mechanisms leading to increased transmission. Data on the biological properties of the transmissible H5N1 virus may be extrapolated to the H7N9 virus and future zoonotic viruses, in order to assess the risk of a new pandemic and to implement appropriate control measures on time. Mechanistic studies on the phenotypic traits associated with each of the identified amino-acid substitutions from previous pandemic virus would be very informative.</p>
