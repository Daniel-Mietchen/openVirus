<p>As described above, the adaptation of the viral RNA polymerase is crucial for avian influenza viruses, since these polymerases have relatively poor activity in mammalian cells. Several amino-acid substitutions in the ribonucleoprotein complex are known to contribute to the host-range restriction of influenza viruses and increase replication in the mammalian URT. High virus replication in the URT is critical for airborne transmission since decreased replication abolished airborne transmission between mammals.

 </sup> the airborne-transmissible H5N1 virus possessed the E627K amino-acid substitution in PB2. However, it has yet to be elucidated if this residue was crucial for airborne transmission and whether it can be substituted by functionally equivalent mutations. The airborne-transmissible H5N1 viruses of Herfst 
 <italic>et al.</italic> possessed several additional substitutions in the polymerase genes, which may have contributed to airborne transmission. A K627E substitution was found to reduce transmission in a direct contact transmission model for HPAI H5N1 virus. Introduction of D701N in combination with the K627E substitution resulted in more efficient transmission in mammals, a phenotype more similar to that of the wildtype viruses, suggesting that this residue can compensate for the absence of 627K.

 </sup> These data indicate that amino-acid positions 627 and 701 in PB2 are critical determinants of airborne transmission between mammals in diverse virus backgrounds.
