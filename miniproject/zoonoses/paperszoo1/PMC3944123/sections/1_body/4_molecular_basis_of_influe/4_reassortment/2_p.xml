<p>Fortunately, at present, reassortment of avian H5, H7 and H9 viruses with contemporary human influenza viruses has not been detected in nature. This may in part be explained by the relatively low number of human cases of avian influenza virus infections, and the low probability of double infections with human influenza viruses in a single host. In addition, influenza viruses have to infect the same cell, and similar timing of infection is necessary to initiate gene reassortment. However, co-infections of avian and human influenza viruses in humans or pigs may provide new opportunities for reassortment, and evidence from pandemics of the last century indicates that the likelihood of such reassortment is not negligible.</p>
