<p>The emergence of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus demonstrated that pigs can be the direct source of pandemic influenza. Reassortment was responsible for the unique constellation of virus genes, which was shown to be a critical determinant of airborne transmission between ferrets,

 </sup> The emergence of H1N2 and H3N2v swine viruses underlines that swine populations should be monitored closely for the emergence of influenza viruses with pandemic potential. When the airborne transmissibility of these viruses was assessed, the H1N2 virus acquired substitutions in HA (D222G) and NA (S315N) during a single ferret passage that resulted in airborne transmission among ferrets. Reverse genetics studies further indicated that these amino-acid substitutions contributed substantially to the airborne transmissibility.

 </sup> The viral RNA polymerase was also shown to promote airborne transmission.

 </sup> Moreover, four H3N2v viruses, collected from 2009 until 2011, also possessed the capacity to spread between cohoused ferrets, and the 2010 and 2011 H3N2v viruses transmitted efficiently to naive ferrets via the airborne route.

 </sup> These findings support the continuous threat of swine influenza viruses to humans, and the need for continued surveillance.
