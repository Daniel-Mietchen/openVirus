<p>The role of other viral proteins in airborne transmission has so far remained elusive. The study of Zhang

 </sup> demonstrated that the PA, NS, M, NA and NP genes are important to confer airborne transmission; however, the key amino-acid substitutions remain unknown. In addition, it has been suggested that H5N1 viruses that acquire a long stalk NA through reassortment may be more likely to be transmitted among humans.
