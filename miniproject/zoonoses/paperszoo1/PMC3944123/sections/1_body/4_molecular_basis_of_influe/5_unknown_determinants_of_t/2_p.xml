<p>Although it is known that influenza virus morphology affects virus production, the relative contribution of spherical and more elongated versions of influenza virus to transmission is still unclear. Early work showed that most influenza virus strains isolated from humans are predominantly filamentous and, upon continued passage in egg or tissue culture, adopt a more spherical morphology, which correlated with increased virus titers.

 </sup> It is possible that increased levels of influenza virus production by spherical strains will results in more efficient influenza virus transmission.

 </sup> The contribution of substitutions in the M gene segment on virus morphology and transmission warrants further investigation.
