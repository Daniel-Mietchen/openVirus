<p>Refining the human receptor binding preference of an avian influenza virus thus appeared to be necessary for viruses to become airborne. Recently, it was suggested that the stability of HA in an acidic environment might be an important additional requirement for airborne transmission between mammals. Upon influenza virus attachment and endocytosis, a low endosomal pH triggers a conformational change in the HA protein to expose the fusion peptide and trigger a fusion reaction between the viral and endosomal membranes, after which viral ribonucleoproteins are released in the cytoplasm.

 </sup> demonstrated the requirement of a T318I amino-acid substitution in HA to lower the pH of membrane fusion, thus compensating for a decrease in HA stability caused by human receptor binding mutations in the airborne-transmissible H5. In addition, this mutation increased the thermostability of the virus. It has been shown that viruses which fuse at low pH have a higher thermostability than those fusing at a higher pH.

 </sup> These environmental factors like temperature and pH are likely to affect airborne transmission. One of the substitutions consistently present in airborne-transmissible A/Indonesia/5/05 virus, H110Y, was likely to be involved in HA stability as well.

 </sup> Several other amino-acid substitutions are known to decrease the pH threshold for activation of HA, and could thus determine a similar phenotypic trait. To investigate whether mutations that alter the pH threshold for fusion (Y23H, H24Q, K58I) affected the fitness of H5N1 virus, mice were infected with wild-type and mutant H5N1 viruses A/chicken/Vietnam/C58/04 (clade 1). Mutant K58I—with the lowest threshold for fusion of pH 5.4—demonstrated increased replication and virulence, suggesting that adaptation of avian H5N1 influenza virus for replication in mice is supported by a low pH threshold for fusion.

 </sup> The same substitution was responsible for increased replication of H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (clade 1) in the URT of ferrets. In the absence of changes in receptor binding preference, this mutation did not alter the transmissibility, since neither the wild-type virus, nor the K58I mutant virus, resulted in direct contact transmission between ferrets.

 </sup> The pH threshold for fusion is thus likely to be an important determinant for airborne transmission between mammals only in the context of a virus with appropriate human receptor binding preference. Comparison of the airborne-transmissible H5N1 viruses to the novel H7N9 virus may suggest that a lower pH threshold for fusion may be required for increased airborne transmissibility of the latter virus between mammals.

 </sup> Additional research is necessary to identify substitutions in the H7N9 virus that are responsible for HA stabilization, which may confer enhanced transmissibility between mammals. Identification of amino-acid substitutions that decrease the pH threshold of fusion and increase the thermostability is important for influenza virus surveillance and risk assessment of currently circulating avian H5 and H7 influenza viruses. However, it is important to note that the increased acid stability and thermostability of HA may only be a surrogate marker for another phenotype, such as stability in aerosols or respiratory droplets or other conditions in the environment. Nevertheless, transmission via the airborne route requires the HA protein to be stable in the hosts' environment.
