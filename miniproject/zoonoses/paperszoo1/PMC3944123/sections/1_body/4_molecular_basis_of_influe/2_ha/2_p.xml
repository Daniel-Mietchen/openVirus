<p>An 
 <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation site in HA was also shown to play a role in airborne transmission of H5N1 viruses. This glycosylation site is located near the RBD at position 158â€“160, and deletion of this site was demonstrated to be beneficial for human receptor binding affinity. Loss of this glycosylation site was found to be critical for H5N1 virus virulence in mice

 </sup> the same glycosylation site was deleted through different substitutions, suggesting that the loss of this glycosylation site was critical for airborne transmission between mammals. Many H5N1 viruses, in particular within the H5N1 lineage circulating in Egypt (clade 2.2), lost their putative 
 <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation site in nature. Recent analysis suggested that avian H5N1 viruses from Egypt lacking the glycosylation site transmit more readily from poultry to humans than those that possess the glycosylation site.
