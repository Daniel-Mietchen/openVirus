 </sup> Most human virus isolates harbor the Q226L substitution responsible for binding to the URT in mammals. However, this amino-acid substitution on its own may not be sufficient for efficient airborne transmission between ferrets. It is important to note that it is difficult to obtain quantitative data on airborne transmission in ferrets to compare efficiency of transmission between human and avian viruses, in part due to animal ethics considerations in relation to the required group size.

 </sup> This difficulty is further complicated by differences in animal breed, age, gender, set-up of the airborne-transmission experiments and climatic conditions during the experiments between different research groups, which may all affect transmission efficiency.
