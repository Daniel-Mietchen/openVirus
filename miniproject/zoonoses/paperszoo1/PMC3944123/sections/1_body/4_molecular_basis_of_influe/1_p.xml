<p>Several influenza virus subtypes from the animal reservoir have the ability to infect the human host but most of these are not further transmitted via aerosols or respiratory droplets (hereafter referred to as â€˜airborne' transmission) between humans. On rare occasions however, influenza pandemics may be the consequence of influenza virus zoonosis. It is important to understand the mechanisms by which influenza viruses emerge, adapt to the human host and acquire the ability of airborne transmission between humans and other mammals. Below, we discuss viral characteristics that were shown to be important for airborne transmission between mammals. Molecular signatures that may contribute to airborne transmission of H5 and H9 influenza virus subtypes are summarized in
