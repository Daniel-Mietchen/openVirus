<p>More studies are required to identify determinants of efficient replication of animal influenza viruses in mammals. One starting point for such studies could be the genome sequences of human and avian influenza viruses, to identify species-specific amino acids. For example, 32 amino-acid residues in PB2, PA, NP, M1 and NS1 were identified to be different between human and avian viruses, of which 13 were conserved among 1918, 1957 and 1968 pandemic influenza viruses.

 </sup> These host-specific markers can help us identify the minimal requirements for adaptation of avian viruses to mammals and may have prognostic and diagnostic values for improving pandemic preparedness.
