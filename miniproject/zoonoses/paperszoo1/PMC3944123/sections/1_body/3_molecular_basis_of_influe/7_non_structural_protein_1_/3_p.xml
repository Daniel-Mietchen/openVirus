<p>Several amino-acid substitutions in the NS1 of H5N1 virus were shown to increase NS1 binding to CPSF30 (the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 30-Kd subunit, involved in cellular pre-mRNA processing), which was also associated with enhanced viral replication.

 </sup> The A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was not able to block host gene expression in both human and swine cell lines,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">95</xref>
 </sup> which is partially due to mutations that block CPSF30 binding. Additionally, A(H1N1)pdm09 virus has a truncated NS1 protein with a 11 amino-acid deletion at its C-terminus, and therefore, lacks the PDZ-binding domain.

 </sup> However, after restoring these functions in A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, they did not appear to have a significant effect on virulence of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in various animal models.
