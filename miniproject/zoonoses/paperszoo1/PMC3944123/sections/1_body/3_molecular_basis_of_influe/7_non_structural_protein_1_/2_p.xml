<p>The C-terminus of NS1 contains a PDZ ligand domain (of the X–S/T–X–V type) that was shown to be an important determinant of virulence.

 </sup> When this domain of NS1 of 1918 H1N1 and H5N1 HPAI viruses was introduced in a mouse-adapted influenza virus, it was shown to increase virulence.

 </sup> Recent HPAI H5N1 virus isolates lack these motifs, which argues against a role of this domain for virulence for these H5N1 viruses.
