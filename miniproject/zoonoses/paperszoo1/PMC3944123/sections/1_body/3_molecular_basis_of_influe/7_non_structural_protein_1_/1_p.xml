<p>NS1 has been studied extensively as a molecular determinant of virulence. One of the most important roles of NS1 is that of an IFN antagonist, which is accomplished by several mechanisms.

 </sup> Influenza viruses lacking NS1 are only able to replicate in cells or mice that have a compromised IFN response.

 </sup> H5N1 viruses, unlike other human, avian and swine influenza viruses, are relatively resistant to the antiviral effects of IFN, which results in increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression.

 </sup> This effect can be modulated by a D92E amino-acid substitution, which is responsible for increased virulence of HPAI H5N1 in mice and facilitates virus replication in the presence of IFN.
