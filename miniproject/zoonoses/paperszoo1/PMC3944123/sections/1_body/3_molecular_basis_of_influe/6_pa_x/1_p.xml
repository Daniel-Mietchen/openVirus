<p>A newly identified protein encoded by gene segment 3, termed PA-X, modulates the host response by repressing cellular gene expression, i.e., host-cell shut off.

 </sup> PA-X-deficient viruses caused enhanced disease in mice, which was related to an accelerated host response. Truncation of the PA-X protein appeared to be associated with influenza virus lineages circulating in particular reservoirs, demonstrating that there may be some species specificity to the evolution of PA-X.
