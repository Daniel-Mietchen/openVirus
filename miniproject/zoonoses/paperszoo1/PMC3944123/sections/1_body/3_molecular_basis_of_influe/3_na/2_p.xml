<p>Upon transmission of avian influenza viruses form waterfowl to domestic birds, deletions in the NA stalk region—which are associated with increased virulence in poultry—have been detected frequently.

 </sup> It is not clear how such shortened NA stalk regions influences virulence, but early steps of the viral replication cycle (binding, immune evasion, prevention of apoptosis) may be involved in addition to tuning of the HA/NA balance. The shortened NA stalk region of H5N1 viruses was also shown to contribute to virulence in mammalian hosts.
