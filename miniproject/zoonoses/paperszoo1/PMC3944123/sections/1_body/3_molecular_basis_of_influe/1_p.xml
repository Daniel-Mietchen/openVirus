<p>Influenza viruses from the animal reservoir can harbor genetic traits responsible for increased host range and virulence in mammals. When influenza viruses cross the species barrier and infect humans, additional genetic changes are frequently introduced. It is of importance to identify and investigate (adaptive) phenotypic and genetic traits associated with host range and virulence, to estimate the risks that animal influenza viruses pose for human health.</p>
