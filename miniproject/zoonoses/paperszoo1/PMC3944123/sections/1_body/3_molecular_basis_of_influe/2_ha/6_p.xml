<p>In addition to substitutions in the RBD, changes in glycosylation patterns of HA can affect host range and virulence of influenza viruses. In H1N1 viruses, glycosylation sites were shown to play an important role in antigenicity, virulence and affinity for the receptor.

 </sup> Introduction of extra glycosylation sites resulted in increased virulence of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in mice.

 </sup> Loss of an 
 <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation site located near the RBD in HA of H5N1 virus (position 158–160), combined with acquisition of human receptor specificity, enhanced H5N1 virus binding to α2,6-SA.

 </sup> In addition, deletion of this glycosylation site increased the virulence of an H5N1 virus in mice.
