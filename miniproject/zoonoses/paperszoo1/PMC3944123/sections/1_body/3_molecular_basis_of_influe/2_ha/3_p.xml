<p>In the HA of HPAI H5N1 viruses, mutations have been described that changed the binding preference from α2,3-SA to α2,6-SA.

 </sup> The majority of these amino-acid substitutions was located in or near the RBD. Several H5N1 strains with enhanced affinity for human-type α2,6-SA receptors have been described in Indonesia.

 </sup> In Egypt, new sublineages of HPAI H5N1 viruses have emerged in local bird populations that displayed enhanced α2,6-SA binding, but retained binding affinity for α2,3-SA and were associated with increased attachment to cells of the human lower respiratory tract.
