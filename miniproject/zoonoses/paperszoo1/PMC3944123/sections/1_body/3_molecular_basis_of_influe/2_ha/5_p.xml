<p>The dual receptor binding of avian H5N1 and H7N9 viruses, as well as the 1918 H1N1 virus, may be responsible, at least in part, for increased severity of disease in humans. These influenza viruses were able to infect epithelial cells that line the lower respiratory tract, the bronchi, bronchioles and type II pneumocytes, which predominantly contain the avian type α2,3-SA receptors.

 </sup> It is plausible that when avian H5N1 and H7N9 viruses acquire stronger affinity for α2,6-SA receptors and lose affinity for α2,3-SA, this would increase their pandemic potential, but at the same time, would decrease virulence.
