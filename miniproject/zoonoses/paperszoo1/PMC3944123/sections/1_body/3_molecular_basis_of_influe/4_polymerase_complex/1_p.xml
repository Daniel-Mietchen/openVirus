<p>The influenza virus polymerase proteins, and in particular basic polymerase 2 (PB2), have been shown to be important for virus adaptation to mammalian species. Interspecies transmission requires adaptation of the viral polymerase to importin-α, which is responsible for translocation of the viral ribonucleoprotein complex to the nucleus, since avian and human influenza viruses require different importin-α.

 </sup> Several amino-acid substitutions (E627K, D701N and G590S/Q591R) have been shown to compensate for the lack of efficient polymerase activity of avian influenza viruses in mammalian cells.

 </sup> The E627K substitution is the best characterized mammalian adaptation mutation. This substitution is associated with increased virulence of human HPAI H5N1 virus isolates and was found in a fatal human case of infection with HPAI H7N7 virus.

 </sup> In addition, most human H7N9 virus isolates contained 627 K, or the alternative mammalian adaptive substitution D701N. The D701N substitution in PB2 was found to increase virulence, and to expand the host range of avian H5N1 virus to mammalian hosts in the absence of E627K.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">76</xref>
 </sup> The D701N substitution caused enhancement of binding of PB2 to importin-α1 in mammalian cells, resulting in increased transport of PB2 into the nucleus.

 </sup> In terms of virulence, it has been shown that E627K in PB2 is a critical virulence determinant for clade 2.3.4 H5N1 viruses, whereas D701N in PB2 and other unknown virulence determinants appear to be involved in the high pathogenicity of clade 1 H5N1 viruses.

 </sup> The A(H1N1)pdm09 virus did not contain the mammalian adaptation residues 627 K and/or 701 N. When the substitutions E627K or D701N were introduced in A(H1N1)pdm09, no increase in virulence was observed.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">79</xref>
 </sup> The lack of these mammalian adaptation markers in PB2 was shown to be compensated by substitutions G590S/Q591R, which may affect interaction with viral and/or cellular factors and promote virus replication in mammals.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">73</xref>
 </sup> Other mutations in PB1, acidic polymerase (PA), nucleoprotein (NP) and nucleic export protein have been described that can compensate for the poor polymerase activity of avian influenza viruses in human cells.
