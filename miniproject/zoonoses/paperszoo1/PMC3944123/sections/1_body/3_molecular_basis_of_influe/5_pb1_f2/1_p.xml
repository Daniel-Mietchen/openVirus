<p>The PB1-F2 protein contributes to viral pathogenicity by inducing apoptosis of infected cells. The 1918 H1N1 virus and various isolates of HPAI H5N1 virus specifically have an N66S amino-acid substitution, which is partially responsible for high virulence.

 </sup> The PB1-F2 N66S variant reduced the production of interferon (IFN).

 </sup> It was demonstrated that the PB1-F2 protein contributed to virulence of pandemic strains and the HPAI H5N1 virus through enhancement of the lung inflammatory response, resulting in increased pathology.

 </sup> However, in some influenza viruses, like the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, a stop codon prevents the expression of PB1-F2, and restoring this function had minimal impact on virulence.

 </sup> In addition, PB1-F2 was shown to promote virulence and increase secondary bacterial pneumonia.
