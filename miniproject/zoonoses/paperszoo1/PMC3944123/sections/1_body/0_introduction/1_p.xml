<p>Influenza A virus is a negative sense, single-stranded, segmented RNA virus of the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family. Influenza A viruses are classified on the basis of the antigenic properties of the glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) into 18 HA subtypes (H1–H18) and 11 NA subtypes (N1–N11).

 </sup> The combination of specific HA and NA subtypes is used in influenza A virus nomenclature (e.g., H5N1, H7N9, H3N2). All influenza A virus subtypes are circulating in wild birds, which are therefore considered the natural influenza A virus reservoir, except H17, H18, N10 and N11. Viruses of subtypes H17N10 and H18N11 were recently identified in bat samples, raising the possibility that birds are not the exclusive influenza A virus reservoir.
