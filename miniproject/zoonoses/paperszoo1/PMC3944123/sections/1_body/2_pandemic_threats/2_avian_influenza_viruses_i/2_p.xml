<p>In 1997, a large outbreak of HPAI H5N1 virus infections in poultry in Hong Kong resulted in the first documented cases of direct transmission of avian viruses from poultry to humans.

 </sup> Since 2003, HPAI H5N1 viruses have spread throughout Asia, Europe and Africa, causing severe outbreaks in poultry. During these outbreaks, HPAI H5N1 viruses have been detected in various mammals on numerous occasions. As of October 7, 661 cases of human HPAI H5N1 virus infection have been reported to the World Health Organization, of which more than half were fatal.

 </sup> While most of the human cases occurred upon direct contact with infected poultry, a few family clusters of human-to-human transmission of HPAI H5N1 virus have been documented.

 </sup> Fortunately, the HPAI H5N1 virus lacks the ability to spread efficiently between humans, a requirement for influenza pandemics to occur. However, because the H5N1 virus is able to infect humans, it is feared that this virus may mutate or reassort with circulating human influenza viruses, possibly resulting in better adaptation to humans and subsequent human-to-human transmission.
