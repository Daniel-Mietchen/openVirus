<p>In 1968, influenza viruses of the H2 subtype have disappeared from humans. Therefore, an increasing proportion of the current world population is likely to be susceptible to infection with H2 viruses if they would re-emerge. Influenza viruses of the H2 subtype continue to circulate in several avian species and pigs, posing a potential pandemic threat.
