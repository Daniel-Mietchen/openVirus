<p>Almost all influenza virus subtypes are present in the avian reservoir as low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses. In this reservoir, consisting primarily of birds living near wetlands and aquatic environment such as the 
 <italic>Anseriformes</italic> and 
 <italic>Charadriiformes</italic>, avian influenza viruses reassort frequently.

 </sup> LPAI viruses are able to spread across the world via bird migration. Domestic ducks and geese may serve as â€˜bridge species' for transmission to domestic poultry. Both wild and domestic birds are suitable influenza virus hosts that mostly experience asymptomatic infections, despite high virus replication. Viruses of subtypes H5 and H7 are a notable exception, since they can evolve in poultry to become highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, causing severe disease and mortality.
