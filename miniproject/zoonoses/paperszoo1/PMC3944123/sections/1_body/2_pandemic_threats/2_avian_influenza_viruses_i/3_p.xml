<p>At the end of March 2013, a novel LPAI H7N9 virus emerged in China, resulting in 137 confirmed human infections including 45 fatalities.

 </sup> This virus caused only mild or no symptoms in birds, and as a consequence stayed undetected in poultry for some time. However, in humans this virus caused severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome in a large number of cases.

 </sup> The H7N9 virus emerged upon multiple reassortment events between different avian influenza viruses.

 </sup> Even though this novel H7N9 virus harbors mammalian adaption markers that have been associated with increased replication and transmission in mammals, only one case of (non-sustainable) transmission between humans has been reported.

 </sup> Several other H7 influenza virus outbreaks in poultry have resulted in human cases of infection in the past. On August 14 2013, HPAI H7N7 was reported in poultry in Northern Italy and in three human cases of infection.

 </sup> In 2003, a large outbreak of an HPAI H7N7 virus in poultry in the Netherlands resulted in 89 cases of human infection, one of which was fatal.

 </sup> H7 viruses often displayed an unusual tissue tropism; the virus targeted the conjunctiva, resulting in conjunctivitis, a symptom rarely reported for other influenza virus subtypes.
