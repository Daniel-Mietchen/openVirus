<p>Influenza viruses with pandemic potential may arise in pigs, because pig cells express both human and avian influenza virus receptors, thus providing an opportunity for adaptation of avian influenza viruses, and reassortment with human viruses when they infect the same cell. When the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus became enzootic in swine, this virus continued to reassort with other swine influenza viruses. Human infections with H1N2 viruses demonstrated the continuous threat of reassortant swine viruses.

 </sup> Starting in 2011, a novel H3N2 variant virus (H3N2v) containing seven gene segments of swine influenza virus origin and the A(H1N1)pdm09 M gene segment was detected in 348 humans.

 </sup> Although humans may have cross-protective immunity due to infections with the seasonal H3N2 viruses that circulated in the 1990s,

 </sup> the H3N2v is antigenically distinct from the currently circulating seasonal H3N2 viruses and can thus potentially infect a large proportion of the human population. Human infections with swine influenza viruses appear to occur infrequently. However, the continuous reassortment with other influenza viruses and waning cross-protective immunity in humans may eventually lead to emergence of viruses with the potential to spread among humans.
