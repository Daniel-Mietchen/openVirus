<p>Generally, virus isolation is considered to be the "gold standard" for diagnosing diseases. Other assays including antigen detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), conventional reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and real-time RT-PCR are recommended as primary diagnostic techniques by the Office International Des Epizooties or World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) World Reference Laboratory (WRL). All of these current methods are relatively time-consuming and laborious. To overcome these problems, a rapid, simple, and practical assay called reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) was first reported by Notomi et al. [

This is of particular interest because the ability to make a simple, rapid preclinical diagnosis would be extremely useful for controlling FMDV. In the current study, we compared the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP assay for detecting FMDV C in clinical samples to that of conventional RT-PCR.
