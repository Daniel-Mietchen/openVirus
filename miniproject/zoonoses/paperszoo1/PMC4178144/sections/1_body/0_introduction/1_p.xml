<p>Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a member of the genus 
 <italic>Aphthovirus</italic> of the family 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, and includes seven different serotypes [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. FMDV serotypes O and A are widely distributed worldwide. In contrast, FMDV serotypes SAT 1, SAT 2, and SAT 3 are normally restricted to Africa while FMDV serotype Asia 1 is limited to Asia [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Historically, FMDV serotype C (FMDV C) has had a narrow geographic distribution compared to both type O and type A. This virus had not been identified in Southeast Asia until it was introduced into the Philippines in 1976 [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. No more case was confirmed after Kenya in 2005 and the Amazon region of Brazil in 2004 [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It has been assumed that FMDV C is disappearing from Africa [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, an investigation by Tekleghiorghis et al. [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and similar research in Uganda [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] indicated that FMDV C may still exist in Eritrea. These findings suggest that FMDV C might be circulating without being detected.
