<p>To compare the detection limits of RT-LAMP and RT-PCR, 10-fold serial dilutions of all samples [3.25 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> ng/mL to 3.25 × 10
 <sup>-1</sup> ng/mL, measured by DU Series 700 (Beckman Coulter, Germany)] were prepared to analyze the sensitivities of the two techniques. To assess the specificity of RT-LAMP, 41 clinical samples including 4 FMDV C, 10 FMDV A, 12 FMDV Asia 1, 10 FMDV O, 4 PRRSV, and one negative control (
