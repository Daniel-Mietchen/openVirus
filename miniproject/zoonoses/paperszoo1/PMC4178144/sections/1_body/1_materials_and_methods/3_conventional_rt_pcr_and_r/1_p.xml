<p>The detection of FMDV by RT-PCR was performed with previously described primers [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A conserved sequence in the VP1 region of FMDV C genome was selected as the target sequence for RT-PCR (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) for VP1 can discriminate FMDV C from FMDV O, A and Asia 1 as well as other viruses, such as SVDV. RT-PCR was performed in a 25-µL reaction containing PrimeScript 1 step Enzyme Mix 1 µL (Takara Bio), 2×1 step buffer (Takara Bio) 12.5 µL , RNase Free dH
 <sub>2</sub>O (Takara Bio) 8.9 µL, 0.8 µL of each upstream and downstream primer, template RNA 1 µL.
