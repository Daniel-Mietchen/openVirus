<p>A set of four RT-LAMP primers including two outer primers and two inner primers that recognize six distinct regions in the conserved target sequence of all topotypes of the virus were designed based on FMDV C genome sequence alignment in National Center for Biotechnology Information (GenBank Accession No. M90368.1; 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). RT-LAMP was carried out in a conventional water bath (Beijing Changan Scientific instrument, China) in a 25-µL reaction containing 2.0 µM each of FIP and BIP primer, 0.2 µM each of F and B primer, 1.0 mM of each deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), 8 U of 
 <italic>Bst</italic> DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, USA), and 1 U of THERMO-X reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, USA), 2.5-µL 10× buffer (containing 4 mM of MgSO
 <sub>4</sub> and 0.8 M betaine), and 1 µL of extracted template RNA in a 0.2-mL Eppendorf tube (Axygen Scientific, USA). Amplification was performed at 60℃ for 45 min and then terminated by A; Lane 3, FMDV Asia 1; Lane 4, FMDV O; and Lane 5, SVDV. heating the reactions at 80℃ for 10 min. The RT-LAMP and RT-PCR products were separated by 2.5% agarose gel electrophoresis for analysis.
