<p>A positive RT-LAMP result was associated with the appearance of many bands of different sizes viewed by agarose electrophoresis. Amplification by RT-LAMP produced different bands with a ladder-like pattern (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, the detection limit of RT-PCR was 3.25 × 10
 <sup>0</sup> ng/mL. In contrast, the detection limit of RT-LAMP was about 3.25 × 10
 <sup>-1</sup> ng/mL which was 10 times higher than the limit of conventional RT-PCR.
