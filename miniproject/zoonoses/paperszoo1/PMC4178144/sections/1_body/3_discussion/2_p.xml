<p>Previous studies [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] indicated that FMDV C may circulate without being detected. Therefore, the development of a highly sensitive assay for detecting FMDV C is critical for preventing and controlling FMDV C epidemics. The four samples containing FMDV C were identified as positive while the one negative control and 36 samples containing other viruses were identified as negative (

Due to its rapidity, sensitivity, and specificity, the RT-LAMP assay is suitable for making clinical diagnoses and FMDV C surveillance. Results from this study indicated that RT-LAMP was 10 times more sensitive than traditional RT-PCR. The detection limit of RT-LAMP demonstrated that this assay would increase the likelihood of recognizing FMDV C in animals or animal products. Furthermore, RT-LAMP might be developed for confirming virus serotypes.
