FMDV serotypes O and A are widely distributed worldwide. In contrast, FMDV serotypes SAT 1, SAT 2, and SAT 3 are normally restricted to Africa while FMDV serotype Asia 1 is limited to Asia [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Historically, FMDV serotype C (FMDV C) has had a narrow geographic distribution compared to both type O and type A. This virus had not been identified in Southeast Asia until it was introduced into the Philippines in 1976 [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. No more case was confirmed after Kenya in 2005 and the Amazon region of Brazil in 2004 [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It has been assumed that FMDV C is disappearing from Africa [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, an investigation by Tekleghiorghis et al. [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and similar research in Uganda [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] indicated that FMDV C may still exist in Eritrea. These findings suggest that FMDV C might be circulating without being detected.</p><p>Generally, virus isolation is considered to be the "gold standard" for diagnosing diseases. Other assays including antigen detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), conventional reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and real-time RT-PCR are recommended as primary diagnostic techniques by the Office International Des Epizooties or World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) World Reference Laboratory (WRL). All of these current methods are relatively time-consuming and laborious. To overcome these problems, a rapid, simple, and practical assay called reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) was first reported by Notomi et al. [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the capability of RT-LAMP to detect FMDV C RNA has not been evaluated. This is of particular interest because the ability to make a simple, rapid preclinical diagnosis would be extremely useful for controlling FMDV. In the current study, we compared the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP assay for detecting FMDV C in clinical samples to that of conventional RT-PCR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Viral strains and samples</title><p>Clinical samples of FMDV O/CHA/1999, A/CHA/2009, and Asia 1/CHA/2005 as well as swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) were provided from the OIE and China National Foot-and-Mouth Disease Reference Laboratory. FMDV C that was introduced from a laboratory in the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was incubated on Baby Hamster Syrian Kindey Cell (BHK-21), which is a subclone (clone 13) of the parental line established from the kidneys of five unsexed mice, provided by the OIE and China National Foot-and-Mouth Disease Reference Laboratory. Identities of all viruses in the 41 samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) were confirmed by RT-PCR, and the procedure is as follows, 50&#x02103; for 30 min, 95&#x02103; for 8 min, 35 cycles of 94&#x02103; for 1 min, 58&#x02103; for 1 min and 72&#x02103; for 1 min, extension at 72&#x02103; for 10 min.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction</title><p>RNA was extracted from the positive samples which are FMDV O/CHA/1999, A/CHA/2009, and Asia 1/CHA/2005 as well as SVDV provided by China National Foot-and-Mouth Disease Reference Laboratory and blood of healthy pig which was negatively detected by RT-PCR or ELISA for FMDV assay, with a TaKaRa MiniBEST Viral RNA/DNA Extraction Kit (ver. 4.0; Takara Bio, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

RT-LAMP was carried out in a conventional water bath (Beijing Changan Scientific instrument, China) in a 25-&#x000b5;L reaction containing 2.0 &#x000b5;M each of FIP and BIP primer, 0.2 &#x000b5;M each of F and B primer, 1.0 mM of each deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), 8 U of <italic>Bst</italic> DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, USA), and 1 U of THERMO-X reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, USA), 2.5-&#x000b5;L 10&#x000d7; buffer (containing 4 mM of MgSO<sub>4</sub> and 0.8 M betaine), and 1 &#x000b5;L of extracted template RNA in a 0.2-mL Eppendorf tube (Axygen Scientific, USA). Amplification was performed at 60&#x02103; for 45 min and then terminated by A; Lane 3, FMDV Asia 1; Lane 4, FMDV O; and Lane 5, SVDV. heating the reactions at 80&#x02103; for 10 min. The RT-LAMP and RT-PCR products were separated by 2.5% agarose gel electrophoresis for analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of RT-LAMP sensitivity and specificity</title><p>To compare the detection limits of RT-LAMP and RT-PCR, 10-fold serial dilutions of all samples [3.25 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> ng/mL to 3.25 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-1</sup> ng/mL, measured by DU Series 700 (Beckman Coulter, Germany)] were prepared to analyze the sensitivities of the two techniques. To assess the specificity of RT-LAMP, 41 clinical samples including 4 FMDV C, 10 FMDV A, 12 FMDV Asia 1, 10 FMDV O, 4 PRRSV, and one negative control (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) were analyzed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Comparison of RT-LAMP and RT-PCR sensitivity</title><p>A positive RT-LAMP result was associated with the appearance of many bands of different sizes viewed by agarose electrophoresis.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, the detection limit of RT-PCR was 3.25 &#x000d7; 10<sup>0</sup> ng/mL.

Early detection of FMD is essential for effective disease control. Simple, rapid, and noninvasive diagnostic tests are critical for FMD diagnosis.</p><p>Previous studies [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] indicated that FMDV C may circulate without being detected. Therefore, the development of a highly sensitive assay for detecting FMDV C is critical for preventing and controlling FMDV C epidemics. The four samples containing FMDV C were identified as positive while the one negative control and 36 samples containing other viruses were identified as negative (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The assay can be completed within 1 h. Due to its rapidity, sensitivity, and specificity, the RT-LAMP assay is suitable for making clinical diagnoses and FMDV C surveillance. Results from this study indicated that RT-LAMP was 10 times more sensitive than traditional RT-PCR. The detection limit of RT-LAMP demonstrated that this assay would increase the likelihood of recognizing FMDV C in animals or animal products. Furthermore, RT-LAMP might be developed for confirming virus serotypes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Clinical samples were provided by the OIE, National Foot and Mouth Disease Reference Laboratory of Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), China.
