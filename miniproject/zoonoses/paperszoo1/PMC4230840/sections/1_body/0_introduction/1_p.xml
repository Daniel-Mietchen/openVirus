<p>Zoonotic infectious diseases have been important concerns to humans since the beginning of the domestication of animals 10,000 years ago. Infectious diseases remain a significant cause of mortality and morbidity globally; approximately 75% of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are zoonoses 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003257-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The phenomenon of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases is driven by various anthropogenic factors, including the following: genetic and biological factors, such as microbial adaptation to macro- and microenvironmental changes along with changes in host susceptibility to infection; environmental factors, including climate change, changes in ecosystems, and changes in human and animal population densities; and socioeconomic and political factors, such as increasing international travel and commerce, social inequality, poverty, conflict, famine, lack of political will, and changes in economic development and land use. In an Institute of Medicine report 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003257-Smolinski1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, the dynamics of these factors were referred to as a “convergence model,” with these forces creating the perfect microbial storm to accelerate the emergence of new infectious diseases.
