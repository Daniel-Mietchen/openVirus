  <title>Pulmonary and respiratory sinus expression of SARS-CoV and influenza virus activating proteases and receptors.</title>
  <p>Lung (A–D) and sinus (E–H) tissue immunostained for TMPRSS2 (A&amp;E), ACE2 (B&amp;F) and HAT (C&amp;G), or stained for 2,6-linked sialic acid (D&amp;H; detected with elderberry (
   <italic>Sambucus nigra</italic>) lectin). All positive reactions are detected with the peroxidase technique (brown) and the tissue is counterstained with haematoxylin (blue). (A) There is strong positive anti-TMPRSS2 immunostaining of bronchial epithelium (lining the bronchus, marked Br), type 2 pneumocytes (P2) and alveolar macrophages (Mp). (B) There is moderately strong positive anti-ACE2 immunostaining of bronchial epithelium (lining the bronchus, marked Br), type 2 pneumocytes (P2) and alveolar macrophages (Mp). (C) There is moderately positive anti-HAT immunostaining of bronchial epithelium (lining the bronchus, marked Br) and alveolar macrophages (Mp), with weakly positive immunostaining of some type 1 (P1) and type 2 pneumocytes (P2). (D) All structures are strongly stained for 2,6-sialic acid except for smooth muscle (SM). (E) There is strong positive anti-TMPRSS2 immunostaining of sinus epithelium (Ep) and lymphoid cells (Ly). (F) There is strong positive anti-ACE2 immunostaining of sinus epithelium (Ep) and lymphoid cells (Ly). (G) There is moderately strong anti-HAT immunostaining of sinus epithelium (Ep) and occasional weakly positive immunostaining of lymphoid cells (Ly). (H) All structures are strongly stained for 2,6-sialic acid. Scale bar = 50 microns (shown in panels D and H and also pertaining to 3 preceding panels in each case).
