   <bold>To detect SARS-S cleavage in trans, expression plasmids coding for SARS-S and the indicated proteases or empty vector (pcDNA) were separately transfected into 293T cells.</bold> Subsequently, the SARS-S and protease expressing cells were mixed, treated with trypsin or PBS and S-protein cleavage was detected by Western blot analysis using a serum specific for the S1 subunit of SARS-S. SARS-S cleavage fragments produced by trypsin and TMPRSS2 are indicated by asterisks. Detection of ÃŸ-actin served as a loading control.
