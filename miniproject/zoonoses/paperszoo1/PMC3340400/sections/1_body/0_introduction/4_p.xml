<p>Despite the intriguing findings made in cell culture, the role of TMPRSS2 and HAT in influenza virus and SARS-CoV spread and pathogenesis remains to be defined. For this, it is essential to determine the extent of TMPRSS2 and HAT expression in viral target cells in human tissues. Here, we show that TMPRSS2 and HAT are coexpressed with ACE2 and 2,6-linked sialic acids, the key receptor determinants of SARS-CoV and influenza virus, respectively, in major portions of the human respiratory tract, indicating that these proteases could support SARS-CoV and influenza virus spread in humans. In addition, we demonstrate that HA activation is conserved between human TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS2 of animal species critically involved in zoonotic transmission of influenza virus, underlining a potentially important role of this protease in the influenza virus zoonosis.</p>
