<p>The SARS-CoV spike protein (SARS-S) and the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) are inserted into the viral membranes and mediate host cell entry. For this, SARS-S and influenza HA bind to host cell receptors, ACE2 (SARS-CoV)

 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Skehel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and mediate the fusion of the viral membrane with a host cell membrane. As a consequence, viral components are released into the host cell and can subvert the synthetic capabilities of the host cell for production and release of progeny particles.
