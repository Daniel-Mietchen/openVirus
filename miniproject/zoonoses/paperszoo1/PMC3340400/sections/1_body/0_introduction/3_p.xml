<p>The influenza HA and the SARS-S-protein are both synthesized as inactive precursors which transit into their active forms upon cleavage by host cell proteases. Cleavage of SARS-S and influenza HA is essential for viral infectivity and the responsible proteases are targets for antiviral intervention

 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Simmons1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, but their nature is incompletely defined. Recent evidence indicates that the type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and HAT can activate human influenza viruses for spread in protease transfected cells
