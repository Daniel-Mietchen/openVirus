<p>TMPRSS2 on target cells activates SARS-S on adjacent cells for cell-cell fusion and activates virion-associated SARS-S for infectious host cell entry

 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Shulla1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. A wide range of sites demonstrated coexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and could thus support SARS-CoV spread (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0035876-t001">table 1</xref>). Specifically, in the lung type 2, but not type 1 pneumocytes express both molecules, as do alveolar macrophages and the epithelial cells of intrapulmonary bronchi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035876-g002">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). In the upper respiratory tract, the epithelium of the bronchi, larynx, nasal mucosa and respiratory sinuses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035876-g002">Fig. 2 E, F</xref>) expresses both molecules, while ACE2 expression is absent from the trachea, vocal folds and epiglottis, although a previous study by Ren et al demonstrated ACE2 expression on the surface epithelium and mucus gland epithelium of trachea, similar to our findings in the larynx and bronchus 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Ren1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. This suggests that ACE2 expression may be variable but widespread in the upper airway. The epithelia of the tonsil (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035876-g002">Fig. 2E, F</xref>) express both TMPRSS2 and ACE2. Additionally, ACE2 expression by some interstitial macrophages/dendritic cells in intra-alveolar septa of the lung, adjacent to TMPRSS2-expressing type 2 pneumocytes. In the gastrointestinal tract, epithelial co-expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 was identified at all sites examined, namely the oesophagus, stomach, ileum and colon. The two molecules were also expressed in cardiac myocytes. Furthermore, variable expression of both molecules by endothelial cells and myoctes of blood vessels, leucocytes and smooth muscle cells was seen (
