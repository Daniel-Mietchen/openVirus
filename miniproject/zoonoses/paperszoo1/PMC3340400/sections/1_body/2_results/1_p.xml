<p>Influenza viruses circulate in birds and poultry, with water fowl constituting the natural reservoir, and coinfection of swine with different influenza viruses is believed to play an important role in the emergence of pandemic viruses

 <xref rid="pone.0035876-BottcherFriebertshauser1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In order to assess the role of TMPRSS2 in the influenza virus zoonosis, we tested whether this protease derived from chicken and swine is able to cleave HA. In parallel, we examined if TMPRSS2 of mouse origin facilitates HA proteolysis, since mice are commonly used as a model system for influenza virus spread and pathogenesis. Finally, cleavage and activation of HA by human and mouse HAT and TMPRSS4 were also evaluated.
