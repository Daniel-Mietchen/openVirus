<p>Western blot analysis of transfected cells revealed that TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and HAT of all animal species tested cleaved the HA precursor HA0 and produced HA1 cleavage fragments identical to those observed for the human enzymes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035876-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The slightly faster migration of HA1 fragments generated by TMPRSS2 compared to the other proteases is due to differential HA glycosylation 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Bertram2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Cleavage resulted in HA activation, since lentiviral vectors produced in the protease expressing cells were fully infectious in the absence of trypsin treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035876-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). In contrast, no HA cleavage and activation was observed in cells transfected with empty vector or cells expressing human TMPRSS3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035876-g001">Fig. 1A,B</xref>), which was previously demonstrated not to process HA 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Bertram2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Similarly, swine, chicken and mouse TMPRSS2 cleaved SARS-S into multiple fragments, as previously documented for human TMPRSS2 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Glowacka1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, although some variation in cleavage efficiency was noted (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035876-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). In contrast, trypsin digestion produced the S1 subunit, as expected 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Bergeron1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Yao1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Of note, SARS-S was cleaved by TMPRSS2 upon coexpression of both proteins (cis cleavage, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035876-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and upon mixing of SARS-S expressing cells with protease expressing cells (trans cleavage, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0035876.s001">Fig. S1</xref>), although some variability in cleavage efficiency was noted in the latter setting. In agreement with SARS-S trans cleavage, expression of TMPRSS2 in target cells (TMPRSS2 panels) endogenously expressing very low amounts of viral receptor, ACE2 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, allowed efficient SARS-S-driven cell-cell fusion and fusion efficiency was not increased by the addition of trypsin. In contrast, SARS-S-driven fusion with control transfected cells (pcDNA panel) was inefficient and fusion efficiency was rescued by trypsin treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035876-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Finally, transfection of ACE2 plasmid into target cells (ACE2 panel) also boosted cell-cell fusion and fusion efficiency was only modestly increased by trypsin, in agreement with our previous finding that receptor and protease expression on target cells can both limit SARS-S-mediated cell-cell fusion 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Simmons2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In sum, these results demonstrate that cleavage-activation of influenza HA and SARS-S is conserved between human, porcine, avian and murine TMPRSS2 as well as human and murine HAT. Our observations also suggest that TMPRSS2 can support influenza virus spread in species integral to the influenza zoonosis, and that mice are suitable models to study the role of TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and HAT in viral spread and pathogenesis.
