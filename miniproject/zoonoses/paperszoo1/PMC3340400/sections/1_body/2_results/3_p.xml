<p>Binding of human influenza viruses to 2,6-linked sialic acids present on proteins and lipids on the host cell surface is critical for infectious viral entry into host cells 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Skehel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. We assessed whether TMPRSS2 and HAT are coexpressed with 2,6-linked sialic acid human tissues. Immunostaining demonstrated the presence of 2,6-linked sialic acids on the surface of almost all cell types (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035876-g003">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035876-g004">4</xref>), in keeping with previous results

 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Yao2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, with the notable exception of vascular smooth muscle cells (data not shown), suggesting that expression of proteases, such as TMPRSS2 and HAT, but not 2,6-linked sialic acid is likely to be a major determinant of viral tropism. TMPRSS2 was expressed by epithelial cells at all sites examined in the aerodigestive tracts, as well as by many endothelial cells and myocytes of blood vessels, leucocytes (including alveolar macrophages) and smooth muscle cells (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0035876-t001">table 1</xref>), indicating that TMPRSS2 could activate influenza virus in most permissive epithelia. HAT showed a distribution similar to TMPRSS2 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035876-g003">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035876-g004">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0035876-t001">table 1</xref>), but immunostaining of pneumocytes (alveolar epithelial cells) was weaker, implying low levels of protease expression at this site (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035876-g002">Fig. 2A, C</xref>). Unlike TMPRSS2, which appeared to be expressed by the majority of type 2 pneumocytes, HAT was expressed by fewer than 50% type 2 pneumocytes, but was additionally seen to be expressed by occasional type 1 pneumocytes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035876-g002">Fig. 2A, C</xref>). Type 2 pneumocytes are defined by their morphology rather than a particular immunophenotype, being plump rather than flattened epithelial cells 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. All sections were examined by an experienced consultant pathologist (ES) in order to identify the cell types that were immunopositive. The exact intensities of staining for TMPRSS2 and HAT of various epithelial types in the aerodigestive tracts are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0035876-t001">table 1</xref>. While TMPRSS2 expression by bronchial and intestinal smooth muscle cells was noted, these cells appeared negative for HAT, although some vascular smooth muscle cells were found to be positive (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0035876-t001">table 1</xref>). Interestingly, TMPRSS2 but not HAT was expressed by cardiac myocytes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035876-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), suggesting that influenza myocarditis might be promoted by TMPRSS2 but not HAT. Notwithstanding, our data demonstrate the potential importance of both proteases in influenza infection.
