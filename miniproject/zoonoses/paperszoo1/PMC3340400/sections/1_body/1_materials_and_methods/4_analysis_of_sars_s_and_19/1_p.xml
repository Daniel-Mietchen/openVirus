<p>For the detection of HA and SARS-S-cleavage in cis, 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding SARS-S 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Hofmann1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> or 1918 HA and plasmids encoding the indicated proteases or empty vector (pcDNA). For analysis of SARS-S cleavage in trans, plasmids encoding SARS-S 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Hofmann1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and proteases were transfected separately into 293T cells followed by mixing of the transfected cells. Subsequently, the cells were treated with PBS or trypsin, lysed, separated via 12,5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. SARS-S was detected by staining with rabbit serum raised against the S1 subunit of SARS-S subunit 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-He1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. For detection of HA, a mouse monoclonal antibody was used 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Glaser1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. As a loading control, the stripped membranes were incubated with an anti-ÃŸ-actin antibody (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany). Bound antibodies were detected with HRP-coupled secondary antibodies (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany).
