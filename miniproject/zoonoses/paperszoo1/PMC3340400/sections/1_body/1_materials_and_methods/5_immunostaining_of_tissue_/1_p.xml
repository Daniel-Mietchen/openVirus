<p>Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue samples of a wide range of tissues from the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, as well as the myocardium, were obtained from the Oxford Radcliffe Biobank, with full ethical approval from the National Research and Ethics Service (Oxfordshire Research and Ethics Committee A: reference 04/Q1604/21). While all patients gave generic consent for the use of their tissue in research at the time of signing a consent form for surgery, informed consent from each patient for the use of tissue in this study was not required by the National Research and Ethics Service, because all tissue was anonymised. Tissue sections were immunostained for TMPRSS2, HAT and ACE2 or with the elderberry lectin, 
 <italic>Sambucus nigra</italic>, that detects 2,6-linked sialic acids. Antigen retrieval was performed by pressure cooking in different antigen retrieval solutions. Slides were mounted in Aquatex mounting medium (Merck, UK). ACE2 immunostaining (affinity purified goat polyclonal serum, R&amp;D Systems, Abingdon, UK) was performed and detected using a mouse anti-goat Ig (GTI-75) 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Tedoldi1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and the Novolink™ max polymer detection system (Leica Microsystems, Newcastle, UK), as per the manufacturer's instructions after antigen retrieval in citrate pH 6.0. TMPRSS2 (mouse monoclonal antibody P5H9 A3 ascites, a generous gift from Dr J.M. Lucas, Division of Human Biology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA, 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Lucas1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>) immunostaining was detected using the NovolinkTM max polymer detection system after antigen retrieval in Tris EDTA pH9.0. HAT immunostaining (mouse monoclonal antibody 337029, R&amp;D Systems, Abingdon, UK) was performed using the Novolink™ max polymer detection system after antigen retrieval in Dako Target retrieval solution pH 6.0 (Dako, Cambridge, UK). Biotinylated elderberry lectin (Sambucus nigra) (Vector labs, Peterborough, UK) binding was detected using Streptavidin-HRP (Ar-Med Limited, Egham, UK) and detected using Dako DAB chromogen substrate (Dako, Cambridge, UK) after antigen retrieval in Tris-EDTA pH 9.0. Lung tissue was used as a positive control for TMPRSS2, ACE2 and elderberry lectin staining

 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Glowacka1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, while bronchus was used as a positive control for HAT immunostaining 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Takahashi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. As a negative control for ACE2 immunostaining and elderberry lectin staining, normal goat polyclonal serum was substituted for the primary antibody/lectin staining step. As a negative control for TMPRSS2 and HAT immunostaining, an irrelevant mouse monoclonal (anti-ALK1 antibody, clone ALK1 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Pulford1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>) was substituted for the primary antibody. Stained sections were photographed with a Nikon DS-FI1 camera with a Nikon DS-L2 control unit (Nikon UK Limited, Kingston-upon-Thames, UK) and an Olympus BX40 microscope (Olympus UK Limited, Watford, UK).
