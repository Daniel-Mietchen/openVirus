<p>For analysis of cell-cell fusion, 293T effector cells seeded in 6-well plates were CaPO
 <sub>4</sub>-transfected with either empty pcDNA plasmids or plasmids encoding SARS- S in combination with plasmid pGAL4-VP16 encoding the Herpes Simplex transactivator VP16 fused to GAL4, as described 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Glowacka1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In parallel, 293T target cells were seeded in 48-well plates and transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated proteases or empty plasmid together with plasmid pGal5-luc, which encodes a promoter with five Gal4 binding sites in front of a luciferase gene. Transfected effector and target cells were mixed, incubated with trypsin or PBS and fusion was quantified by determination of luciferase activities in cell lysates 48 h after cocultivation using a commercially available kit (Promega, Madison, USA).
