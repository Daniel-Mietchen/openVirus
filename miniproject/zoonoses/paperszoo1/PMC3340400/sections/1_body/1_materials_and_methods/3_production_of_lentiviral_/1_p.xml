<p>For generation of lentiviral pseudoparticles, CaPO
 <sub>4</sub> transfections were performed as described 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Glowacka1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Briefly, 293T cells were transiently cotransfected with pNL4-3 E-R- Luc 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Connor1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and expression plasmids coding for influenza virus HA and neuraminidase (NA) or vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Chaipan1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. For analysis of HA activation by TTSPs, expression plasmids for the indicated proteases 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Bertram2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Glowacka1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> or empty vector were cotransfected into cells producing pseudoparticles. The culture medium was replaced at 16 h and harvested at 48 h post transfection. The supernatants were passed through 0.45 µm filters and stored at −80°C. For infection, pseudoparticles were treated with either PBS or trypsin followed by incubation with 293T target cells for three days before cells were lysed and luciferase-activities determined using a commercially available kit (Promega, Madison, USA).
