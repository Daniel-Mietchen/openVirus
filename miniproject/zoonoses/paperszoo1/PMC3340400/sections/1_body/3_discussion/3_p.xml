<p>The mode of cleavage activation is a major virulence determinant of avian influenza viruses

 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Ito1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Viruses with a multi-basic cleavage site in HA are believed to be activated by ubiquitously expressed host cell proteases and can thus replicate systemically and cause severe disease 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Bertram2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In contrast, it has been posited that replication of viruses with a mono-basic cleavage site is confined to the aerodigestive tract, because the expression of as yet unidentified HA-activating protease(s) is limited to this organ 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Bertram2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Our results suggest that TMPRSS2 could be the elusive protease, but it remains to be demonstrated whether TMPRSS2 expression in waterfowl and poultry is indeed specific for the aerodigestive tract. HA activation was conserved between avian, porcine and human TMPRSS2, which share high sequence identity (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0035876.s002">figure S2</xref>), indicating that TMPRSS2 might support influenza virus spread not only in the reservoir (waterfowl) and humans but also in an important intermediate host (swine).
