<p>Collectively, our findings are compatible with an important role of TMPRSS2 and HAT in influenza virus and of TMPRSS2 in SARS-coronavirus infection. Knock down of these proteases in primary pulmonary cells and the analysis of 
 <italic>Tmprss2</italic> knock-out mice would allow to precise definition of the role of these proteases in viral spread. The latter animals are available 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> and do not show an obvious phenotype, indicating that TMPRSS2 might be an attractive target for novel drugs active against respiratory viruses.
