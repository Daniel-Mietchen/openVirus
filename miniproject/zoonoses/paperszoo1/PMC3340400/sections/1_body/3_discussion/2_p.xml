<p>Influenza viruses usually replicate in the tracheao-bronchial epithelium 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Kuiken1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-vanRiel1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Spread in these tissues might be supported by both TMPRSS2 and HAT, which we found to be expressed by cells positive for 2,6-linked sialic acid in the nasal and buccal mucosa as well as in the epithelium of trachea, bronchus and larynx. If infection is associated with pneumonia, a complication more frequently observed with pandemic compared to seasonal influenza viruses, viral spread to the alveolar epithelium is observed 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Kuiken1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Type I pneumocytes have been suggested to be major targets of influenza virus in the alveoli 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-vanRiel1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and were found to be positive for 2,6-linked sialic acid in this study. The protease responsible for HA activation in these cells remains to be defined, since TMPRSS2 was absent from this cell type and expression of HAT was infrequent and weak. However, other studies found that type II pneumocytes are preferentially infected 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Shieh1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and these cells were identified as positive for 2,6-linked sialic acid, TMPRSS2 and occasionally for HAT within the present study. The presence of cells positive for 2,6-linked sialic acid, TMPRSS2 and/or HAT was not limited to the respiratory tract, in keeping with published findings which demonstrate TMPRSS2 expression in the epithelia of several organs 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Lucas1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Jacquinet1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Vaarala1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. It is therefore tempting to speculate that TMPRSS2 and HAT might also support viral spread outside the lung and might thus contribute to complications associated with influenza infection, like gastrointestinal manifestations, myocarditis and encephalopathy 
 <xref rid="pone.0035876-Kuiken1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In sum, TMPRSS2 and, with the exception of the alveolar epithelium, HAT could activate influenza viruses throughout the respiratory tract and might support viral spread in extra-respiratory tissues.
