A key question in the study of emerging zoonoses is how the evolution of transmission efficiency interacts with heterogeneity in contact patterns in the new host species, as this interplay influences disease dynamics and prospects for control. Here we use a synergistic mixture of models and data to tease apart the evolutionary and demographic processes controlling a host-range shift in equine H3N8-derived canine influenza virus (CIV). CIV has experienced 15 years of continuous transfer among dogs in the United States, but maintains a patchy distribution, characterized by sporadic short-lived outbreaks coupled with endemic hotspots in large animal shelters. We show that CIV has a high reproductive potential in these facilities (mean R<sub>0</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3.9) and that these hotspots act as refugia from the sparsely connected majority of the dog population. Intriguingly, CIV has evolved a transmission efficiency that closely matches the minimum required to persist in these refugia, leaving it poised on the extinction/invasion threshold of the host contact network. Corresponding phylogenetic analyses show strong geographic clustering in three US regions, and that the effective reproductive number of the virus (R<sub>e</sub>) in the general dog population is close to 1.0. Our results highlight the critical role of host contact structure in CIV dynamics, and show how host contact networks could shape the evolution of pathogen transmission efficiency. Importantly, efficient control measures could eradicate the virus, in turn minimizing the risk of future sustained transmission among companion dogs that could represent a potential new axis to the human-animal interface for influenza.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Influenza virus infects a range of vertebrate hosts, including domesticated animals as well as humans. Some of the most serious influenza pandemics in humans have involved host range shifts, when an influenza virus jumps from one host species to another. Importantly, however, host range shifts do not always cause pandemics. Rather, epidemiological patterns tend to be unpredictable in new host species, causing disease patterns that change over space and time. In this paper, we analyze epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of canine influenza virus (CIV), which jumped to dogs in the late 1990s from an equine strain (EIV) prevalent in horses. We show that the epidemiology and evolution of CIV is strongly influenced by heterogeneous patterns of infectious contact among dogs in the US. A few large populations in metropolitan animal shelters serve as reservoirs for CIV, but the virus cannot be maintained for long in smaller facilities or in the companion dog population without input from the larger shelters, which represent disease hotspots. These hotspot dynamics give a clear picture of what can happen in the time between the beginning of a host range shift and the onset of a possible pandemic, allowing more targeted strategies for control and eradication.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by NIH/NIGMS grant 2 R01 GM080533 to CRP and ECH.

Two recent pandemics in humans &#x02013; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and H1N1 influenza in 2009 &#x02013; involved host-range shifts in respiratory zoonotic viruses <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Guan1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, while the recently documented Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has similarly emerged from an animal reservoir to pose a growing risk to the human population <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Coleman1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Importantly, however, cross-species transmission events do not always lead to pandemics. Rather, zoonoses emerging in new host species tend to have patchy and dynamic prevalence patterns in space and time. As a result, the probability that an emerging zoonosis will take hold in a new host population has been difficult to assess <italic>a priori</italic>, which limits our capacity to use targeted interventions to avert pandemics before they happen <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Morse1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>A variety of host-pathogen interactions may follow a species jump, and revealing their determinants is essential to understanding the process of zoonotic emergence. First, the emerging pathogen may be poorly adapted for replication and onward transmission in the new host population. This leads to inefficient transmission, where many potentially infectious contacts between susceptible and infected individuals fail to spread the disease, due for example to a low pathogen load in the infected individual. In this case, the disease will have a lower basic reproductive number (R<sub>0</sub> &#x02013; the number of secondary infections caused by a typical infected individual in an entirely susceptible population) in the recipient host than its recent ancestor in the donor host. Inefficient transmission following a spillover event may lead to &#x0201c;stuttering chains&#x0201d; of infection marked by patchy patterns of disease prevalence interspersed with stochastic fadeouts. Even if a pathogen has R<sub>0</sub> above 1 (a necessary but not sufficient condition for self-sustaining spread), values of R<sub>0</sub> that are only marginally above 1 are associated with a higher probability of stochastic extinction. The probability that a pathogen will establish itself (in a large homogeneously mixed population of susceptible hosts) following the introduction of <italic>n</italic> infected individuals is given by 1&#x02212;(1/R<sub>0</sub>)<italic><sup>n</sup></italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1004455-May1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>The heterogeneity in prevalence of emerging pathogens may also reflect the demographic variability inherent to host populations. In smaller host populations random variation in the timing and frequency of births, deaths, immigration, emigration, and contacts between infected and non-infected individuals, as well as in the timing of individual infections, can have profound effects on epidemic dynamics <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Antia1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004455-Arinaminpathy1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Emerging pathogens that result from spillover into new hosts are by definition initially confined to a small population, in the sense that the first infected individual(s) will have limited numbers of potential contacts to whom they can spread the disease. This, in turn, makes the epidemic dynamics of emerging pathogens inherently stochastic <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Newman1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Meyers1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Finally, evolutionary change in emerging pathogens can affect both their basic reproductive number, and their response to demographic variability. Pathogen evolution can result in R<sub>0</sub> increasing toward or above 1.0 after repeated spillover events from the reservoir population, or during a chain of transmission in the new host, either of which could result in the emergence and selection of host-adaptive mutations. The occurrence of multiple outbreaks over time may also increase the likelihood that the pathogen evolves toward a point when it can be self-sustaining in the new host <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Arinaminpathy1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Recent analytical frameworks that unite the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of host-pathogen interactions can help identify the processes that drive epidemiological and phylogenetic patterns during and after host-range shifts <xref rid="ppat.1004455-LloydSmith1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Arinaminpathy1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Stadler1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Here we study the population dynamics and evolution of equine-H3N8 derived canine influenza virus (CIV) in the US, and use the results to propose control strategies. CIV emerged following the transfer of a single H3N8 equine influenza (EIV) to dogs from horses around 1999. Direct descendants of that virus have been circulating continuously in dogs since that time <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Crawford1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004455-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. CIV was first recognized as the cause of disease in greyhounds in a training facility in Florida in 2004 and was transferred to various states in the US with the racing greyhounds, eventually spreading to other breeds <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Crawford1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The hemagglutinin (HA) sequence of CIV was genetically distinct from EIV by 2004, forming a separate monophyletic group from EIV in phylogenetic trees <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Crawford1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Notably, there is no evidence of CIV transfer back to horses, onward to humans, nor of reassortment involving CIV and other influenza viruses <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Krueger1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Furthermore, although some other H3N8 EIV spillovers from horses into dogs have been reported, these only comprised single infections or small outbreaks that rapidly faded out <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Rivailler1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>Although CIV can readily transmit among dogs its prevalence remains patchy: it is enzootic in some regions of the US, but has thus far failed to establish outside of these enzootic regions <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Dubovi1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004455-Serra1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The overall seroprevalence of CIV in the companion (pet) dog population appears to be low (&#x0223c;3% or less depending on the region), with visits to canine daycare a risk factor <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Barrell1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Serra1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. CIV enzootic regions are typically associated with large animal shelters <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Holt1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, and the movement of the virus to different parts of the US is most likely associated with the transport of infected shelter dogs to facilities in other regions where they may be more readily adopted <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Pecoraro1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to CIV, its recent ancestor, H3N8 EIV, has been circulating widely in horses since before 1963 when it was first reported in Florida, having most likely been introduced with horses from South America <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Waddell1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The virus appears to spread continuously within and between many parts of North and South America, Europe, and Asia <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Daly1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004455-Bountouri1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. EIV has been introduced into countries that were previously free of the virus, including Australia and South Africa, causing significant outbreaks that extended over large distances, although these were controlled and the virus eradicated <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Daly1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Cowled1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Data from an outbreak in an unvaccinated population of racehorses places R<sub>0</sub> for EIV at 10.18 (95% confidence interval: 9.57&#x02013;10.89) in that context. In contrast, the reproductive number of EIV in vaccinated populations of racehorses has been estimated to be between 1.4 and 2.3 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Hughes1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. EIV has experienced marked evolution in all gene segments since it emerged, with evidence of antigenic variation in the HA gene, including phylogeographic patterns in HA variation, with distinct clades in Europe versus the US, and among US states <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Daly1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Daly2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Murcia1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>Although CIV and EIV are closely related, their epidemiology and evolutionary dynamics differ, with EIV seemingly more successful, and less heterogeneously distributed. Moreover, EIV continues to spread despite active control measures (particularly vaccination) whereas CIV retains a patchy distribution in the absence of significant control measures. An analysis of the phylogenetic history and ecology of CIV since its recent emergence from EIV may therefore reveal how host demography, disease dynamics, and pathogen evolution can combine to determine the prevalence patterns and risk posed by emerging zoonotic pathogens.</p><p>Here we combine individual-level data on the intake, output, and transfer rates of dogs among US animal shelters of different sizes, with CIV gene sequence data and available seroprevalence estimates, to identify the processes controlling disease dynamics in emerging zoonoses at the human-animal interface. We hypothesize that CIV persists through the presence of transmission hotspots, which rescue chains of transmission that fade out in other populations. The putative hotspots are large animal shelters in major metropolitan areas. After estimating R<sub>0</sub> from all available data we ask: are the population sizes of small shelters small enough to make fadeout significantly more likely than in large shelters? And do large shelters have good prospects of maintaining CIV in an enzootic state?</p><p>We then use the parameters from our analyses to determine what control measures would result in eradication of the virus. CIV is a prime target for eradication because it has both the potential to cause significant disease burden, and it is currently confined to a small subset of its host population. Effectively controlling CIV would improve conditions in metropolitan animal shelters, as well as minimizing the risk of zoonotic human infection posed by CIV, before it has the opportunity to evolve higher transmissibility in the companion dog population. A possible future scenario of sustained CIV transmission amongst companion animals would represent the evolution of a potentially significant new axis to the human-animal interface for influenza.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Phylogenetic Structure of CIV in the USA</title><p>To put the CIV sampled from animal shelters in a wider geographical context, and to reveal movement of the virus on a continental scale, we determined the HA1, M and NP gene sequences of recent CIV isolates, and conducted a phylogenetic analysis of these sequences combined with homologous sequences available on GenBank as well as the Influenza Research Database.

This overdispersion in host population size is a potentially important characteristic for the epidemiology of CIV because it indicates the presence of a few extraordinarily large shelters where a pathogen might persist more easily than in a host population of average size. Large well-connected populations are more favorable environments for emerging pathogens because variance in vital rates (e.g. the rate of arrival of new susceptible individuals) decreases predictably with population size. All else being equal, this makes large host populations more stable for sustained pathogen transmission.</p><fig id="ppat-1004455-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1004455.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Demography of dogs in US animal shelters.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cumulative distribution of median population size in each shelter (black dashed line) compared to a negative binomial distribution fitted to the data (solid red line), and a fitted Poisson distribution (dotted blue line).

In addition, without appealing to models it is clear from the demographic data that turnover rates in most shelters are too high for an inactivated vaccine to be effective, because those vaccines take more than a week to generate protective immunity. Since the expected residence time of a dog in an animal shelter is around 10 days, most dogs would have been part of the chain of transmission by the time an inactivated vaccine given at intake took effect, and then they would leave the shelter.</p><fig id="ppat-1004455-g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1004455.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Predicted performance of a control program administered to dogs on arrival in US animal shelters.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A vaccination (or other control measure) that removes individuals from the chain of transmission with 85% probability (&#x003ba;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.15) within 24 h (&#x003b1;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1 day) is predicted to eradicate CIV from shelters within six months.

This potential approach requires further research. In addition we note that the LAIV performance required to eradicate CIV is higher than what has been typically observed in other live influenza vaccines, and there is still much uncertainty about the rate at which protection would be acquired during the time that dogs spend in shelters (typically 1&#x02013;2 weeks) <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Barria1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.

Thus another interesting feature of the control simulations in a metapopulation framework is the sensitivity to migration parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In particular, we show that there are efficacious control strategies that would cause the virus to go locally extinct but that would fail to achieve global eradication.

In contrast, strains of CIV's recent ancestor (EIV H3N8) have been commonly found in horses around much of the world since at least 1963.

Our study investigates heterogeneity in CIV transmission and prevalence to better understand the processes that determine how zoonotic pathogens spread following a host range shift, and how these processes affect the performance of control and eradication strategies.</p><p>Stuttering chains of infection in recently emerged zoonoses are caused by two distinct mechanisms that may operate in tandem. The first is poor adaptation of the pathogen to its new host species, causing lower within-host replication rates that may reduce pathogen shedding and lead to inefficient transmission <xref rid="ppat.1004455-LloydSmith1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Transmission is inefficient because many potentially infectious contacts between infected and susceptible individuals fail to spread the infection. The second mechanism that generates stuttering chains is variation in contact rates among different subsets of the new host population, which can increase the probability of stochastic fadeouts <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Newman1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In this case the fadeouts are not caused by inefficient transmission but by exhausting the local supply of susceptible hosts.</p><p>Strikingly, host contact heterogeneity has received less attention as a potential driver of stuttering chains despite its fundamental role in disease dynamics. We found that contact heterogeneity plays a critical role in the patchy distribution of CIV. Demographic data indicate that most shelters are too small, and import susceptible individuals too slowly, to protect CIV from local stochastic extinction at its current reproductive rate. At the same time, the influence of contact heterogeneity on the spread of CIV would diminish if transmissibility were higher and the epidemiology of CIV (and similar zoonoses) generally represents an interaction between contact heterogeneity and transmission efficiency.</p><p>More evidence of contact heterogeneity appears at the inter-shelter scale. Observed transfer rates suggest that the majority of intakes and outputs are not associated with other shelters, so that shelter-to-shelter transfer has not created an effectively larger metapopulation of multiple shelters. While there are many millions of susceptible household dogs in the USA (around 80 million, about 25% the size of the human population), it is likely that they do not exhibit infectious contact patterns sufficient to maintain the virus in continuous transmission (see below). Hence, this work shows that apparent stuttering chains of transmission are not always driven by poor adaptation of an emerging pathogen to its new host. Rather, in the case of CIV, demographic variability in contact rates is alone sufficient to explain the fadeout in the disease in most situations.</p><p>The basic reproductive number for CIV is intriguingly close to the minimum value required to persist in a shelter of average size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). This suggests that transmission efficiency in CIV may have evolved to precisely the point of persistence. Yet, this average shelter size belies the high variance in shelter populations, with many small facilities balanced by a few extraordinarily large ones (roughly matching the distribution pattern of US city sizes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The process by which CIV currently persists is therefore to thrive in a few large populations with high rates of infected-susceptible contact (as mediated by a high arrival rate of new susceptibles, rather than by increase density), but failing to take hold in the general population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). By analogy with conservation biology, large populations thus function as refugia for the virus, protecting it from extinction and also limiting its distribution. These are also exactly the conditions to facilitate further evolution toward higher reproductive capacities, by facilitating repeated outbreaks outside the refugia, followed by selection for higher transmissibility <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Antia1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Arinaminpathy1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Lieberman1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>Our mean estimate of R<sub>0</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3.9 in the large animal shelters is lower than that estimated for EIV during outbreaks <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Glass1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, but close to the upper bound for estimates of human influenza transmission <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Mills1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Wallinga1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.

Variation in R<sub>0</sub> among different viral strains and host species can be difficult to interpret because of the many factors that can affect transmission and removal rates in different settings. However, these comparisons do indicate that CIV has the biological capacity to spread relatively efficiently among dogs given the right conditions in the host population.</p><p>Although most of the parameters in the epidemic model were estimated from a large volume of host demographic data from animal shelters, there are currently few estimates of seroprevalence in shelters where CIV is endemic and as a result our estimate for equilibrium seroprevalence relies on data from a single shelter <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Holt1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This introduces a risk of sampling bias because that individual shelter could exhibit individual characteristics that affect its equilibrium seroprevalence, and/or due to non-random temporal fluctuations in seroprevalence. While the scarcity of seroprevalence estimates adds uncertainty to R<sub>0</sub> estimates, the extant data would be difficult to explain with values of R<sub>0</sub> lower than our estimates. This is due to the rapid rate at which infected individuals are replaced by new arriving susceptibles in the high throughput shelters where CIV is enzootic. The low residence time of dogs in large, high-throughput shelters thus indicates (consistent with previous results <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Holt1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>) that individuals in shelters where CIV is enzootic must acquire the infection within a few days of arriving. This places a lower bound on probable values for R<sub>0</sub> by constraining estimates of the generation time of the infection, at least in the context of large shelters <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Wallinga1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In other facilities that are smaller or where CIV is not enzootic, long-term average seroprevalence over time may be lower <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Pecoraro1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> due to stochastic fadeouts of the disease.</p><p>Phylogenetic analyses independently supports several key predictions of our analysis. First, these analyses confirm that CIV remains confined to endemic hotspots, with transfers to other regions causing outbreaks that are generally short-lived (and thus failing to establish new lineages outside of endemic locations). Moreover, the strong phylogeographic structure, with distinct viral clusters in New York, Pennsylvania and Colorado for each gene analyzed, is exactly what might be expected given our empirically-parameterized epidemic model, which predicts geographic segregation. Each US state has only a few large cities that would have an animal shelter capable of supporting CIV in the long term, and with relatively infrequent transfers among cities.</p><p>Second, the mean and HPD interval for R<sub>e</sub> from the phylogenetic analysis in 2004 (when CIV was first detected and when infected greyhounds were being transported to many US states for racing) roughly matches the distribution of R<sub>0</sub> from the stochastic SIR model and demographic data. The initial phase of an epidemic is usually associated with exponential growth (corresponding to R<sub>e</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;R<sub>0</sub>), and R<sub>e</sub> must always be less than or equal to R<sub>0</sub> by definition. This makes the phylogenetic estimate of R<sub>e</sub> in 2004 a conservative independent assessment of R<sub>0</sub>.</p><p>The third concurrence between the demographic and phylogenetic analysis involves the current estimate of R<sub>e</sub>&#x0223c;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1. While R<sub>0</sub> in our analysis measures the reproductive potential of the disease where it is enzootic, the phylodynamic estimates of R<sub>e</sub> reflects the net spread rate of CIV across the US as a whole, including multiple shelters and the companion dog population. As such, R<sub>e</sub>&#x0223c;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1 indicates that on balance CIV is currently failing to persist where it is not already enzootic, which is consistent with both epidemiological observations <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Dubovi1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and the predictions of the demographic analysis which showed that most shelters are too small to support CIV in an endemic state (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Targeted strategies for control and eradication depend on understanding the conditions under which an emerging enzootic pathogen can maintain itself in a new host population. Our simulations indicate that eradication may be possible, but will require relatively efficient control, and that success may depend on the rates at which dogs are transferred between animal shelters. For control measures with &#x0223c;75% efficiency, CIV may be eradicated from most shelters but still persist overall through connected chains of outbreaks, with large shelters serving as focal points for staging new infections elsewhere. This suggests that control programs for CIV will be most successful if implemented across multiple shelters and that participating shelters should maintain control measures even after the virus has been eliminated locally.</p><p>Uncertainties in our analysis would be reduced by more information on CIV prevalence and additional CIV sequence data. A key area of uncertainty is transmission rates between companion dogs within and among households whose contact patterns would differ significantly from those of dogs in animal shelters. Working from first principles, if a proportion <italic>p</italic> of contacts between infectious and susceptible dogs result in the infection being transmitted, then the probability that an infected individual in the companion population will first transmit the infection on their <italic>k</italic>th contact with a susceptible dog is <italic>p(1-p)<sup>k&#x02212;1</sup></italic>, which gives an expected value for <italic>k</italic> of <italic>1/p</italic>.

<xref rid="ppat.1004455-Jirjis1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. This suggests that for a CIV lineage to avoid extinction in companion dogs, the average infected dog must contact k&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.33 susceptible individuals during the time they are infected. Another approach that yields the same result is to recognize that if a proportion <italic>p</italic> of contacts produce secondary infections, then R<sub>0</sub>&#x0003e;1 requires <italic>k&#x0003e;1/p</italic>, again translating to approximately two contacts per week. It is evident from common experience that while some companion dogs are highly sociable, others do not frequently interact with other dogs. Therefore, some companion dogs probably achieve the minimum contact rate required to sustain CIV, but others probably do not. Many dogs with higher contact rates than this minimum would be necessary for CIV to actively spread among companion dogs, and to protect the virus from stochastic extinction in the general dog population, at its current transmission efficiency.</p><p>Conversely, if CIV had emerged with much higher transmissibility upon entry to the greyhound population, stuttering chains of transmission would not have been observed. Thus, the capacity for contact heterogeneity to control epidemic spread is facilitated by lower transmissibility. Furthermore, while endemic hotspots created by contact heterogeneity can theoretically increase the chances of evolving higher transmission efficiency, it is evident that not all cross-species transmission events will involve small stepwise gains in transmissibility in the new host. Indeed, a variety of adaptive models, involving differing numbers and fitness of mutations, can be put forward to explain the process of emergence <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Holmes1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p><p>Despite these caveats, and limitations in the available data, our analyses provide a coherent view of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of CIV. After approximately 15 years of continuous circulation among dogs in the US, CIV can be maintained only in relatively dense host populations with high inputs of susceptible individuals (essentially viral &#x0201c;chemostats&#x0201d;), despite a relatively high reproductive potential in that context. These hotspots are weakly connected by migration, leading to geographic signatures in the CIV phylogenies. Most dog populations are too small or diffuse to independently support CIV at its current level of transmissibility, explaining its current modest reproductive rate (R<sub>e</sub>&#x0223c;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1), and consistent with the epidemiology of CIV, which is characterized primarily by sporadic short-lived outbreaks outside of enzootic centers <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Dubovi1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The demographic gradient between high-throughput populations where CIV is enzootic, and smaller or more diffuse populations where sporadic outbreaks can occur, creates hotspot dynamics that can facilitate pathogen evolution toward higher transmissibility <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Arinaminpathy1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Lieberman1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Our results therefore demonstrate one way that urbanization can increase the risk posed by emerging infectious pathogens <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Woolhouse1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Dalziel1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p><p>Although humans exposed to CIV appear not to be commonly infected (as shown by serological testing), the true risk of future human infection by either EIV or CIV is unknown as we do not understand the host barriers that restrict human infection, or the genotypic changes in the viruses that might overcome those barriers <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Krueger1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Our analysis can therefor inform a strategy for preemptive eradication of an influenza A virus that is well adapted to mammals, since if CIV did gain high transmissibility among companion dogs then much of the human population would be directly exposed to the virus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Epidemiological Model</title><p>Our analysis is based on an SIR framework that models changes over time in the number of dogs in a shelter who are susceptible (S), infected (I), or removed (recovered and thus immune; R). In what follows, we describe the model for a single shelter: below we expand the model to incorporate the dynamics of an control program that reduces the force of infection, and to consider control in multiple shelters linked through the transfer of dogs.</p><p>We assume dogs arrive at a shelter of a given size at a rate of &#x003bc; dogs per day. Dogs leave at a per-capita rate of &#x003b4; per dog per day, regardless of their state, so the mean residence time in a shelter is 1/&#x003b4; days. The number of dogs in a shelter, N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;S+I+R, is equal to &#x003bc;/&#x003b4; at equilibrium. Arrival and departure rates are estimated empirically using individual-level records from 13 animal shelters of varying size across the US (see Supporting Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004455.s001">Data S1</xref>). The records comprise a total of 124,519 dogs, recording the date each individual arrived and left the shelter. In 8 of the 13 shelters, the data included whether or not the departure of the dog represented a transfer to another shelter. Arrival rate, &#x003bc;, for a shelter was estimated as the median number of dogs arriving in that shelter per day. Departure rate, &#x003b4;, for a shelter was estimated as the inverse of the median length of stay of dogs in that shelter. When estimating arrival and departure rates we excluded dogs that were admitted to the shelter in response to a euthanasia request, as these dogs had systematically shorter residence times. We also excluded dogs whose length of stay was greater than 40 days, as these represented rare atypical cases (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g002">Figure 2C,D</xref>).</p><p>We assume that dogs in a shelter have a constant rate of contact per day with other dogs where the contact would be capable of spreading infection if one of the dogs were infected. An alternate hypothesis is that contact rate increases with population size, potentially leading to hotspot dynamics in large shelters in the absence of demographic stochasticity. Our assumption of constant contact rates is thus conservative with respect to the hypothesis that demographic structure drives hotspot dynamics in CIV.</p><p>Assuming that contact between any pair of dogs in the shelter is equally likely, the force of infection is given by &#x003bb;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x003b2;P, where &#x003b2; is the contact rate and P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;I/N is the current prevalence of CIV in the shelter <xref rid="ppat.1004455-McCallum1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. The rate of new infections is given by &#x003bb;S, and susceptible dogs contract the disease an average of 1/&#x003bb; days after entering the shelter. In this framework, the basic reproductive number of the disease is R<sub>0</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x003b2;/(&#x003b3;+&#x003b4;), and the disease only persists in the long run if R<sub>0</sub>&#x0003e;1, in which case equilibrium prevalence is given by<disp-formula id="ppat.1004455.e001"><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1004455.e001.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>which is bounded above by &#x003b4;/(&#x003b3;+&#x003b4;) as R<sub>0</sub> becomes large (see Supporting Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004455.s002">Text S1</xref>, Section 1.6).</p><p>The infected class in our model represents the number of dogs with non-zero viral loads, rather than those exhibiting clinical symptoms. Thus, we avoid including latent or asymptomatic classes in our model. We set &#x003b3;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1/7 because viral shedding continues for approximately seven days after inoculation <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Crawford1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Seroconversion for dogs infected with CIV also happens at approximately 7 days <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Crawford1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Equilibrium seroprevalence is then given by R/N (see Supporting Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004455.s002">Text S1</xref>, Section 1.7).</p><p>Variation among individuals in time of infection, recovery, arrival, and departure causes variations in disease prevalence around the predicted long-term average. These excursions from mean prevalence carry with them the risk of visiting zero prevalence, leading to stochastic extinction of the disease. This demographic stochasticity becomes increasingly pronounced in smaller populations. However, the critical population size below which disease dynamics begin to significantly diverge from the long-term average through stochastic fadeouts depends upon R<sub>0</sub>, and upon the turnover rate in the population. We parameterize the stochastic SIR model with the demographic data to test the impact of demographic stochasticity on the spread and maintenance of CIV in animal shelters. We implement the model in continuous time at the level of individual dogs using the Gillespie algorithm <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Gillespie1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>We estimated a posterior distribution for R<sub>0</sub> given seroprevalence data and demographic data by using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, as follows. From the stochastic SIR model we simulated seroprevalence samples by observing the seropositivity of <italic>n</italic> randomly selected dogs from the population at a given time. Seroprevalence thus observed has the property of being normally-distributed about the long-term equilibrium value given by the mean-field model in our simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). We then seek the posterior distribution of an unknown equilibrium seroprevalence at an actual shelter, given a real point seroprevalence estimate there. We estimate this distribution by sampling from the Gaussian distribution of deviations between point seroprevalence estimates and equilibrium seropreovalence, using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Gilks1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. We assessed convergence by visually examining within- and among- chain mixing. Convergence was determined to have occurred when the long-term variance in sampler state among chains was the same as the variance within chains. Convergence under this definition was easily achieved using 10 chains run for 10<sup>5</sup> steps each, with a burnin of 10%, and keeping every 100<sup>th</sup> step. From the posterior distribution of equilibrium seroprevalence, we then map to a posterior distribution for R<sub>0</sub> by inverting <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="ppat.1004455.e001">Equation 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Control and Eradication Strategies</title><p>We represent control strategies by a vaccination program that reduces the force of infection (as described below), but the results apply to any control measure that provides a similar reduction in risk of infection and in infectiousness. In what follows we discuss control in the context of a LAIV administered to dogs upon arrival at the shelter.</p><p>The model with vaccination dynamics includes two more compartments, counting the number of dogs in each shelter who are vaccinated (V), and the number of dogs who are infected despite vaccination (W). Vaccination reduces a dog's susceptibility to infection by decreasing the probability that a virus population initially transferred through infectious contact will enter a phase of exponential growth, prerequisite to significant viral shedding and clinical symptoms <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Nowak1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>.</p><p>By reducing viral load and viral shedding, vaccination reduces the risk of infection in vaccinated dogs and reduces the infectiousness of a dog who becomes infected despite vaccination. Vaccinated dogs thus experience a reduced force of infection &#x003b5;&#x003bb;, 0&#x02264;&#x003b5;&#x02264;1, and, if they become infected, contribute to the force of infection at a reduced rate 0&#x02264;&#x003c9;&#x02264;1, leading to an overall force of infection of &#x003bb;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x003b2;(I+&#x003c9;W)/N in population which has W vaccinated individuals who have nonetheless become infected.</p><p>Dogs transition from S to V at a rate of &#x003b1; per dog per day. Because a live vaccine is assumed to be administered to dogs immediately upon arrival, 1/&#x003b1; measures the average time after entry/vaccination that a dog experiences the vaccine-associated decrease in risk of infection from other dogs, and decreased infectiousness if they do become infected. Vaccination changes mean dynamics by reducing R<sub>0</sub> by a factor of 1-K, where K is effective vaccination coverage. K is given by (1-&#x003ba;)V/N, where &#x003ba;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x003b5;&#x003c9; expresses the failure rate of the vaccine, ranging from 0 for perfect vaccine, to 1 for an entirely ineffective one (see Supplementary material, section 1.4). We use a step function for &#x003ba; as a function of &#x003b1;, where &#x003ba; goes from 1 to its post-vaccine value at 1/&#x003b1; days.</p><p>We also model the effects of a generic control strategy equivalent to inoculating some dogs with a perfect vaccine, or to quarantine that partially or completely stops the flow of susceptible dogs into the shelter. We do this by replacing susceptible dogs with removed ones in the intake stream. Reducing the proportion of susceptible dogs in the intake stream to 0&#x0003c;<italic>&#x003b8;</italic>&#x0003c;1, while 1- <italic>&#x003b8;</italic> are already removed, has the same effect as reducing R<sub>0</sub> to <italic>&#x003b8;</italic>R<sub>0</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Metapopulation Dynamics</title><p>The metapopulation model expands the stochastic SIR model for a single shelter to describe multiple shelters whose dynamics are linked by the transfer of dogs. As above, the model is implemented at the level individual dogs using the Gillespie algorithm. Thus at each point in continuous time, each individual in the model has a disease state (S,I,R,V, or W) and a location in a given shelter. The metapopulation is composed of shelters that vary in dog population size, intake rate and output rate by sampling with replacement from the demographic data. Transfer probabilities are also based on the demographic data (see Supporting Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004455.s002">Text S1</xref>, Section 2). Although the CIV phylogenies show geographic localization (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g001">Figure 1</xref>), the metapopulation model is spatially implicit, consistent with level of detail in the demographic data we used. However, even without including spatial structure in transfer patterns, the metapopulation model reproduces hotspot dynamics, based on transfer hierarchies driven by differences in shelter size (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Phylogenetic Analysis, Estimates of R<sub>e</sub>, and Phylogeography</title><p>We compiled all available CIV HA1, NP and M gene segment sequences from GenBank and the Influenza Research Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fludb.org">www.fludb.org</ext-link>) and by sequencing samples provided by the Animal Health Diagnostic Center (AHDC) at Cornell University. For the sequencing of the virus samples obtained from AHDC we extracted viral RNA using Qiagen viral RNA mini kit and synthesized cDNA using Avian Myeloblastosis Virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase and influenza universal primer Uni12. Three gene segments, HA1, NP and M, were then amplified by PCR with gene specific primers (primer sequences are available upon request) for all samples. The PCR products were purified using EZNA Cycle-Pure Kit and sequenced by the Sanger method. All sequences derived here have been submitted to GenBank and assigned accession numbers KM359803-KM359864.</p><p>All sequences were aligned by MUSCLE v3.8.31 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Edgar1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> using default parameters, followed by manual adjustment. Phylogenetic trees of each gene were then estimated using the maximum likelihood (ML) available in PhyML 3.0 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Guindon1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> and assuming the general time-reversible reversible (GTR) model of nucleotide substitution and a gamma distribution of among-site rate variation with 4 rate categories (i.e. the GTR+I+&#x00393;<sub>4</sub> model of nucleotide substitution) with SPR branch-swapping. The robustness of the phylogeny was estimated using 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Because of their greater availability, the analyses of evolutionary dynamics and phylogeography were only performed on the HA1 gene (see below).</p><p>To estimate R from the CIV sequence data we used a total of 94 HA1 sequences (alignment length&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1032 nt) sampled from various locations (states) in the US (Colorado, New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, California, Kentucky, Wyoming, Philadelphia, South Carolina, Virginia, Vermont, Connecticut, Texas, and Iowa) between 2003 and 2013. This data set included 40 sequences sampled from dog shelters in New York between 2005 and 2012, which were analyzed separately using the same protocols.</p><p>First, we estimated the mean (and credible intervals) of R in both data sets using the epidemiological birth-death method <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Stadler2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> available in BEAST v1.7.5 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Drummond1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. This analysis used the simpler Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY) model of nucleotide substitution and a gamma distribution of among-site rate variation (HKY+&#x00393;<sub>4</sub>). To account for temporal rate variation in the data an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock model was employed. Using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework available in BEAST, 100 million steps were run, sampling every 10,000 and removing 10% as a burn-in. Second, temporal changes in R were estimated using the more complex serial-sampled birth-death (SSBD) model <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Stadler1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, available in BEAST v2.0 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Bouckaert1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, again using the HKY+&#x00393;<sub>4</sub> but this time (to ensure statistical convergence) employing a strict molecular clock with a uniform distributed clock rate of 2&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> (1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>&#x02013;3&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>) nucleotide substitutions per site, as this was found to be best-fit to the data in epidemiological birth-death method. The MCMC was again run for 100 million steps, sampling in the same way as described above. Two independent runs allowed different R<sub>e</sub> values to be inferred from up to R<sub>e</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;25.</p><p>To determine whether CIV was more clustered on the phylogenetic tree by US state of sampling than expected by chance alone, we employed the Association Index (AI), Parsimony Score (PS) and Maximum Clade size (MC) phylogeny-trait association statistics incorporated within the Bayesian Tip-association Significance testing (BaTS) program <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Parker1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Traits were defined as the US state of sampling. Phylogenetic uncertainty in the data was incorporated by basing estimates on the posterior distribution of trees obtained from the BEAST analysis (epidemiological birth-death method) described above. In all cases, 1000 random permutations of sampling locations were undertaken to create a null distribution for each statistic.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1004455.s001"><label>Data S1</label><caption><p>
