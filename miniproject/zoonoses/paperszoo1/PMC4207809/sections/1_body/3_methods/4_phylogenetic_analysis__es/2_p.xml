<p>All sequences were aligned by MUSCLE v3.8.31 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Edgar1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> using default parameters, followed by manual adjustment. Phylogenetic trees of each gene were then estimated using the maximum likelihood (ML) available in PhyML 3.0 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Guindon1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> and assuming the general time-reversible reversible (GTR) model of nucleotide substitution and a gamma distribution of among-site rate variation with 4 rate categories (i.e. the GTR+I+Î“
 <sub>4</sub> model of nucleotide substitution) with SPR branch-swapping. The robustness of the phylogeny was estimated using 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Because of their greater availability, the analyses of evolutionary dynamics and phylogeography were only performed on the HA1 gene (see below).
