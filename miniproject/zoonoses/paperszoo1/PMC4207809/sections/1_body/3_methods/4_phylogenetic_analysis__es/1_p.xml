<p>We compiled all available CIV HA1, NP and M gene segment sequences from GenBank and the Influenza Research Database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fludb.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.fludb.org</ext-link>) and by sequencing samples provided by the Animal Health Diagnostic Center (AHDC) at Cornell University. For the sequencing of the virus samples obtained from AHDC we extracted viral RNA using Qiagen viral RNA mini kit and synthesized cDNA using Avian Myeloblastosis Virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase and influenza universal primer Uni12. Three gene segments, HA1, NP and M, were then amplified by PCR with gene specific primers (primer sequences are available upon request) for all samples. The PCR products were purified using EZNA Cycle-Pure Kit and sequenced by the Sanger method. All sequences derived here have been submitted to GenBank and assigned accession numbers KM359803-KM359864.
