<p>First, we estimated the mean (and credible intervals) of R in both data sets using the epidemiological birth-death method 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Stadler2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> available in BEAST v1.7.5 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Drummond1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. This analysis used the simpler Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY) model of nucleotide substitution and a gamma distribution of among-site rate variation (HKY+Γ
 <sub>4</sub>). To account for temporal rate variation in the data an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock model was employed. Using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework available in BEAST, 100 million steps were run, sampling every 10,000 and removing 10% as a burn-in. Second, temporal changes in R were estimated using the more complex serial-sampled birth-death (SSBD) model

 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Bouckaert1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, again using the HKY+Γ
 <sub>4</sub> but this time (to ensure statistical convergence) employing a strict molecular clock with a uniform distributed clock rate of 2×10
 <sup>−3</sup> (1×10
 <sup>−3</sup>–3×10
 <sup>−3</sup>) nucleotide substitutions per site, as this was found to be best-fit to the data in epidemiological birth-death method. The MCMC was again run for 100 million steps, sampling in the same way as described above. Two independent runs allowed different R
 <sub>e</sub> values to be inferred from up to R
 <sub>e</sub> = 25.
