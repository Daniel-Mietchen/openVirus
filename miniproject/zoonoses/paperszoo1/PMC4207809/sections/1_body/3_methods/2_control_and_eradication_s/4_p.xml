<p>Dogs transition from S to V at a rate of α per dog per day. Because a live vaccine is assumed to be administered to dogs immediately upon arrival, 1/α measures the average time after entry/vaccination that a dog experiences the vaccine-associated decrease in risk of infection from other dogs, and decreased infectiousness if they do become infected. Vaccination changes mean dynamics by reducing R
 <sub>0</sub> by a factor of 1-K, where K is effective vaccination coverage. K is given by (1-κ)V/N, where κ = εω expresses the failure rate of the vaccine, ranging from 0 for perfect vaccine, to 1 for an entirely ineffective one (see Supplementary material, section 1.4). We use a step function for κ as a function of α, where κ goes from 1 to its post-vaccine value at 1/α days.
