<p>We also model the effects of a generic control strategy equivalent to inoculating some dogs with a perfect vaccine, or to quarantine that partially or completely stops the flow of susceptible dogs into the shelter. We do this by replacing susceptible dogs with removed ones in the intake stream. Reducing the proportion of susceptible dogs in the intake stream to 0&lt;
 <italic>θ</italic>&lt;1, while 1- 
 <italic>θ</italic> are already removed, has the same effect as reducing R
 <sub>0</sub> to 
 <italic>θ</italic>R
 <sub>0</sub>.
