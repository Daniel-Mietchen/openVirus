<p>By reducing viral load and viral shedding, vaccination reduces the risk of infection in vaccinated dogs and reduces the infectiousness of a dog who becomes infected despite vaccination. Vaccinated dogs thus experience a reduced force of infection ελ, 0≤ε≤1, and, if they become infected, contribute to the force of infection at a reduced rate 0≤ω≤1, leading to an overall force of infection of λ = β(I+ωW)/N in population which has W vaccinated individuals who have nonetheless become infected.</p>
