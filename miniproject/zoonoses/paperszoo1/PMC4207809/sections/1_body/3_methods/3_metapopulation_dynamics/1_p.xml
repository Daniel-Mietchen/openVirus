<p>The metapopulation model expands the stochastic SIR model for a single shelter to describe multiple shelters whose dynamics are linked by the transfer of dogs. As above, the model is implemented at the level individual dogs using the Gillespie algorithm. Thus at each point in continuous time, each individual in the model has a disease state (S,I,R,V, or W) and a location in a given shelter. The metapopulation is composed of shelters that vary in dog population size, intake rate and output rate by sampling with replacement from the demographic data. Transfer probabilities are also based on the demographic data (see Supporting Information, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004455.s002">Text S1</xref>, Section 2). Although the CIV phylogenies show geographic localization (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g001">Figure 1</xref>), the metapopulation model is spatially implicit, consistent with level of detail in the demographic data we used. However, even without including spatial structure in transfer patterns, the metapopulation model reproduces hotspot dynamics, based on transfer hierarchies driven by differences in shelter size (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g006">Figure 6</xref>).
