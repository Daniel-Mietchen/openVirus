<p>Assuming that contact between any pair of dogs in the shelter is equally likely, the force of infection is given by λ = βP, where β is the contact rate and P = I/N is the current prevalence of CIV in the shelter 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-McCallum1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. The rate of new infections is given by λS, and susceptible dogs contract the disease an average of 1/λ days after entering the shelter. In this framework, the basic reproductive number of the disease is R
