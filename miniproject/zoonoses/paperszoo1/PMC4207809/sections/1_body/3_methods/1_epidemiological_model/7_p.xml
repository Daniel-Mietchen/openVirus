<p>We estimated a posterior distribution for R
 <sub>0</sub> given seroprevalence data and demographic data by using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, as follows. From the stochastic SIR model we simulated seroprevalence samples by observing the seropositivity of 
 <italic>n</italic> randomly selected dogs from the population at a given time. Seroprevalence thus observed has the property of being normally-distributed about the long-term equilibrium value given by the mean-field model in our simulations (

We then seek the posterior distribution of an unknown equilibrium seroprevalence at an actual shelter, given a real point seroprevalence estimate there. We estimate this distribution by sampling from the Gaussian distribution of deviations between point seroprevalence estimates and equilibrium seropreovalence, using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm

Convergence was determined to have occurred when the long-term variance in sampler state among chains was the same as the variance within chains. Convergence under this definition was easily achieved using 10 chains run for 10
 <sup>5</sup> steps each, with a burnin of 10%, and keeping every 100
 <sup>th</sup> step. From the posterior distribution of equilibrium seroprevalence, we then map to a posterior distribution for R
 <sub>0</sub> by inverting
