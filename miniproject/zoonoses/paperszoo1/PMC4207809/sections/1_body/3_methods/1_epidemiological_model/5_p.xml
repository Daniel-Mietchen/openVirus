<p>The infected class in our model represents the number of dogs with non-zero viral loads, rather than those exhibiting clinical symptoms. Thus, we avoid including latent or asymptomatic classes in our model. We set γ = 1/7 because viral shedding continues for approximately seven days after inoculation
