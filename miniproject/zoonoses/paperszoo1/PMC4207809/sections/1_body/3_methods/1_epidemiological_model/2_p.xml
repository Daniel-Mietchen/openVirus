<p>We assume dogs arrive at a shelter of a given size at a rate of μ dogs per day. Dogs leave at a per-capita rate of δ per dog per day, regardless of their state, so the mean residence time in a shelter is 1/δ days. The number of dogs in a shelter, N = S+I+R, is equal to μ/δ at equilibrium. Arrival and departure rates are estimated empirically using individual-level records from 13 animal shelters of varying size across the US (see Supporting Information, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004455.s001">Data S1</xref>). The records comprise a total of 124,519 dogs, recording the date each individual arrived and left the shelter. In 8 of the 13 shelters, the data included whether or not the departure of the dog represented a transfer to another shelter. Arrival rate, μ, for a shelter was estimated as the median number of dogs arriving in that shelter per day. Departure rate, δ, for a shelter was estimated as the inverse of the median length of stay of dogs in that shelter. When estimating arrival and departure rates we excluded dogs that were admitted to the shelter in response to a euthanasia request, as these dogs had systematically shorter residence times. We also excluded dogs whose length of stay was greater than 40 days, as these represented rare atypical cases (see
