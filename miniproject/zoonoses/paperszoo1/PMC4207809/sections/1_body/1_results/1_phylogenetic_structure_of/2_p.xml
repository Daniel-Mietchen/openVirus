<p>The most striking result of this analysis is that CIV exhibits a marked geographical clustering by US state with distinct clades being observed in New York (and nearby states), in Pennsylvania, and in Colorado, which also represent our largest sampling sets (

 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Parker1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, with significantly more clustering by US state of origin than expected by chance alone across the data set as a whole (p&lt;0.001). Similarly, the Maximum Clade (MC) statistic reveals significant (p&lt;0.001) clustering in the individual states of Colorado, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Wyoming. In addition, many of the viruses from the northeastern states of Vermont, Connecticut, New Hampshire clustered with the viruses that are circulating continuously in New York (also in the northeast), suggesting that those viruses were derived from the New York enzootic hotspots.
