<p>Interestingly, the posterior distribution for R
 <sub>0</sub> (estimated by MCMC as described above), and the empirical distribution of shelter population sizes from the demographic data, suggest that CIV straddles the border between persistence and stochastic fadeout. That is, the demographic and seroprevalence data indicate that CIV cannot persist in the majority of shelters, because the median of the posterior distribution of R
 <sub>0</sub> is below the cutoff for persistence in a shelter of median size. But CIV can persist in existing shelters that are larger than the median size, because the posterior distribution for R
 <sub>0</sub>, combined with the distribution of shelter sizes from the demographic data, has significant density at R
 <sub>0</sub>-N combinations that would allow persistence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, points). This suggests that CIV persists on the brink of extinctionâ€”its current transmission efficiency is only sufficient to persist in large, high-throughput populations, but not yet to invade more widely.
