<p>Using the shelter demography data and the stochastic epidemic model, we simulated CIV outbreaks in shelters of a realistic distribution of sizes, intake rates and output rates, and for varying levels of R
 <sub>0</sub>. From these simulations we estimated the probability that a shelter (of a given population size, N) infected with a CIV virus (of a given R
 <sub>0</sub>) could maintain the virus for 100 days. The response surface for this experiment yielded a cut-off curve in the N-R
 <sub>0</sub> plane, below which fadeout was almost certain and above which persistence was almost certain (
