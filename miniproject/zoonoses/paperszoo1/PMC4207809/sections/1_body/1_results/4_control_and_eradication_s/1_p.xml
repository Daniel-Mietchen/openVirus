<p>We then used the parameterized epidemic model and demographic data to simulate the impact of control strategies for CIV. The purpose of this analysis is to test how the observed hotspot dynamics are predicted to interact with potential eradication strategies, and to estimate, given available demographic and epidemiological data, the degree of control efficacy required to eliminate CIV from animal shelters where it is persisting, allowing for the complete eradication the virus from the canine population. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g004">Figure 4B</xref> shows the effect of a generic control measure applied to a single shelter, that reduces the inflow of susceptible dogs to a proportion 1/&lt;R
 <sub>0</sub>&gt; = 0.26 of current levels, where &lt;R
 <sub>0</sub>&gt; = 3.9 is the mean of the posterior distribution for R
 <sub>0</sub>, as above. This generic control measure has the effect of reducing the effective reproductive number in a single shelter to unity. Consistent with theory 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Anderson2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> this is a reduction in the susceptible portion sufficient to eradicate the disease from a large isolated shelter.
