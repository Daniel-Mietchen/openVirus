<p>We also used our epidemic model to explore the passage of CIV from an infection in one large shelter to other shelters through the transfer of dogs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The hotspot dynamics predicted by our model show regularities in the way CIV spreads outward from a single shelter. Large shelters are predicted to receive the infection earlier, as well as maintaining it for longer, creating a wave in the population sizeâ€”time-of infection plane (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). The probability that a single infection introduced to a susceptible shelter would start an epidemic that persisted for at least 100 days increases with population size (
