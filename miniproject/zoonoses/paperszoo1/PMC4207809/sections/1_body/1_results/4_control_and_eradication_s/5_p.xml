<p>The key result is that a net control efficacy of ∼85% is required for eradication of CIV from its reservoir in a network larger animal shelters, even though a net efficacy of ∼75% would probably be sufficient for eradication from a single shelter. Thus another interesting feature of the control simulations in a metapopulation framework is the sensitivity to migration parameters (

In particular, we show that there are efficacious control strategies that would cause the virus to go locally extinct but that would fail to achieve global eradication. These include scenarios where the expected global prevalence approaches 0, but where the virus would persists through connected chains of stochastic outbreaks (
