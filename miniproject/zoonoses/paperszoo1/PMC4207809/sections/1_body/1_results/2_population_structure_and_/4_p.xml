<p>Most dogs arriving to shelters are susceptible to CIV

 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Holt1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The arrival rate of susceptible dogs places an upper limit on CIV prevalence by continual dilution with uninfected individuals, which leads to a saturating relationship for prevalence as a function of R
 <sub>0</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). We estimated a posterior distribution for R
 <sub>0</sub> given seroprevalence data and demographic data by using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method based on a stochastic SIR model parameterized with the demographic data (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Point estimates of seroprevalence are normally-distributed about the long-term equilibrium value given by the mean-field model in our simulations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), and a seroprevalence estimate of 0.42 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Holt1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> from a large shelter where CIV is enzootic, combined with the demographic data on dog intake and outcome rates, yield a mean estimate for R
 <sub>0</sub> of 3.9 for CIV in large animal shelters. The posterior distribution of R
 <sub>0</sub> has a median of 3.3, and a highest probability density (HPD - the central 95% of the posterior distribution) interval extending from 2.0 to 8.9 (
