<p>Moving from estimating the reproductive potential (R
 <sub>0</sub>) of CIV in animal shelters to estimating the effective spread rate in the general population from genetic data, we employed phylodynamic birth-death models to analyze HA1 sequence data collected across the US to determine the rate of spread of the virus in the wider dog population. Our estimates for the effective reproductive number (R
 <sub>e</sub>; the average number of secondary infections produced by a typical infected individual at a given time, in a population where not all potential hosts are necessarily susceptible) show considerable temporal variation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g003">Figure 3D,E</xref>). At the time when CIV was first recognized in 2004 the posterior distribution of R
 <sub>e</sub> roughly matches that of R
 <sub>0</sub>, consistent with the initial, exponential phase of the epidemic. During the period 2004–2008 R
 <sub>e</sub> drops to a value of approximately 1.0. A similar pattern was observed in the New York data set. Across the USA as a whole the mean estimate of R
 <sub>e</sub> is currently 1.02 (95% HPD = 0.79,1.26), with a similar number found in New York (R
 <sub>e</sub> = 1.06, 95% HPD = 0.72, 1.47) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The low R
 <sub>e</sub> observed toward the present suggests that CIV spread has now reached an equilibrium, where stochastic fadeouts often associated with outbreaks are balanced with new infections, which usually occur in the large animal shelters where it is enzootic.
