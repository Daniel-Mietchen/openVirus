<p>Shelters with larger populations are fueled primarily by higher intake rates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), as the median residence time of dogs does not vary significantly among shelters of different sizes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The residence time of dogs in a shelter is roughly exponentially distributed with a mean of 9.88 days and a standard deviation of 8.22 days (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Transfer rates among shelters appear relatively lowâ€”among the eight shelters in our demographic data for which there was transfer information the median proportion of dogs whose stay at a shelter ended with a transfer is 0.067 and the mean is 0.1. Transfer probability is not correlated with dog population size in our data (data not shown).
