<p>Although CIV can readily transmit among dogs its prevalence remains patchy: it is enzootic in some regions of the US, but has thus far failed to establish outside of these enzootic regions

 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Serra1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The overall seroprevalence of CIV in the companion (pet) dog population appears to be low (∼3% or less depending on the region), with visits to canine daycare a risk factor
