<p>A variety of host-pathogen interactions may follow a species jump, and revealing their determinants is essential to understanding the process of zoonotic emergence. First, the emerging pathogen may be poorly adapted for replication and onward transmission in the new host population. This leads to inefficient transmission, where many potentially infectious contacts between susceptible and infected individuals fail to spread the disease, due for example to a low pathogen load in the infected individual. In this case, the disease will have a lower basic reproductive number (R
 <sub>0</sub> – the number of secondary infections caused by a typical infected individual in an entirely susceptible population) in the recipient host than its recent ancestor in the donor host. Inefficient transmission following a spillover event may lead to “stuttering chains” of infection marked by patchy patterns of disease prevalence interspersed with stochastic fadeouts. Even if a pathogen has R
 <sub>0</sub> above 1 (a necessary but not sufficient condition for self-sustaining spread), values of R
 <sub>0</sub> that are only marginally above 1 are associated with a higher probability of stochastic extinction. The probability that a pathogen will establish itself (in a large homogeneously mixed population of susceptible hosts) following the introduction of 
 <italic>n</italic> infected individuals is given by 1−(1/R
 <sub>0</sub>)
