<p>In contrast to CIV, its recent ancestor, H3N8 EIV, has been circulating widely in horses since before 1963 when it was first reported in Florida, having most likely been introduced with horses from South America 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Waddell1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The virus appears to spread continuously within and between many parts of North and South America, Europe, and Asia

 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Bountouri1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. EIV has been introduced into countries that were previously free of the virus, including Australia and South Africa, causing significant outbreaks that extended over large distances, although these were controlled and the virus eradicated

 <sub>0</sub> for EIV at 10.18 (95% confidence interval: 9.57–10.89) in that context. In contrast, the reproductive number of EIV in vaccinated populations of racehorses has been estimated to be between 1.4 and 2.3 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Hughes1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. EIV has experienced marked evolution in all gene segments since it emerged, with evidence of antigenic variation in the HA gene, including phylogeographic patterns in HA variation, with distinct clades in Europe versus the US, and among US states
