<p>Although most of the parameters in the epidemic model were estimated from a large volume of host demographic data from animal shelters, there are currently few estimates of seroprevalence in shelters where CIV is endemic and as a result our estimate for equilibrium seroprevalence relies on data from a single shelter 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Holt1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This introduces a risk of sampling bias because that individual shelter could exhibit individual characteristics that affect its equilibrium seroprevalence, and/or due to non-random temporal fluctuations in seroprevalence. While the scarcity of seroprevalence estimates adds uncertainty to R
 <sub>0</sub> estimates, the extant data would be difficult to explain with values of R
 <sub>0</sub> lower than our estimates. This is due to the rapid rate at which infected individuals are replaced by new arriving susceptibles in the high throughput shelters where CIV is enzootic. The low residence time of dogs in large, high-throughput shelters thus indicates (consistent with previous results 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Holt1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>) that individuals in shelters where CIV is enzootic must acquire the infection within a few days of arriving. This places a lower bound on probable values for R
 <sub>0</sub> by constraining estimates of the generation time of the infection, at least in the context of large shelters 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Wallinga1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In other facilities that are smaller or where CIV is not enzootic, long-term average seroprevalence over time may be lower 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Pecoraro1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> due to stochastic fadeouts of the disease.
