<p>The basic reproductive number for CIV is intriguingly close to the minimum value required to persist in a shelter of average size (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). This suggests that transmission efficiency in CIV may have evolved to precisely the point of persistence. Yet, this average shelter size belies the high variance in shelter populations, with many small facilities balanced by a few extraordinarily large ones (roughly matching the distribution pattern of US city sizes; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The process by which CIV currently persists is therefore to thrive in a few large populations with high rates of infected-susceptible contact (as mediated by a high arrival rate of new susceptibles, rather than by increase density), but failing to take hold in the general population (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). By analogy with conservation biology, large populations thus function as refugia for the virus, protecting it from extinction and also limiting its distribution. These are also exactly the conditions to facilitate further evolution toward higher reproductive capacities, by facilitating repeated outbreaks outside the refugia, followed by selection for higher transmissibility
