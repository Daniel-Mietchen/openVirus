<p>The third concurrence between the demographic and phylogenetic analysis involves the current estimate of R
 <sub>e</sub>∼ = 1. While R
 <sub>0</sub> in our analysis measures the reproductive potential of the disease where it is enzootic, the phylodynamic estimates of R
 <sub>e</sub> reflects the net spread rate of CIV across the US as a whole, including multiple shelters and the companion dog population. As such, R
 <sub>e</sub>∼ = 1 indicates that on balance CIV is currently failing to persist where it is not already enzootic, which is consistent with both epidemiological observations 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Dubovi1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and the predictions of the demographic analysis which showed that most shelters are too small to support CIV in an endemic state (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004455-g004">Figure 4</xref>).
