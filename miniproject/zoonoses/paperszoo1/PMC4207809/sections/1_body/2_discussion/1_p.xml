<p>Since its emergence more than a decade ago, equine H3N8-derived CIV has maintained a patchy distribution, occurring most often in sporadic and short-lived outbreaks in US animal shelters 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Dubovi1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In contrast, strains of CIV's recent ancestor (EIV H3N8) have been commonly found in horses around much of the world since at least 1963. EIV thus transmits efficiently among horses, sometimes despite vaccination programs

Our study investigates heterogeneity in CIV transmission and prevalence to better understand the processes that determine how zoonotic pathogens spread following a host range shift, and how these processes affect the performance of control and eradication strategies.
