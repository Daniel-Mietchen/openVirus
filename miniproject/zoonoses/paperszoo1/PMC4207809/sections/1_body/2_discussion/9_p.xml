<p>Second, the mean and HPD interval for R
 <sub>e</sub> from the phylogenetic analysis in 2004 (when CIV was first detected and when infected greyhounds were being transported to many US states for racing) roughly matches the distribution of R
 <sub>0</sub> from the stochastic SIR model and demographic data. The initial phase of an epidemic is usually associated with exponential growth (corresponding to R
 <sub>e</sub> = R
 <sub>0</sub>), and R
 <sub>e</sub> must always be less than or equal to R
 <sub>0</sub> by definition. This makes the phylogenetic estimate of R
 <sub>e</sub> in 2004 a conservative independent assessment of R
 <sub>0</sub>.
