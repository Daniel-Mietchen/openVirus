<p>Uncertainties in our analysis would be reduced by more information on CIV prevalence and additional CIV sequence data. A key area of uncertainty is transmission rates between companion dogs within and among households whose contact patterns would differ significantly from those of dogs in animal shelters. Working from first principles, if a proportion 
 <italic>p</italic> of contacts between infectious and susceptible dogs result in the infection being transmitted, then the probability that an infected individual in the companion population will first transmit the infection on their 
 <italic>k</italic>th contact with a susceptible dog is 
 <italic>p(1-p)
  <sup>k−1</sup>
 </italic>, which gives an expected value for 
 <italic>k</italic> of 
 <italic>1/p</italic>. Studies of CIV transmission in comingling trials estimate 
 <italic>p = 0.75</italic>
 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Jirjis1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. This suggests that for a CIV lineage to avoid extinction in companion dogs, the average infected dog must contact k = 1.33 susceptible individuals during the time they are infected. Another approach that yields the same result is to recognize that if a proportion 
 <italic>p</italic> of contacts produce secondary infections, then R
 <sub>0</sub>&gt;1 requires 
 <italic>k&gt;1/p</italic>, again translating to approximately two contacts per week. It is evident from common experience that while some companion dogs are highly sociable, others do not frequently interact with other dogs. Therefore, some companion dogs probably achieve the minimum contact rate required to sustain CIV, but others probably do not. Many dogs with higher contact rates than this minimum would be necessary for CIV to actively spread among companion dogs, and to protect the virus from stochastic extinction in the general dog population, at its current transmission efficiency.
