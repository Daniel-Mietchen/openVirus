<p>Stuttering chains of infection in recently emerged zoonoses are caused by two distinct mechanisms that may operate in tandem. The first is poor adaptation of the pathogen to its new host species, causing lower within-host replication rates that may reduce pathogen shedding and lead to inefficient transmission 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-LloydSmith1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Transmission is inefficient because many potentially infectious contacts between infected and susceptible individuals fail to spread the infection. The second mechanism that generates stuttering chains is variation in contact rates among different subsets of the new host population, which can increase the probability of stochastic fadeouts 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Newman1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In this case the fadeouts are not caused by inefficient transmission but by exhausting the local supply of susceptible hosts.
