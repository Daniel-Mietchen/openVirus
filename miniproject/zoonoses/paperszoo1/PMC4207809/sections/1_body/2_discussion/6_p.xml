<p>Our mean estimate of R
 <sub>0</sub> = 3.9 in the large animal shelters is lower than that estimated for EIV during outbreaks 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Glass1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, but close to the upper bound for estimates of human influenza transmission 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Mills1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Wallinga1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. It is also considerably higher than that of pandemic H1N1 influenza in humans in 2009 (R
 <sub>0</sub> = 1.4–1.6) which spread worldwide within weeks of its first recognition in humans 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004455-Fraser1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Variation in R
 <sub>0</sub> among different viral strains and host species can be difficult to interpret because of the many factors that can affect transmission and removal rates in different settings. However, these comparisons do indicate that CIV has the biological capacity to spread relatively efficiently among dogs given the right conditions in the host population.
