  <title>A simulation of CIV invasion over multiple shelters, starting with an infection in a single large shelter.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) Each vertex represents an animal shelter with dog population size proportional to the area of the circle. Edges show transfer of infection from shelter to shelter over time through the movement of infected dogs. Edge lengths are arbitrary. The data for this figure were produced by simulating the metapopulation stochastic SIR model with 100 shelters for 100 days, starting with a single infection in the largest shelter. Population sizes were sampled with replacement from the shelter data. R
   <sub>0</sub> = 3.9. Transfer probability is set to the mean observed value of τ = 0.1. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Large shelters tend to receive the infection earlier (and more often) following an outbreak at another shelter. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Probability that CIV will persist for 100 days in a shelter of a given size following the introduction of a single infected individual to an otherwise susceptible population. The plateau on the curve arises for populations sufficiently large that early depletion of susceptibles is not an important factor in the probability of an outbreak: rather than population size, this probability is determined by R
   <sub>0</sub>.
