 <xref rid="pone.0031076-National1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Over the last 30 years of economic reform in the country, there have been environmental, demographic, social and behavioural changes in the population. As China's ties with the rest of world become increasingly strong, infectious diseases in China no longer remain a domestic issue. A thorough review of infectious disease surveillance in China is timely and important for the country's disease prevention and control strategies. Currently, 39 infectious diseases are classified as notifiable in China. This study reviews trends in notifiable infectious diseases in China, in their historical context, discusses the current epidemiological state of these infections and their implications for disease surveillance and public health interventions. The review is structured by category of disease or transmission route.
