<p>The TB epidemic has spread unevenly in China: in 2005, China reported a national TB prevalence of 0.2% 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-World1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, whereas the southern province of Guangxi, which borders Vietnam, reported a much higher prevalence of 0.65% 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Dong1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In 1991, in adopting DOTS – the internationally recommended TB control strategy – China launched a 10-year infectious and endemic disease control project in an effort to curb its expanding TB epidemic in 13 of its 31 provinces 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Squire1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. It is estimated that the number of Chinese people infected with TB between 1990 and 2000 decreased by 30% and that 300,000 TB deaths were averted. With a success rate greater than 90% 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, DOTS has led to the avoidance of an estimated 1.5 million TB cases 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Squire1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. However, since 2000, multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB have emerged as a severe public health issue in the country. In 2004, China reported approximately 140,000 MDR TB cases, accounting for about one third of the estimated global burden of MDR TB 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Zignol1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. In some provinces, the proportion of MDR TB among newly notified TB cases and previously treated cases was found to exceed 10% and 30%, respectively 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Aziz1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. The latest study indicates that the prevalence of MDR TB among TB patients is as high as 19.4%, and 14.9% of MDR TB cases were XDR during 2007 to 2009 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. The mortality due to TB increased at a rate of 28% (95% CI, 14–43%) per year.
