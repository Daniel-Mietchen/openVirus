<p>The first case of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in China was reported in 1985, but a local HIV epidemic was not detected until 1989 when a cluster of infections was diagnosed among IDUs in Yunnan province 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Zhang10" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Before 2000, China had fewer than 20,000 reported HIV/AIDS cases, but in 2007, the number rose to 200,000. The latest estimates are that 700,000 people were living with HIV/AIDS in China at the end of 2007, with 70,000 new infections added every year since then 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-State1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref> and 20,000–30,000 annual AIDS-related deaths 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Cunningham1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. Although the HIV/AIDS epidemic first began and predominated among IDUs, it rapidly spread to other population groups through both heterosexual and homosexual transmission. The latest figures demonstrate that heterosexual transmission has accounted for approximately 38–50% of new HIV infections since 2005 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-He1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, which may level at or exceed the percentage (30–49%) caused by transmission due to the sharing of injection equipment among IDUs 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-HIVAIDS1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Kretzschmar1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. Notably, HIV infection has become more prevalent among MSM, as male homosexual activities account for approximately 10% of new infections 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-State2" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. AIDS mortality rate increased from 0.10 in 1999 to 1.01 cases per million in 2005, then to 4.58 cases per million in 2008, corresponding to an annual growth rate of 44% (95% CI, 30–58%) the rate is expected to increase sharply if the epidemic remains uncontrolled and there is no large procurement of antiretroviral drugs. Cumulatively, over 9000 infants were infected through mother-to-child transmission by 2005 and it was estimated that about 500 million Chinese were carriers of 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> in 2003 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Miao1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>: coinfection of HIV and 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> could therefore have a large epidemiological impact, in the absence of appropriate public health interventions.
