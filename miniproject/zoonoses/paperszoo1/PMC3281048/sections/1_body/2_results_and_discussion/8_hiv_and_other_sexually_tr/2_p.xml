<p>Since early 1980s, underground prostitution has again become rampant in major cities in China 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Pirkle1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. The number of Chinese men, increased purchasing power of urban residents and trends away from traditional Chinese family values of fidelity all led to an increased number of male clients for commercial sexual services 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Tucker1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. In addition, lack of sexual health knowledge among commercial sex workers and their inability to effectively negotiate condom use during sexual acts substantially increased the risk of STI transmission

 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. The previously hidden population of men who have sex men (MSM) is becoming more overt due to increasing acceptance in society. High-risk sexual behaviours, including a low percentage of condom use, in this population is also contributing to the fast transmission of STIs
