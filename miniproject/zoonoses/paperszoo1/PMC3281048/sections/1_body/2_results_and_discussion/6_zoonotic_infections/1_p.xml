<p>Rabies is one of the zoonotic diseases on the rise in China. During a 58-year period between 1950 and 2007, a total of 117,530 human rabies cases were reported, corresponding to an incidence rate of 9.1 cases per 100,000 population. Three major epidemics were observed

 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Zhang8" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>: the first occurred in the mid-1950s when the annual number of reported cases reached a peak of about 2,000. The epidemic subsided in the 1960s and then started to surge again in the early 1970s. After reaching a sustained peak from 1982 until the end of the decade, at a level of 5,000 to 6,000 cases per year

 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Meng1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. As the disease in humans is closely associated with transmission of rabies virus by infected dogs, in the past epidemics, strict policies for vaccination of owned dogs and elimination of stray dogs were put in place, resulting in effective control of the epidemic. However, since 2000, due to a new wave of rapid expansion of the pet dog population in urban China, there has been a third outbreak, in which the number of cases has increased rapidly: in 2007, the number of notified cases climbed to 3,250

 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The rabies-related mortality rate increased during 1999 to 2008 by a mean of 26% (95% CI, 14â€“37%) per year (
