<p>Transmission of zoonotic infectious agents relies on close interaction between infected animals and humans. As a result of the increasing social trend of keeping house pet dogs, it is estimated that the number of pet dogs in China reached 80–200 million in 2004 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>. However, only 30% of dog owners register their animals with government authorities and only 2–8% of dogs are vaccinated against rabies

 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Hu2" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref> – coverage of greater than 70% is needed to sufficiently control rabies, as determined by the World Health Organization (WHO) 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-World2" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>. The high rabies prevalence (6.4%) among dogs and the expanding number of pet dogs pose a continual and increasing threat of transmission of rabies virus from dogs to humans in China 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Hu2" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>. In addition, the consumption of game meat, especially in southern China, is one of the important sources of zoonotic diseases 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-vandenBerg1" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>. Markets in Guangdong provinces sell live poultry, fish, reptiles and mammals, including dogs and civet cats, for food 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Peiris1" ref-type="bibr">[92]</xref>: the housing of these live animals, often in packed conditions, together with human activities, makes such markets the ideal hub for cross-species transmission of zoonotic agents 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-vandenBerg1" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>. Since there is no systematic surveillance of these live markets, it is difficult to estimate the number of such markets and the amount of game meat consumed by residents in southern China. The SARS epidemic in 2003 demonstrates that transmission of pathogens originally associated with animals can cause worldwide outbreaks in human populations. The current absence of both epidemiological and behavioural data, including their frequency of contacts and means of animal handling, on animal infectious diseases is a strong barrier to effective surveillance and control.
