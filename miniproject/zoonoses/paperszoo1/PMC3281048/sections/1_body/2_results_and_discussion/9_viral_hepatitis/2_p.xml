<p>In contrast to HAV infection, which always causes acute hepatitis but never develops into a chronic condition, HCV and HBV infections often cause chronic hepatitis and may develop into cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Purcell1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. Coinfection of HBV or HCV with other pathogens causing chronic infections, such as HIV, results in substantial increases in the disease burden on individuals, accelerates disease progression and complicates treatment 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Tedaldi1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Soriano1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. Since HBV and HCV can both be transmitted through exchange of body fluids, coinfection of these hepatitis viruses with HIV is common in at-risk groups in China. Approximately 67–71% of the 700,000 registered IDUs in China are infected with HCV

 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Bao1" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Bao2" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref> and 17–26% of them are infected with HBV 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Ruan3" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>. The prevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection is 6.45% in IDUs 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Bao1" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>. Among blood donors, the prevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection is 5.8–6.5% 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Bao1" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Qian2" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>, whereas the figure for HIV/HBV coinfection is 3.7% 
 <xref rid="pone.0031076-Xu2" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>. In comparison, coinfection of HIV and HCV among the general population remains unknown as there is currently no reports on its prevalence. However, coinfection is expected to be increasingly noticeable as the HIV epidemic transforms into a generalised epidemic in China
