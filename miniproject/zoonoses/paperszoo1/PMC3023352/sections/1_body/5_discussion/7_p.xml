<p>In cases of data from the Korean surveillance system for NSI, the incidence was 10.56 cases per 100 inpatients-bed per year and 4.07 cases per 100 workers per year. These were significantly lower values than from statistics in the US such as the National Surveillance System for Healthcare Workers (NaSH) (30 cases per 100 beds) (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). The prime issue when studying occupational infection in health care workers was representativeness. Further analysis was needed in not only compensated data coverage from IACI, but also other types of compensated data coverage from private educational pensions, which was covered by 10 university hospitals in Korea. The addition of more hospitals to its reporting network would further strengthen the NSI surveillance system. Along with these results, health care workers have experienced latent tuberculosis due to exposure in hospitals. An analysis of the workers' compensation database for occupational infection in health care workers was performed. During 7 yr, 307 cases of compensated occupational infection were collected. The most common cause of infection was tuberculosis (219 cases, 71.3%). In addition, latent tuberculosis was evaluated. The prevalence ratio among all health care workers was 1.05 (95% CI 0.80-1.35) in a university hospital. Further studies of tuberculosis should be conducted because the burden of tuberculosis is high in the general population in Korea. After identifying epidemics in health care workers, focused prevention and management should be performed in high-risk groups.
