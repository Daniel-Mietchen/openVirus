<p>Through analysis the workers' compensation database, 131 cases in total including 24 cases of agricultural workers and 107 cases of fishery workers was analyzed. The most common cause of infection is rickettsial disease known as scrub typhus, which accounted for 123 cases. It was revealed that most of the actual cases of scrub typhus in agricultural workers could be underreported in statistics of compensated occupational disease. Because most agricultural workers have been engaged in self employed-business or unskilled laborers in Korea, they were almost beyond the criterion for coverage from workers' compensation. In addition, these analyses were preliminary and have not been adjusted for potential confounders.</p>
