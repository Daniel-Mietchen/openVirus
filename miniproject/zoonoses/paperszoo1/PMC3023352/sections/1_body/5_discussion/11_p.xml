<p>Workers in service sectors, such as veterinarians, researchers, and animal trainers or keepers are vulnerable to biological hazards, termed 'zoonosis'. Sentinel cases for zoonosis, such as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in animal research and fungal infection in animal caregivers, showed us how the actual risk of zoonosis could be concealed in practice. Another potential sentinel case could be brucellosis due to the exponential increase of bovine brucellosis in Korea. Finally, sewage or waste handlers should be considered as a high-risk group for exposure to biological hazards. Since most waste handlers are self-governed with respect to workers' compensation, most cases of infection have been concealed. There are several 'blind spots' for official statistics on occupational infection. Workers in the funeral industry should be considered as one emerging risk group for occupational infection from corpses. Even though funeral service providers share risk of transmission with health care workers, national statistics for conditions of funeral service providers have not been recognized yet. A thesis on the risk of exposure in funeral service providers was reported, with special focus on the embalming of corpses was reported once in Korea, but it was not for public health but for economic perspective (
