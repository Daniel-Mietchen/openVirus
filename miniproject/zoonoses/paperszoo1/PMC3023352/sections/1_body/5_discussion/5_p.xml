<p>This review had several limitations. First, even though categorization according to the cause of industrial accidents was validated, the spectrum of categories was too broad to verify the actual pathogen according to occupational subgroup. Secondly, statistics from the workers' compensation database showed only a part of the actual burden of occupational infection. Much of the information on groups at high-risk of occupational infectious disease was controlled by MOEL. The distribution of workers' compensation coverage was heterogeneous according to the spectrum of regulation, even among the same functional groups in Korea. Since high-risk groups have been legally unprotected, the validity and effectiveness of statistics-based on workers' compensation is tenuous. Underestimation for policy-making and interventions to decrease risk of exposure could be raised. Therefore, a broad approach should be considered encompassing social- and academic-based issues for high-risk groups, as well as provision of training and equipment.</p>
