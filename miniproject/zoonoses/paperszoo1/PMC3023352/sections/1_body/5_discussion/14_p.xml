<p>Recently, the main challenges for government have been being focusing on each high-risk group. However, most high-risk groups for occupational risk of infectious disease are beyond the scope of MOEL in Korea. Health care, agricultural, fishery and forestry workers, and waste handlers are considered 'blind spots' when dealing with workers' compensation. The combination of under-reporting of occupational disease in national statistics and lack of concern from the organizational system for occupational disease can result in the responsibility for prevention and control of infection being a personal burden. This could lead to the weakening demand for policy-making and reduction of obligation for risk control interventions. Therefore, a broader approach should be considered that encompasses social- and academic-based issues for high-risk groups, including the practicalities of training and equipment availability.</p>
