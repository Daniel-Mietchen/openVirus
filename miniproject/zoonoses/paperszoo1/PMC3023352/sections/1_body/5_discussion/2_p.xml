<p>Cases diagnosed as occupational infection and covered under workers' compensation were classified as 'the disorder caused by biological agent' in international statistics on occupational injury and illness. Because of differences in classification, a global consensus on the magnitude and spectrum of infectious diseases in occupational disease has failed to materialize. In 2008, occupational disorders caused by biological agents in Japan accounted for 2.9% (257 cases) of the total number of occupational injury and illness (8,684 cases) (

Among all occupational illnesses (2,432 cases) in 2008, excluding industrial accident-related illnesses (6,252 cases), cases of occupational infection accounted for 10.6% of the total in Japan. According to the Finnish Register of Occupational Diseases, 134 cases (2.0%) of occupational infection out of 6,715 recognized and suspected cases of occupational disease occurred in 2006 (

However, problems arise when making direct comparisons of occupational health statistics between countries because of differences in reporting procedures and how work-related injury and illness are compensated.
