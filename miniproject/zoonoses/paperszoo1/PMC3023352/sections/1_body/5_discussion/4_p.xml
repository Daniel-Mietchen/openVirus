<p>Cases of occupational infection in 2007 (159 cases) were more frequently reported than in 2006 (113 cases). Intestinal tract infection (17 cases) and dermal fungal infection (17 cases), which had hardly been reported in the past, had surged in 2007 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Moreover, incidence according to industry type (clerk, 21 cases) and time-duration after employed (0.5-1 yr) peaked in 2007. An overview of all available statistics for 2007 suggested an increase in occupational infection, such as food-borne illness. In the 9-yr period covered by this review, compensated occupational infection was most frequent in workers employed less than 3 months, with the exception being 2007. Regardless of working characteristics, all newly employed workers should be educated in maintaining safety and health in the workplace. Even if case numbers are collated in annual reports without an actual analysis of the data, the number of compensated cases showed a trend, and the epidemiology of occupational infection should be an essential consideration for control and management of occupational disease.
