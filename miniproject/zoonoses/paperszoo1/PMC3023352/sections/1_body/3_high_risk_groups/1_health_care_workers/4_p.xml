<p>Health care workers have also experienced latent tuberculosis by exposure to the pathogen in hospitals. One study examined changes in the tuberculin skin test and the QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay before and after treatment for latent tuberculosis in health care workers at a local university hospital. Among 48 participants (14 doctors, 34 nurses), test-results were positive as markers of latent tuberculosis in 25-39.6% of study subjects respectively (

Tuberculosis occurred in 61 (0.72%) of 8,433 newly employed health care workers over a 6-yr period. The prevalence ratio was calculated by dividing the number of observed tuberculosis cases in health care workers by the number of tuberculosis cases in the general population in Korea. The prevalence ratio among all health care workers was 1.05 (95% CI 0.80-1.35) (
