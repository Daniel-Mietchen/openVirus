<p>A focused review of occupational infection in health care workers from the workers' compensation database was performed (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). From January 1998 to December 2004, 307 cases of compensated occupational infection were collected. The most common cause of infection was tuberculosis (219 cases, 71.3%), followed by viral hepatitis (43 cases, 13.7%). The major type of occupation was nurse (223 cases, 72.7%), followed by doctor (37 cases, 12.1%). The most common working duration was 1.0-5.0 yr (164 cases, 53.4%) and the most common age group was 20-29 yr old (228 cases, 74.3%). The most common size of the enterprise was 500-900 workers (91 cases, 29.6%). The majority of working place of hospital were from inpatient wards (161 cases, 52.4%), followed by intensive care units (51 cases, 16.6%). The result showed that the highest risk group for occupational infection in the health care sector was female nurses of reproductive age. Therefore, the importance of prevention in high-risk groups for health care-related occupational infection should be stressed. Moreover, this article could elucidate the variety of occupational infection, not only the majority of health care-related infection, such as tuberculosis and viral hepatitis, but also infections through contact or airborne transmission (e.g., measles and meningitis).
