<p>Overall, genotype to phenotype mapping using host reservoir as the discriminant phenotype can reveal evolutionary trajectories of RNA viruses in rapid expansion and under great evolutionary pressure (capturing the effects of diversification and expansion in a new host, as well as the contraction of diversity following host adaptation), while establishing the genetic signatures imposed by specific hosts which permit cross-species transmission events to be identified. Although discriminant analysis approaches are typically marred by biases related to sampling efforts and founder effects 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, RFA enables the circumvention of some of these biases through cross-validation, sampling with replacement and attribution of weights to unequally sampled groups (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003254.s017">Text S1</xref> for more details). Even though some residual sources of bias are impossible to eliminate, these rigorous methods (which are computationally efficient and thus applicable to large numbers of sequences) are potentially useful for assessing the risk of viral emergence, and represent a powerful additional tool alongside phylogenetic analysis for analysing the phenotypic evolution of RNA viruses.
