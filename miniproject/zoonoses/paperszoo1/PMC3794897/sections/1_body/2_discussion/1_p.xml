<p>In recent years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become an increasingly popular tool to identify genetic determinants of non-infectious human diseases 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-McCarthy1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. However, statistically rigorous genotype-to-phenotype mapping for pathogens has been much less common. The methods used for human GWAS are particularly ill-suited to feature selection in RNA viruses, due to the short genome length, very high substitution rate and diversity, and the high degree of genetic linkage

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Siu1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Human GWAS tend to concentrate on common variants to explain the observed phenotypes

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Wittkowski1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>; our work demonstrates that non-parametric machine-learning based methods – such as RFA – are more appropriate in the context of RNA viruses, by identifying sets of substitutions associated with a particular phenotypic class, rather than solely evaluating the significance of individual polymorphisms

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Wittkowski1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. The incorporation of interactions among predictor variables in RFA makes it possible to identify possible epistatic effects, as highlighted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003254-g003">Figure 3</xref>, with substitutions being determinant for host discrimination when found together with other substitutions at other sites, but being fairly unimportant by themselves. While RFA and other related discriminative methods arise from a different theoretical paradigm from likelihood-based statistical models, their predictive performance can be readily assessed via bootstrapping and other resampling methods.
