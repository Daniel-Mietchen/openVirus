<p>Our work demonstrates that machine-learning based feature selection methods are a powerful tool for 
 <italic>de novo</italic> discovery of likely functional host discriminating markers, whilst providing a measure of the relative importance of those markers to host specificity. More generally, we highlight the potential of RFA for gaining important biological insights on cross-species transitions of RNA viruses.. First, we find that even relatively distantly related viruses within viral families – that might be geographically isolated and transmitted by different routes – share highly conserved genetic signatures of host specificity. Second, we see that the fitness landscapes of host adaptation are shaped by host phylogeny, with evolutionary barriers generally being lower between closely related host species, though not always (influenza A viruses transfer between birds and some mammalian hosts being a counter-example). Third, our analysis of influenza A often selects sites with empirically proven functional relevance
