<p>RFA prediction errors and variable importance are estimated from the samples which are left out of the training set at each split of the tree –the ‘out-of-bag’ samples. This makes RFA highly robust to over-fitting. Although RFA is unlikely to over-fit, we carried out cross-validation of the algorithm by performing multiple bootstrap runs of the feature selection procedure. Each bootstrap run is a new realisation of the complete feature selection procedure, thus removing selection bias concerns on the importance of the most significant variables.</p>
