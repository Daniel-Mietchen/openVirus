<p>The information within a given sequence alignment was numerically recoded into an allele frequency matrix, using the 
 <italic>adegenet</italic> R package 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Jombart1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref> (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003254.s017">Text S1</xref> for more details). Starting from a multiple sequence alignment, all conserved sites are discarded, and a presence/absence matrix of all other alleles is assembled. Since we are dealing with RNA viruses, this matrix is actually equivalent to a presence/absence matrix of amino acid/nucleotide types in polymorphic sites (
