<p>To address our second goal of investigating the functional relevance of identified discriminant features, we applied RFA to a collection of influenza A samples from distinct host species focusing on two viral segments that have been suggested to be major determinants of host range and virulence 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Ping1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. First, as a critical validation of the RFA, we analysed H1N1 hemagglutinin (HA) amino acid sequences collected in human (pre and post 2009 pandemic) and swine hosts, since multiple sources of empirical evidence for the functional relevance of specific amino acids in that gene are available

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Neumann1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Tumpey1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Second, we analysed the PB2 Influenza A gene, since it is highly conserved across subtypes and its evolution has been hypothesised to reflect host specific adaptation
