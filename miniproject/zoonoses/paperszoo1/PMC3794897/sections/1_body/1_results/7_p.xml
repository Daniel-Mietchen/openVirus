<p>Feature selection performed on the PB2 segment highlights subtype transcending functionally relevant amino acids from sequences of 7 influenza subtypes (H1N1, H1N2, H2N2, H3N2, H5N1, H3N8, H7N7), collected in 5 different hosts (humans, birds, pigs, dogs, and horses), as detailed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003254.s013">Table S8</xref>. Overall, we identified a subset of 23 host discriminant positions (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003254.s014">Table S9</xref>), out of which only 7 fall outside known functional domains 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Boivin1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Das1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Our results are substantially congruent (overlap of 7 identified positions out of 12) with those of a phylogenetic study aimed at identifying amino acid sites with strong support for different selection constraints in human and avian viruses 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Tamuri1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, even though our analysis is not limited to differences between these two hosts. A closer look at the identified sites in the most extensively studied functional domains (the 627 and NLS domains) reveals that all lie on the surface of the protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003254-g006">Figure 6</xref>), with mutations at positions 588, 591,627, and 702 being responsible for the most drastic conformational changes. Analysis of the physiochemical properties of the selected amino acids reveals side chain charge reversals in positions 591 and 627 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003254.s014">Table S9</xref>). The insertion of a lysine in an otherwise avian adapted H5N1 virus (which is unable to infect humans) has been shown to promote host adaptation

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Subbarao1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and increase virulence 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Hatta1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Conversely, mutation in amino acid 591 can reduce the selective pressure for mutations at amino acid 627, serving as an alternate human adaptive strategy 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Mehle1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. This possible interaction is emphasised by the juxtaposition of residues 591 and 627, as observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003254-g006">Figure 6</xref>. Of the remaining selected amino acids, some refer to mutations that can alter domain structure, three of which are human discriminating (661, 674, and 702). Interestingly, only one of the selected sites (292) differentiates canine viruses from equine viruses. The paired mean distance between groups (measured in terms of the number of differences observed in the full gene sequences) is smallest for the canine and equine viruses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003254.s015">Table S10</xref>). These host species turn out to be the ones with the most recent common ancestor 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-daFonseca1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-deJong1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, lending additional support to the hypothesis that host phylogeny shapes evolution of viruses by affecting cross-species mutational barriers. However, influenza H1N1 viruses found in human hosts are more similar (on average) to avian viruses than to viruses found in other mammalian hosts. Bird viruses are also the least divergent comparison group from swine viruses, perhaps reflecting the avian origin of all influenza viruses, and that, for influenza, transmission between birds and some mammalian hosts (human and swine in this case) is more frequent than expected by their phylogenetic relationships, probably due to persistent exposure in domestic settings.
