<p>We first analyse polymerase gene sequences of RNA viruses to identify the genetic signatures predicting host species. As an example, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003254-g001">Figure 1a</xref> represents the diversity of Flavivirus polymerase amino acid sequences (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003254.s007">Table S2</xref>). Here we use principal component analysis (PCA) solely to visualise the variation between samples, not as a classification tool. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003254-g001">Figure 1b</xref> illustrates how feature selection identifies amino acid positions which robustly classify samples by host species, resulting in clustering of samples which infect the same reservoir. The clustering of samples seen in the PCA plot is similar to that seen in the maximum likelihood tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003254-g001">Figure 1c</xref>), supporting the use of PCA as a useful tool for generating low-dimensional representations of genetic variation.
