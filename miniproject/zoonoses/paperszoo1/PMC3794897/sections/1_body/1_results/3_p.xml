<p>Second, we examine the potential of RFA applied as a phenotypic classifier to give insight into cross-species disease emergence. In this case, analysis of sequences of viruses which have fully adapted to particular host species – as in the Flavivirus example – is insufficient to distinguish between the subset of mutations required to allow cross-species emergence and later non-essential mutations which further increase viral fitness in a new species. We therefore need to examine data collected from zoonotic outbreaks. The 2003 SARS epidemic is a good example of a zoonosis which rapidly developed a high level of transmissibility in humans

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Guan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The pathogen was rapidly identified 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Fouchier1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and the origin of the virus was initially traced back to palm civets 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Guan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, before bats were identified as the natural reservoirs of SARS-like coronaviruses 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. We applied the RFA to nucleotide sequences of the spike protein of SARS-like coronaviruses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003254.s008">Table S3</xref>), recovered from human patients and palm civets from the 2003 and 2004 epidemics and bat sequences available in the Genbank database. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003254-g002">Figure 2a</xref> illustrates the extent to which bat sequences differ from the human and palm civet sequences recovered in China in 2002–2004, and also highlights the similarity of palm civet and human sequences 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Guan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Analysis of the variation in the selected host-discriminant viral alleles (highlighted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003254-g003">Figure 3</xref>) reveals interesting relationships between host reservoirs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003254-g002">Figure 2b</xref>). Firstly, there is noticeable genetic variation in the samples from human SARS patients collected in the early and mid-stages of the 2003 epidemic, compatible with adaptation of the virus to a new host species. The late 2003 samples were less variable, suggesting selective pressures may by then have stabilized 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Consortium1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Secondly, human patient samples from a small outbreak in January 2004 are more closely related to palm civet 2004 samples than to any human sample from the previous year, indicating that the 2004 outbreak represented an independent cross species transition 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The palm civet samples from 2003 were collected a few months after the human epidemic ended so there might have been an accumulation of mutations responsible for the substantial distance between palm civet 2003 samples and human 2003 samples. However, the close proximity between the bat samples and the first samples from the human 2003 epidemic suggests that the transition from palm civet to human occurred quite rapidly after the transition from bat to palm civet. With respect to our second goal – identifying functional relevant sites – it is notable that 12 of the 15 positions identified by feature selection coded for non-synonymous substitutions (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003254.s009">Table S4</xref>), most of which are mapped onto the surface of the spike protein. It should be noted that of the 15 positions identified in the current study, 13 overlap with those found in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Pickett1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The functional relevance of the two unique positions (239 and 311) found here and that of the 13 unique positions identified in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Pickett1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> is not clear. When running the RFA for amino acid sequences of the same viruses, we obtain a subset of 12 significant amino acid positions that are coded for by the exact same non-synonymous substitutions highlighted by the RFA conducted on the nucleotide sequences.
