<p>Our goals are two-fold. First, we investigate how well feature-selection algorithms such as RFA can reliably classify RNA viruses according to their host species reservoir, thereby giving insight into pathogen evolution, and the frequency of cross-species transition events. Identification of functional polymorphisms is not critical in meeting this goal, though clearly is desirable. Second, we evaluate how well RFA can identify sets of sites that are functionally relevant to the phenotype of interest (in this case host species), in the context of dense RNA virus genomes and their high degree of linkage.</p>
