<p>High mutation rates in RNA viruses facilitate the overcoming of host specific barriers

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Parrish1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. However, cross-species transfer seems to be favoured between closely related host species

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Pedersen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, suggesting that the fitness landscape of host adaptation is shaped by host phylogeny. Streicker and colleagues 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Streicker1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> defined lineages of rabies virus associated to particular bat taxa, identifying 43 cross species transmission events involving 15 bat species. Here we reanalyse the complete nucleoprotein sequences available for five of those bat species (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003254.s010">Table S5</xref>). PCA applied to these sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003254-g004">Figure 4a</xref>) shows how viruses collected from 3 of the bats species (
 <italic>L. borealis, L. seminolus, L. cinereus</italic>) are extremely similar, with a substantially divergent lineage infecting 
 <italic>E. fuscus</italic> bats and an isolated small cluster of viruses seen in 
 <italic>T. brasiliensis</italic>. Applying RFA to predict host species to these sequences allows discrimination of 
 <italic>L. cinereus</italic> specific traits (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003254-g004">Figure 4b</xref>), but does not significantly separate the 
 <italic>L. borealis</italic> and 
 <italic>L. seminolus</italic> clusters. This suggests that transmission of rabies virus between these two bat species is much more frequent than between any other pair of species examined. The advantage of RFA compared with phylogenetic methods is that it allows a probability of “belonging” to each host bat species to be estimated for each virus sample. Thus we can examine whether a virus isolated in one species is in fact native to a different host species. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003254-g004">Figure 4b</xref> highlights the 8 outlier sequences (T1–T8) in this dataset – viruses which are closer to rabies viruses native to a different species from that in which they were isolated. For these 8 viruses, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003254-g004">Figure 4c</xref> gives the RFA classification probabilities of these viruses to the 5 different host species considered. In six cases, the cross-species transitions thus identified agree with those identified in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Streicker1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Five of these 8 transitions occurred between 
 <italic>L. borealis</italic> and 
 <italic>L. seminolus</italic>. This, and the relatively poor ability of RFA to choose between these species in classifying viruses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003254.s011">Table S6</xref>), suggests that phylogenetic closeness between host species (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003254.s004">Figure S4</xref>) facilitates cross-species transmission.
