<p>While most viral variants generated in a specific host are selectively neutral in that host, upon crossing the species barrier they are under strong selective pressure. We expect selection to shape the relative frequencies of viral variants found in donor and recipient species. Specific hosts impose specific evolutionary landscapes on viruses which will translate into signature genetic sequences. We therefore expect comparisons of allele frequencies between sequences of the same pathogen isolated from different hosts to reveal a large subset of alleles which are conserved between host species and a smaller subset of host specific alleles. This comparison can be performed by statistical techniques able to discriminate phenotype (host) relevant variables (alleles). Here we apply feature selection methods which identify a subset of variable sites which can be used to build a robust phenotype classifier
