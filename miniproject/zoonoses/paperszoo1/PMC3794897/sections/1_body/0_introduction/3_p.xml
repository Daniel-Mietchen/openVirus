<p>The identification of genetic markers predicting cross-species disease emergence faces many of the same challenges as genotype-to-phenotype mapping in other spheres, such as human genome-wide association studies of risk factors for chronic diseases 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Turnbull1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Principle among these are relatively small sample sizes coupled with a very large number of potential explanatory variables (single nucleotide substitutions and their interactions)
