 <title>Author Summary</title>
 <p>Moving away from genome scan methods used for human GWAS (ultimately inappropriate for the short highly polymorphic genomes of RNA viruses), our work shows the power and potential of multi-class machine learning algorithms in inferring the functional genetic changes associated with phenotypic change (e.g. crossing a species barrier). We show that even distantly related viruses within a viral family share highly conserved genetic signatures of host specificity; reinforce how fitness landscapes of host adaptation are shaped by host phylogeny; and highlight the evolutionary trajectories of RNA viruses in rapid expansion and under great evolutionary pressure. We do so by (for each dataset) unveiling a set of phenotype characteristic mutations which are shown to be functionally relevant, thus providing new insights into phenotypic relationships between RNA viruses. These methods also provide a solid statistical framework with which the degree of host adaptation can be inferred, thus serving as a valuable tool for studying host transition events with particular relevance for emerging infectious diseases. These methods can then serve as rigorous tools of emergence potential assessment, specifically in scenarios where rapid host classification of newly emerging viruses can be more important than identifying putative functional sites.</p>
