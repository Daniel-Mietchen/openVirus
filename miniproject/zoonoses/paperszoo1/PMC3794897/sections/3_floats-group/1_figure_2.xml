  <p>The first two principal components of the PCA undertaken using (a) SARS coronavirus complete spike protein nucleotide sequences, and (b) nucleotides selected by the RFA. Viral groups, defined by host species and season, are represented by ellipses of different colours: Human patient samples from 2002/2003 collected in early, mid and late epidemic phase are HP03E (green), HP03M (purple) and HP03L (yellow); 2004 Human samples are labelled HP04 (black); palm civets samples collected in 2003 and 2004 are labelled PC03 (blue) and PC04 (red); bat samples are labelled BT (magenta).</p>
