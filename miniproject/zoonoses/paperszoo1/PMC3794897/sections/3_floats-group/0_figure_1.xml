  <title>Feature selection of host specific genetic signatures within Flaviviridae.</title>
  <p>The scatterplots display the first two principal components of the PCA undertaken using allele frequency information from (a) Flaviviruses' full polymerase sequences and (b) an alignment of the amino acids selected by the random forest algorithm. The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree obtained from full polymerase sequences is presented in (c). Tree branch lengths reflect the number of amino acid differences per sequence.</p>
