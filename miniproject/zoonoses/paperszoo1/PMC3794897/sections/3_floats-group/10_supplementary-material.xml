 <caption>
  <p>Bat species phylogeny according to the 12S ribosomal RNA gene (Genbank reference for sequences - AF263219, AF326092, AY495480, AY495484, and AY495482). The maximum likelihood tree is shown, displaying the percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in number of substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 1014 positions in the final dataset.</p>
