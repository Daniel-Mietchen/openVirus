  <p>Feature selection impact on host reservoir clustering, training set (TS) and out-of-bag samples (OOB) error rates for the viruses of 3 taxa (excluding Flaviviruses) discriminated in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003254.s006">Table S1</xref>. We display the relationship between viral sequences according to the scores of the first two principal components of the PCA analysis of both the original sequences and the sequences containing only those amino acids which were selected by feature selection. Colour coding of host reservoir is as follows: gold – primates/humans; purple – birds; green – other mammals/artiodactyls; red – bats/carnivores; blue – rodents/lagomorphs.
