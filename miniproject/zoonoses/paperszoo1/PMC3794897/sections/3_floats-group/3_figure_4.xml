  <title>Cross-species transition events of rabies viruses in bats.</title>
  <p>The first two principal components of the PCA undertaken using (a) complete Rabies virus nucleoprotein sequences, and (b) an alignment of nucleotides selected by the RFA. The ellipses of different colours represent the bat species in which virus samples were collected. Eight putative cross-species transmission events are highlighted in yellow with the respective predicted bat species of origin shown in (c).</p>
