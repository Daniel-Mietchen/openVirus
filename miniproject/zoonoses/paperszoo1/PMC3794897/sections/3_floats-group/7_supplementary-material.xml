  <p>RFA error rates as a function of the number of variables in the forest (panels on the left) and solution stability (panels on the right) for 4 viral taxa. Points in the panels on the right reflect the proportion of trees in which the variable of the rank given on the x-axis from the original random forest are included among the top ranked X variables (X = 10 for blue points and X = 30 for red points) in the 100 bootstrap samples.</p>
