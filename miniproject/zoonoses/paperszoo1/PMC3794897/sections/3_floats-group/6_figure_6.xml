  <title>Computationally predicted structure of the 531â€“738 subset of amino acids in the PB2 subunit of the polymerase protein of influenza A viruses.</title>
  <p>For structural prediction we used the consensus sequence for the subset of viruses' samples collected from each host species. These sequences contain two functional domains: the 627 (in cyan) and the NLS binding (in grey) domains. Highlighted in yellow are the amino acids which were identified by the RFA as discriminating host species.</p>
