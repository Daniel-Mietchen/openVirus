  <title>Allele diversity across samples of influenza A H1N1 HA sequences collected from human (pre and post 2009 pandemic) and swine hosts.</title>
  <p>Each vertical stripe represents allelic variance for a specific amino acid residue in three blocks of 40 sequences (taken at random) per host/virus type. The block of amino acids marked by an asterisk refers to the 100 residues to which the RFA has attributed the highest significance in explaining the allelic differences observed between groups. The ordering of other amino acids follow that of the HA gene. For each position (column) the allele present in the first human (seasonal) virus is colored blue. Moving from bottom to top, different alleles at the same position are then sequentially colored green, red, cyan, yellow and purple. Non polymorphic sites are not shown.</p>
