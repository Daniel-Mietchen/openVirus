<p>The 25-page chapter on the Global Emerging Infections System (GEIS) of the DOD as it applies to biodefense is well written. Surveillance systems used by DOD-GEIS are described, from the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics to newer systems, along with ways to integrate DOD and civilian surveillance systems. Other particularly useful chapters that encompass multiple present and potential future biological threats include those on diagnostics. These 3 chapters focus on explaining biological threat identification systems, DNA-based pathogen identification, and immune responseâ€“based assays. Taken together, the 25 chapters of this book are a welcome addition to the growing field of counterbioterrorism and complement well the mostly clinical publications already in print.</p>
