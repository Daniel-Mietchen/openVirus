<p>In conclusion, the results from this study have demonstrated that the HEV 239 vaccine is highly immunogenic for rabbits and that it can completely protected these animals against rabbit HEV and genotype 4 HEV infections, suggesting the vaccine could serve as a candidate vaccine to manage animal sources of human HEV infection. These findings may facilitate the prevention of food-borne sporadic HEV infection in both developing and industrialized countries. Given that swine is the primary animal reservoir of HEV, future studies are warranted to evaluate the HEV 239 vaccine in the pig model.</p>
