<p>A growing body of evidence has revealed that rabbits constitute another potentially important reservoir of HEV and humans appear to be at risk of infection from rabbit HEV 
 <xref rid="pone.0087600-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0087600-Lhomme1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The recent investigations of HEV prevalence in rabbits from China, USA and France indicated rabbit HEVs are widespread among various breeds of rabbits 
 <xref rid="pone.0087600-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0087600-Izopet1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Moreover, the demonstration that rabbit HEV can experimentally infect cynomolgus macaques 
 <xref rid="pone.0087600-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and SPF pigs 
 <xref rid="pone.0087600-Cossaboom2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> together with the identification of a human HEV strain closely related to rabbit HEV 
 <xref rid="pone.0087600-Izopet1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> has reinforced the potential zoonotic risk of this virus. However, it remains unclear whether rabbit HEV is preventable by vaccination of HEV 239, which is based on a genotype 1 strain of HEV 
 <xref rid="pone.0087600-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In the present study, the HEV 239 vaccine conferred cross-protection against subsequent infections from rabbit HEV and swine HEV of genotype 4. By contrast, all six unvaccinated rabbits developed hepatitis, with liver enzyme elevations, viremia, and fecal virus shedding following challenge. Previous studies have shown that the capsid protein of rabbit HEV cross-reacted with antibodies against human and swine HEV 
 <xref rid="pone.0087600-Cossaboom2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and that rabbit and human HEV belong to a single serotype 
 <xref rid="pone.0087600-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, which might explain why the genotype 1 vaccine is highly efficacious against both rabbit HEV and swine HEV infection. In the previous study with rhesus monkeys, the vaccine could afford complete protection against a challenge dose of 10
 <sup>4</sup> genomes and partial protection against infection with 10
 <sup>7</sup> genomes 
 <xref rid="pone.0087600-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The titer of challenge virus in this study was only 2.5×10
 <sup>6</sup> copies due to the limited amount of source material, and so additional studies will be needed to confirm that the 239 vaccine is able to protect rabbits against the higher challenge dose used in the earlier study.
