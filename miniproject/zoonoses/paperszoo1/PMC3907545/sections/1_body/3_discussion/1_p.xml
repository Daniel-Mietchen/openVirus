<p>Hepatitis E was historically thought to be a disease of developing countries associated with water-borne transmission. However, the recent recognition of the importance of chronic hepatitis E in immunosuppressed individuals

 <xref rid="pone.0087600-Dalton1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and the increasing number of zoonotically acquired cases from non-endemic industrialized countries has suggested that food-borne transmission appears to play a more important role in HEV infection in these regions. The recently licensed HEV 239 vaccine will be of great use in preventing of water-borne transmission during outbreaks in developing countries where the virus is endemic. However, prevention strategies for food-borne sporadic HEV infection in both developing and developed countries are more problematic since the target population and transmission routes are currently uncertain. Vaccination of the primary host for HEV seems a possible option

In the present study, we showed that the HEV 239 vaccine afforded complete protection for rabbits against challenge with rabbit HEV and swine HEV of genotype 4, suggesting the vaccine could be used to cope with zoonotic transmission of HEV.
