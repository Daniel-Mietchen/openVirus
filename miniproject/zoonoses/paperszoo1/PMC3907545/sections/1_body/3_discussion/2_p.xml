<p>The HEV 239 vaccine elicited excellent immunogenicity in rabbits, as indicated by the strong anti-HEV antibody response in the immunized group (

Although the first dose had induced satisfactory immune responses with S/CO value reaching 23.5 at week 2, three 30Âµg doses of immunizations were carried out according to the instructions of the vaccine manufacture in this study. Consequently, additional studies should be performed to determine appropriate vaccine dosages and immunization times to make large-scale animal vaccinations much more cost effective. Besides, our results confirmed previous reports that rabbit model is able to serve as an alternative to the non-human primate models for HEV vaccine evaluation
