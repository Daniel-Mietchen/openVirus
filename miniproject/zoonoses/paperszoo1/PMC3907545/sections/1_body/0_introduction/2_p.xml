<p>Accumulating lines of evidence indicate that animal reservoirs of HEV serve as important sources of human infection. The demonstration of HEV infection in humans following consumption of undercooked infected meat from wild boar and deer has provided direct proof of zoonotic transmission of HEV genotypes 3 and 4
