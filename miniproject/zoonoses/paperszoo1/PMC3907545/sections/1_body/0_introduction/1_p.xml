<p>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) constitutes a significant health burden worldwide, especially in regions with poor sanitation including large parts of Asia, Africa and Mexico, where it has proved to be the most or second-most important cause of acute clinical hepatitis 
 <xref rid="pone.0087600-Purcell1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. At least four genotypes comprising a single serotype of mammalian HEV exist. Genotypes 1 and 2 exclusively infect humans and are mainly responsible for the large epidemics that have occurred in resource-limited areas where they are transmitted by water-borne and fecalâ€“oral routes usually through contaminated water supplies. Genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic, and are mainly associated with sporadic infections and limited foodborne outbreaks in both developing and developed countries 
 <xref rid="pone.0087600-Hoofnagle1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. To-date, in addition to human, mammalian HEV strains have been isolated from both domesticated and wild pigs, 
 <italic>sika</italic> deer, mongooses and rabbits, and antibodies to HEV have been detected in a wider range of animal species including cats, dogs, cattle, sheep, goats, horses, macaques, donkeys, rats, and mice
