<p>Each of the rabbits vaccinated with three 30 Âµg doses of the HEV 239 vaccine mounted an anti-HEV response while control animals inoculated with PBS remained negative for antibodies to HEV during the 6 week pre-challenge period. The first vaccine dose induced a strong anti-HEV antibody response in the vaccinated animals, with the mean signal-to-cutoff (S/CO) value reaching 23.5 at week 2. Following the two booster immunizations at the second and fourth week, the anti-HEV titer (S/CO) increased to 27.3 at the time of challenge (
