<p>At week 6, each of the rabbits in groups A was challenged with 2.5×10
 <sup>6</sup> copies of a rabbit HEV strain and those in group B with the same dose of a swine HEV strain of genotype 4.The course of the infection was monitored for 10 weeks after challenge by measuring serum ALT levels, viremia, fecal shedding and HEV antibody responses. Two of the control animals in group A inoculated with rabbit HEV showed significant elevations in serum ALT, as indicated by a peak ALT value that was equal to or greater than twice the geometric mean of the three immediate pre-challenge values (

Viremia and fecal shedding of virus was also detected in all three control rabbits in group A.HEV RNA was first detected in sera at 3 weeks after inoculation and was intermittently positive for a further 3–5 weeks, while virus excretion in stool was first detected 1 week post-challenge and continued until the end of monitoring at 10 weeks post challenge.
