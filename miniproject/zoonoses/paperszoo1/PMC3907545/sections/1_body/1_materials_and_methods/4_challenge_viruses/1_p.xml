<p>A genotype 4 strain bjsw1 (pig feces, GU206559) and a rabbit strain of HEV CHN-BJ-R14 (rabbit feces, JX109834) were used as challenge viruses. A suspension [in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4)] of feces containing the swine or rabbit HEV strain was prepared as a challenge pool. The clarified suspension was subsequently filtered through 0.45-µm and 0.22-µm filters. Quantification of HEV RNA in the virus inocula was determined according to the method described previously 
 <xref rid="pone.0087600-Jothikumar1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and a final dilution containing 2.5×10
 <sup>6</sup> copies per milliliter (mL) was immediately used for intravenous inoculation of animals.
