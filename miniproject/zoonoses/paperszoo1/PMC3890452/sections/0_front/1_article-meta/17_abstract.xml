 <p>In this review, we mainly focus on zoonotic encephalitides caused by arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) of the families 
  <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> (genus 
  <italic>Flavivirus</italic>) and 
  <italic>Togaviridae</italic> (genus 
  <italic>Alphavirus</italic>) that are important in both humans and domestic animals. Specifically, we will focus on alphaviruses (Eastern equine encephalitis virus, Western equine encephalitis virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus) and flaviviruses (Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus). Most of these viruses were originally found in tropical regions such as Africa and South America or in some regions in Asia. However, they have dispersed widely and currently cause diseases around the world. Global warming, increasing urbanization and population size in tropical regions, faster transportation and rapid spread of arthropod vectors contribute in continuous spreading of arboviruses into new geographic areas causing reemerging or resurging diseases. Most of the reemerging arboviruses also have emerged as zoonotic disease agents and created major public health issues and disease epidemics.
