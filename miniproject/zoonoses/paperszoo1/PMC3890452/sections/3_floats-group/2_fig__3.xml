  <p>Vertical transmission cycle (transovarial and transstadial). A vertical transmission exists in some arthropod vectors and is epidemiologically important. This type of transmission is found in viruses that belong to tick-borne encephalitis complex. However, it is also found in some of the mosquito-transmitted viruses (e.g., La Crosse encephalitis, Murray Valley encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis,West Nile, and Western equine encephalitis).</p>
