<p>Arboviruses are maintained in complex life cycles involving nonhuman primate/vertebrate hosts and primary arthropod vectors (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Mosquitoes are the most important vectors that transmit zoonotic viruses. Different mosquito species (
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp., etc.) may act as vectors for the same virus in different vertebrate hosts depending on different geographical and ecological locations. Ticks, sandflies (
 <italic>Phlebotomus</italic> spp.) and gnats (
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> spp.) are also important vectors of some arboviruses. Vertical transmission (transovarial and transstadial) occurs in some arthropod vectors as they transmit some arboviruses from parent arthropod to offspring arthropods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). This type of transmission mainly occurs in tick-borne encephalitis viruses (TBEVs) but it has been also reported in some mosquito-borne viruses [

 <italic>Aedes triseriatus</italic>, not only by transovarial and transstadial routes but also sexually [
