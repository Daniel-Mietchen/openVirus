<p>Most known arboviruses were first isolated in tropical regions such as Africa and South America and in some Asian countries. However, the geographic distribution and frequency of epidemic outbreaks of arboviral diseases have expanded dramatically across the world in the past several decades [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Several factors such as changes in viral genetics, host and/or vector population, and climate changes facilitated expansion and transmission of arboviruses resulting in emergence/reemergence of arboviral disease outbreaks in new regions in the world. Extensive tropical urbanization and faster and increased movement of humans and animals with modern transportation helped vectors to be in closer contact with vertebrate reservoir hosts raising transmission potential. Introduction of West Nile virus into the New World and the emergence of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in Australia are a few prominent examples of recent unexpected emerging/reemerging zoonotic diseases [
