<p>In this review, we will mainly focus on the transmission and epidemiology of mosquito-borne arboviruses, especially alphaviruses and flaviviruses that are pathogenic to humans as well as domestic animals, thus, increasing the public health and economic significance. Although these viruses, with the exception of JEV, are not currently circulating in the Korean peninsula, there is a great chance for other viruses to emerge when a competent vector and vertebrate host populations happen to be temporally and spatially together in a permissive environment.</p>
