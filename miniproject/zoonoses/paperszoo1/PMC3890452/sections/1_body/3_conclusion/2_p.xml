<p>Currently, prevention of infection with most arboviruses relies primarily on efforts to control vector populations by spraying repellents, wearing protective clothing and reducing breeding places. Despite the great efforts to make vaccines against arboviral infections, especially those that cause severe encephalitis, only a few were successful. Currently, several new generation live-attenuated vaccines based on modern molecular biology techniques are under development. ChimeriVax candidates developed against DENV, WNV, and JEV showed satisfactory safety and immunogenicity results both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in pre-clinical tests [
