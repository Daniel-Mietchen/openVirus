<p>Many arboviruses are present in different environments across the world and virulent forms of these viruses are constantly emerging and invading new habitats. Thus, understanding the ecology and epidemiology of these arboviruses is critical to predict future emergence mechanisms and to implement preventive and control measures. In order to control and prevent the urban spread, it is extremely important to understand the mechanisms how the enzootic (sylvatic) strains reemerge and reinitiate urban transmission cycles that infect humans and domestic animals. Besides the above-mentioned viruses, there are many arboviruses with very little information available. Therefore, it is only a matter of time before we see the emergence of one of these viruses with a virulent phenotype and spread into an immunologically na√Øve population. Introduction of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) just in this summer of South Korea is an excellent example of a constant geographical expansion of these viruses. This virus is a novel member of the genus 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> in the family 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> and causes fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome in humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B169">169</xref>]. The transmission cycle of SFTSV is not clear yet, but 
 <italic>Haemaphysalis longicornis</italic> ticks are considered as vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B169">169</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B170">170</xref>]. There have been 13 confirmed cases including 8 fatalities from SFTSV in South Korea [
