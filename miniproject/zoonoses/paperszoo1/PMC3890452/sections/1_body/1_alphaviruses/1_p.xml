<p>Alphaviruses (formerly, group A arboviruses) are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the genus 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> in the family 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>. The alphavirus genome varies between 11 and 12 kb in length and is composed of a non-segmented, single-strand RNA with a 7-methylguanosine and a poly A tail at 5'- and 3'-terminus, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. It encodes four non-structural proteins responsible for genome replication and protein processing, and generates a subgenomic mRNA (26S). The five structural proteins (C, E3, E2, 6K, and E1) are translated from the 26S subgenomic mRNA [
