<p>The alphaviruses are widely distributed throughout the world. They have been classified as belonging to either New and Old World alphaviruses: New World alphaviruses (e.g., Eastern equine encephalitis virus [EEEV], Western equine encephalitis virus [WEEV], and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus [VEEV]) are distributed across the Americas and cause encephalitis in humans, whereas Old World alphaviruses (e.g., Sindbis virus [SINV], CHIKV, O'nyong-nyong virus [ONNV], Ross River virus [RRV], Barmah Forest virus [BFV], and Semliki Forest virus [SFV]), characterized by fever, rash, and arthritis, are found in Europe, Asia, Australia, and parts of Africa [

The alphavirus serogroups can be divided into seven antigenically related complexes: Barmah Forest, Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), Middleburg, Ndumu, Semliki Forest, Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE), and Western equine encephalitis (WEE) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. All clinically relevant alphaviruses are transmitted by mosquitoes. More than one mosquito species is usually involved in the alphavirus transmission cycle. The survival of alphaviruses in a certain geographic region depends on the presence of competent vectors (mosquitoes) and of vertebrate hosts that develop viremic infection with low pathogenicity. Important amplification hosts are birds (for SINV, SFV, EEEV, and WEEV), rodents (for RRV, VEEV, BFV), and monkeys (for CHIKV, ONNV, and Mayaro fever virus) [
