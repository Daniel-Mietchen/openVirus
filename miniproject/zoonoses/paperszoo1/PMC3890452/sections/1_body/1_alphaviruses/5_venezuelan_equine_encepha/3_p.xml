<p>Infected patients manifest "flu-like" clinical signs (e.g., fever, severe headache, myalgia) after 1- to 4-days of incubation. Most clinical cases are self-limited illnesses with recovery after about a week [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">102</xref>]. Thus the disease is less severe in adults than children. The case fatality rate in patients is approximately 20% but it can reach up to 35% in children under 5 years of age. In horses, enzootic and epizootic VEEV strains present a major difference in terms of pathogenesis, but they show similar virulence in humans. Generally, VEE clinical manifestations are indistinguishable from other tropical infectious diseases such as DF; therefore, the number of cases may be underestimated [
