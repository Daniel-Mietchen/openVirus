<p>Of the three equine encephalitis alphaviruses, VEEV is the most important zoonotic pathogen, with several reported outbreaks in South and Central America [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>] and some of the Central American and Mexican outbreaks have spread into southern Texas in 1971 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>]. The VEEV was first isolated from brains of affected horses during an equine encephalitis outbreak that occurred in central Colombia and Venezuela in 1936 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">92</xref>]. The VEEV antigenic complex is divided into six distinct antigenic subtypes (I-VI) (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>]. The "epizootic subtypes" of VEEV (types IAB and IC), responsible for the large outbreaks of encephalitis in horses in the Western hemisphere in the last 25 years, are believed to originate from subtype ID strains with an adaptive mutation in the E2 envelope glycoprotein gene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">94</xref>]. This mutation increases the ability to infect the epidemic mosquito vector, 
 <italic>Aedes taeniorhynchus</italic> and replication in equids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">95</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">96</xref>]. The "enzootic subtypes" of VEEV are considered to be of low pathogenicity for equids under most circumstances. The enzootic subtypes of VEEV include ID, IE, and IF strains from South and Central America, Central America and Brazil, respectively, and type II (Everglades) virus circulating in Florida. Phylogenetic studies indicate that the epidemic subtypes IAB and IC strains emerged from one of six subtypes of ID VEEV lineages, but there was no epidemic strains emerged from IE lineages [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">99</xref>]. This epidemic-progenitor subtype ID lineage occurs in western Venezuela, Colombia, and the Amazon areas of Ecuador and Peru [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">100</xref>]. Enzootic cycles of VEEV subtypes ID and IE are dispersed from southern Florida to northern Argentina [
