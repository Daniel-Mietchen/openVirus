<p>Epidemiological studies indicate that major human VEEV outbreaks emerge from humans being infected from spillover of enzootic rodent cycles [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108">108</xref>,

Although direct transmission between horses, person-to person, or from horses to humans was not confirmed, there are however, reported cases of people infected in laboratories via aerosols [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>]. VEEV is also important as a biological weapon due to the ease of growth in large quantities and the high infectivity when aerosolized [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B111">111</xref>]. Transplacental transmission of VEE infections has been observed in horses.
