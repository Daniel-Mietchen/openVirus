<p>The enzootic transmission cycle of VEEV is maintained among rodents and other vertebrates (e.g., cotton rats, spiny rats, bats, and opossums) as reservoirs and mosquitoes in the subgenus 
 <italic>Culex</italic> (
 <italic>Melanoconion</italic>) as primary vectors (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">98</xref>]. These enzootic (sylvatic) cycles are limited in distribution, and typically found in humid, tropical forests or swamps throughout the Americas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">104</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107">107</xref>]. In contrast, epizootic VEEV strains (IAB and IC) are transmitted by several mosquito vectors (e.g., 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Psorophora</italic> spp.) abundant in agricultural habitats, to susceptible amplification hosts such as equids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. During epizootic or epidemic cycles, equids are efficient amplification hosts with high-titered viremia for mosquito transmission. Thus, infections from horses will be transmitted to humans during epizootics of VEE in horses. In addition, humans, dogs, pigs, cats, cattle, goats, bats, and birds can be infected during an epizootic [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. They develop viremia that can be a source of mosquito infections.
