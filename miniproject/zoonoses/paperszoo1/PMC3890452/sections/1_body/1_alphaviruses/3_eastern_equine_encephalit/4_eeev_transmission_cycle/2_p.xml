<p>In South America, reservoirs and amplification hosts involved in the enzootic EEEV transmission cycle are not known yet. However, seroprevalence and experimental studies suggest thatthe 
 <italic>Culex</italic> (
 <italic>Melanoconion</italic>) subgenus and rodents/marsupials may serve as principal enzootic vectors and reservoirs, respectively, and they may play a more important role in enzootic EEEV transmission in South America [
