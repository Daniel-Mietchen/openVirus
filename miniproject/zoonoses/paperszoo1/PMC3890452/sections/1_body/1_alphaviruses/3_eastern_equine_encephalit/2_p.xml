<p>In North America, EEEV is enzootic from the eastern and gulf coasts as far as to inland sites (Texas) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. NA-EEEV strains are genetically highly conserved, with only one major lineage (lineage I) from the first isolation in 1933 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Most EEE outbreaks in North America occur in the late summer and early fall, often associated with heavy rainfall. Outbreaks in horses are common and often accompanied by high case-fatality rates. Eighty to 90% of the infected horses develop acute and lethal disease, and about 66% of the survivors develop severe neurologic sequelae [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. During outbreaks or epidemics of EEE, horses do not serve as amplifying hosts but they tend to be the first to develop clinical signs and often serve as an indicator of the start of an outbreak or epidemic. Thus, the rapid detection of EEEV in equine specimens is critical for control of disease outbreaks in humans, horses, and other animal species. The NA-EEEV strains are responsible for most human cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Human infections are usually asymptomatic, but some progress to severe encephalitis accompanied by high fatality rate or incapacitating sequelae. The disease is generally more severe in the elderly and infants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Although only few cases of human EEEV infection have been reported annually since the 1960s, the high mortality rate and severe neurologic sequelae in infected patients make EEEV an important human pathogen.
