<p>The EEEV transmission cycle in North America is maintained between the passerine birds as reservoir/amplification hosts and ornithophilic mosquito, 
 <italic>Culiseta melanura</italic>, as the main enzootic vector in swamp habitats (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In addition, studies have shown that 
 <italic>C. melanura</italic>, regarded as a bridge vector in human and equine infections so far, may also serve as a main epizootic vector as well [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Mosquito species such as 
 <italic>C. peccator</italic>, 
 <italic>C. erraticus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Uranotaenia sapphirina</italic> may also serve as enzootic vectors in some regions of the southeastern US [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. These mosquitoes are known to feed on reptiles and amphibians. Recently, snakes have been suggested to play a role in the enzootic EEEV transmission cycle as over-wintering hosts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. EEEV infections in birds are usually asymptomatic; however, disease with high-titered viremia and high mortality rate has been reported in chukar partridges, pheasants, egrets, glossy ibises (
 <italic>Plegadis falcinellus</italic>), rock doves, house sparrows, psittacine birds, ratites (emus, ostriches), African penguins, chicken (&lt;14 days old), pigeons, Pekin ducks, and whooping cranes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Passerine birds develop extremely high levels of viremia, enough to infect both enzootic vectors as well as a variety of bridge vectors (e.g., 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Coquillettidia</italic>) that transmit the virus from enzootic cycle to humans and horses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In pheasants, EEEV is transmitted through feather picking and cannibalism. Humans and equids are dead-end hosts since they do not develop sufficient viremia to transmit the virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].
