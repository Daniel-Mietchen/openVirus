<p>Epizootic transmission to horses and humans is mediated by bridge vectors, such as 
 <italic>Ochlerotatus melanimon</italic> in California, 
 <italic>Aedes dorsalis</italic> in Utah and New Mexico and 
 <italic>A. campestris</italic> in New Mexico. The seasonal continuation of the natural WEEV transmission cycle in temperate regions is not clear. However, the annual reintroduction of migratory birds and vertical transmission among 
 <italic>A. dorsalis</italic> mosquitoes are suspected for the maintenance mechanism in temperate regions [
