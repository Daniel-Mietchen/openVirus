<p>In addition, Highland J virus (HJV), Fort Morgan virus (FMV), and related Buggy Creek virus (BCRV), distinct but closely related to WEEV, were also isolated in North America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. HJV has been identified in the eastern US (Florida) and is transmitted from 
 <italic>C. melanura</italic> mosquitoes to songbirds in freshwater swamps [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. It has a low pathogenicity in mammals and is rarely seen in humans or horses. Exposure to HJV has not been directly associated with human illness. However, HJV can cause sporadic encephalitis in horses, and is also pathogenic to turkeys and partridges [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>]. Similar to WEEV, BCRV is a natural recombinant virus derived from Old World SINV and New World EEEV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. BCRV (and the closely related FMV) is apparently widely distributed in North America, having been found in Texas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Colorado, South Dakota, and Washington State. It was first isolated in 1980 at Buggy Creek in Grady County, Oklahoma. However, the ecologically very similar FMV was discovered in the 1970s in Colorado [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>]. BCRV is commonly associated with the cimicid swallow bug (
 <italic>Oeciacus vicarius</italic>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>]. The bug is an ectoparasite of the colonially nesting cliff swallow (
 <italic>Petrochelidon pyrrhonota</italic>) and, to a lesser extent, the house sparrow (
 <italic>Passer domesticus</italic>), with both birds serving as hosts to BCRV. FMV is also associated with swallow bugs, cliff swallows, and house sparrows. These two viruses are pathogenic to swallows but not to humans or horses. These four viruses in North America (WEEV, BCRV, FMV, and HJV), the Aura virus in South America, and SINV with its four subtypes found in Africa, Asia, Australia, and Europe, are regarded as members of the WEE complex [
