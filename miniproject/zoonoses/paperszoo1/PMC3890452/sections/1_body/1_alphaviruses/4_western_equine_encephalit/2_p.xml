<p>WEEV continues to cause equine encephalitis in northern South America and Central America with occasional outbreaks in Florida and the southwestern US, but only a few human cases of WEE have been reported, with low fatality rate, in the past several decades in North America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. Most WEEV infections in humans and equines occur in summer, June and July, and slightly later in temperate regions like Canada. Although most human cases of WEE are asymptomatic, infants and children are highly susceptible to WEEV infection and are most likely to develop severe encephalitis. Clinical manifestations develop after 2 to 10 days of incubation and are characterized by nonspecific febrile viremia, malaise, and headache often in association with meningismus. The case fatality rate in humans is about 3% to 4% [
