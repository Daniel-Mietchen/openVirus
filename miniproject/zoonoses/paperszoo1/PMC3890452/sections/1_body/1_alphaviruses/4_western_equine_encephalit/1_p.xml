<p>WEEV is genetically diverse and both epizootic and enzootic strains have been identified. Epizootic North American strains are more virulent than strains that are enzootic in South America (sporadic cases of WEE). WEE was the first equine encephalitic arbovirus identified in North America. It is closely related to Sindbis and SFV since it emerged from a recombination of viruses in the EEE and the Sindbis lineages [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. Epidemiological studies have shown that WEEV occurs throughout most of the Americas from the western half of North to South America, including Guyana, Ecuador, Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina [
