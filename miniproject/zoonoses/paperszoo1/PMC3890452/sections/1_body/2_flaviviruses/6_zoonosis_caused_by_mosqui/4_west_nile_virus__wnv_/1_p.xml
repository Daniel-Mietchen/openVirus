<p>WNV was first isolated from blood of a woman in West Nile district, Uganda in 1937 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B144">144</xref>]. Before its appearance in the New World, WNV caused sporadic outbreaks in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia. Since it first emergence in New York in 1999, West Nile virus has spread rapidly across the US, Canada, Central and South America and is currently one of the most common causes of epidemic encephalitis in the US [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Now, WNV has spread to Europe, the Mediterranean, Asia, and the Americas and has a global distribution like DENV, which occurs in tropical and subtropical areas of southeast Asia, the Pacific, and the Americas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B145">145</xref>]. WNV can be divided into five lineages based on the nucleotide sequence and phylogenetic analysis. Lineages 1 and 2 are considered the main genetic lineages. Lineage 1 is highly invasive and in the 1990's the virulent strain of lineage 1 WNV emerged in the Middle East and invaded Eastern Europe and subsequently the US, resulting in a worldwide distribution currently. KUN is a variant of lineage 1 WNV that is enzootic in Australia. Lineage 2 has remained enzootic in Africa. The nucleotide sequence identity between the lineages 1 and 2 is approximately 75% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B146">146</xref>]. Taxonomic status and virulence of lineages 3 and 4 are not clear but lineage 5 appears to be confined to India [
