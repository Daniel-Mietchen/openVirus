<p>WNV maintains an enzootic transmission cycle between 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes and birds (reservoir host). Horses, humans, and other mammals infected in a spillover transmission are "dead-end" hosts (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B152">152</xref>]. In temperate regions, human infections usually coincide with the seasonal activity of 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquito vectors that peaks in August and September. The virus amplification in birds occurs mostly in the late spring and early summer. In tropical regions, transmission occurs all year long. Due to high number of asymptomatic cases of WNV infection, there is a high risk of virus transmission by blood transfusion or organ transplantation [
