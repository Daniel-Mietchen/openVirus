<p>JE (formerly known as Japanese B encephalitis) is the most common mosquito-transmitted encephalitic disease in Asian countries where it is regarded as a major health threat [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B129">129</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B130">130</xref>]. JEV was first documented as viral encephalitis in the 1870s and isolated in 1935 from the brain of a fatal human encephalitis case in Tokyo, Japan [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. JEV is classified into one single serotype with at least four distinct genotypes (I-IV) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B134">134</xref>]. Genotype I strains have been isolated in Australia, Cambodia, China, Thailand, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam since 1967. JEV strains isolated in Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, and Thailand between 1951 and 1999 were included in Genotype II. Genotype III isolates have been found in temperate areas of Asia including China, Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines since 1935, and genotype IV was found only in Indonesia in 1980 and 1981. Recently, Genotype V has been suggested for an isolate from the Muar region of Malaysia [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B135">135</xref>]. Genotypes I and III frequently occur in epidemic regions whereas genotypes II and IV are mostly associated with endemic transmission [
