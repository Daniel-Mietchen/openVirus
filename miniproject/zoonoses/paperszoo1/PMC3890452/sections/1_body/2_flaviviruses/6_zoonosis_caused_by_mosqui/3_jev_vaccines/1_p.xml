<p>Despite the use of effective vaccines including both inactivated whole virus and live attenuated vaccines, JEV remains as an important cause of arthropod-transmitted viral encephalitis. The first JE vaccines available were inactivated vaccines prepared in mouse brains or primary hamster kidney cells with protection efficacy of 76% to 95% [

Recently, a new purified inactivated JE vaccine derived from Vero cell-adapted SA14-14-2 strain (IXIARO, Intercell AG, Vienna, Austria) has been licensed in the US, Europe, Canada, and Australia [
