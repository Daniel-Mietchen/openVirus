<p>West Nile-Innovator is a formalin-inactivated veterinary vaccine produced by Fort Dodge Animal Health (now Zoetis, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) conditionally licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 2001 and received full-licensed status in 2003. Acambis Inc. (Cambridge, MA, USA) has developed a live-attenuated vaccine based on its ChimericVax technology, which has also been used in the development of vaccines against JE and DENVs. The first Chimerivax West Nile, WN01, was developed by Intervet as a single dose vaccine for horses (PreveNile, Schering-Plough Animal Health/Merck) and has been commercially available since 2006 in the US [

As a part of the development of a WNV vaccine for human use (WN02), three mutations were introduced into the WN01 E gene (L107F, A316V, and K440R). These mutations are known to attenuate the closely related JEV. In the human WN02 vaccine, these mutations were shown to independently enhance neuroattenuation of the chimera, so that reversion at one or two residues would maintain the attenuated phenotype [
