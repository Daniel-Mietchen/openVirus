<p>Most of the WNV infections in humans are subclinical (80%), but some develop clinical signs (20%) without neurologic signs characterized by biphasic fever, malaise, headache, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, myalgia, and arthralgia (West Nile fever). Less than 1% of the people will develop neurologic disease (1 neurologic case in ~150 total infections) and of these 10% are fatal (&lt;0.1% of total infections) [

Neurological disease is more common in elderly people and immunosuppressed individuals and is characterized by meningitis, encephalitis, or meningoencephalitis. Some people develop a poliomyelitis-like syndrome of acute flaccid paralysis following WNV infection. Horses are the most important domestic animal affected by WNV, but severity of the disease is dependent on the neurovirulence of the infecting virus strain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B151">151</xref>]. The strain of lineage 1 WNV that emerged in North America and Europe is highly pathogenic to horses and affected horses show a variety of neurological signs. About 1 in 12 horses develops clinical signs following infection characterized by fever, anorexia, depression, and encephalomyelitis (muscle fasciculation of face and neck, hyperexcitabilty, apprehension, lameness, ataxia, paresis and recumbency) with low-grade viremia and 90% of the horses will recover from infection. However, lineage 2 WNV only causes subclinical disease in horses [
