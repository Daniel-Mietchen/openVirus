<p>Up to 70% of adults in tropical regions of Asia have JEV antibodies. An estimated 50,000 cases occur every year where the most acutely infected patients are children or non-immune individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B136">136</xref>]. Clinical infections are severe with a case fatality rate of 30% or severe neurologic sequels in up to 50% of the patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B137">137</xref>]. JEV infections occur all year long in South Asian countries while they occur during summer in temperate regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B138">138</xref>]. The infection in animals is subclinical, however, it causes abortion in pregnant sows and death in newborn piglets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B139">139</xref>]. JEV causes inapparent infection in horses, but neurologic signs are observed occasionally with a high fatality rate. Seroepidemiological studies show that JEV can incidentally infect a variety of other vertebrates, including dogs, ducks, chickens, cattle, bats, snakes, and frogs [
