<p>JEV is maintained in a zoonotic cycle and transmitted by mosquitoes, primarily 
 <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B139">139</xref>]. This mosquito vector mainly hatches in rice fields in India and other Asian countries, with multiplication increasing up to 50% in fertilized fields. JEV also can be transmitted by 
 <italic>C. annulus</italic>, 
 <italic>C. annulirostris</italic>, and 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B139">139</xref>]. Pigs and aquatic birds are the efficient amplification and reservoir hosts of JEV that develop high-titered viremia providing a source of infection for mosquitoes (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B139">139</xref>]. In enzootic regions, pigs, frogs, and waterbirds (e.g., egrets and herons) increase the risk of transmission to humans and equines, especially in agricultural settings such as rice cultivation areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B139">139</xref>]. The combination of increased rice crops and pig farming gives JEV an epidemiological advantage. Humans and horses are dead-end hosts since the level of viremia is insufficient for mosquito transmission and they succumb to encephalitis after infection.
