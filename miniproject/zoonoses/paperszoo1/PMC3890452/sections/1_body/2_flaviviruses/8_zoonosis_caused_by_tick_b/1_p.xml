<p>Tick-borne flaviviruses form a major group within viruses transmitted by ticks. Mosquito-borne and tick-borne flaviviruses, although distinct, appear to have evolved via a common ancestral line that diverged from viruses with no known arthropod vector [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B163">163</xref>]. Tick-borne flaviviruses are medically important arboviruses causing 10,000 to 15,000 human cases every year in Europe and Asia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B164">164</xref>]. These viruses circulate mostly in forests, moorlands, or in steppe regions and are transmitted between ticks feeding on rodents and other mammals. Tick-borne flaviviruses can cause a wide range of disease, from mild febrile illness (with biphasic fever) to encephalitis or hemorrhagic fever, in humans and animals [
