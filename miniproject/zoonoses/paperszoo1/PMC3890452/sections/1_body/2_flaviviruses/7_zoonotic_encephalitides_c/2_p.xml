<p>SLEV also belongs to the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> and cross-reacts serologically with other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, especially with JEV and WNV, which makes serological diagnosis of these viral infections difficult. SLEV occurs in North, Central and South America and it is one of the most important arbovirus infections in North America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B125">125</xref>]. SLEV is maintained in a mosquito-bird-mosquito cycle and wild birds (sparrow, pigeon, blue jay, and robin) are the primary vertebrate hosts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B156">156</xref>]. Birds sustain inapparent infections but develop sufficient viremia to infect mosquito vectors. The principal vectors are 
 <italic>C. pipiens</italic> and 
 <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic> in the east, 
 <italic>C. nigripalpus</italic> in Florida, and 
 <italic>C. tarsalis</italic> and members of the 
 <italic>C. pipiens</italic> complex in western states in the US [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B125">125</xref>]. Humans and domestic mammals acquire SLEV infection, but are dead-end hosts. Most SLEV infections are silent but clinical severity can vary from mild nonspecific febrile illnesses to meningitis or encephalitis. The severity of the disease and fatality rate increases with age. There is no vaccine available but SLEV infection is thought to confer life-long immunity against subsequent infection.
