<p>California encephalitis serogroup in the genus 
 <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic> include at least fourteen different viruses (e.g., La Crosse [LAC], Jamestown Canyon virus, snowshoe hare virus and Tahyna virus [TAHV]), each of which is transmitted by mosquitoes and has a narrow range of vertebrate hosts and a limited geographic distribution [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B157">157</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B159">159</xref>]. The LAC virus is the most important zoonotic pathogen in the California encephalitis serogroup, which is maintained by transovarial transmission in 
 <italic>A. triseriatus</italic>, a tree-hole-breeding woodland mosquito, and is amplified by a mosquito-vertebrate-mosquito cycle involving inapparent infection of woodland rodents (e.g., squirrels and chipmunks) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B160">160</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B161">161</xref>]. Humans are dead-end hosts, and there is no human-to-human transmission. The LAC and Jamestown Canyon virus occur in the US, snowshoe hare virus occurs in Canada. The LAC virus cause encephalitis in humans and disease is severe in children (childhood encephalitis). TAHV has been isolated in the former Soviet Union (USSR), where it caused influenza-like disease in humans [
