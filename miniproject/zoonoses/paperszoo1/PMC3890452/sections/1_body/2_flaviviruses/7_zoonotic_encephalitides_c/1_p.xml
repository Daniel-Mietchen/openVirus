<p>There are several other flaviviruses that can cause milder cases of human febrile illness with rash and occasional mild encephalitis. These include MVEV, the causative agent of Murray Valley encephalitis in Australia, and New Guinea and KUN virus, which is a close relative of WNV that circulates in Australia. The antibodies to MVEV cross neutralize JEV and this may explain, in part, the absence of JE in Australia. The KUN virus may cause neurological disease in horses, where as MVEV is not pathogenic to horses.</p>
