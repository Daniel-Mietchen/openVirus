<p>Flaviviruses (formerly group B arboviruses) include agents pathogenic for humans and animals that are transmitted by mosquitoes or ticks [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B124">124</xref>]. Flaviviruses are enveloped viruses containing a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 11 kb in length. The viral genome encodes three structural proteins (capsid [C], premembrane [prM], and envelope [E] proteins) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [

 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> is comprised of more than sixty-six virus species, many of which are arthropod-borne human pathogens (mainly mosquitoes and ticks) and are highly pathogenic for both humans and animals (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B127">127</xref>]. Flaviviruses are further classified into antigenic complexes and subcomplexes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B128">128</xref>] that are related serologically, genetically, and etiologically. The diseases caused by flaviviruses range from fevers and encephalitides to hemorrhagic fever. There are three complexes of flaviviruses that include important agents pathogenic for humans [
