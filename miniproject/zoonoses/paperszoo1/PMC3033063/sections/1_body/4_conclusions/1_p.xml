<p>Inhalation and transdermal or mucous membrane inoculation of infected louse feces are well-established routes of pathogen transmission during epidemics of human louse-borne typhus. The mechanism by which 
 <italic>R. prowazekii</italic> is transmitted from flying squirrels to humans is less well understood. Various routes have been hypothesized, but none have been empirically established. Plausible mechanisms include inhalation or direct introduction (through mucous membrane or dermal abrasion) of infected feces from louse or flea ectoparasites of flying squirrels or through the bite of infected flea ectoparasites of flying squirrels (

  <italic>9</italic>
 </xref>). At least one species of flea ectoparasite (
 <italic>Orchopeas howardii</italic>) of flying squirrels is known to opportunistically bite humans and could serve as a bridge vector for transmission from flying squirrel to human. Rickettsiae transmission among captive flying squirrels, however, has only been demonstrated with a louse vector (

 </xref>). While the exact mechanism of pathogen transmission has not yet been determined, the lack of detectable exposure to 
 <italic>R. prowazekii</italic> in the household members or co-workers of documented cases (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">
  <italic>3</italic>
 </xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">
  <italic>5</italic>
 </xref>) supports the idea that the risk for 
 <italic>R. prowazekii</italic> infection after casual or indirect exposure to flying squirrels is low. Rather, existing evidence suggests that infection follows from close physical contact with flying squirrels or from exposure to a concentrated source of infectious materials (e.g., nests, dander, or infected ectoparasites).
