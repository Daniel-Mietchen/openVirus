yet the processes by which they emerge are complex and poorly understood. Nipah virus (NiV) is an important threat owing to its broad host and geographical range, high case fatality, potential for human-to-human transmission and lack of effective prevention or therapies. Here, we investigate the origin of the first identified outbreak of NiV encephalitis in Malaysia and Singapore. We analyse data on livestock production from the index site (a commercial pig farm in Malaysia) prior to and during the outbreak, on Malaysian agricultural production, and from surveys of NiV's wildlife reservoir (flying foxes). Our analyses suggest that repeated introduction of NiV from wildlife changed infection dynamics in pigs. Initial viral introduction produced an explosive epizootic that drove itself to extinction but primed the population for enzootic persistence upon reintroduction of the virus. The resultant within-farm persistence permitted regional spread and increased the number of human infections. This study refutes an earlier hypothesis that anomalous El Ni&#x000f1;o Southern Oscillation-related climatic conditions drove emergence and suggests that priming for persistence drove the emergence of a novel zoonotic pathogen. Thus, we provide empirical evidence for a causative mechanism previously proposed as a precursor to widespread infection with H5N1 avian influenza and other emerging pathogens.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Nipah virus</kwd><kwd>epidemic enhancement</kwd><kwd>infectious disease dynamics</kwd><kwd>emerging pathogens</kwd><kwd>zoonosis</kwd><kwd>flying fox</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Preventing and controlling emerging zoonoses require identification of the processes that drive cross-species pathogen transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C1">1</xref>]. Agricultural intensification has been proposed as a major underlying cause of pathogen emergence from wildlife and domestic animal populations into human populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C3">3</xref>]; however, the precise mechanisms by which this occurs have rarely been demonstrated. Specific agricultural practices may increase frequency of cross-species pathogen transmission, setting the stage for persistence of new pathogens to occur. Pathogen introduction into a partially immune population&#x02014;such as a population where some individuals are vaccinated or were previously infected&#x02014;can result in longer and potentially larger epidemics than introduction into a naive population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C4">4</xref>]. We refer to this phenomenon as immunity-based, population-level &#x02018;priming&#x02019; for persistence. The potential of such priming to drive zoonotic emergence has been demonstrated theoretically in the general case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C4">4</xref>], as a possible precursor to measles emergence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C5">5</xref>] and as a mechanism that could facilitate widespread emergence of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C6">6</xref>]. Here, we present evidence that this process is not only theoretically possible but is likely to have played a key role in the first known outbreak of Nipah virus (NiV) encephalitis, and therefore for the emergence of a lethal zoonosis.</p><sec id="s1a"><label>1.1.</label><title>Background</title><p>NiV is a paramyxovirus that emerged in people in Malaysia in 1998 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C9">9</xref>]. Serology, virus isolation and polymerase chain reaction detection indicate that NiV is maintained in <italic>Pteropus</italic> spp. fruit bats (flying foxes), including <italic>P. vampyrus</italic> and <italic>P. hypomelanus</italic> in peninsular Malaysia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C12">12</xref>]. Transmission from flying foxes to pigs is thought to occur via saliva on fomites (discarded fruit pulp) or via faecal or urine contamination of pigsties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C11">11</xref>]. Pigs act as amplifier hosts, enabling infection of humans via droplet transmission during respiratory infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C13">13</xref>]. The risk of direct transmission from bats to humans in Malaysia is believed to be low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C14">14</xref>].</p><p>Between September 1998 and April 1999, NiV caused 246 reported cases of febrile encephalitis in humans in peninsular Malaysia and Singapore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C8">8</xref>] and an epidemic of respiratory and neurological disease in commercially farmed pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C15">15</xref>]. Initial human cases were seen in Tambun village and surrounding areas in Perak State, followed by a large epidemic in the southern states of Negeri Sembilan and Selangor and several cases in Singapore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20110223F1">figure 1</xref><italic>a</italic>). The majority of these cases occurred in pig farmers and abattoir workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C17">17</xref>]. During the course of the outbreak investigation, nine cases of NiV encephalitis were retrospectively diagnosed in the Tambun area with onset dates between January 1997 and May 1998, five of which were associated with the index farm of the 1998&#x02013;1999 outbreak in Perak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20110223F1">figure 1</xref><italic>a</italic>). Six of the nine cases are considered confirmed cases on the basis of serological tests performed in 1999 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C16">16</xref>]; the remaining three are probable cases.

Further information on case numbers can be found in the electronic supplementary material. (<italic>b</italic>) Detection of Nipah virus-induced pre-weaning mortality in the three breeding sections on the index farm. To investigate the timing of Nipah-induced mortality in the three breeding sections, we define a piglet mortality index (PMI) that compares the observed mortality for each litter with expected mortality (based on the number of piglets born and the time from farrow to wean). Here we present average PMI values through time, shown as quantiles of the values observed during the parametrization period; raw litter-level PMI values are shown in the electronic supplementary material. The presence of Nipah virus is suggested when pre-weaning mortality of piglets is significantly greater than expected, and we infer the presence of Nipah virus when significant excess mortality is observed in multiple litters during the same time period or coincident with human cases. The binned PMI values show that significant mortality peaks occurred in the Breeding Nucleus and Breeding section 2 during the time period of the first cluster of human cases in early 1997; individual litters in Breeding section 1 also showed elevated mortality during this time period (electronic supplementary material). Piglet mortality then returned to baseline levels until approximately July 1997, corresponding to the time of the next observed human cases, around which time the virus is likely to have been reintroduced from the flying fox reservoir. Model output analysed in the same manner as the piglet mortality data from the index farm is shown in the electronic supplementary material. (i) Breeding Nucleus; (ii) Breeding section 1; (iii) Breeding section 2. (<italic>c</italic>) Commercial production of mangoes and domestic pigs in Malaysia, 1961&#x02013;2005. The drop in both mango (dashed lines) and pig production (solid line) between 1998 and 1999 is because of the depopulation and closing of pig farms in areas infected with Nipah virus. Mangoes on these farms were not harvested and many of the orchards have since been abandoned or converted to other crops. Data are from the Food and Agricultural Organization's Agricultural Production database.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rsif20110223-g1"/></fig></p><p>Several mechanisms have been previously proposed for the appearance of NiV in pig and human populations in 1998. One frequently cited explanation is that flying foxes harbouring NiV were new to the region where transmission to pigs occurred, driven there by climatic anomalies. In late 1997, an El Ni&#x000f1;o Southern Oscillation-related drought and burning of forested land in Sumatra and Kalimantan (Indonesia) created an atmospheric haze across Sumatra and peninsular Malaysia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C18">18</xref>]. One of us (K.B.C., see group author list) hypothesized that this atmospheric haze caused atypical flying fox immigration from Sumatra across the Straits of Malacca into peninsular Malaysia and northward towards Perak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C18">18</xref>]. This hypothesized movement of flying foxes into an area with large pig farms potentially outside the species' normal range was proposed to have precipitated transmission of the virus from bats to pigs. However, a retrospective diagnosis of human NiV encephalitis cases on the index farm in early 1997 indicates that bat-to-pig transmission did not result from these specific environmental conditions. In particular, seven of these cases occurred prior to the rise in airborne particulate matter that is diagnostic of the haze event, which peaked in September 1997 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C18">18</xref>]. The recognition of cases prior to the haze event refutes the hypothesis that this event drove initial cross-species transmission (<xref ref-type="table" rid="RSIF20110223TB1">table 1</xref>). Furthermore, at the time of the major outbreak in pigs and humans, NiV antibodies were found to be widespread in flying fox colonies within peninsular Malaysia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C12">12</xref>], suggesting that the outbreak was not the result of a (recent) point source introduction of the virus into the bat population, as previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C18">18</xref>].

The intensification of production of pigs and mangoes was loosely correlated during this time period. The marked decline in both end-of-year standing pig population (SPP) and annual mango production between 1998 and 1999 indicates that this correlation may reflect widespread dual use of agricultural land to produce both pigs and mangoes, with the decline in commercial mango harvest reflecting the widespread abandonment and culling of infected pig farms that occurred in the first half of 1999 (following the discovery of NiV).</p></sec><sec id="s2a2"><label>2.1.2.</label><title>Patterns on the index farm</title><p>Pigs were first brought to the land that became the index farm in 1970.

Our model shows that multiple transmission events from bats to pigs are the best explanation for the observed pattern of human cases and pig mortality. As piglets aged in the index farm, they were moved from the breeding sections into the growing section, and finally into the finishing section for the last six weeks before they were sent to slaughter. When the virus was initially introduced into the pig population, individuals entering the growing section were immunologically naive. As the virus spread throughout the farm, the proportion of pigs entering this section with active immunity increased to the point where too few susceptibles remained for the chain of transmission to continue, and the virus could not be maintained within the farm population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20110223F2">figure 2</xref><italic>a,c</italic>). The first, rapid epizootic of NiV in the pig population on the index farm thus would have produced highly localized human infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20110223F1">figure 1</xref><italic>a</italic>) and the virus most probably went extinct in the pig population at this time (figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20110223F2">2</xref><italic>a,c</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20110223F3">3</xref>).

The top panels illustrate the infection/immunity profile of the growing section following (<italic>a</italic>) initial introduction of the virus and (<italic>b</italic>) subsequent introduction. The population profile is normalized by the capacity of the growing section (see the electronic supplementary material). The qualitative difference in infection dynamics results primarily from the prevalence of maternal antibodies in the young pig population.

The change in dynamics between initial and subsequent introductions of the virus on the index farm results from the presence of acquired immunity in the sow population and conferred immunity in the young pig population. The age structure within the growing section, along with its rapid turnover and large population size, allowed the virus to circulate enzootically. On reintroduction of the virus into the growing section, the population had a different immunological profile from the time of initial introduction. Many young pigs moving from the breeding sections into the growing section now carried maternally derived passive immunity rather than active immunity obtained from exposure to the virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20110223F2">figure 2</xref><italic>b</italic>). We estimate that maternal antibodies are lost at approximately 14 weeks of age (electronic supplementary material). Pigs born with maternal antibodies would therefore become susceptible to the virus roughly four weeks after entering the growing section, where they would remain for another six weeks. These dynamics produce a steady inflow of susceptible individuals, which is sufficient to maintain the virus over a period of 2 years or more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20110223F2">figure 2</xref><italic>b,d</italic>), a period similar to that observed between the index case for NiV in Malaysia in 1997 and the onset of the large-scale outbreak.

Phase I of emergence, the occurrence of human cases, required that only two criteria be met: circulation of the virus in a local bat population and the existence of a pathway for transmission from <italic>Pteropus</italic> bats to pigs. In phase I, early human cases were directly linked to the transmission of virus from bats to pigs, with all identified cases occurring in the immediate vicinity of the index farm where bat-to-pig transmission ignited rapid pig-to-pig transmission and produced a tight cluster of human cases on the index farm and an adjacent property.

Alternative pathways that would have been sufficient to produce both phases of emergence&#x02014;had they occurred&#x02014;are indicated by dashed arrows. Specifically, introduction of Nipah virus into an area with extremely dense pig-farming activity (such as Port Dickson in Negeri Sembilan or Sabang Perai Utara in Pulau Penang) probably could have resulted in viral persistence without priming and reintroduction. However, these areas lacked factors further up the causal pathway: the absence of <italic>Pteropus</italic> bats in these areas prevented viral introduction prior to the establishment of an alternative source of infection (e.g. persistent viral circulation on the index farm in Kinta, Perak). Similarly, if Nipah virus in Malaysia had resulted in human-to-human transmission, an alternative causal pathway could have produced incident human cases outside the area of transmission from flying foxes, as was seen in the Faridpur outbreak in Bangladesh in 2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C34">34</xref>], but there is no evidence that such human-to-human transmission occurred in Malaysia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C35">35</xref>]. The causal pathway that was realized in Malaysia most probably involved (i) the creation of a pathway for transmission from bats to pigs via agricultural intensification (i.e. dual-use agriculture, or the practice of planting fruit trees on land used for livestock production, and increased fruit production through time) and (ii) repeated introduction of the virus into a high-turnover commercial pig population in Perak that led to viral persistence and set the stage for phase II of the emergence process.

In principle, several scenarios could have produced such a pathway, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20110223F5">figure 5</xref>; however, the evidence amassed here indicates that the causal pathway realized in the Malaysian outbreak involved priming for persistence and reintroduction on the index farm, which created a source of infection independent from the virus's circulation in flying foxes.</p><sec id="s3a1"><label>3.1.1.</label><title>Phase I emergence</title><p>The maturation of mango trees adjacent to pigsties on the index farm in 1987 created an opportunity for phase I emergence to occur, with transmission of the virus from flying foxes to pigs most likely to occur during fruiting or flowering. The electronic supplementary material includes a timeline of phase I emergence, which highlights the key events leading up to the introduction of NiV into the index farm. We propose that NiV did not emerge for some years after the maturation of the mango trees owing to chance events within the system, e.g. fruit bat population dynamics, migratory behaviour or the dynamics of NiV in bat populations. This is supported by our own work on Hendra virus which suggests that, when the virus is actively transmitted within a bat colony, there is a heightened chance of repeated spillover, but circulation of the virus in bats is unlikely at any given place and time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C36">36</xref>]. On the other hand, we cannot rule out the possibility that specific local conditions in late 1996 and early to mid-1997 caused increased viral shedding among bats in the area surrounding the index farm, thereby increasing the risk of cross-species transmission to pigs.</p><p>Given the high mobility of flying foxes and the seasonal fluctuation in colony sizes in peninsular Malaysia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C33">33</xref>], NiV is probably transmitted regularly between roost sites and throughout the region. Such dynamics explain the ubiquity of NiV antibodies, and our data suggest that flying foxes and possibly NiV were regularly present near the index farm in Perak prior to the 1998&#x02013;1999 outbreak. Thus, we propose that it is plausible that flying foxes repeatedly introduced the virus onto the index farm in 1997.</p></sec><sec id="s3a2"><label>3.1.2.</label><title>Phase II emergence</title><p>Our analyses have shown that the initial introduction on the index farm was most probably insufficient to induce persistent circulation of the virus. Furthermore, the lack of human cases on other farms between the time that this epizootic would have burned out and the reappearance of human cases associated with the index farm strongly suggests that the virus was not circulating on farms in the surrounding area in the interim. The short duration of this initial epizootic appears to have provided an insufficient window of time for transportation of pigs between farms to spread the infection. On the other hand, reintroduction of the virus into the &#x02018;primed&#x02019; pig population on the index farm provided a substantially longer window of opportunity for spread. Our model's results indicate that reintroduction of the virus at the time of the reappearance of human cases on the index farm would have permitted enzootic circulation of the virus until the farm was culled in 1999.</p><p>During this time, the infection spread to other farms in the Tambun area, probably via movement of infected pigs from the index farm, which supplied gilts and piglets to smaller operations in the vicinity. Subsequent pig movement (including &#x02018;fire sales&#x02019; of pigs in reaction to the cluster of human cases in September&#x02013;November 1998) allowed the virus to spread throughout Perak and eventually south to Negeri Sembilan and Selangor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C15">15</xref>]. Because there was no evidence of transmission between humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C35">35</xref>], the pattern of human infection necessarily followed the spread of the virus in pigs, explaining why human cases were much more widespread in 1998&#x02013;1999 than in 1997. In addition, the high density of pig farms in many parts of the south (electronic supplementary material) may have allowed respiratory transmission of the virus between adjacent farms without physical movement of infected pigs, contributing to the rapid spread of infection and high number of human cases in the south. On the other hand, these areas were buffered from phase I emergence via bat-to-pig transmission by the absence of flying foxes in the area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C33">33</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20110223F4">figure 4</xref>) and, possibly, a lesser degree of overlap between fruit and pig production (electronic supplementary material).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3b"><label>3.2.</label><title>Drivers of emergence</title><p>We have identified two synergistic component causes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C37">37</xref>] that precipitated each phase of emergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20110223F5">figure 5</xref>). The existence of a pathway for transmission from flying foxes to pigs was a necessary complement to viral circulation in the bat population to produce phase I of emergence, and viral persistence in the pig population on the index farm created an infection source outside the flying fox reservoir that, combined with transportation of pigs, was sufficient to produce phase II of emergence. Each of these component causes was brought about by a phenomenon that&#x02014;while not strictly necessary&#x02014;did ultimately permit emergence in this context. We refer to these factors as &#x02018;drivers&#x02019; of emergence, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="RSIF20110223TB1">table 1</xref> outlines the evidence for interpreting each of these drivers as a causal factor. Agricultural intensification (namely, dual use of agricultural land and increases in production) resulted in the direct overlap of mango production and livestock rearing and therefore produced a pathway for a virus circulating in flying foxes to infect an intensively managed commercial pig population, driving phase I of emergence. Because NiV had a very low probability of persisting on the index farm without reintroduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20110223F3">figure 3</xref>), priming for persistence was necessary to bring about enzootic circulation in this context and appears to have been sufficient to do so, driving phase II of emergence.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><label>3.3.</label><title>Broader implications</title><p>This study illustrates how a broad, interdisciplinary approach to the study of emerging zoonoses focused on data from specific emergence events can illuminate emergence processes. We have demonstrated the specific role of agricultural expansion, particularly dual use of agricultural land and intensified pig production practices, in NiV emergence. A role for long-term changes in species interactions has previously been hypothesized for numerous host-jumping viral species including various primate retroviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C39">39</xref>], SARS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C40">40</xref>] and avian influenza viruses, and our evidence suggests that cross-species transmission of NiV most probably resulted from the expanded interface between wild animal reservoirs and human or domestic animal populations, although it is possible that short-term ecological conditions were also a contributing factor.</p><p>Our findings have important implications for control of NiV in commercial pig farms, prevention of widespread epidemics in livestock and our general understanding of zoonotic disease emergence. First, although restrictions on planting fruit trees near pigsties appear to have prevented introduction of the virus into pig populations in Malaysia since 1999, there is a possibility of reintroduction both there and in other countries where flying foxes are found. Regular surveillance of pigs sent to markets and abattoirs in areas where pig farming overlaps flying fox distributions, along with hospital-based surveillance of encephalitis cases, may permit identification of initial NiV introductions and allow for early intervention and prevention of subsequent spread. Second, widespread prophylactic vaccination of pig populations is likely to be cost-prohibitive because of the rapid turnover of commercial pig populations. In addition, if vaccine coverage were not kept at a sufficient level, the dynamics of the virus when introduced into the population would resemble those following reintroduction on the index farm, inducing long-term persistence and increasing the risk of phase II emergence (electronic supplementary material).</p><p>Finally, an important feature of the NiV outbreak in Malaysia and Singapore was the two-phase process by which emergence occurred, which implies that there was a missed opportunity for earlier recognition of this novel aetiological agent and potential intervention. Zoonotic pathogens often go unnoticed during the initial stages of &#x02018;viral chatter&#x02019;&#x02014;that is, repeated introductions that cause only a small number of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C41">41</xref>]&#x02014;because they are not yet easily transmissible in humans (e.g. simian retroviruses), are initially asymptomatic (e.g. HIV), are clinically similar to other diseases (e.g. NiV in Malaysia, which was originally misdiagnosed as Japanese encephalitis despite its epidemiological distinctiveness) and/or occur in areas with poor surveillance and diagnostic testing (e.g. NiV in Bangladesh and India). Other pathogens are noticed relatively quickly because they cause dramatic disease (e.g. Ebola haemorrhagic fever); however, even in these situations, we cannot rule out the possibility of previous undocumented cases, and the discovery of historical cases after the identification of an emerging pathogen is common (NiV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C16">16</xref>], SARS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C42">42</xref>], HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C38">38</xref>] and H5N1 influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C43">43</xref>]).</p><p>These patterns support previous calls for increasing targeted global surveillance and pathogen discovery in atypical disease outbreaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C45">45</xref>]. As the Malaysian NiV outbreak highlights, surveillance of livestock and livestock workers in regions of high wildlife biodiversity would improve the chances that viral chatter of wildlife origin is detected prior to a widespread epidemic in livestock or people. This approach may be critical for identifying new outbreaks of NiV, which has recently demonstrated a potential to produce propagated outbreaks in Bangladesh, where short chains of human-to-human transmission have occurred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C34">34</xref>]. It may also provide a strategy for the identification of unknown henipaviruses, and other novel agents, prior to epidemic or pandemic emergence.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><label>4.</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4a"><label>4.1.</label><title>Agricultural production patterns</title><sec id="s4a1"><label>4.1.1.</label><title>Large-scale patterns</title><p>Malaysian mango production data (in metric tonnes per year) and domestic pig census data (in head of pig, censused at the end of the calendar year) for 1961&#x02013;2005 were obtained from the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations' free online Agricultural Production database (FAOSTAT Classic; <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://faostat.fao.org">http://faostat.fao.org</uri>; accessed 15 November 2006).

Dynamics were explored using a deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) model with a cut-off value of one infected individual (calculated as the sum of individuals in all exposed and infectious classes), below which the infection was considered to have gone extinct. A stochastic individual-based model (IBM) was then used to confirm that the qualitative dynamics observed in the ODE model were robust to the incorporation of empirically derived waiting time distributions and other factors that could not be represented in the ODE framework. The stochastic model was run for a wide range of parameter combinations to assess the probability of extinction following initial and subsequent introductions under different scenarios and to assess the range of transmission parameters consistent with observed seroprevalence levels in Breeding section 2.
