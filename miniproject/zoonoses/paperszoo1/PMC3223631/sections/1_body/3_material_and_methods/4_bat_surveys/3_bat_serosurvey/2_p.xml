<p>Flying foxes were non-randomly sampled using mist nets and anaesthetized. Three millilitres of blood was collected from the brachial vein and stored for 24 h at 4°C to allow for serum separation. The separated serum was then stored at −20°C until use. All bats were released at the site of capture after recovery from anaesthesia. Serum neutralization tests were conducted on all serum samples at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong, Australia, under Biosafety Level 4 conditions. Details on anaesthesia and testing protocols are given in the electronic supplementary material.</p>
