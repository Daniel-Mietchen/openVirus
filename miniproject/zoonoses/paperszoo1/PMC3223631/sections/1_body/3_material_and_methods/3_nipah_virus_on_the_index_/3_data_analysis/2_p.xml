<p>Statistical analyses of production records were developed to detect evidence of the virus in the breeding sections. A baseline model for pre-weaning piglet mortality was formulated for each breeding section on the basis of production records from 1 January 1995 through 31 October 1996, and candidate models were compared by Akaike information criterion. For all litters born after this period, a piglet mortality index (PMI) was calculated that indicates the extent to which the observed mortality deviates from the expected mortality for a litter of the same size during the baseline period. Litter-level data are shown in the electronic supplementary material.</p>
