<p>Population dynamic models of production dynamics on the index farm were developed and parametrized from descriptions of farm-management practices provided during interviews with farm workers and detailed production records from 1 January 1995 to 31 October 1996. Models of infection dynamics were then constructed by building on these baseline population models. Dynamics were explored using a deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) model with a cut-off value of one infected individual (calculated as the sum of individuals in all exposed and infectious classes), below which the infection was considered to have gone extinct. A stochastic individual-based model (IBM) was then used to confirm that the qualitative dynamics observed in the ODE model were robust to the incorporation of empirically derived waiting time distributions and other factors that could not be represented in the ODE framework. The stochastic model was run for a wide range of parameter combinations to assess the probability of extinction following initial and subsequent introductions under different scenarios and to assess the range of transmission parameters consistent with observed seroprevalence levels in Breeding section 2. Detailed descriptions of the ODE model and the IBM are given in the electronic supplementary material.</p>
