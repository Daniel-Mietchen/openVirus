<p>Finally, an important feature of the NiV outbreak in Malaysia and Singapore was the two-phase process by which emergence occurred, which implies that there was a missed opportunity for earlier recognition of this novel aetiological agent and potential intervention. Zoonotic pathogens often go unnoticed during the initial stages of ‘viral chatter’—that is, repeated introductions that cause only a small number of cases [

Other pathogens are noticed relatively quickly because they cause dramatic disease (e.g. Ebola haemorrhagic fever); however, even in these situations, we cannot rule out the possibility of previous undocumented cases, and the discovery of historical cases after the identification of an emerging pathogen is common (NiV [
