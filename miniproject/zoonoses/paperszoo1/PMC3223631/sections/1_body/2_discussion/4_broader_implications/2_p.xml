<p>This study illustrates how a broad, interdisciplinary approach to the study of emerging zoonoses focused on data from specific emergence events can illuminate emergence processes. We have demonstrated the specific role of agricultural expansion, particularly dual use of agricultural land and intensified pig production practices, in NiV emergence. A role for long-term changes in species interactions has previously been hypothesized for numerous host-jumping viral species including various primate retroviruses [
