<p>We have identified two synergistic component causes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C37">37</xref>] that precipitated each phase of emergence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20110223F5">figure 5</xref>). The existence of a pathway for transmission from flying foxes to pigs was a necessary complement to viral circulation in the bat population to produce phase I of emergence, and viral persistence in the pig population on the index farm created an infection source outside the flying fox reservoir that, combined with transportation of pigs, was sufficient to produce phase II of emergence. Each of these component causes was brought about by a phenomenon that—while not strictly necessary—did ultimately permit emergence in this context. We refer to these factors as ‘drivers’ of emergence, and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="RSIF20110223TB1">table 1</xref> outlines the evidence for interpreting each of these drivers as a causal factor. Agricultural intensification (namely, dual use of agricultural land and increases in production) resulted in the direct overlap of mango production and livestock rearing and therefore produced a pathway for a virus circulating in flying foxes to infect an intensively managed commercial pig population, driving phase I of emergence. Because NiV had a very low probability of persisting on the index farm without reintroduction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20110223F3">figure 3</xref>), priming for persistence was necessary to bring about enzootic circulation in this context and appears to have been sufficient to do so, driving phase II of emergence.
