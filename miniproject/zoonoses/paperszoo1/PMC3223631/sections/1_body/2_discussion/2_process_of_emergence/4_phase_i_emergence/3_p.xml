<p>Given the high mobility of flying foxes and the seasonal fluctuation in colony sizes in peninsular Malaysia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C33">33</xref>], NiV is probably transmitted regularly between roost sites and throughout the region. Such dynamics explain the ubiquity of NiV antibodies, and our data suggest that flying foxes and possibly NiV were regularly present near the index farm in Perak prior to the 1998â€“1999 outbreak. Thus, we propose that it is plausible that flying foxes repeatedly introduced the virus onto the index farm in 1997.
