<p>The maturation of mango trees adjacent to pigsties on the index farm in 1987 created an opportunity for phase I emergence to occur, with transmission of the virus from flying foxes to pigs most likely to occur during fruiting or flowering. The electronic supplementary material includes a timeline of phase I emergence, which highlights the key events leading up to the introduction of NiV into the index farm. We propose that NiV did not emerge for some years after the maturation of the mango trees owing to chance events within the system, e.g. fruit bat population dynamics, migratory behaviour or the dynamics of NiV in bat populations. This is supported by our own work on Hendra virus which suggests that, when the virus is actively transmitted within a bat colony, there is a heightened chance of repeated spillover, but circulation of the virus in bats is unlikely at any given place and time [

On the other hand, we cannot rule out the possibility that specific local conditions in late 1996 and early to mid-1997 caused increased viral shedding among bats in the area surrounding the index farm, thereby increasing the risk of cross-species transmission to pigs.
