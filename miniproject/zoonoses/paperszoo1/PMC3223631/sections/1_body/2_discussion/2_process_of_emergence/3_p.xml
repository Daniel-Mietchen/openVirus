<p>Phase II of emergence, incident human cases outside the area of transmission from flying foxes, required that the criteria for phase I be met but also mandated the existence of a pathway for transmission to humans that had become unlinked from the wildlife reservoir. In principle, several scenarios could have produced such a pathway, as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20110223F5">figure 5</xref>; however, the evidence amassed here indicates that the causal pathway realized in the Malaysian outbreak involved priming for persistence and reintroduction on the index farm, which created a source of infection independent from the virus's circulation in flying foxes.
