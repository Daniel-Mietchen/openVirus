<p>NiV emergence in Malaysia occurred in two phases, and our current understanding of the processes leading to its emergence is outlined in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20110223F5">figure 5</xref>. Phase I of emergence, the occurrence of human cases, required that only two criteria be met: circulation of the virus in a local bat population and the existence of a pathway for transmission from 
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> bats to pigs. In phase I, early human cases were directly linked to the transmission of virus from bats to pigs, with all identified cases occurring in the immediate vicinity of the index farm where bat-to-pig transmission ignited rapid pig-to-pig transmission and produced a tight cluster of human cases on the index farm and an adjacent property.
