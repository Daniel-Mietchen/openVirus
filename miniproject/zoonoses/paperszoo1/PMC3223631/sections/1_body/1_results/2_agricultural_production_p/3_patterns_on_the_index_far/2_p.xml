<p>Pigs were first brought to the land that became the index farm in 1970. By 1980, the SPP on the property had reached 30 000 (approx. the same size as at the time the farm was culled in 1999). Mangoes, jackfruit (
 <italic>Artocarpus heteropyllus</italic>) and durian (
 <italic>Durio</italic> sp.) were grown on the index farm, while other farms in the Tambun area grew primarily pomelos (
 <italic>Citrus maxima</italic>), which are not eaten by flying foxes. As Chua

Approximately 400 mango trees were planted on the farm in 1983, and the trees began producing fruit in 1987. The location of these trees, in relation to the areas where pigs were kept, is shown in the electronic supplementary material, which also includes additional details of the timeline of pig and fruit production on the index farm.
