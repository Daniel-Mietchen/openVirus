<p>Serological analysis demonstrates that evidence of NiV infection is ubiquitous throughout the distribution of flying fox populations in peninsular Malaysia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20110223F4">figure 4</xref>). Overall antibody prevalence in 
 <italic>P. vampyrus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. hypomelanus</italic> is 38.7 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 163) and 17.5 per cent (
 <italic>n</italic> = 80), respectively, consistent with previous reports of NiV antibodies or infection in flying fox populations from northern India and throughout southeast Asia [
