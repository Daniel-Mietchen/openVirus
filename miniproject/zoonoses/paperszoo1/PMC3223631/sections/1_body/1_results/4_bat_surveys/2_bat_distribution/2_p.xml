<p>We conducted a countrywide survey of the distribution and infection status of the two 
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> species in peninsular Malaysia. We located 14 active 
 <italic>P. vampyrus</italic> roost sites across peninsular Malaysia, four 
 <italic>P. hypomenlanus</italic> roosts on islands surrounding the peninsula and one mixed roost near Langkawi Island off the northwest coast. We estimated the current distribution of 
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> spp. bats in peninsular Malaysia using combined results of wildlife surveys and analysis of hunter licensing data (
