<p>We analysed pig production data from the index farm and developed an age-structured model of NiV dynamics within the farm population. Our model shows that multiple transmission events from bats to pigs are the best explanation for the observed pattern of human cases and pig mortality. As piglets aged in the index farm, they were moved from the breeding sections into the growing section, and finally into the finishing section for the last six weeks before they were sent to slaughter. When the virus was initially introduced into the pig population, individuals entering the growing section were immunologically naive. As the virus spread throughout the farm, the proportion of pigs entering this section with active immunity increased to the point where too few susceptibles remained for the chain of transmission to continue, and the virus could not be maintained within the farm population (
