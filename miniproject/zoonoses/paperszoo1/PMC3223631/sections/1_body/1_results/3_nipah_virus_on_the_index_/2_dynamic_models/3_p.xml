<p>Our models suggest that, when NiV was reintroduced to the farm, it circulated enzootically until the farm was depopulated in March 1999 (figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20110223F2">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20110223F3">3</xref>). This finding is consistent with the timing of human cases associated with the index farm and with the high antibody prevalence detected in sows and piglets in Breeding section 2 upon depopulation of the index farm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C31">31</xref>]. The change in dynamics between initial and subsequent introductions of the virus on the index farm results from the presence of acquired immunity in the sow population and conferred immunity in the young pig population. The age structure within the growing section, along with its rapid turnover and large population size, allowed the virus to circulate enzootically. On reintroduction of the virus into the growing section, the population had a different immunological profile from the time of initial introduction. Many young pigs moving from the breeding sections into the growing section now carried maternally derived passive immunity rather than active immunity obtained from exposure to the virus (

Pigs born with maternal antibodies would therefore become susceptible to the virus roughly four weeks after entering the growing section, where they would remain for another six weeks. These dynamics produce a steady inflow of susceptible individuals, which is sufficient to maintain the virus over a period of 2 years or more (

 <italic>b,d</italic>), a period similar to that observed between the index case for NiV in Malaysia in 1997 and the onset of the large-scale outbreak. The population size and turnover rate of the finishing section suggest that it may also have permitted enzootic circulation of the virus (electronic supplementary material).
