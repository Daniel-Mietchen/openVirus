<p>Although no direct prevalence data exist for NiV in the pig population on the index farm, the presence of the virus in the breeding sections can be inferred from production records kept by the farm's managers (electronic supplementary material) and from reported serological findings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C31">31</xref>]. These data are consistent with the scenario predicted by the model and with the timing of human cases: there was a period of approximately five to six months between the first introduction of the virus into the pig population and subsequent, smaller peaks in piglet mortality (

The virus appears to have spread into each of the three breeding sections between December 1996 and February 1997, with strong evidence of infection (unusually high piglet mortality) in at least two of the breeding sections (Breeding Nucleus and Breeding section 2) during January 1997, and significant mortality on a number of subsequent occasions, following an interim period in which piglet mortality returned to baseline levels (
