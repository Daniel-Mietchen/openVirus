<p>NiV is a paramyxovirus that emerged in people in Malaysia in 1998 [

 <italic>Pteropus</italic> spp. fruit bats (flying foxes), including 
 <italic>P. vampyrus</italic> and

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C12">12</xref>]. Transmission from flying foxes to pigs is thought to occur via saliva on fomites (discarded fruit pulp) or via faecal or urine contamination of pigsties [
