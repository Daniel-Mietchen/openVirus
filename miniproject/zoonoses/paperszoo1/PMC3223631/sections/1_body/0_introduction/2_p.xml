<p>Preventing and controlling emerging zoonoses require identification of the processes that drive cross-species pathogen transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C1">1</xref>]. Agricultural intensification has been proposed as a major underlying cause of pathogen emergence from wildlife and domestic animal populations into human populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C2">2</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C3">3</xref>]; however, the precise mechanisms by which this occurs have rarely been demonstrated. Specific agricultural practices may increase frequency of cross-species pathogen transmission, setting the stage for persistence of new pathogens to occur. Pathogen introduction into a partially immune population—such as a population where some individuals are vaccinated or were previously infected—can result in longer and potentially larger epidemics than introduction into a naive population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C4">4</xref>]. We refer to this phenomenon as immunity-based, population-level ‘priming’ for persistence. The potential of such priming to drive zoonotic emergence has been demonstrated theoretically in the general case [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C4">4</xref>], as a possible precursor to measles emergence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C5">5</xref>] and as a mechanism that could facilitate widespread emergence of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C6">6</xref>]. Here, we present evidence that this process is not only theoretically possible but is likely to have played a key role in the first known outbreak of Nipah virus (NiV) encephalitis, and therefore for the emergence of a lethal zoonosis.
