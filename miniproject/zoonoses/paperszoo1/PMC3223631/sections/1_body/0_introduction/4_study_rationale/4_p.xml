<p>Second, our preliminary models suggested that repeated introduction could plausibly lead to persistence of the virus in a generic large pig population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C30">30</xref>]. In this study, we use detailed information on management practices and production patterns at the index farm to parametrize models of this population. We use these models to examine whether repeated introduction was necessary and sufficient to allow the virus to persist on the farm. We then compare model predictions of piglet mortality patterns with data from production records to assess whether repeated introduction led to persistence of the virus in this population.
