 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C12">12</xref>] identified 
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> spp. as likely reservoirs of NiV infection. Here we examine the distribution of 
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> bats in peninsular Malaysia, present data on NiV serology from all known roosts and examine the opportunities for transmission of the virus from bats to pigs by placing these findings in the context of large-scale agricultural production patterns.
