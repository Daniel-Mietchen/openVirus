 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C18">18</xref>] identified the presence of fruit trees on the index farm as a plausible link between flying foxes and pigs that could have precipitated introduction of the virus. We place this finding in a broader context by examining spatial and temporal patterns of agricultural production in peninsular Malaysia prior to and at the time of the outbreak. We also investigate, in detail, the history and status of fruit crop production on the index farm.
