Despite the continued threat that NiV and related viruses represent to global health, no detailed studies have combined data on pig populations, bat colonies and human cases to examine the mechanisms that drove the first known and largest outbreak. This paper describes an interdisciplinary approach that synthesizes all available data to improve and update our understanding of the process of NiV emergence in Malaysia. The study has three main branches, all of which build on earlier work.
