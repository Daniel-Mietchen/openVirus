 <caption>
  <p>Proposed drivers of emergence. Hill outlined nine criteria to be used to assess causality for epidemiological outcomes with complex origins [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C19">19</xref>]. A useful discussion of the implementation of these criteria in disease ecology is provided by Plowright 
   <italic>et al</italic>. [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C20">20</xref>]. This table is intended to assess the causal role of three factors that have been proposed as drivers of Nipah virus emergence in Malaysia. Because we are assessing causality in the context of a specific event, three of the nine original criteria are considered inapplicable (strength of association, consistency and biological gradient). n.a., not applicable.
