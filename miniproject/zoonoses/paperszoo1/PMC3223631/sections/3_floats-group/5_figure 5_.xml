  <p>Complex causality of Nipah virus emergence in Malaysia. Each rectangle represents a component cause of emergence. Grey rectangles represent ‘realized’ component causes that were present in Malaysia, whereas white rectangles represent ‘potential’ component causes that did not occur. Boxes surrounding multiple component causes indicate complete or near-complete synergy between these causes. Arrows indicate that some component causes can bring about other component causes (creating a causal pathway), or can lead directly to an outcome of interest (phase I or phase II emergence, highlighted in red). We refer to component causes that brought about another component cause that had been a missing link in the causal pathway as ‘drivers’ (highlighted in dark blue). Alternative pathways that would have been sufficient to produce both phases of emergence—had they occurred—are indicated by dashed arrows. Specifically, introduction of Nipah virus into an area with extremely dense pig-farming activity (such as Port Dickson in Negeri Sembilan or Sabang Perai Utara in Pulau Penang) probably could have resulted in viral persistence without priming and reintroduction. However, these areas lacked factors further up the causal pathway: the absence of 
   <italic>Pteropus</italic> bats in these areas prevented viral introduction prior to the establishment of an alternative source of infection (e.g. persistent viral circulation on the index farm in Kinta, Perak). Similarly, if Nipah virus in Malaysia had resulted in human-to-human transmission, an alternative causal pathway could have produced incident human cases outside the area of transmission from flying foxes, as was seen in the Faridpur outbreak in Bangladesh in 2004 [

   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSIF20110223C35">35</xref>]. The causal pathway that was realized in Malaysia most probably involved (i) the creation of a pathway for transmission from bats to pigs via agricultural intensification (i.e. dual-use agriculture, or the practice of planting fruit trees on land used for livestock production, and increased fruit production through time) and (ii) repeated introduction of the virus into a high-turnover commercial pig population in Perak that led to viral persistence and set the stage for phase II of the emergence process.
