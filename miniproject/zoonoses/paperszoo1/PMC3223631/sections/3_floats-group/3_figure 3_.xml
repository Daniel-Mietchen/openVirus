  <p>Results from an individual-based model of Nipah virus dynamics on the index farm: proportion of epidemics leading to enzootic circulation of Nipah virus on the index farm, with and without reintroduction of the virus. Simulations show that most epidemics produced by initial introduction of the virus drive themselves to extinction by depleting the susceptible population (blue line); however, a single reintroduction of the virus is most often sufficient to produce a subsequent epizootic that leads to persistent circulation. Here, we define persistence as circulation of the virus from the time of introduction (or reintroduction) until the farm was depopulated. Analogous results for a wide range of values for the unknown transmission parameters are shown in the electronic supplementary material.</p>
