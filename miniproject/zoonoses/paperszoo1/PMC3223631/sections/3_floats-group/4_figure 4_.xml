 <caption>
  <p>Nipah virus serology and flying fox distribution in peninsular Malaysia. The flying fox density in each state is expected to correlate with two indices that describe the hunting level within the state relative to a null expectation, as described in the electronic supplementary material. Hunting indices &gt; 1 indicate a higher than expected hunting level and are expected to correlate with relatively high flying fox densities. Known flying fox roost locations tend to be located in states with relatively high hunting indices. Nipah virus serology results are given for all sampling sites throughout peninsular Malaysia; seroreactive bats (white) were found at all sampling sites. PP, Pulau Penang; KL, Kuala Lumpur.</p>
