<p id="Par57">So far, we have discussed changing the codon bias (
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>) or codon pair bias (
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) in the P1 region while retaining its amino acid sequence. In a separate approach, the Wimmer group (S.M., E.W. and colleagues)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup> has shuffled synonymous codons of the P1 region according to a specifically designed computer algorithm to maximize the number of nucleotide changes while retaining the existing codons (for example, without changing the codon bias). The resulting P1 sequence was synthesized and cloned into the backbone of poliovirus, yielding PV-SD
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup> (
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). The P1 coding region of PV-SD contained 934 changes out of 2,643 nucleotides; that is, on average, every third nucleotide was different from that of the wild-type sequence. Notably, PV-SD replicated in HeLa cells with wild-type kinetics
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>. Apparently, the positioning of the synonymous codons in PV-SD, after the extensive codon shuffle, did not influence viral protein synthesis, confirming that synonymous mutations have an effect on the virus only when they are specifically directed to lower the codon bias

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup> or codon pair bias
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. An intriguing conclusion from PV-SD is that, at the genome level, RNA viruses are promiscuous with respect to nucleotide changes, as long as these changes do not affect protein function or the rate of protein synthesis. In other words, RNA structures throughout much of the viral coding regions, with notable exceptions, such as
