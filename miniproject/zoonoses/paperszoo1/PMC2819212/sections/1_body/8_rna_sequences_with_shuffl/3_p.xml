<p id="Par59">We have used shuffled sequences to test for unknown 
 <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA elements in the poliovirus genome. The fact that PV-SD replicates with wild-type kinetics provided proof that the P1 region is void of essential 
 <italic>cis</italic>-acting replication elements, which would probably have been destroyed by the large-scale shuffling. Note that other human picornaviruses, such as rhinovirus type 14 (HRV14), do contain such an essential element (
 <italic>cre</italic> in HRV14—a stem-loop structure of ∼50 nt) in P1. Hence, HRV14-SD would have probably been nonviable

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>
 </sup>. The poliovirus equivalent to the HRV14 
 <italic>cre</italic> maps to the P2 coding region
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>
 </sup>. We expected that scrambling the P2 coding sequence of the poliovirus genome would destroy the 
 <italic>cre</italic> element and kill the virus, which is indeed what we have found (Y. Song, C. Ward, D. Futcher, S. Skiena, E.W. and S.M., unpublished data). Re-establishing the 
 <italic>cre</italic> sequence in P2 by molecular engineering rescues the virus, which indicates that the P2 region does not contain any other important RNA sequences in addition to 
 <italic>cre</italic>. Synonymous scrambling of RNA virus sequences may be an excellent tool in searching for RNA structures that are essential for viral replication.
