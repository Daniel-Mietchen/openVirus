 </sup> has shown that, in mice, viral constructs bearing at least the 1918 hemagglutinin (HA) gene in a background of modern, nonâˆ’mouse-adapted human influenza A virus are all highly pathogenic. Furthermore, expression microarray analysis performed on whole-lung tissue of mice infected with the reconstructed 1918 virus or viral constructs containing at least the 1918 HA and neuraminidase (NA) genes showed marked upregulation of mouse genes involved in apoptosis, tissue injury and oxidative damage

 </sup>, is nevertheless distinctive. These findings were unexpected, because the viruses with the 1918 HA gene had not been adapted to mice. Control experiments in which mice were infected with modern human viruses produced limited viral replication and little disease.
