<p id="Par27">The effort to determine the complete genomic sequence of the 1918 influenza virus began in 1995, when one of us (J.K.T. and colleagues) initiated a project to recover viral RNA fragments of the 1918 virus from preserved tissues of victims of the pandemic using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR)

This technology also made possible experiments using infectious viruses that contain 1918 influenza genes. Once the sequence was determined, the 1918 influenza virus gene segments were synthesized using commercially obtained overlapping oligos and subcloned into plasmids for 'rescue' using reverse genetics
