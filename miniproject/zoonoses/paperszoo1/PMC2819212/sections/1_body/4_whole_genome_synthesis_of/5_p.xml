<p id="Par30">The viral genotypic basis of the 1918 pandemic virus's virulence and transmissibility has not yet been fully mapped; however, by making chimeric viruses containing at least one 1918 influenza virus gene segment, and by targeted mutagenesis or gene synthesis, future experiments should help us to determine how this pandemic virus killed and spread so efficiently. Such knowledge may help us to elucidate virulence factors for other influenza viruses such as the 2009 influenza pandemic and, thereby, help us to identify targets for future drug intervention.</p>
