<p id="Par2">Unprecedented progress in synthesis and sequence analysis of DNA lies at the heart of the recent transformation of molecular biology and the emergence of the field termed synthetic biology. Sequencing a DNA in the megabase (Mb) range is no longer a daunting undertaking and, applying the most advanced technology, can be accomplished within less than a week. DNA synthesis has not yet advanced to the efficiency of DNA sequencing, but synthesizing DNA of 8−30 kilobase pairs (kbp)—the genome size of most RNA viruses and many DNA viruses—can be accomplished easily and is largely a matter of available resources.</p>
