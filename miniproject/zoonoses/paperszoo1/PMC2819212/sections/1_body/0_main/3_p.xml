<p id="Par4">In this Review, we summarize briefly the recent advances in DNA synthesis and sequencing and their impact on virology. Specifically, we describe the 
 <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of viruses in the absence of a natural template with the aim of resurrecting viruses using archaevirology, identifying viruses that cause human diseases after zoonotic infections, reconstructing viral genomes to unravel complex biological systems ('refactoring' genomes) or recoding viral genetic information for the production of vaccine candidates.
