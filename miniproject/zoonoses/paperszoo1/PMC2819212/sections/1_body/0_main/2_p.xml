<p id="Par3">It is not surprising, therefore, that the 
 <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of viral genomes in the absence of a natural template has found its way into studies of viruses, although this branch of virology is still in its infancy. Chemical synthesis of viral genomes provides a new and powerful tool for studying the function and expression of viral genes, as well as their pathogenic potential. This method is particularly useful if the natural viral template is not available. It also allows the genetic modification of viral genomes on a scale that would be impossible to achieve by conventional molecular biology methods.
