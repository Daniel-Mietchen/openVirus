<p id="Par33">To reconstruct a replicating retrovirus that may resemble the ancestor of HERV-K sequences, Lee and Bieniasz designed a consensus genome (9,472 nt) and, using whole-genome synthesis, generated the proviral clone HERV-K
 <sub>CON</sub>, which “likely resembles the progenitor of HERV-K(HML-2) variants that entered the human genome within the last few million years”
