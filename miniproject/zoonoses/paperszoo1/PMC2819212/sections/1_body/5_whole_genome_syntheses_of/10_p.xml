<p id="Par40">As yet, there is no known tissue culture system that supports the replication of bat SARS virus, suggesting that it is not infectious in humans

 </sup>. However, this inability to culture the virus also prevents investigation of the mechanism of cross-species transmission from bats to civets to humans (or transmission directly from bats to humans). The nucleotide sequence of the bat SARS virus is known. To determine the possible steps by which the bat SARS-CoV may have adapted to human populations, Denison and colleagues
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>
 </sup> synthesized the 29.7-bp bat SARS virus cDNA. They subsequently succeeded in converting the bat SARS-CoV to an infectious clone by exchanging the region encoding its receptor-binding domain (RBD) with that of the human SARS-CoV. The result is the largest replicating genome to be synthesized so far
