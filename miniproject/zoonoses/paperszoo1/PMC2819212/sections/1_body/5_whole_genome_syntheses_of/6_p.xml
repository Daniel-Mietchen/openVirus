 </sup> provided the first convincing evidence of SIVcpz antibodies and nucleic acid in fecal samples from wild 
 <italic>P. T. troglodytes</italic> in a narrow area in south-eastern Cameroon. However, recovery of replication-competent virus from fecal samples had failed. These authors therefore analyzed virus-specific nucleic acids isolated from the fecal samples and obtained a consensus sequence that, when chemically synthesized, yielded infectious molecular clones of SIVcpz

 </sup>. Analyses of these isolates yielded the important result that “naturally occurring SIVcpz strains already have many of the biological properties required for persistent infections of humans.” The authors conclude that “medically important 'SIV isolates' that have thus far eluded investigation... are needed to identify viral determinants that contribute to cross-species transmission and host adaptation”
