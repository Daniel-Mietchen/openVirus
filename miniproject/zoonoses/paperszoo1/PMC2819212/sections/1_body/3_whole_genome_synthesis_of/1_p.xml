 </sup>. Apart from providing a 'proof of principle', the experiment signaled a new era in biologyâ€”that is, the chemical synthesis of organisms as an approach to investigating gene function and pathogenicity by allowing large-scale changes in a genome of interest. The extent of such alterations (for example, large changes in genome architecture and gene structure) cannot be achieved with the 'traditional' methods in molecular biology
