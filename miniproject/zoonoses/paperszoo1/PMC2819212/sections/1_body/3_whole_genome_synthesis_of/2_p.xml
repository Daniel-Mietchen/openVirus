<p id="Par23">The synthetic polio cDNA contained 27 intentional nucleotide changes that were placed across the genome to serve as genetic markers (watermarks). When grown in HeLa cells, an efficient tissue culture system for poliovirus proliferation, the synthetic virus (denoted sPV1(M)) showed no phenotypic changes compared with the wild-type PV1(M). However, when injected intracerebrally into 
 <italic>CD155</italic> tg mice, which are transgenic for the poliovirus receptor, CD155, the median lethal dose (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) was five orders of magnitude higher than that of the wild-type virus (LD
 <sub>50</sub> values of 10
 <sup>2</sup> and 10
 <sup>7</sup> for the wild-type virus and sPV, respectively; E.W. and colleagues)

 </sup>. Unexpectedly, the genetic locus for the enormous attenuation of sPV(M) was a single A residue at position 102 of the genome, located in the 5′ nontranslated region (5′ NTR) of the genome at a site long thought to serve as simply a spacer between two highly structured regions
