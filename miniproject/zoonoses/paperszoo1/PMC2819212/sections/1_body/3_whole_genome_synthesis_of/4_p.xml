<p id="Par25">Finally, it should be noted that the synthesis of poliovirus also confirmed the accuracy of the genome sequence. This may be considered utterly superfluous, as the sequencing of PV1(M), the first of any lytic animal RNA virus, was originally carried out by two different methods

 </sup> and confirmed subsequently in numerous genetic analyses. But chemical synthesis is clearly useful in providing confirmation of sequence and will prove useful going forward in the proofreading of larger genomic sequences
