<p id="Par24">The synthesis of poliovirus did not require living cells. Subsequent to its chemical synthesis, the cDNA was transcribed

 </sup>. For the chemist, therefore, poliovirus is nothing more than a chemical. When the virus enters a cell, however, it has a program for survival. It will subvert cellular compartments and turn them into viral factories, in which it will proliferate subject to the evolutionary laws—heredity, genetic variation, selection toward fitness, evolution into different species and so on. That is, poliovirus obeys the same rules that apply to living entities
