  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>
 </sup>) with an aim to test the functions of a set of T7 genes once they are untangled from each other (by removing overlapping gene segments). To this end, they replaced the left 11,515 bp of the wild-type genome with 12,179 bp of synthetic redesigned DNA (available in cassettes α and β) and tested the biological properties of the synthetic DNA when combined with the remainder of the wild-type (WT) genome. Notably, three chimera, α-WT, WT-β-WT and α-β-WT, were viable, but, perhaps not surprisingly to the investigators, none grew as well as wild-type T7 phage (although no burst size was included in the report)
