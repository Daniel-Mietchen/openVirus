<p id="Par61">Phage α-β-WT, called T7.1, represents a redesign of &gt;30% of the T7 genome and, by removing overlaps, the genes in the α-β region could be studied independently, an enormous advantage for genetic analyses. T. F. Knight described the work as “the most compelling example of work in synthetic biology to date”

 </sup>. From a scientific perspective, Endy's work demonstrated that overlapping genetic elements in the T7 genome were, in aggregate, non-essential for phage replication. Until these experiments, the community had been stressing the importance of these features, given that they are conserved across evolutionary distance, but the synthetic approach provided a way of clarifying this issue. From an engineering perspective, this work provided confidence that up to 5% of the DNA sequence of an organism can be changed while still maintaining its viability.
