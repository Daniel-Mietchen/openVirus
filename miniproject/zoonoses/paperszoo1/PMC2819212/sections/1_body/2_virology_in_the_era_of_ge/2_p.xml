<p id="Par17">How do RNA viruses fit into the world of DNA synthesis and DNA sequencing? The answer is 'reverse genetics'. In their landmark paper of 1978, Weissmann and colleagues

 </sup> converted the RNA genome (4,127 nt) of the RNA phage Qβ into double-stranded DNA with the aid of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme (of retroviruses) that transcribes RNA into DNA. The virus-specific double-stranded DNA (cDNA), which was embedded into a plasmid, yielded authentic Qβ phage following transfection into bacteria. At the time, the authors concluded that the viral cDNA “would allow genetic manipulations that cannot be carried out at the RNA level”
