<p id="Par19">Synthesis of viral cDNA with reverse transcriptase requires, of course, naturally occurring virion RNA as template. An alternative is the chemical synthesis of cDNA, which, of course, requires knowledge of the viral genome sequence. The first replicating structure that was synthesized from sequence information was a replicon of the hepatitis C virus that lacked the genes for the structural proteins

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. Currently, 2,361 complete viral genome sequences have been deposited in the Viral Genome Resource (

Thus, there are huge resources of information available in the virus field, waiting to enter studies that we may broadly term synthetic virology.
