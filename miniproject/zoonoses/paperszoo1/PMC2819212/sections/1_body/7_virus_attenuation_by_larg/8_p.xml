 </sup>; in one of the subclones (PV-AB
 <sup>2470–2954</sup>), this ratio was reduced to about 1 PFU per 100,000
 <sup>5</sup> particles. That is, only one plaque can be expected to emerge if 10
 <sup>5</sup> particles are plated onto a dish of 10
 <sup>6</sup>–10
 <sup>7</sup> HeLa cells. Once this one virus has succeeded in overcoming the host cell, however, its burst size will be only one order of magnitude lower than that of the wild-type poliovirus. That is, although the dehumanized virus can replicate in HeLa cells, once released it has enormous problems in spreading to other cells. It should be noted that we have analyzed the sequences of the codon-deoptimized viruses for the emergence of higher-order structures that could have impeded replication. No such structures have been found. The properties of the virus with a 'scrambled' P1 region (PV-SD;
