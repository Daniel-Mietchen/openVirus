<p id="Par49">Because of the existence of a polyprotein in picornaviruses, codon deoptimizing the P1 region (the N-terminal third of the polyprotein) compromises viral replication: fewer ribosomes arrive at the coding region for the essential replication proteins (genomic regions P2 and P3; 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), and genome replication is thus reduced or shut off altogether. It was not surprising, therefore, that extensive codon deoptimization in virus PV-AB (
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>), harboring 680 changes (out of 2,643 nt) without altering a single encoded amino acid, led to a 'dead' phenotype. However, subcloning individual segments of the recoded P1 segment revived the virus, albeit in attenuated form. Indeed, the subclones are not only inhibited in protein synthesis
