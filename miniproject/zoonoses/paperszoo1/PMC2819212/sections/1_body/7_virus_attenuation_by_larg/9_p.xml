 <bold>Codon pair bias</bold>. It has been known since 1989 that in addition to, and independently of, codon usage, pairs of synonymous codons do not exist in the genome at the frequency that one might expect on the basis of the frequency of the two individual codons that make up the pair. This phenomenon, called 'codon pair bias', was discovered in prokaryotic cells

 </sup> but has since been seen in all other examined species, including humans

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>
 </sup>. For example, given the known codon frequencies in humans, the amino acid pair Ala-Glu is expected to be encoded by GCC GAA and GCA GAG about equally often. In fact, the codon pair GCC GAA is strongly underrepresented, despite containing the most frequent alanine codon, such that it is used only one-seventh as often as GCA GAG
