 </sup>) without loss of efficient RNA replication. However, changing synonymous codons in the P1 region from frequently used to rarely used codons (that is, 'codon deoptimizing' this segment of viral mRNA) will unbalance the synthesis of the polyprotein without changing its amino acid sequence, resulting in attenuated viruses
