<p id="Par45">It should be noted that poliovirus, like all RNA viruses, is a quasi-species that, in reality, exists in nature as a large swarm of different genotypes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>
 </sup>. This is the consequence of the high error rate of viral RNA synthesis in the absence of proof reading and editing functions. The 'wild-type' sequence in this vast swarm is the genotype that can proliferate most efficiently under the prevailing conditions, where it out-competes all of its related genotypes
