<p id="Par52">On the basis of 14,795 annotated (known) human genes, the Wimmer group has calculated a codon pair score, specific for each of the possible 3,721 codon pair combinations, as well the codon pair bias (CPB) for each gene, taking into consideration the codon frequency for each of the paired codons and the frequency of the encoded amino acid pair. In 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, the calculated CPB of a human gene is plotted against its amino acid length. Underrepresented codon pairs yield negative scores. Wild-type PV1(M) shows a slightly negative score (CPB = −0.02), but, not surprisingly, it uses codon-pairing corresponding to human genes (
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Using a custom-made computer optimization algorithm, we have constructed polioviruses whose P1 coding region had either a substantially negative codon pair bias, containing many underrepresented codon pairs (PV-Min, CPB = −0.474), or a substantially positive codon pair bias, containing many overrepresented codon pairs (PV-Max, CPB = +0.246;
