 </sup> published a massively parallel microchip-based DNA synthesis approach that they predicted “might increase yields in oligo synthesis from 9 bp per dollar to 20 kbp per dollar.” Once this or related strategies have matured and reach commercialization, the synthesis of small viral DNA genomes (for example, the 3,215-bp genome of hepatitis B virus (HBV)) could be accomplished for less than $100. At so low a cost, who would then construct an HBV mutant by such classic methods as site-directed mutagenesis? All current gene synthesis methods, either practiced or just conceived, still depend on relatively short oligos as their basic building blocks. But further progress in synthetic biology will require accurate synthesis of long, continuous DNA sequences.
