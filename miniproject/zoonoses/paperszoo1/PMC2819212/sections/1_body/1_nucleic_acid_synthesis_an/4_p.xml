 </sup> led to the first chemical synthesis of a DNA (7,500 bp) corresponding to the entire genome of an infectious organism, poliovirus, published in 2002. At the time of its publication, the poliovirus-specific DNA was the largest DNA ever synthesized. This milestone was subsequently dwarfed in scale by the synthesis of the 582,970-bp genome of
