<p id="Par8">The assembly of larger DNA segments representing genes or entire genomes, however, is still tedious and costly, even today. It requires many oligos that must be purified, because their chemical synthesis is error prone (none of the successive chemical reactions during 3′-to-5′ chain elongation proceeds at 100%). For this reason, the building blocks for the assembly of large polynucleotides are generally no longer than 40–80 nt. Different approaches have been used to assemble oligos into large polynucleotides, although all have in common the processes of enzymatic chain elongation and/or ligation of hybridized overlapping oligos
