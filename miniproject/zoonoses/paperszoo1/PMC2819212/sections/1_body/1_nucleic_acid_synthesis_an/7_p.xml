<p id="Par12">The first sequence of a naturally occurring polynucleotide, yeast tRNA
 <sup>Ala</sup>, was deciphered by R. Holley and colleagues

 </sup> in 1965. Initiated in 1958, the most difficult task of this project was to isolate from 140 kg of bakers' yeast 1 g of highly purified tRNA
 <sup>Ala</sup>, whose 76 ribonucleotides were then sequenced in 2.5 years (the sequence was later revised slightly)
