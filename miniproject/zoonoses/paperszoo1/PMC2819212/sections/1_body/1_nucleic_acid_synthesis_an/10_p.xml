<p id="Par15">The strong progress in sequencing technologies is evident in the reduction in time and costs of human genome projects. The sequence of the 'inaugural human genomes' (3 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> bp), published in 2001 (refs. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>), was determined over a period of roughly 10 years at a cost of $3 billion—and it was incomplete

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. In contrast, the complete sequence of Jim Watson's genome was determined in 4 months at a cost of less than $1 million
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>. Currently, the price has dropped further to below $50,000 (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>), and there is reason to believe that the number of solved human sequences will exceed 1,000 in the near future.
