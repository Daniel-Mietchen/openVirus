  </sup>, the publication of the 
  <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of poliovirus in the absence of natural template aroused unusually strong and sometimes conflicting responses from different quarters of society. Many of the negative reactions were tainted by fear that the poliovirus synthesis could aid bioterrorism. This was not surprising, as the news of the synthesis reached a public (particularly in the United States) that was highly sensitized to the threat of bioterrorism in the months following the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 and the anthrax attacks in Washington and elsewhere in 2001 and 2002. However, these concerns, led to numerous useful public debates about complex issues of biological research, scientific publication and national security

  </sup>. There may be two reasons for this. First, these later papers were embedded in numerous editorials or, as in the case of the ΦX174 synthesis, in a carefully orchestrated press conference called by the then US Secretary of Energy. These activities were aimed at explaining to the public the significance, particularly the benefit, of the research involving 
  <italic>de novo</italic> virus synthesis. Second, compared to in 2002, the general public was probably better prepared and better educated to accept the new reality of synthetic viruses and their possible consequences
