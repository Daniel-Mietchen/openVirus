<p id="Par62">The ability to manipulate the genomes of viruses has long been important as a model for molecular systems, for investigating viral pathogenesis and for the production of viral vaccines. The methods of molecular biology and the utility of reverse genetics allow the rapid production of altered viruses from cloned viral genes, including those that are important for public health. Until recently, these methods have relied on PCR or RT-PCR amplification of templates from the pre-existing virus, followed by subcloning into the appropriate plasmid vectors, with or without mutagenesis, and such techniques will continue to be invaluable for virology and vaccinology. However, the advances in gene synthesis, coupled with the ability to use the techniques described in this Review, have allowed the production of viruses in the absence of available infectious virus. This has implications not only in terms of dual use (

Moreover, genome synthesis of both DNA and RNA viruses will lead to unprecedented possibilities in modifying naturally occurring genomes, thereby allowing new studies of viral genome architecture, viral gene expression and gene function. The examples presented in this Review are only the beginning of a new era in which genome synthesis is likely to dominate genetic experiments with viruses.
