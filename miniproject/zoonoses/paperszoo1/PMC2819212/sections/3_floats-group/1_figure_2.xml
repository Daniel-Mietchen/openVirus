   </sup> is of plus-strand polarity (that is, it functions as mRNA in viral replication). It is covalently linked at the 5′ end to the small viral protein VPg (3B of the polyprotein), followed by a long 5′ nontranslated region (5′ NTR), a continuous open reading frame (ORF), a 3′ NTR and poly(A). The 5′ NTR consists of structural elements that control RNA replication (cloverleaf) and translation (the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)). The ORF encodes the polyprotein, the single translation product of the viral mRNA. The polyprotein is proteolytically processed by viral proteinases 2A
   <sup>pro</sup> and 3C/3CD
   <sup>pro</sup> into functional proteins, which have been divided into the structural region (P1 and the capsid precursors) and the nonstructural regions P2 and P3 (replication proteins). The ORF is followed by a 3′ NTR, which contributes to the control of RNA synthesis, and poly(A). The P1 coding region has been a target for codon and codon pair deoptimization. (
