  <title>The codon pair bias (CPB) score for each of the 14,795 annotated human genes was calculated

  <p>Each dot represents the calculated CPB score of one gene plotted against its amino acid (aa) length. Predominant use of underrepresented codon pairs yields negative CPB scores. Various poliovirus constructs are plotted according to the CPB score of their P1 capsid precursor protein. As the CPB decreases, translatability decreases and the attenuation effect on the virus increases. PV-Min is nonviable; PV-Max expresses replication and virulence phenotypes similar to those of wild-type PV. Adapted from ref.
