  <title>Comparison of lethality in mice infected with select 1918 and modern human H1N1 influenza A (Tx/91) reassortant viruses.</title>
  <p>BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU of virus to determine which virus genes of the 1918 virus contributed to virulence. Among all eight gene segments tested individually, the HA gene was the only 1918 virus gene able to confer a virulent phenotype when rescued on the genetic background of Tx/91 H1N1 virus. In the reciprocal experiments, the exchange of most of the individual 1918 influenza virus genes with seasonal influenza Tx/91 virus genes did not alter the virulence of the lethal 1918 virus; however, substitution of the HA, NA or PB1 genes substantially affected the ability of this virus to cause severe disease in mice.
