These new advances in DNA manipulation have been extended to the level of whole-genome synthesis, as evident from the synthesis of poliovirus, from the resurrection of the extinct 1918 strain of influenza virus and of human endogenous retroviruses and from the restructuring of the phage T7 genome. The largest DNA synthesized so far is the 582,970 base pair genome of <italic>Mycoplasma genitalium</italic>, although, as yet, this synthetic DNA has not been 'booted' to life. As genome synthesis is independent of a natural template, it allows modification of the structure and function of a virus's genetic information to an extent that was hitherto impossible. The common goal of this new strategy is to further our understanding of an organism's properties, particularly its pathogenic armory if it causes disease in humans, and to make use of this new information to protect from, or treat, human viral disease. Although only a few applications of virus synthesis have been described as yet, key recent findings have been the resurrection of the 1918 influenza virus and the generation of codon- and codon pair&#x02013;deoptimized polioviruses.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc. 2009</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Main</title><p id="Par2">Unprecedented progress in synthesis and sequence analysis of DNA lies at the heart of the recent transformation of molecular biology and the emergence of the field termed synthetic biology. Sequencing a DNA in the megabase (Mb) range is no longer a daunting undertaking and, applying the most advanced technology, can be accomplished within less than a week. DNA synthesis has not yet advanced to the efficiency of DNA sequencing, but synthesizing DNA of 8&#x02212;30 kilobase pairs (kbp)&#x02014;the genome size of most RNA viruses and many DNA viruses&#x02014;can be accomplished easily and is largely a matter of available resources.</p><p id="Par3">It is not surprising, therefore, that the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of viral genomes in the absence of a natural template has found its way into studies of viruses, although this branch of virology is still in its infancy. Chemical synthesis of viral genomes provides a new and powerful tool for studying the function and expression of viral genes, as well as their pathogenic potential. This method is particularly useful if the natural viral template is not available. It also allows the genetic modification of viral genomes on a scale that would be impossible to achieve by conventional molecular biology methods.</p><p id="Par4">In this Review, we summarize briefly the recent advances in DNA synthesis and sequencing and their impact on virology. Specifically, we describe the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of viruses in the absence of a natural template with the aim of resurrecting viruses using archaevirology, identifying viruses that cause human diseases after zoonotic infections, reconstructing viral genomes to unravel complex biological systems ('refactoring' genomes) or recoding viral genetic information for the production of vaccine candidates.</p><p id="Par5">Synthetic biology is the design and construction of new biological entities, such as enzymes, genetic circuits and cells, or the redesign of existing biological systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Such changes exceed those introduced previously into biological systems by methods of classic molecular engineering. Synthetic biology depends on the collaboration of specialists from different disciplines, as it requires knowledge in molecular biology, computer science, engineering, mathematics, physics and chemistry. Of the papers discussed in this short Review, it is only the research efforts to refactor the genome of a bacteriophage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> or to recode RNA viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> that belong to the category of synthetic biology. It can be predicted with certainty, however, that this will rapidly change in the coming years. In the future, large-scale changes will be introduced into numerous viruses, allowing the creation of redesigned particles that can provide new insights into biology or the design of new vectors that can prevent or cure infectious diseases, cure genetic deficiencies by delivering genes or treat cancer through oncolytic mechanisms, to name but a few applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Nucleic acid synthesis and sequencing</title><p id="Par6">In 1828, Friedrich W&#x000f6;hler synthesized urea from inorganic sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, striking a heavy blow to the doctrine of vitalism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The chemical DNA was discovered in 1869 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>), but it took decades to solve the structural configuration of polynucleotides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In keeping with their tradition, chemists began to synthesize DNA as soon as DNA structures had been published. The most ambitious of such early ventures was Khorana's synthesis of a 75-base-pair (bp) double-stranded DNA that encoded the nucleotide sequence of yeast tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>, published in 1970 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>). This was followed by the chemical and enzymatic synthesis of the first man-made functional gene, the 207-bp DNA of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> tyrosine suppressor tRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">These early landmarks consumed enormous resources, in the case of tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> some &#x0201c;20 man-years of effort&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In the 1980s, however, DNA synthesis went through a rapid transformation, with the introduction of novel activated nucleosides that allowed fully automated 3&#x02032;-to-5&#x02032; synthesis of oligodeoxynucleotides (oligos) on solid supports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In particular, phosphoramidites (that is, nucleotides that carry protective groups on the reactive hydroxyl and phosphate groups of the ribose and the amine of the base) have been the building blocks of choice. During the past 20 years, numerous DNA synthesis companies have been established in response to an exploding demand for oligos (&#x0223c;15&#x02013;80 nucleotides (nt)) that are used for genetic analyses, PCR, diagnostic assays, sequence determination or other procedures. The turnaround time for an order of a 75-bp DNA, corresponding to yeast tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>, with extra base pairs at each end encoding restriction sites for subcloning, is currently less than 1 week&#x02014;a fraction of the time and effort expended originally in Khorana's laboratory.</p><p id="Par8">The assembly of larger DNA segments representing genes or entire genomes, however, is still tedious and costly, even today. It requires many oligos that must be purified, because their chemical synthesis is error prone (none of the successive chemical reactions during 3&#x02032;-to-5&#x02032; chain elongation proceeds at 100%). For this reason, the building blocks for the assembly of large polynucleotides are generally no longer than 40&#x02013;80 nt. Different approaches have been used to assemble oligos into large polynucleotides, although all have in common the processes of enzymatic chain elongation and/or ligation of hybridized overlapping oligos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Examples are the 2.7-kbp plasmid containing the &#x003b2;-lactamase gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and the 4,917-kbp gene encoding the merozoite surface protein (MSP-1) of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Currently, synthesizing genes or genomes is most cost efficient when done in part by commercial facilities, where the cost per base pair of finished and sequence-confirmed DNA is now as low $0.39 (E.W. and S.M., based on information obtained from an informal web survey).</p><p id="Par9">Work in one of our groups (E.W. and colleagues)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> led to the first chemical synthesis of a DNA (7,500 bp) corresponding to the entire genome of an infectious organism, poliovirus, published in 2002. At the time of its publication, the poliovirus-specific DNA was the largest DNA ever synthesized. This milestone was subsequently dwarfed in scale by the synthesis of the 582,970-bp genome of <italic>Mycoplasma genitalium</italic> in 2008 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>). Although this synthetic bacterial genome has not yet been 'booted' to life, the assembly of such a large DNA molecule bears witness to the vast possibilities that DNA synthesis will ultimately offer in engineering bacteria or viruses.</p><p id="Par10">Although the mechanics of constructing genes or genomes from oligos is being refined, DNA synthesis is making rapid progress, so that it is likely to fundamentally change research in molecular biology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In 2004, Tian <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> published a massively parallel microchip-based DNA synthesis approach that they predicted &#x0201c;might increase yields in oligo synthesis from 9 bp per dollar to 20 kbp per dollar.&#x0201d; Once this or related strategies have matured and reach commercialization, the synthesis of small viral DNA genomes (for example, the 3,215-bp genome of hepatitis B virus (HBV)) could be accomplished for less than $100. At so low a cost, who would then construct an HBV mutant by such classic methods as site-directed mutagenesis? All current gene synthesis methods, either practiced or just conceived, still depend on relatively short oligos as their basic building blocks. But further progress in synthetic biology will require accurate synthesis of long, continuous DNA sequences.</p><p id="Par11">Synthesizing large DNA molecules would be of only limited value if new methods of DNA sequencing had not kept pace with the advances in synthesis. In fact, the advances in DNA sequencing have dwarfed current DNA synthesis technology.</p><p id="Par12">The first sequence of a naturally occurring polynucleotide, yeast tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>, was deciphered by R. Holley and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> in 1965. Initiated in 1958, the most difficult task of this project was to isolate from 140 kg of bakers' yeast 1 g of highly purified tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>, whose 76 ribonucleotides were then sequenced in 2.5 years (the sequence was later revised slightly)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Since then, however, two phases of technological innovation in sequencing have led to rapid progress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">The first phase was based on generating radioactive, sequence-specific fragments of DNA and separating them by PAGE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Sanger's method of producing fragments enzymatically by chain termination with dideoxynucleoside triphosphates proved to be more practical than the chemical method of Maxam and Gilbert. Subsequently, gels were replaced by capillaries, and radioactive labels by four-color fluorescence; the process was automated and streamlined, but the underlying principle of the dideoxy method remains, to this day, the most widely used platform of DNA sequencing.</p><p id="Par14">The second phase, still in its infancy, falls under the rubric of a single paradigm, termed 'cyclic array sequencing'. &#x0201c;Cyclic array platforms achieve low cost by simultaneously decoding a two-dimensional array bearing millions (potentially billions) of distinct sequence features&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Such instruments, with slightly different technologies, are already commercially available from companies. Other methods, such as single-molecule sequencing, sequencing by microelectrophoresis, sequencing by mass spectrometry or sequencing by squeezing DNA through tiny nanopores (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>) are being tested, but have yet to mature into commercially useful techniques.</p><p id="Par15">The strong progress in sequencing technologies is evident in the reduction in time and costs of human genome projects. The sequence of the 'inaugural human genomes' (3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> bp), published in 2001 (refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>), was determined over a period of roughly 10 years at a cost of $3 billion&#x02014;and it was incomplete<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In contrast, the complete sequence of Jim Watson's genome was determined in 4 months at a cost of less than $1 million<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Currently, the price has dropped further to below $50,000 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>), and there is reason to believe that the number of solved human sequences will exceed 1,000 in the near future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Virology in the era of gene synthesis</title><p id="Par16">Viruses store their genetic information in DNA or RNA. Total-genome synthesis of a viral genome seemed likely to occur first with one of the small DNA viruses; the protocol seemed straightforward: simply transfect the synthetic DNA into suitable host cells and assay the emerging virus. In fact, the first chemical whole-genome synthesis was performed with poliovirus, an RNA virus.</p><p id="Par17">How do RNA viruses fit into the world of DNA synthesis and DNA sequencing? The answer is 'reverse genetics'. In their landmark paper of 1978, Weissmann and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> converted the RNA genome (4,127 nt) of the RNA phage Q&#x003b2; into double-stranded DNA with the aid of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme (of retroviruses) that transcribes RNA into DNA. The virus-specific double-stranded DNA (cDNA), which was embedded into a plasmid, yielded authentic Q&#x003b2; phage following transfection into bacteria. At the time, the authors concluded that the viral cDNA &#x0201c;would allow genetic manipulations that cannot be carried out at the RNA level&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, an understatement that revolutionized molecular biology of RNA viruses. Three years later, Racaniello and Baltimore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> repeated this experiment with poliovirus. Again, the virion RNA, embedded as cDNA into a plasmid, yielded authentic poliovirus in very poor yield when transfected into HeLa cells, a human cancer cell line that is optimal for poliovirus proliferation.</p><p id="Par18">Depending on the nature of the RNA virus (either positive-strand viruses, whose genome is of the same polarity as mRNA, or negative-strand viruses, whose genome is of the opposite polarity to that of mRNA), virus-specific cDNAs can now be readily prepared and used by different strategies to regenerate the parental RNA virus in high yield. The utility of reverse genetics was quickly recognized and, not surprisingly, it has now been developed for member viruses of nearly every known RNA virus family (for example, rabies virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, respiratory syncytial virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, influenza A virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, measles virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, Ebola virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> and bunyavirus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Reverse genetics systems have also been recently achieved for members of the <italic>Reoviridae</italic> (viruses with a segmented double-stranded genome&#x02014;for example, rotavirus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>&#x02014;using a helper virus&#x02212;driven reverse genetics procedure).</p><p id="Par19">Synthesis of viral cDNA with reverse transcriptase requires, of course, naturally occurring virion RNA as template. An alternative is the chemical synthesis of cDNA, which, of course, requires knowledge of the viral genome sequence. The first replicating structure that was synthesized from sequence information was a replicon of the hepatitis C virus that lacked the genes for the structural proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, and the first synthesis of a complete viral genome was that of poliovirus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Currently, 2,361 complete viral genome sequences have been deposited in the Viral Genome Resource (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GenomesHome.cgi?taxid=10239">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GenomesHome.cgi?taxid=10239</ext-link>), ready to be downloaded and investigated further. Thus, there are huge resources of information available in the virus field, waiting to enter studies that we may broadly term synthetic virology.</p><p id="Par20">There are, of course, cases in which no complete viral genome sequences are available for chemical synthesis. A notable recent example is the synthesis of the 1918 'Spanish' influenza pandemic virus, which caused the most severe influenza pandemic in history. Although the pandemic virus was not isolated at the time, work in one of our laboratories (J.K.T. and colleagues)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> deciphered the genome sequence using influenza viral RNA fragments, &#x0003c;100 nucleotides in length, that were preserved in the tissues of victims of the 1918 pandemic. In addition, Hahn and colleagues successfully synthesized chimpanzee retrovirus simian immunodeficiency virus cpz (SIVcpz)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, the natural reservoir of HIV-1 and another case in which chemical synthesis was the only means of obtaining cDNA to generate infectious virus. The resurrection of an infectious retrovirus by whole-genome synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> of a consensus sequence of ancient remnants endogenous to the human genome also illustrates the potential of this approach in archaevirology. As with the synthesis of SIVcpz, the total synthesis of an infectious recombinant bat severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus cDNA (29.7 kbp) was also aimed at studying mechanisms of <italic>trans</italic>-species infection and zoonosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">In the following sections, we discuss in more detail the complete synthesis of several different viruses, either in the absence of natural template or using reverse genetics. We then go on to describe several applications of synthetic virology, such as the large-scale recoding of the viral genomes for the production of attenuated vaccine candidates or the use of refactoring (that is, the synthesis of portions of a genome) to facilitate the elucidation of individual gene functions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Whole-genome synthesis of poliovirus</title><p id="Par22">In 2002, one of our groups (E.W. and colleagues)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> published the cell-free chemical biochemical synthesis of poliovirus type 1, Mahoney (PV1(M) in the absence of a natural template. This work caught global attention, high praise, ridicule and fierce condemnation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Apart from providing a 'proof of principle', the experiment signaled a new era in biology&#x02014;that is, the chemical synthesis of organisms as an approach to investigating gene function and pathogenicity by allowing large-scale changes in a genome of interest. The extent of such alterations (for example, large changes in genome architecture and gene structure) cannot be achieved with the 'traditional' methods in molecular biology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">The synthetic polio cDNA contained 27 intentional nucleotide changes that were placed across the genome to serve as genetic markers (watermarks). When grown in HeLa cells, an efficient tissue culture system for poliovirus proliferation, the synthetic virus (denoted sPV1(M)) showed no phenotypic changes compared with the wild-type PV1(M). However, when injected intracerebrally into <italic>CD155</italic> tg mice, which are transgenic for the poliovirus receptor, CD155, the median lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) was five orders of magnitude higher than that of the wild-type virus (LD<sub>50</sub> values of 10<sup>2</sup> and 10<sup>7</sup> for the wild-type virus and sPV, respectively; E.W. and colleagues)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Unexpectedly, the genetic locus for the enormous attenuation of sPV(M) was a single A residue at position 102 of the genome, located in the 5&#x02032; nontranslated region (5&#x02032; NTR) of the genome at a site long thought to serve as simply a spacer between two highly structured regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. This unexpected result led us<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> to develop a highly attenuated oncolytic poliovirus.</p><p id="Par24">The synthesis of poliovirus did not require living cells. Subsequent to its chemical synthesis, the cDNA was transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic> into infectious viral RNA (E.W. and colleagues)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> that, in turn, yielded infectious sPV1(M) upon incubation in an extract of non-infected HeLa cells (E.W. and colleagues)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. For the chemist, therefore, poliovirus is nothing more than a chemical. When the virus enters a cell, however, it has a program for survival. It will subvert cellular compartments and turn them into viral factories, in which it will proliferate subject to the evolutionary laws&#x02014;heredity, genetic variation, selection toward fitness, evolution into different species and so on. That is, poliovirus obeys the same rules that apply to living entities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. One could even argue that poliovirus has sex in the infected cell, as it readily recombines with sibling progeny or with related viruses should they co-infect the same cell (E.W. and colleagues)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>.

This may be considered utterly superfluous, as the sequencing of PV1(M), the first of any lytic animal RNA virus, was originally carried out by two different methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup> and confirmed subsequently in numerous genetic analyses.

The influenza pandemic of 1918&#x02013;1919 caused up to 50 million deaths worldwide and remains an ominous warning to public health as to the possible impact that a future influenza pandemic could have (J.K.T. and colleagues)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>.

Understanding how the 1918 pandemic virus emerged and mapping the virulence factors may also help us in preparations for the current H1N1 influenza pandemic.</p><p id="Par27">The effort to determine the complete genomic sequence of the 1918 influenza virus began in 1995, when one of us (J.K.T. and colleagues) initiated a project to recover viral RNA fragments of the 1918 virus from preserved tissues of victims of the pandemic using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.

The development of reverse genetics technology for influenza viruses in 1999, which allowed the production of infectious virus entirely from plasmid-cloned influenza gene segments without helper virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>, makes it possible to produce influenza viruses with specific sequences for research into pathogenesis and molecular virology, as well as for vaccine production. This technology also made possible experiments using infectious viruses that contain 1918 influenza genes. Once the sequence was determined, the 1918 influenza virus gene segments were synthesized using commercially obtained overlapping oligos and subcloned into plasmids for 'rescue' using reverse genetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>.

The demonstrated role of the HA and PB1 genes in replication efficiency and virulence is particularly interesting because both genes were transferred by reassortment from an avian virus to the then-circulating human influenza virus, to generate the 1957 and 1968 pandemic strains.

It is covalently linked at the 5&#x02032; end to the small viral protein VPg (3B of the polyprotein), followed by a long 5&#x02032; nontranslated region (5&#x02032; NTR), a continuous open reading frame (ORF), a 3&#x02032; NTR and poly(A). The 5&#x02032; NTR consists of structural elements that control RNA replication (cloverleaf) and translation (the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)). The ORF encodes the polyprotein, the single translation product of the viral mRNA. The polyprotein is proteolytically processed by viral proteinases 2A<sup>pro</sup> and 3C/3CD<sup>pro</sup> into functional proteins, which have been divided into the structural region (P1 and the capsid precursors) and the nonstructural regions P2 and P3 (replication proteins).

A major reason for the nearly unlimited possibilities of encoding a protein is the degeneracy in the genetic code (for example, several synonymous codons can specify the same amino acid). However, the preference for a synonymous codon is not the same in <italic>E. coli</italic>, in jellyfish or in human cells; this phenomenon is termed 'codon bias'. For example, in humans, the alanine codon GCC is used four times more frequently than the synonymous codon GCG. The cell's preference of one synonymous codon over another to specify the same amino acid is thought to relate to the abundance of the corresponding cognate tRNAs in the cell. Consequently, rare codons are associated with a suboptimal translation of an mRNA. Codon bias, then, may contribute to the restriction of the abundance of sequences encoding the same protein. Codons used frequently in the jellyfish may be used rarely in human cells, and thus expression of the jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP) in human cells is poor unless the codons of the jellyfish gene have been changed to those frequently used in human cells; accordingly, the GFP gene has been 'humanized' to achieve good expression in human cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par48">To exploit this phenomenon, we (S.M., E.W. and collaborators)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> have 'dehumanized' the sequence encoding P1 of the poliovirus polyprotein.We chose this segment of the poliovirus genome because we have gathered abundant evidence that the P1 coding sequence does not harbor RNA signals essential for viral proliferation (E.W. and colleagues)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref></sup>.

However, changing synonymous codons in the P1 region from frequently used to rarely used codons (that is, 'codon deoptimizing' this segment of viral mRNA) will unbalance the synthesis of the polyprotein without changing its amino acid sequence, resulting in attenuated viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par49">Because of the existence of a polyprotein in picornaviruses, codon deoptimizing the P1 region (the N-terminal third of the polyprotein) compromises viral replication: fewer ribosomes arrive at the coding region for the essential replication proteins (genomic regions P2 and P3; <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), and genome replication is thus reduced or shut off altogether. It was not surprising, therefore, that extensive codon deoptimization in virus PV-AB (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>), harboring 680 changes (out of 2,643 nt) without altering a single encoded amino acid, led to a 'dead' phenotype.

Once this one virus has succeeded in overcoming the host cell, however, its burst size will be only one order of magnitude lower than that of the wild-type poliovirus. That is, although the dehumanized virus can replicate in HeLa cells, once released it has enormous problems in spreading to other cells. It should be noted that we have analyzed the sequences of the codon-deoptimized viruses for the emergence of higher-order structures that could have impeded replication.

Using a custom-made computer optimization algorithm, we have constructed polioviruses whose P1 coding region had either a substantially negative codon pair bias, containing many underrepresented codon pairs (PV-Min, CPB = &#x02212;0.474), or a substantially positive codon pair bias, containing many overrepresented codon pairs (PV-Max, CPB = +0.246; <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), while retaining the exact set of codons present in the wild-type virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and the same amino acid sequence of P1.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>The codon pair bias (CPB) score for each of the 14,795 annotated human genes was calculated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</title><p>Each dot represents the calculated CPB score of one gene plotted against its amino acid (aa) length.

Apparently, the accumulation of hundreds of unfavorable codon pairs led to a dead phenotype ('death by a thousand cuts'). Conversely, various subclones carrying segments of the P1 region of PV-Min cloned into wild-type poliovirus (for example, PV-MinXY or PV-MinZ, with CPB scores of &#x02212;0.32 and &#x02212;0.19, respectively; <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) were viable, albeit severely debilitated, as revealed by plaque assays and single-step growth kinetics experiments, and their neurovirulence in <italic>CD155</italic> tg mice was reduced 1,000-fold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Similar to the reduced specific infectivity of subclones of PV-AB, that of the PV-Min subclones, PV-Min XY and PV-MinZ, was also reduced to roughly 1 PFU per 10,000 particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Moreover, the translational activities of the subclone RNAs were impaired, an observation suggesting a relationship between viability and viral protein synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par54">This prompted us to investigate whether PV-Max, the variant in which the P1 coding region carried many overrepresented codon pairs, would grow to titers substantially higher than those of wild-type poliovirus or be more neurovirulent than wild-type virus in <italic>CD155</italic> tg mice. It had neither of these phenotypes. PV-Max, therefore, was not a highly virulent variant virus, an observation that suggests that the end product of evolution of poliovirus had already optimized the encoding of polypeptide P1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>) and cannot be 'improved'. For an RNA virus, which exists as a quasi-species, this is not unexpected. The signature of poliovirus is the efficient replication of its small genome, which, under optimal conditions, is driven by an irresistible desire to maintain optimal genome structure; that is, during replication, important replication signals are constantly rebuilt, and unnecessary nucleotide sequences (for example, foreign genes and duplications) are deleted. Indeed, the virus has an inexhaustible arsenal to achieve these goals&#x02014;by exploiting point mutations, by homologous or illegitimate recombination and even by the acquisition of foreign RNA sequences. These considerations do not mean that the sequence of PV-Max is the only other possible sequence that can express wild-type phenotypes in tissue culture and in <italic>CD155</italic> tg mice. On the contrary, there are probably a huge number of sequences with wild-type phenotypes.</p><p id="Par55">Regardless of the changes in usage of rare codons or underrepresented codon pairs, the product of the translational machinery remains the same; however, the efficiency of protein synthesis may be vastly altered. Thus, no matter how many synonymous changes have been introduced into the genome, a virus synthesized in the infected cell will have the same structure and will encode the same replication proteins as the wild-type virus, but it may be substantially disadvantaged in terms of proliferation. Such a variant of a human pathogenic virus may enter the host by its normal route and replicate poorly, but still allow the host to mount an immune response strong enough to induce lasting protective immunity. In other words, a human virus with altered codon usage or altered codon pair usage could possibly serve as a vaccine. Recoding viral genomes, a process that we call 'synthetic attenuated virus engineering' (SAVE), may be a new and rapid route to discover vaccine candidates and prevent viral disease. Indeed, polioviruses harboring underrepresented codons or underrepresented codon pairs are attenuated in <italic>CD155</italic> tg mice. Infection of these mice with a sublethal dose of codon- or codon pair&#x02013;deoptimized viruses induced an immune response that protected the animals against a lethal dose of the wild-type virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par56">The Wimmer group is now extending the SAVE strategy from poliovirus to the influenza virus because of its enormous importance as a major human pathogen, both in its pandemic and epidemic forms. We also want to know to what extent computer-aided rational design can lead rapidly to vaccine candidates of a virus whose genetic and pathogenic properties are completely different from that of poliovirus. First, influenza virus is a negative-stranded RNA virus with a segmented genome; on entry into the host cell the virion must activate its virus-associated RNA polymerase, which will synthesize genome-complementary RNA for translation and replication. Second, many of the important steps in influenza virus replication occur in the cell nucleus, an environment that is avoided by nearly all other RNA viruses (for example, poliovirus can replicate even in enucleated cells). Third, influenza virus is an enveloped virus that replicates in the respiratory tract. Although this work is still in progress, our results show that, by codon pair deoptimization, it is possible to rapidly construct highly attenuated influenza viruses that, after a single cycle of immunization, protect mice against a lethal dose of wild-type influenza virus (S.M., D. Papamichail, J.R. Coleman, S. Skiena and E.W., unpublished data). Most importantly, the best of the constructed vaccine candidate strains offer a wide margin of safety at a relatively low concentration of inoculating virus (S.M., D. Papamichail, J.R. Coleman, S. Skiena and E.W., unpublished data).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>RNA sequences with shuffled codons</title><p id="Par57">So far, we have discussed changing the codon bias (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>) or codon pair bias (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) in the P1 region while retaining its amino acid sequence. In a separate approach, the Wimmer group (S.M., E.W. and colleagues)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> has shuffled synonymous codons of the P1 region according to a specifically designed computer algorithm to maximize the number of nucleotide changes while retaining the existing codons (for example, without changing the codon bias). The resulting P1 sequence was synthesized and cloned into the backbone of poliovirus, yielding PV-SD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). The P1 coding region of PV-SD contained 934 changes out of 2,643 nucleotides; that is, on average, every third nucleotide was different from that of the wild-type sequence. Notably, PV-SD replicated in HeLa cells with wild-type kinetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Apparently, the positioning of the synonymous codons in PV-SD, after the extensive codon shuffle, did not influence viral protein synthesis, confirming that synonymous mutations have an effect on the virus only when they are specifically directed to lower the codon bias<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> or codon pair bias<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. An intriguing conclusion from PV-SD is that, at the genome level, RNA viruses are promiscuous with respect to nucleotide changes, as long as these changes do not affect protein function or the rate of protein synthesis. In other words, RNA structures throughout much of the viral coding regions, with notable exceptions, such as <italic>cis</italic>-acting replication elements or encapsidation signals, are probably rather inconsequential.</p><p id="Par58">As pointed out above, a protein of 881 amino acids (the P1 capsid precursor of poliovirus) can be encoded in about 10<sup>442</sup> different ways. How many of these sequences, if 'cloned' into the present-day poliovirus, would express a wild-type phenotype that would be stable if passaged in HeLa cells, the preferred substrate for poliovirus in the laboratory? We have not passaged PV-SD in HeLa cells for numerous generations in an attempt to observe genetic variation toward the sequence of wild-type PV1(M). Such an experiment may not yield relevant results, because PV1(M) may also express a genetic drift. After all, the natural human cells for poliovirus proliferation are not known, but they reside in the gastrointestinal tract and are obviously very different from HeLa cells, which have been derived from a cervical cancer.</p><p id="Par59">We have used shuffled sequences to test for unknown <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA elements in the poliovirus genome. The fact that PV-SD replicates with wild-type kinetics provided proof that the P1 region is void of essential <italic>cis</italic>-acting replication elements, which would probably have been destroyed by the large-scale shuffling. Note that other human picornaviruses, such as rhinovirus type 14 (HRV14), do contain such an essential element (<italic>cre</italic> in HRV14&#x02014;a stem-loop structure of &#x0223c;50 nt) in P1. Hence, HRV14-SD would have probably been nonviable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref></sup>. The poliovirus equivalent to the HRV14 <italic>cre</italic> maps to the P2 coding region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref></sup>. We expected that scrambling the P2 coding sequence of the poliovirus genome would destroy the <italic>cre</italic> element and kill the virus, which is indeed what we have found (Y. Song, C. Ward, D. Futcher, S. Skiena, E.W. and S.M., unpublished data). Re-establishing the <italic>cre</italic> sequence in P2 by molecular engineering rescues the virus, which indicates that the P2 region does not contain any other important RNA sequences in addition to <italic>cre</italic>. Synonymous scrambling of RNA virus sequences may be an excellent tool in searching for RNA structures that are essential for viral replication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Refactoring the bacteriophage T7 genome</title><p id="Par60">&#x0201c;Refactoring [is] a process that is typically used to improve the design of legacy computer software&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref></sup>. Endy and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> have used this definition to describe their efforts to redesign the DNA bacteriophage T7 genome (39,937 bp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref></sup>) with an aim to test the functions of a set of T7 genes once they are untangled from each other (by removing overlapping gene segments). To this end, they replaced the left 11,515 bp of the wild-type genome with 12,179 bp of synthetic redesigned DNA (available in cassettes &#x003b1; and &#x003b2;) and tested the biological properties of the synthetic DNA when combined with the remainder of the wild-type (WT) genome. Notably, three chimera, &#x003b1;-WT, WT-&#x003b2;-WT and &#x003b1;-&#x003b2;-WT, were viable, but, perhaps not surprisingly to the investigators, none grew as well as wild-type T7 phage (although no burst size was included in the report)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par61">Phage &#x003b1;-&#x003b2;-WT, called T7.1, represents a redesign of &#x0003e;30% of the T7 genome and, by removing overlaps, the genes in the &#x003b1;-&#x003b2; region could be studied independently, an enormous advantage for genetic analyses. T. F. Knight described the work as &#x0201c;the most compelling example of work in synthetic biology to date&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref></sup>. From a scientific perspective, Endy's work demonstrated that overlapping genetic elements in the T7 genome were, in aggregate, non-essential for phage replication. Until these experiments, the community had been stressing the importance of these features, given that they are conserved across evolutionary distance, but the synthetic approach provided a way of clarifying this issue. From an engineering perspective, this work provided confidence that up to 5% of the DNA sequence of an organism can be changed while still maintaining its viability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par62">The ability to manipulate the genomes of viruses has long been important as a model for molecular systems, for investigating viral pathogenesis and for the production of viral vaccines. The methods of molecular biology and the utility of reverse genetics allow the rapid production of altered viruses from cloned viral genes, including those that are important for public health. Until recently, these methods have relied on PCR or RT-PCR amplification of templates from the pre-existing virus, followed by subcloning into the appropriate plasmid vectors, with or without mutagenesis, and such techniques will continue to be invaluable for virology and vaccinology. However, the advances in gene synthesis, coupled with the ability to use the techniques described in this Review, have allowed the production of viruses in the absence of available infectious virus. This has implications not only in terms of dual use (<xref rid="Sec12" ref-type="sec">Box 1</xref>), but also for our understanding of evolution and the properties of important pathogens. Moreover, genome synthesis of both DNA and RNA viruses will lead to unprecedented possibilities in modifying naturally occurring genomes, thereby allowing new studies of viral genome architecture, viral gene expression and gene function. The examples presented in this Review are only the beginning of a new era in which genome synthesis is likely to dominate genetic experiments with viruses.</p><sec id="Sec12"><boxed-text><label>Box 1: 'Dual use' concerns and total synthesis of viruses</label><p id="Par63">As discussed elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, the publication of the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of poliovirus in the absence of natural template aroused unusually strong and sometimes conflicting responses from different quarters of society. Many of the negative reactions were tainted by fear that the poliovirus synthesis could aid bioterrorism. This was not surprising, as the news of the synthesis reached a public (particularly in the United States) that was highly sensitized to the threat of bioterrorism in the months following the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 and the anthrax attacks in Washington and elsewhere in 2001 and 2002. However, these concerns, led to numerous useful public debates about complex issues of biological research, scientific publication and national security<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref></sup>. Notably, the synthesis of the bacteriophage &#x003a6;X174 genome in 2003, which stood out because of its speed of merely 2 weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>, or the resurrection of the 1918 'Spanish' influenza virus in 2005 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>), did not set off the shock waves experienced in 2002, when the poliovirus genome synthesis was published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. There may be two reasons for this. First, these later papers were embedded in numerous editorials or, as in the case of the &#x003a6;X174 synthesis, in a carefully orchestrated press conference called by the then US Secretary of Energy. These activities were aimed at explaining to the public the significance, particularly the benefit, of the research involving <italic>de novo</italic> virus synthesis. Second, compared to in 2002, the general public was probably better prepared and better educated to accept the new reality of synthetic viruses and their possible consequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>.
