<p>Deterministic and stochastic mathematical models are powerful and cost‚Äêeffective tools. When used in conjunction with laboratory and field data and geographic information and remote sensing tools, they lead to a better understanding of the four stages of infection and transmission (

Developing new models that cross disciplinary boundaries (integrating stages (1), (2), (3), and (4)), accurately describing the dynamics that take place within the wildlife reservoir and between hosts and generating new hypotheses about viral evolution will help address some unanswered questions in the study of viral zoonoses in wildlife and spur new research in this area.
