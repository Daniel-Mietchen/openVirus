<p>Our objective in this review is to emphasize the role of mathematical models in the study of viral zoonoses. The models described are mathematical, deterministic and stochastic, and are therefore limited in scope. We did not discuss statistical models or statistical techniques that are valuable in the study of viral zoonoses and that are especially important in fitting models to data. We mentioned briefly some of the computationally intensive models that use information about geography, landscape and environment to identify factors associated with high prevalence of disease in wildlife or to model disease spread. The list of references provides some additional sources for more details.</p>
