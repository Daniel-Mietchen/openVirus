<p>Gaps exist in modeling of wildlife viral zoonoses that need further investigation to move the field forward. Models that can evaluate the genomic trajectory of particular RNA viruses in reservoir host species are essential to understanding how viral zoonoses are maintained in nature. Additionally, models that incorporate selective pressures (e.g., resources such as food and water, predators, breeding cycles), infection history and the heterogeneity in an animal’s ability to maintain and amplify a pathogen can be used to probe how viruses are maintained in their reservoirs and to determine what drives spill over into new nonreservoir species. There is a need for increased surveillance of wildlife diseases and inclusion of this data in model formulation and analysis. Difficulties encountered due to case acquisition and underreporting, and lack of existing wildlife surveillance infrastructure and validated diagnostic tests need to be overcome (

Modeling is crucial given that the successful spill over event is rare, and can help drive hypothesis testing that can capture such events in controlled experimental or field settings. With respect to immunological pressures, many unanswered questions need to be addressed with models. For example, what are the mechanisms of the immune response in the wildlife host that lead to a persistent infection or to the possibility of a superspreader? How and why does it differ in the spill over dead‐end host that either dies or has no productive infection? How does the immune response differ when a host is infected with a single versus multiple pathogens? What effects do seasonality or climate change have on the immune response and disease susceptibility? What are the drivers of host‐switching events that lead to emergence of new disease? Formulation and analysis of more detailed within‐host models to existing population level model structures will be necessary to accurately evaluate and predict risk of infection and development of disease in animal populations.
