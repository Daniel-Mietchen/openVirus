<p>Although the within‐host and population dynamics are often modeled separately, host‐pathogen interactions at the within‐host level can influence the dynamics of the system at the population level in a number of ways. The pathogen may alter the host by changing its reproductive, movement or social behavior (

 <xref rid="b122" ref-type="ref">Murray and Seward [1992]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b100" ref-type="ref">Klein et al. [2004]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b167" ref-type="ref">van Gils et al. [2007]</xref>). A pathogen may shorten the host lifespan, e.g., H5N1 influenza virus in chickens (
 <xref rid="b40" ref-type="ref">Chen et al. [2006]</xref>). A better understanding of the behavior of the pathogen within‐host will lead to better models and more accurate parameterization for host‐pathogen interactions on a population or evolutionary level (
 <xref rid="b180" ref-type="ref">Mideo et al. [2008]</xref>). For instance, knowledge of within‐host biology tells us if we need to address time since infection or changes in immunity, persistently infectious individuals versus short‐term infection resulting in recovery and possibly immunity. Host biology may tell us that infectivity is age‐dependent or that infection alters behavior, e.g., hantavirus infection in male rodents increases aggression (
 <xref rid="b100" ref-type="ref">Klein et al. [2004]</xref>), rabies infection in foxes increases erratic movement (
 <xref rid="b122" ref-type="ref">Murray and Seward [1992]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b123" ref-type="ref">Murray et al. [1986]</xref>), low pathogenic avian influenza infection in swans delays migration (
 <xref rid="b167" ref-type="ref">van Gils et al. [2007]</xref>). Host or pathogen biology may differ in space or time (seasonality) and the environment may play a significant role in the contact process, especially in an animal reservoir, e.g., spatial overlap of habitats leading to spill over of hantavirus infection in rodents (
 <xref rid="b14" ref-type="ref">Allen et al. [2009]</xref>). Multiple hosts may amplify or dilute the pathogen effects or multiple pathogen co‐infection may decrease the effectiveness of the immune response. That is, increased biodiversity in bird species reduces spillover of West Nile virus in humans (
 <xref rid="b155" ref-type="ref">Swaddle and Calos [2008]</xref>), reduced species diversity increases infection prevalence of Sin Nombre virus in deer mice (
 <xref rid="b58" ref-type="ref">Dizney and Ruedas [2009]</xref>), micro‐ and macro‐parasitic co‐infection induces antagonistic immune responses (
 <xref rid="b67" ref-type="ref">Fenton et al. [2008]</xref>). In summary, the within‐host biology leads to a particular choice of model at the population level, such as an 
 <italic>SI</italic> model with susceptible and infectious stages or an 
 <italic>SIR</italic> model with susceptible, infectious, recovered and immune stages. Alternately, an 
 <italic>SI</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> model with susceptible and two infectious stages could be applied if the infection modifies the behavior of some individuals, such as those in infectious stage 2 but not stage 1. These types of models are discussed in more detail in the following sections.
