<p>Various modeling approaches are discussed in this review that have been applied to the study of maintenance and transmission of viral zoonoses among reservoir populations. Mathematical models and techniques developed for spread of disease in humans often apply to wildlife populations but there are key differences. For example, the wildlife reservoir has adapted to the specific viral infection while this is not the case for humans. In addition, environmental effects and anthropogenic disturbances have a much greater impact on diseases in wildlife than in humans. Mathematical models developed for diseases of wildlife often concentrate on the population level, omitting steps (2) and (3) (
