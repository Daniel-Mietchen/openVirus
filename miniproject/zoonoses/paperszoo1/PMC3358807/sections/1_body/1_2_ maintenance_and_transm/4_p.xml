<p>A variety of models have been applied to wildlife diseases, including mathematical and statistical models. We restrict this review to viral zoonoses and to mathematical models, that are either deterministic or stochastic. In 
 <xref rid="ss3" ref-type="sec">Sections 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ss4" ref-type="sec">4</xref>, models that have been developed at the population level and cellular level, respectively, are summarized.
