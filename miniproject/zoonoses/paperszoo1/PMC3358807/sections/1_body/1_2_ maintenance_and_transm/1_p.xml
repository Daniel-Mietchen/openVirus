<p>Four stages of infection are identified from initiation to maintenance and transmission of a viral pathogen in a reservoir host: (1) contact or exposure, (2) cellular entry, (3) viral replication, assembly and release, and (4) transmission (see 
 <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). When the disease is maintained in the reservoir population, the stages are cyclic (1) → (2) → (3) → (4) → (1). A viral infection begins with contact or exposure of an animal host with a particular pathogen. At the first stage, environmental conditions including climate, seasonality, anthropogenic disturbances, landscape, and resources (i.e., habitat, food, water) may individually or collectively determine whether there is contact between host and pathogen (

 <xref rid="b137" ref-type="ref">Previtali et al. [2010]</xref>). In addition, the host’s intrinsic characteristics, its population and social structure, mobility, behavior, and susceptibility may modulate the extent of its exposure. In the second stage, the within‐host and cellular level, the virus must overcome physical barriers of the host, and must be compatible with cell receptors to gain entry into a target cell. After viral entry, the third stage, viral replication depends on host and viral genetics as well as host factors, such as the immune response, prior exposure, nutritional status, co‐infection, age, sex, and reproductive status. Establishment of an infection in one host does not necessarily mean transmission to another host, as it may be a dead‐end host. Transmission, the fourth stage of infection, depends on viral load, mode of viral shedding, host factors, and the community intra‐ and inter‐host ecological interactions. These latter interactions are also affected by the spatial environment and anthropogenic factors.
