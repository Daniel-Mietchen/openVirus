<p>The concept of herd immunity comes from the SIR model and is important in control of infectious diseases. Herd immunity determines the proportion 
 <italic>p</italic> of susceptible individuals that should be vaccinated or removed to prevent an outbreak. That is, the proportion 
 <italic>p</italic> for herd immunity is found by solving 
 <inline-graphic xlink:href="NRM-25-5-e044.jpg" xlink:title="inline image" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>, which yields

 </disp-formula> The minimal proportion to be vaccinated for herd immunity is 
 <inline-graphic xlink:href="NRM-25-5-e045.jpg" xlink:title="inline image" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/> assuming a homogeneously mixed population (
 <xref rid="b19" ref-type="ref">Anderson and May [1992]</xref>). Due to the presence of 
 <inline-graphic xlink:href="NRM-25-5-e046.jpg" xlink:title="inline image" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/> in this formula, the same limitations for 
 <italic>p</italic> apply as for 
 <inline-graphic xlink:href="NRM-25-5-e047.jpg" xlink:title="inline image" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>, namely that it relies on a large population size and assumes all individuals are initially susceptible.
