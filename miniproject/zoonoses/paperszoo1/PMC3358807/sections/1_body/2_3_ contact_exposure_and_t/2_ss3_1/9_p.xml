<p>The continuous‐time SIS and SIR models serve as a point of departure for many other types of modeling formats, discrete‐time and continuous‐time, deterministic and stochastic SIS and SIR models (e.g., Allen [

 <xref rid="b39" ref-type="ref">Caswell [2001]</xref>). The basic stochastic SIS and SIR models include variability due to transmission, recovery and disease‐related deaths. Stochastic SIS and SIR models can be used to predict the probability of an outbreak, the final size distribution of an epizootic, the expected duration of an epizootic or the limiting stationary or quasistationary probability distribution. For example, an approximation to the probability of an outbreak, 
 <italic>PO</italic>, in either discrete‐event, stochastic SIS or SIR models depends on the initial number of infected individuals,

 <sub>0</sub>, and on the basic reproduction number

 <inline-graphic xlink:href="NRM-25-5-e049.jpg" xlink:title="inline image" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>. This is a good approximation if 
 <italic>N</italic> is large and 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is small (
 <xref rid="b7" ref-type="ref">Allen [2008]</xref>). The probability of no outbreak,

Although there has been much theoretical research in stochastic SIR and SIS epidemic models, fewer stochastic models have been applied to zoonotic diseases and even fewer to viral zoonoses in wildlife populations. Thresholds in wildlife populations are more difficult to assess than in human or domestic animal populations due to lack of sufficient data (failed outbreaks are often not observed), possibility of alternative but unknown reservoirs and the differences in the types of thresholds (
