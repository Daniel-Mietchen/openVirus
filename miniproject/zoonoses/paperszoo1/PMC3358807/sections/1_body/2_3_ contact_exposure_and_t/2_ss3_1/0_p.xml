 <bold>3.1. Basic epizootic model</bold> The basic epizootic model is known as an SIR model. The flow diagram of an SIR model, 
 <italic>S</italic>→
 <italic>I</italic>→
 <italic>R</italic>, means a susceptible individual becomes infectious then recovers and is immune. The model is the same as the well‐known SIR epidemic model, but the term “epizootic” is used in place of “epidemic” to emphasize that we are applying these models to outbreaks in animal populations. The term epizootic refers to a single outbreak, whereas enzootic implies persistence of the disease in an animal population. If there is no immunity, then re‐infection may occur and the model is known as an SIS model; whereas if immunity wanes, then the model is known as an SIRS model. The simplest type of model assumes homogeneous mixing. That is, all susceptible individuals are equally likely to become infectious depending on the number of contacts (
 <italic>c</italic>) per unit time of an infectious individual with other individuals in the population and the probability (
 <italic>q</italic>) that a contact results in an infection.
