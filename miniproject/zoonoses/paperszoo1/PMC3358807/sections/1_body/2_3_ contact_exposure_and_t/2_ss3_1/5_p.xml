<p>The SIS and SIRS models have the same basic reproduction number as the SIR model. In the SIS model, the recovery rate γ
 <italic>I</italic> is in the equation 
 <italic>dS</italic>/
 <italic>dt</italic>. In the SIRS model, there is a loss of immunity, δ
 <italic>R</italic> is subtracted from 
 <italic>dR</italic>/
 <italic>dt</italic> and added to 
 <italic>dS</italic>/
 <italic>dt</italic>. If 
 <inline-graphic xlink:href="NRM-25-5-e108.jpg" xlink:title="inline image" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/> in the SIS and SIRS models with disease fatalities, then there is a single outbreak, which may lead to population extinction in the case of standard incidence. A model with standard incidence, disease fatalities and 
 <inline-graphic xlink:href="NRM-25-5-e119.jpg" xlink:title="inline image" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>, will result in extinction of the entire population, 
 <italic>N</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) → 0 (see 
 <xref rid="ss6" ref-type="sec">Appendix A</xref> and 
 <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 (b)</xref>). But with mass action incidence, the total population density is reduced but does not go to zero (
 <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 (c) and (d)</xref>). If there are no disease fatalities, then the population size remains constant. Many animal reservoirs that maintain the disease in the wild have adapted to the pathogen so that there are few, if any, disease‐related mortalities; such is the case with hantavirus (
 <xref rid="b72" ref-type="ref">Glass et al. [1998]</xref>). This is a distinct difference between the animal reservoir and the spill‐over infection. Disease‐related mortalities are a more common occurrence in spill over infections, where animal hosts have not adapted to the pathogen.
