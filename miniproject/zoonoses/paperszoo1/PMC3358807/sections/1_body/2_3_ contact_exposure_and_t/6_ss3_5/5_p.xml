<p>This latter result about the maximal pathogen reproduction number (
 <xref rid="m26" ref-type="disp-formula">10</xref>) has led to much speculation about the evolution of virulence (
 <xref rid="b54" ref-type="ref">Dieckmann et al. [2002]</xref>). The parameter α
 <sub>
  <italic>j</italic>
 </sub> is a measure of pathogen virulence. The preceding result implies that it is to the pathogen’s advantage to evolve to reduced virulence, that is, to evolve so that α
 <sub>
  <italic>j</italic>
 </sub> is small and 
 <inline-graphic xlink:href="NRM-25-5-e082.jpg" xlink:title="inline image" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/> is large (
 <xref rid="b34" ref-type="ref">Bremermann and Thieme [1989]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b105" ref-type="ref">Levin and Pimentel [1981]</xref>). A well‐known natural experiment of myxoma virus in rabbits supports this hypothesis (

 <xref rid="b64" ref-type="ref">Fenner and Myers [1978]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b105" ref-type="ref">Levin and Pimentel [1981]</xref>). The European rabbit, introduced into Australia in the mid 1800s, rapidly increased to very high densities causing a serious problem to agriculture. To control the rabbit population, a lethal strain of myxoma virus was introduced in the mid 1950s. The initial mortality rate in infected rabbits was estimated at 99.8% (
 <xref rid="b64" ref-type="ref">Fenner and Myers [1978]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b105" ref-type="ref">Levin and Pimentel [1981]</xref>). But over time, the mortality decreased, the virulence level of the virus decreased in the rabbit population. The relationship between reduced virulence and disease persistence is not as simple as a decrease in pathogen reproduction number with virulence, α

 <inline-graphic xlink:href="NRM-25-5-e083.jpg" xlink:title="inline image" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/> are generally not independent; for example, transmission may be correlated with virulence (
