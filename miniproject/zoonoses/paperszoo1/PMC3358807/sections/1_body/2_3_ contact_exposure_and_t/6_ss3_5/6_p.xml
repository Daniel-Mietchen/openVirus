<p>Co‐infection and superinfection are two pathways whereby a single host can be multiply infected with several viral strains or pathogens. Co‐infection of a host with several strains may lead to viral recombination and a new strain that is more virulent. This is one of the major concerns with avian influenza (

With co‐infection, superinfection, stochastic effects or density‐dependent births instead of deaths, the competitive exclusion principle no longer holds (see e.g.,

In addition, calculation of thresholds becomes more complex and explicit expressions may not be possible. Only a few longitudinal co‐infection studies have been conducted in natural nonhuman animal populations (e.g.,
