<p>Much of the modeling work on spatial effects or the impact of climate change on viral zoonoses has been computationally intensive. A computational model for spread of H5N1 avian influenza among birds was developed based on phylogenetic data of virus isolates, migratory bird pathways and trade in poultry and wild birds (
 <xref rid="b97" ref-type="ref">Kilpatrick et al. [2006]</xref>). The model predicts global spread of H5N1, based on the location of H5N1 introductions in various countries. Remote sensing data on landscape and rainfall patterns have been applied to hantaviruses in rodents indicating significant relationships between geography, rainfall and disease in the reservoir (

 <xref rid="b45" ref-type="ref">Clements and Pfeiffer [2010]</xref> summarizes some of the contributions of geographical information systems (GIS), remote sensing (RS) and spatially explicit modeling to human risk and intervention strategies with respect to rabies, West Nile virus, avian influenza and other emerging viral zoonoses. Mathematical models coupled with data from GIS and RS are “powerful and cost‐effective tools” for assessing alternative control strategies (
