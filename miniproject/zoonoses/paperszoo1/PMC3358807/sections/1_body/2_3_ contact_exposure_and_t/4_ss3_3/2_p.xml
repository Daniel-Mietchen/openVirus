<p>In a more realistic rabies model, 
 <xref rid="b121" ref-type="ref">Murray [1993]</xref> and 
 <xref rid="b123" ref-type="ref">Murray et al. [1986]</xref> separated the types of rabies cases into nonfurious and furious types, denoted here by 
 <italic>I</italic> and 
 <italic>F</italic>, respectively. Animals with furious rabies as opposed to nonfurious rabies are more aggressive and may attack anything that moves; they become confused and wander randomly (
 <xref rid="b123" ref-type="ref">Murray et al. [1986]</xref>). In their model, it is assumed that rabies is spread via animals with the furious type. Animals become infected with rabies, stage 
 <italic>I</italic>, then may progress to the furious type, 
 <italic>F</italic>. Including births and deaths in a logistic type growth function, the model takes the following form: 
 <disp-formula id="m16">
  <label>(5)</label>
  <graphic xlink:href="NRM-25-5-e008.jpg" id="nlm-graphic-39" position="float" orientation="portrait" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </disp-formula> where 
 <italic>r</italic>=
 <italic>b</italic>−
 <italic>m</italic>, 
 <italic>b</italic> and 
 <italic>m</italic> are the density‐independent birth and death rates, respectively, and 
 <italic>N</italic>=
 <italic>S</italic>+
 <italic>I</italic>+
 <italic>F</italic> is the total population density. All animals are born susceptible, but all animals are subject to density‐independent and density‐dependent deaths. In the absence of disease, the population grows logistically to carrying capacity 
 <italic>K</italic>. Nonfurious foxes progress to the furious type at a rate σ. The rabid animals (furious rabies) have an additional disease‐related mortality rate α. The basic reproduction number for model (
 <xref rid="m16" ref-type="disp-formula">5</xref>) is 
 <disp-formula id="m17">
  <graphic xlink:href="NRM-25-5-e009.jpg" id="nlm-graphic-41" position="float" orientation="portrait" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </disp-formula> For this model, there also exist traveling wave solutions, provided 
 <inline-graphic xlink:href="NRM-25-5-e066.jpg" xlink:title="inline image" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>. With parameter values for rabies in foxes, 
 <xref rid="b121" ref-type="ref">Murray [1993]</xref> calculated a spreading speed of 51 km/year. Reaction‐diffusion models of the type (
 <xref rid="m16" ref-type="disp-formula">5</xref>) have been applied to the spread of hantaviruses and West Nile virus (
 <xref rid="b1" ref-type="ref">Abramson et al. [2003]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b106" ref-type="ref">Lewis et al. [2006]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b110" ref-type="ref">Maidana and Yang [2009]</xref>). Reaction‐diffusion models can offer some tractability, allowing 
 <inline-graphic xlink:href="NRM-25-5-e067.jpg" xlink:title="inline image" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/> to be calculated. However, this tractability does come at a cost. These models assume that dispersal is short range, which cannot always be justified.
