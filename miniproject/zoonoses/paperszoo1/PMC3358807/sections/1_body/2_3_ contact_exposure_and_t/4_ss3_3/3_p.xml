<p>In addition to simple reaction‐diffusion models, other types of reaction‐diffusion models include biased or directed motion and other types of spatial settings, such as spatially discrete locations or patches (e.g.,

For example, in the case of rabies, baits laden with vaccine were deposited in strategic locations in Canada, the United States and Europe with the goal of stopping the spread of rabies in wildlife reservoirs, foxes, coyotes and raccoons; this has been modeled in (

They found epizootic periods of 4–5 years and although recurrent epidemics declined in size, the model agreed most closely with an assumption of little or no immunity (
 <xref rid="b42" ref-type="ref">Childs et al. [2007]</xref>). They also used the model to evaluate culling versus vaccination as control measures for raccoon rabies and found that the most cost effective strategy involves culling over 32% of the raccoons or yearly vaccination of up to 99% of the population (

 <xref rid="b151" ref-type="ref">Smith and Cheeseman [2002]</xref> found that culling was more effective for disease elimination than vaccination for control of fox rabies in Europe. Such types of studies on disease spread, vaccination coverage and other methods for control of zoonotic diseases are immensely valuable for prevention of human infection and conservation of wildlife.
