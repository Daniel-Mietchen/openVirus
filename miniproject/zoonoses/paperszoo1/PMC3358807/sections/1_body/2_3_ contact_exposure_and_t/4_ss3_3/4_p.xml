<p>Another study of a viral disease of wildlife that successfully applied a metapopulation model was an outbreak of phocine distemper virus (PDV) in harbour seals (

Although PDV is not a viral zoonoses, the mathematical methods employed are useful to the study of viral zoonoses and the study is also important for conservation purposes. A stochastic patch SEIR model was applied to data on an outbreak in 1988 of PDV in the harbour seal in the North Sea (

 <xref rid="b156" ref-type="ref">Swinton et al. [1998]</xref>). Stochastic fade‐out was observed. The model showed that it would be highly unlikely for the disease to persist in the population due to high transmission rates within subpopulations and a small annual birth rate (
