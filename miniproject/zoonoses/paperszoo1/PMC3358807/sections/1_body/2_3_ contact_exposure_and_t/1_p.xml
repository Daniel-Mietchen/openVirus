<p>Contact with an infectious host is the first event in a chain that leads to transmission in a wildlife population. The contact or exposure of a host to a pathogen is often built on the premise of homogenous mixing in epidemiological models. The most common epidemiological models are SIR models, which are the basis for many population‐based disease models (e.g.,

For wildlife populations, births and deaths, sex‐specific behavior, and sickness‐related behavior may affect exposure or transmission success. Spatial structure of the population accounts for contacts that may depend on spatial proximity or habitat heterogeneity. Environmental variability and anthropogenic disturbances are also important factors affecting successful transmission. Interactions within and between different species may lead to an amplification or a dilution effect, resulting in either spatial expansion or contraction of the disease (
