<p>For mass‐action incidence in model (
 <xref rid="m8" ref-type="disp-formula">4</xref>), the basic reproduction number depends on 
 <italic>K</italic>, Namely, 
 <inline-graphic xlink:href="NRM-25-5-e054.jpg" xlink:title="inline image" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/> When 
 <inline-graphic xlink:href="NRM-25-5-e055.jpg" xlink:title="inline image" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/> a critical carrying capacity can be defined, 
 <italic>K
  <sub>T</sub>
 </italic>= (
 <italic>b</italic>+γ+α)/β, the minimal density needed for an outbreak. In stochastic epizootic models, there is also a concept of “critical community size.” This concept is not as well‐defined as the population threshold 
 <italic>N
  <sub>T</sub>
 </italic> or 
 <italic>K
  <sub>T</sub>
 </italic>. It was first introduced by 
 <xref rid="b27" ref-type="ref">Bartlett [1957]</xref> in connection with measles outbreaks. The disease does not persist if the community size is too small. Only through introduction of new infectious individuals will there be another outbreak. Unlike the estimate for the probability of an outbreak, there is no distinct threshold for critical community size in stochastic models. Persistence of wildlife disease between epizootics depends on the length of the tail of the preceding outbreak, the number of animals that did not become infected and the rate the susceptible pool is replenished (
