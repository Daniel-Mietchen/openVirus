<p>For a pathogen that is maintained in a reservoir host, it will often be the case that

 <inline-graphic xlink:href="NRM-25-5-e057.jpg" xlink:title="inline image" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>. When infection prevalence increases in the reservoir, then humans are more likely to come in contact with the infected reservoir population. Thus, it is infection prevalence rather than 
 <inline-graphic xlink:href="NRM-25-5-e058.jpg" xlink:title="inline image" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/> that is a determinant of risk in human infection. Infection prevalence may differ from animal abundance in that there may be a lag between abundance and infection (
