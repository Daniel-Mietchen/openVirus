<p>To prevent and control the spread of a zoonotic pathogen, it is essential to understand the mechanisms that lead to the persistence of a pathogen in its animal reservoir, the spread of a pathogen from an animal reservoir to humans (i.e., host‐jumping) and the evolution of new diseases. Mathematical models of infectious diseases in wildlife have been used to increase our understanding of these mechanisms and to test hypotheses about effective methods for prevention and control of infectious diseases in wildlife and humans. The collection of work in the books edited by 
 <xref rid="b78" ref-type="ref">Grenfell and Dobson [1995]</xref> and 
 <xref rid="b93" ref-type="ref">Hudson et al. [2002]</xref> summarizes some of these modeling efforts. Our goals are to provide a review of some of the mathematical modeling frameworks developed for the study of viral zoonoses in wildlife and to provide references for more detailed analyses. A recent survey of 442 modeling studies of zoonotic pathogens by 
 <xref rid="b108" ref-type="ref">Lloyd‐Smith et al. [2009]</xref> found few dynamical models that account for multi‐host pathogens, multiple pathogens, within‐host pathogen dynamics in zoonotic transmission and pathogen evolution. In this review, we highlight these gaps and others in the modeling process that need to be filled to address important questions about viral zoonoses in wildlife. We examine some of the factors governing viral maintenance and transmission in the primary animal reservoir, how these factors have been accounted for in mathematical models and where additional modeling efforts are needed.
