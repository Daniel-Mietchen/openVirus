<p>Recently emergent and re‐emergent infectious diseases pose a worldwide public health concern. 
 <xref rid="b158" ref-type="ref">Taylor et al. [2001]</xref> estimated that 75% of human infectious diseases originate from an animal reservoir, many caused by viruses. Human diseases originating from a nonhuman animal reservoir are referred to as zoonoses. Some recent emerging and re‐emerging viral zoonoses include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola virus, SARS coronavirus, rabies virus, avian influenza viruses (AIV), Nipah virus, Hendra virus, hantaviruses, and West Nile virus. The two strains of HIV, HIV‐1, and HIV‐2, evolved from two simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) carried by the chimpanzee and Sooty mangabey, respectively (
