<p>Because model (
 <xref rid="m32" ref-type="disp-formula">15</xref>) does not include the activity of the innate immune response prior to antibody production and CTL activity, there may be delays prior to activation (

 <xref rid="b104" ref-type="ref">Lee et al. [2009]</xref>). In long‐term infections, the immune response adapts to the persistent infection, caused by a down‐regulation of the immune response (
 <xref rid="b149" ref-type="ref">Schönrich et al. [2008]</xref>). When a virus jumps to a naive host, the immune response may be very strong. For example, in some viral infections, the CTL response can lead to tissue damage and if severe enough, host death (

 <xref rid="b172" ref-type="ref">Wodarz [2007]</xref> refers to this latter type of response as CTL‐induced pathology. In addition, the immunological response and infection length are influenced by current infections and infection history (

 <xref rid="b132" ref-type="ref">Pedersen and Fenton [2007]</xref> emphasize the importance of understanding the community ecology at the level of the within‐host, that is, a tri‐trophic level interaction among the immune system, pathogen community and their respective target cells. The differences in the immune response to a viral pathogen by a reservoir as opposed to a spill over species needs further investigation. These differences in responses are key to understanding host‐switching and cross‐species pathogen transmission (
