 <bold>4.2.â€‚Host immune response</bold> The host immune response is responsible for eliminating the source of infection, the infected cells and the virions from a host. The immune system is very complex, involving many types of molecules, cells and chemicals (e.g., 
 <xref rid="b120" ref-type="ref">Murphy et al. [2008]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b134" ref-type="ref">Perelson [2002]</xref>). Two important cellular components of the adaptive immune response are B cells and T cells. The B cells are responsible for generation of antibody molecules and T cells are responsible for production of cytokines and killing of infected cells. In response to a viral pathogen, B cells are activated to produce antibodies, molecules specific to a particular virus particle. Antibodies bind to a specific virus particle so that it can be recognized and cleared by multiple mechanisms, including by macrophages, which can then present antigen to T cells. Natural killer cells also are activated by receptors on the surface of infected cells. They bind to these receptors and release chemicals inside the cell that may either kill the infected cell or cause the infected cell to stop replication of the virus particle. Helper T cells assist in both B cell and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activation.
