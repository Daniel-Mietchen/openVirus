<p>A virus‐cell model is similar to an SIR model in that uninfected and infected target cells as well as free virus particles or virions are modeled. However, this model does not account for many factors that influence the success of a viral entry, replication and release. Factors that affect viral infection include the host immune response, host and viral genetics and activity along nonimmune signaling pathways (e.g., cell‐death, metabolism) that correlate with productive infection. Some of these factors will be mentioned briefly in the following sections.</p>
