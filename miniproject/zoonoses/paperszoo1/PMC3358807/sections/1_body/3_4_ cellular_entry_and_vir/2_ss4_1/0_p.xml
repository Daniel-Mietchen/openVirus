 <bold>4.1. Basic virus‐cell model</bold> Let 
 <italic>V</italic> denote virions that enter a healthy target cell 
 <italic>T</italic> changing this target cell into an infected one 
 <italic>I</italic>, where the virus is capable of replication and release. We refer to this model as a TIV model, where there are two types of target cells, healthy and infected, and the virus particles or virions. This model has been extensively investigated with respect to human infectious diseases, in particular HIV‐1 (e.g., 
 <xref rid="b125" ref-type="ref">Nowak and May [2000]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b135" ref-type="ref">Perelson and Nelson [1999]</xref>). The TIV model is a system of three differential equations,

 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 0. The expression β
 <italic>VT</italic> represents rate of viral entry into a host cell; λ is a constant reproductive rate of target cells; δ
 <sub>
  <italic>T</italic>
 </sub>, δ
 <sub>
  <italic>I</italic>
 </sub> and 
 <italic>c</italic> are death rates of healthy target cells, infected target cells and virions, respectively. The death rate of infected target cells exceeds that of healthy cells, δ
 <sub>
  <italic>I</italic>
 </sub> &gt; δ
 <sub>
  <italic>T</italic>
 </sub>. The parameter π represents rate of reproduction of virions from one infected cell and is sometimes written as π=
 <italic>N</italic>δ
 <sub>
  <italic>I</italic>
 </sub>, where 
 <italic>N</italic> is known as the burst size, 
 <italic>N</italic>≥ 2. Sometimes the expression β
 <italic>VT</italic> is divided by total number of cells, 
 <italic>T</italic>+
 <italic>I</italic>, so that the incidence rate is standard (see e.g., 
 <xref rid="b75" ref-type="ref">Gourley et al. [2008]</xref>). In the absence of infection, the disease‐free equilibrium target cell population is 
 <inline-graphic xlink:href="NRM-25-5-e084.jpg" xlink:title="inline image" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>. The loss of virions because of entry into a target cell is often not accounted for in this model, namely, −β
 <sub>1</sub>
 <italic>VT</italic>, in the equation for 
 <italic>dV</italic>/
 <italic>dt</italic>, because this term is small compared to the viral clearance rate, 
 <italic>cV</italic>. Generally, β
 <sub>1</sub>≥β, since one or more virion may be associated with infection of a target cell. 
 <xref rid="b163" ref-type="ref">Tuckwell and Le Corfec [1998]</xref> and 
 <xref rid="b53" ref-type="ref">De Leenheer and Smith [2003]</xref> assume β
 <sub>1</sub>=β.
