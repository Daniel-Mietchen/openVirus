 <xref rid="b112" ref-type="ref">Más et al. [2010]</xref>). Regardless if one uses the concept of quasispecies to describe intra‐host variation of RNA viruses or population theories, it is well supported that RNA viruses have a high mutation rate and lack error‐correcting mechanisms. This lack of error correction results in a greater diversity and distribution of the viral genetics that may be selected upon within the host following a successful infection. Insight into the mechanism in which viruses adapt to new hosts is critical since many new viral zoonoses are RNA viruses, such as hantaviruses, avian influenza viruses, Nipah virus and SARS CoV. Hence, modeling of this phenotype of RNA viruses can shed light on how to predict which viruses in wildlife have intrinsic genetic character that would permit spill over into other species and amplification.
