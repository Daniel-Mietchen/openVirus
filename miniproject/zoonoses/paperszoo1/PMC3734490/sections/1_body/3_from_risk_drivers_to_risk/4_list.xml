  <p>The initial generation of genetic novelty, which may vary between production systems. For instance, differences in pathogen diversity and antibiotic use in production systems may lead to different levels of genetic recombination (

  <p>Subsequent stepwise adaptation of novel, more virulent pathogen types to one or more host species (

  <p>Sustained transmission within the new host population(s), which will be influenced by contact patterns, genetic susceptibility, and local population sizes and densities, which will affect the chance of local extinctions of novel pathogens.</p>
