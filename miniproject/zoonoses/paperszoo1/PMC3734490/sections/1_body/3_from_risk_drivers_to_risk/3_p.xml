<p>A second level of analysis is needed to explore the ways in which such sociobiological configurations may influence pathogen emergence, evolution, and transmission into human populations, including the development of plausible risk scenarios. Types of zoonotic pathogens range from those that can infect humans but do not spread, to pathogens that spread easily between humans (
 <xref rid="r59" ref-type="bibr">Wolfe et al. 2007</xref>); evolutionary or ecological conditions that favor emergence of the latter types pose the greatest risk. Mathematical modeling can provide insights into how ecological and evolutionary processes leading to emergence and spread of new zoonotic pathogens are likely to be affected by changes in specific features of the risk environment. There is a growing body of modeling and empirical research on pathogen emergence and evolution, as well as on pathogensâ€™ dependence on contact networks and routes of transmission (
