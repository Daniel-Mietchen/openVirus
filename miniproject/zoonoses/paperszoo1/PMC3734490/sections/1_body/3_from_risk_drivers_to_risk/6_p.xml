<p>Finally, a third level of analysis is required to estimate the health and economic burden for given risk scenarios and identify policy options for risk management. This complex issue also requires integration of disciplinary perspectives and diverse empirical material, including 
 <italic>a</italic>) epidemiological models at the population level, 
 <italic>b</italic>) health systems indicators, 
 <italic>c</italic>) inward and outward trade indices, 
 <italic>d</italic>) information on existing health and agricultural policy and regulations, 
 <italic>e</italic>) cultural attitudes toward specific interventions, 
 <italic>f</italic> ) political constraints and opportunities, and 
 <italic>g</italic>) economic data on livestock production systems. After the epidemiological models have been completed, macroeconomic modeling has the potential to embed such heterogeneous data sets into a comprehensive framework for assessments of specific interventions in terms of cost benefits and cost effectiveness (
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">Beutels et al. 2008</xref>). For example, the computable general equilibrium (CGE) approach, a member of the “whole economy” class of economic models, can be used to account for differential effects of policy options on categories of social actors (e.g., consumers, producers, households, governments) (
 <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al. 2005</xref>). In addition, combined with outputs from epidemiological models, the CGE approach can accommodate the fact that zoonotic disease and associated control initiatives will affect the economy and population health over time, and that the time profiles of costs and benefits will be sensitive to the sequence of events and interventions (
 <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al. 2009</xref>). However, such models must be sufficiently flexible and open to account for the variety of qualitative insights on cultural attitudes and governance constraints, in addition to quantitative data on macroeconomic trends and health indicators (
 <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al. 2011</xref>). The advice and experience of agricultural experts and other stakeholders must also be included as an active element of the risk management strategy.
