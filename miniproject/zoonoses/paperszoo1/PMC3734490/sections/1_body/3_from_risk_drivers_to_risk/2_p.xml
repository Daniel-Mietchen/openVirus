<p>The first level of analysis involves integration of disciplinary expertise to provide a rich sociobiological characterization of risk environments. The contribution of social scientists enhances understanding of both the political economy and the actual practice of livestock production and, above all, the relations between these. In studies to date, analysis of livestock industries is often limited to an aggregate of statistical values, framed within broad categories such as “industrial,” “semi-intensive,” “backyard,” or “mixed farming” production systems (

Although such classifications are useful for organizing the collection and comparison of data for analysis, they inevitably obscure the complexity of an economic sector that is becoming increasingly differentiated. In turn, improved knowledge of the structure and practices of livestock production can provide a framework for strategic pathogen sampling, allowing the linkage of production systems—with their microbial and genetic profiles—to identify vulnerabilities and drivers of pathogen diversity and evolution at each stage of the production process.
