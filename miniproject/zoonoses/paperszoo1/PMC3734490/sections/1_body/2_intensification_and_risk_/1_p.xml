<p>Ecological and biological drivers of disease risk are bidirectionally linked to political and economic factors. 
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">Glass and McAtee (2006)</xref> identified a range of factors that, although not directly associated with disease emergence, can alter social conditions in a way that creates a new regime of public health risk. For example, public distrust in central government resulting from corruption, conflicts, and political instability may disrupt public health systems and disease surveillance. Such distrust can itself result from zoonotic disease events, as happened in the United Kingdom following the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The lack of trust in government agencies associated with this outbreak is considered to have been an important factor in the sharp fall in immunizations with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, despite official declarations of their safety (
