For example, attempts to decrease labor costs may result in the less-effective exercise of local control measures, as low-level workers develop labor- and time-saving practices for dealing with management pressure and working conditions. Withdrawal of state subsidies may also affect smallholders (family farmers) who are tied to large agribusiness companies through contract farming (

If they do not, they may be taken out of the market chain and potentially turn to illegal trade. Indeed, illegal movement of animals and derived products represents one of the most important sources of spread of infectious diseases. One example is the significance of illegal trade in poultry between countries in Southeast Asia in the continued spread of avian influenza H5N1 across that region (
