<p>The health implications of these developments are uncertain. Large-scale intensive units may be good at biosecurity because they are usually more isolated from the external environment and better protected from infection through sustained veterinary control and management procedures. On the other hand, large numbers of susceptible animals in confined spaces increase the risk of disease transmission (

 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">Leibler et al. 2009</xref>) and may encourage evolution of pathogens (
 <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">Mennerat et al. 2010</xref>). In Thailand, for example, broiler houses with advanced ventilation systems allow confinement of up to 1 million birds per farm (NaRanong 2008). In such conditions, pathogens are likely to have higher chances of survival, transmission, and rapid evolution (

Pathogens may enter through ventilation units, feed and water systems, or livestock and leave through ventilation, animal products, and production waste (
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">Leibler et al. 2009</xref>). Industrial units can produce up to two tons of animal waste every day, which may contain large quantities of pathogens (
