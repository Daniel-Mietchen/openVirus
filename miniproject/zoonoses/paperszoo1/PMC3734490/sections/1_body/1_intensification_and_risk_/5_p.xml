<p>In light of these characteristics of modern farming, we suggest that zoonotic risks may be greatest in landscapes where large-scale production units are in close proximity to traditional, small-scale production and to wildlife populations through encroachment of agricultural production into recently deforested natural habitats. Contacts between livestock varieties and wild animals can lead to the introduction of pathogens into intensive production units, where the high density of susceptible animals can facilitate the establishment, transmission, and amplification of pathogens (
