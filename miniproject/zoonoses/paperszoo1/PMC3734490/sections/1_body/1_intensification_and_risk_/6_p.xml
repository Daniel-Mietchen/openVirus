<p>These conditions are typical of livestock intensification today in many LMICs, and are exemplified by outbreaks of Nipah virus in Asia. The first human outbreaks of Nipah virus, harboured by fruit bats (

The index case for these outbreaks, a 30,000-unit intensive pig farm in Malaysia, was established in a deforested area with resident fruit bat populations that frequented fruit trees associated with the farm. The virus was probably passed to the pigs through urine and masticated pellets dropped when the bats fed in overhanging trees. Pigs acted as amplifier hosts, enabling transmission to humans (
