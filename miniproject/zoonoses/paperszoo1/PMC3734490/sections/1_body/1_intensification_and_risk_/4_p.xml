<p>Other technical innovations associated with intensification have complex risk profiles. Although the widespread use of antibiotics to prevent infection in intensified production may reduce zoonotic risks, nontherapeutic antibiotic use in animal feeds has been shown to serve as a source of antibiotic resistance transferable to human pathogens, where it may affect treatable human infections (

The use of imported specialized breeds—characterized by genetic selection toward increased productivity—also has unclear implications for zoonotic risk. Although standardization of specialized breeds may be associated with lower pathogen diversity (
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">Guernier et al. 2004</xref>) and thus reduced risk of new pathogen emergence, it can facilitate disease transmission due to homogeneity in genetic susceptibility. In addition, imported breeds may be more vulnerable to pathogens than indigenous breeds, which have unique adaptive traits selected by farmers in local environments over many generations, including resilience to local parasites and diseases (
