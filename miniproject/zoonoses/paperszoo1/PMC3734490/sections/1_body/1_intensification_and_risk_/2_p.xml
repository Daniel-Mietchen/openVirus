<p>Over time, growth in demand and production has extended grazing and farming into natural ecosystems, illustrated by the recent transformation of portions of the Amazon forest into grassland for beef production (

 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">Bruinsma 2003</xref>). In attempting to meet demand, livestock production has evolved and diversified, with a global trend toward intensification. This trend is characterized by concentration of large numbers of animals in housing units, use of concentrate feed, reduced genetic diversity, vertical integration, and industrial management practices. This “landless” mode of production emerged in the United Kingdom and the United States in the 1930s (

While “backyard” and semi-intensive production systems are still widespread, particularly in LMICs, industrial enterprises have been estimated to account for 74% of the world’s poultry production, 40% of pork, and 68% of egg production (
