<p>Broad interdisciplinary approaches are needed to better understand the complex interactions of factors that act together to increase or reduce risks to animal and human health in the new livestock industries. However, such a research program demands solutions to theoretical and practical issues that are rarely addressed in policy statements on “one health.” These issues are likely to gain more relevance as the focus moves from the domain of policy making to the research needed to inform policy. Thus, these issues should become more central in future studies of emerging diseases, as in other contexts of interdisciplinary integration between the natural and social sciences.</p>
