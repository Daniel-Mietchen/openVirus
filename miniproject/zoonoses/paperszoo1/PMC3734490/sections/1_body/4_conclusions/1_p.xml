<p>Livestock intensification will characterize global development for decades to come as countries lift themselves out of poverty. There are major potential consequences of this change, not only with respect to emerging zoonotic diseases but also to agricultural sustainability, food security, and climate change effects (
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">Friel et al. 2009</xref>). It is not at all clear that intensification will lead to a greater frequency of zoonotic disease emergence, although some important risk factors are present. What is needed is an approach to understanding where and how risk can be generated. This requires an intersectoral and interdisciplinary approach and a stepwise process leading from improved knowledge and specification of risk drivers to policy options for risk management. However, integrated research like this has particular methodological challenges. For instance, the development of modeling tools able to account for the combination of potential risk factors, as well as their health and economic effects, requires the translation of a diverse range of socioeconomic, biological, cultural, and epidemiological information into a common language for data collation, comparability, and analysis. This process is likely to be difficult because different disciplines may rely on different bases for causal inference, notions of impact, measurement systems, and theoretical frameworks. Thus, continued disciplinary interactions, mediated by boundary-spanning concepts such as risk environment, are crucial to refine research questions and methods toward a common goal. Fruitful relationships of this sort have led to novel insights on the dynamics of epidemicsâ€”for example, the role of concurrent sexual relationships in the context of HIV transmission (
