<p>Recent studies indicate that more than three-fourths of communicable human diseases are zoonotic in origin (
 <xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr">Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005</xref>), including diseases associated with significant mortality and morbidity such as avian influenza (H5N1), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola virus, and Nipah virus. Some of these zoonotic diseases originate in wildlife and others in domestic livestock species; many have the potential to affect humans through a livestock–human interface (
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">Cleaveland et al. 2001</xref>) in which domestic livestock can act as “amplifier hosts” (
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">Keesing et al. 2010</xref>) for diseases that they contract from wildlife and then pass to humans through frequent and close contact. In light of this, there is growing interest in promoting cooperation between medical and veterinary sectors, as captured in the concept of “one health” (
 <xref rid="r62" ref-type="bibr">Zinsstag et al. 2011</xref>). Scientific research is now focusing on the interactions between humans, domestic animals, and wild animals to better understand the mechanisms of disease emergence and transmission, thus informing more effective policies for communicable disease prevention and control.
