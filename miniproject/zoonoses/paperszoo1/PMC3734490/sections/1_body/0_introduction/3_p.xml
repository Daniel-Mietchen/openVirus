<p>It has long been argued that this “livestock revolution” (

 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">Leibler et al. 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="r61" ref-type="bibr">World Bank 2009</xref>). Given our understanding of the links between livestock species and emerging zoonoses, it is relevant to ask whether changes in production systems might increase or decrease the risk of disease emergence in human populations. What husbandry practices are most likely to facilitate or prevent the emergence of new pathogens and their transmission to humans? What can be done to reduce risks? What balance is to be struck between these risks and the health gains from improved nutrition and the economic gains associated with livestock intensification? In this commentary, we provide a brief overview of the diverse range of factors likely to influence zoonotic disease risk, and identify ways in which a comprehensive risk analysis may be conducted by using an interdisciplinary approach. We also present a conceptual framework for interdisciplinary research on this problem, from the identification and analysis of risk drivers to the development of policy options for risk management.
