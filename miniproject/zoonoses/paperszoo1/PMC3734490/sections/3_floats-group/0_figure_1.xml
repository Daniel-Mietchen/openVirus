  <p>A conceptual framework that can guide interdisciplinary research on zoonotic risk in the new livestock industries. Each rectangle with a dotted border represents a level of analysis in the research program. The first step requires the characterization of risk environments, including an understanding of ecological and biological risk drivers, as well as the wider socioÂ­economic contexts that influence them. The second step entails the production of plausible risk scenarios that explore the ways in which risk environments may influence pathogen emergence, evolution, and transmission to human population. Finally, the third level of analysis evaluates the health and economic burden for given risk scenarios in order to identify policy options for risk management, in collaboration with stakeholders and agricultural experts.</p>
