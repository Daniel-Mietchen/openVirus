<p>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) probably emerged from the wildlife trade in Guangdong Province, China.

 </sup> Chinese authorities slaughtered thousands of civets, small arboreal mammals traded for their musk-producing glands, because they were suspected to be the source of the pathogen. SARS is now believed to have originated from large fruit bats.

 </sup> Bats had been captured in the wild and traded live in Chinese markets. At some point in the wildlife supply chain, infected bats were likely brought into contact with susceptible hosts, such as civets, in whom the virus amplified. The intermingling of species established a cycle in which susceptible animals and humans could become infected. After the SARS epidemics subsided, an editorial in the 
 <italic>American Journal of Public Health</italic> made this observation: â€˜The concentration of animals, their overlapping sojourns in the markets (allowing disease to spread through vast numbers of animals), and their interactions with humans (facilitating human infection) make these markets ripe for zoonoses. Once an epidemic starts among these animals, it can spread to animals reared in less cruel conditions'.
