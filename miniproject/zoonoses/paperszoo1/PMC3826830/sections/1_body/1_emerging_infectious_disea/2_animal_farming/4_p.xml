<p>Thus far, H5N1 has shown limited human-to-human spread. Pigs, however, may help H5N1 gain the ability to widely infect humans.

 </sup> Pigs are highly susceptible to both avian and human influenza A viruses.

 </sup> Until recently, only sporadic reports described pigs infected with H5N1, but a study published in 2010 reveals that between 2005 and 2007, 7.4 per cent of 700 pigs tested in Indonesia carried H5N1, even though they lacked influenza-like symptoms.

 </sup> One viral isolate had acquired the ability to recognize a cell receptor present in the noses of both pigs and humans. This change might allow it to spread easily from pigs to humans and then among humans. The pigs may have been initially infected from nearby chicken farms, but there was also evidence of pig-to-pig transmission.
