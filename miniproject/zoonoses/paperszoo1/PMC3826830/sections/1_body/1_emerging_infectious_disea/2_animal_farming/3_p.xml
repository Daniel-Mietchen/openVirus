<p>Most avian influenzas begin as mildly pathogenic viruses.

 </sup> Once they enter domestic bird populations, they may rapidly mutate into highly pathogenic viruses. Research demonstrates that after circulation in domestic birds for very short periods, low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses can mutate into HPAIs.

 </sup> Since 1990, outbreaks of HPAI virus subtypes have become more common in farmed birds compared with before 1990.

 </sup> Intensive confinement of birds facilitates both the increasing frequency and scale of these outbreaks.

 </sup> According to the World Organization for Animal Health of the Food and Agriculture Organization, two lessons should be learned from these prior outbreaks.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>
 </sup> First, that if LPAI viruses are allowed to spread among farmed birds, they can eventually mutate into HPAI viruses; and second, that densely confining birds considerably increases their vulnerability to infectious diseases.
