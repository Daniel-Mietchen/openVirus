<p>Environmental hazards, stagnation of drug development, climate change, human population growth, emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), world hunger, and violence are among our most urgent public health concerns. Their multifactorial roots necessitate strategies that go well beyond the traditional health sector. One strategy that has been largely neglected and that can help address several of these issues involves improving the treatment of non-human animals (hereafter â€˜animals'). I briefly describe how EIDs are connected with the treatment of animals and discuss why this connection needs to be addressed in public health strategies. I describe other areas of exploration, including issues concerning domestic violence and medical research.</p>
