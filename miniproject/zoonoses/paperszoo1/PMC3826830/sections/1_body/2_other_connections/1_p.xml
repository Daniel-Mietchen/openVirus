<p>Two other connections between human health and the treatment of animals warrant further exploration: medical research and interpersonal violence. More than 115 million animals are used each year in experiments or to supply the biomedical industry.

 </sup> Although the topic of animal research has not traditionally been viewed as a public health issue, its use is inextricably tied to the safety and efficacy of medical therapeutics, that play an integral role in many public health applications, including those intended to combat EIDs. Successful anti-infectious disease campaigns, for example, often rely on the availability of safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics, that in turn, depend on reliable and predictive pre-clinical research. A new study found that the mouse models used extensively to study human inflammatory diseases, including infectious diseases, only poorly mimic the human condition.

 </sup> This calls into question the reliability of mouse models to identify, develop, and test drug and vaccine candidates.
