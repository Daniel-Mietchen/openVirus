<p>Direct benefits to human health are possible if efforts to improve the treatment of animals are routinely incorporated into public health policy and strategies. If, to benefit animals, we focus on reducing the number of animals confined in industrial farms and traded worldwide, opportunities for the emergence and spread of new pathogens would decrease and benefit people. Plant-based diets can reduce the number of animals confined in industrial farms and further decrease emergence of zoonotic pathogens. Such diets also confer environmental and personal health benefits.
