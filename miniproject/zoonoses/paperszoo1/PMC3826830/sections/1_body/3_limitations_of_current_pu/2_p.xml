<p>Interventions against EIDs target surveillance and inspection activities, animal vaccination campaigns, and culling, but do not confront an underlying cause, the poor treatment of animals. Surveillance is constrained by our infrastructure plus scientific limitations. Relying on inspection of shipments remains impractical. Gerson and colleagues estimated that only 2 per cent of the more than 12 million commercial shipments into Canada annually are physically inspected.

 </sup> Trying to predict which virus subtypes circulating among animals that will pose dangers to humans is extremely difficult.
