<p>Studying the connection between domestic violence and animal mistreatment can surely help control both problems. Strategies combating animal cruelty may increase detection and prevention of violence against humans. Similarly, critically assessing the value of the use of animals in research is likely to benefit animals and improve research. We should strive to replace animal experiments with more predictive human-based testing methods. With further study, other connections between human health and animal treatment are likely to be discovered.</p>
