<p>Two major categories of emerging infections—
 <underline>newly emerging</underline> and 
 <underline>reemerging</underline> infectious diseases—can be defined, respectively, as diseases that are recognized in the human host for the first time; and diseases that historically have infected humans, but continue to appear in new locations or in drug-resistant forms, or that reappear after apparent control or elimination 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003467-Fauci1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Emerging/reemerging infections may exhibit successive stages of emergence. These stages include adaptation to a new host 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003467-Parrish1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, an epidemic/pathogenic stage, an endemic stage, and a fully adapted stage in which the organism may become nonpathogenic and potentially even beneficial to the new host (e.g., the human gut microbiome) or stably integrated into the host genome (e.g., as endogenous retroviruses). Although these successive stages characterize the evolution of certain microbial agents more than others, they nevertheless can provide a useful framework for understanding many of the dynamic relationships between microorganisms, human hosts, and the environment.
