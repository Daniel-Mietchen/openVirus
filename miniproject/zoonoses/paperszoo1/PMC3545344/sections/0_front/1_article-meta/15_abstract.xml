  <title>Objectives</title>
  <p>To conduct on-site assessments of public health implications at key European pet markets.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Design</title>
  <p>Observational study of visitor behaviour at stalls that displayed and sold animals, mainly amphibians and reptiles, to assess potential contamination risk from zoonotic pathogens. We noted initial modes of contact as ‘direct’ (handling animals) as well as ‘indirect’ (touching presumed contaminated animal-related sources) and observed whether these visitors subsequently touched their own head or mouth (H1), body (H2) or another person (H3).</p>

 <sec>
  <title>Setting</title>
  <p>Publicly accessible exotic animal markets in the UK, Germany and Spain.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Participants</title>
  <p>Anonymous members of the public in a public place.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Main outcome measures</title>
  <p>Occurrence and frequency of public contact (direct, indirect or no contact) with a presumed contaminated source.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Results</title>
  <p>A total of 813 public visitors were observed as they attended vendors. Of these, 29 (3.6%) made direct contact with an animal and 222 (27.3%) made indirect contact with a presumed contaminated source, with subsequent modes of contact being H1 18.7%, H2 52.2% and H3 9.9%.</p>

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p>Our observations indicate that opportunities for direct and indirect contact at pet markets with presumed contaminated animals and inanimate items constitute a significant and major concern, and that public attendees are exposed to rapid contamination on their person, whether or not these contaminations become associated with any episode of disease involving themselves or others. These public health risks appear unresolvable given the format of the market environment.</p>
