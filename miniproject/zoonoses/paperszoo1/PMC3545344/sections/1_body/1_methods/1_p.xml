<p>Hygiene and potential pathogen transfer were assessed by observation of public visitor and trader behaviour, with special reference to contact involving animals, animal containers, related intermediary surfaces (such as table tops), as well as contacts involving hands, body and clothing. All items (including animals and inanimate items) directly associated with the sellersâ€™ stalls were presumed contaminated. Pathogen transfer from local contamination sources is well known, and it is reasonable to anticipate that at a stall at which animals are sold, all animals and animal-related material will probably have been exposed to microbial transfer and dissemination.</p>
