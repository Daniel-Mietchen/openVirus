 </sup> Also, direct contact between any contaminated reptile and open human lesions, such as sores, or via reptile debris penetrating human orbital or aural sites, are further potential routes of infection.

 </sup> Aquatic turtles and other species of water-dwelling reptiles may contaminate large bodies of water – resulting in contaminated splashes, droplets and smears that may lead to human infection. Lizards are handled more than turtles and are more likely to introduce infection via skin scratches. Snakes are handled far more frequently than even lizards and thus may spread contaminants more widely and consistently. Diverse surfaces may act as intermediary carriers of many biotic contaminants and once a surface is contaminated, potential contagions may long persist.
