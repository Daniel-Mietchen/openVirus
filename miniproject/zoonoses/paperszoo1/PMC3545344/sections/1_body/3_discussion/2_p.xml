<p>We consider that the five-minute static observation period for target activities was sufficient for assessment of potential microbial contamination and transference. Target activities were noted within the five-minute period, and indeed a shorter observation period may have been as informative. However, a longer static observation period would unlikely have been more informative because the general throughput of the public arriving at, inspecting and then leaving each seller stall frequently occurred within a five-minute period. Mobile observation periods that involve monitoring the actions of people moving through the venues may have been additionally informative in revealing certain incidental contacts, although given the relatively crowded nature of the events, these additional contacts may reasonably be presumed to occur without specific observation.</p>
