<p>Hand sanitizer products such as gels and sprays for the prevention of infection were infrequently adopted at the visited events and, where present, were utilized in a less than thorough manner which itself represents a poor form of hygiene management.

Such over-reliance is likely to lead to complacent behavior, infection and re-infection.</p>
