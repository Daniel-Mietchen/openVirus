<p>It is also highly unlikely that any method of hygiene control could be practicably implemented in the context of a pet market. Even if comprehensive disinfectant surgical scrub areas were provided with appropriate guidance on contaminant elimination from hands, then this would not offer a reliable solution. Contaminated areas other than hands would remain, and re-contamination of hands and other areas from clothes, people and the environment would likely rapidly re-occur once the person returned to the generalized areas of the pet market and its multifactorial contamination sources. Contamination of clothes and hair, for instance, would also represent a robust contamination source that would persist even after leaving a market and regardless of any hand cleansing.</p>
