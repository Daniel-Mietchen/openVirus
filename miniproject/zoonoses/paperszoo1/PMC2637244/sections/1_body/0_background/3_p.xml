<p>In addition to the adverse effects previously shown for attenuated RVF vaccines, there are considerable safety concerns regarding viral vaccines based on highly pathogenic organisms due to the risk for exposure or escape of live agents during the manufacturing process. In addition, there is also a risk of insufficient inactivation or emergence of revertants, when large quantities of virulent virus strains are handled. Because of these shortcomings, new RVF vaccine strategies ought to be considered. Genetic immunisation is an attractive alternative, since the antigens are produced by the host cells and the presentation resembles natural infections by intracellular parasites. It is also cost-effective and circumvents the need for elevated biosafety level facilities [
