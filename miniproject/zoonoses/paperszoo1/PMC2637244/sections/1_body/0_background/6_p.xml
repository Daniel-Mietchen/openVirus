<p>In this study we evaluate the induced immune responses and the conferred protection in mice after genetic immunisation with cDNA encoding the structural proteins of RVFV. The elicited immune responses towards the N, G
 <sub>N</sub>, G
 <sub>C </sub>and G
 <sub>N</sub>/G
 <sub>C </sub>proteins after gene-gun immunisation were analysed and the protective abilities of the N and the G
 <sub>N</sub>/G
 <sub>C </sub>construct were tested by virus challenge.
