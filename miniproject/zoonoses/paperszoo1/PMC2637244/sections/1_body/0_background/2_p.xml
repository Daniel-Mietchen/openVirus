<p>Despite the fact that RVF is an important viral zoonosis, and the risk for emergence in new susceptible areas has been emphasized [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], effective and safe vaccines are not commercially available. However, formalin inactivated vaccines have been developed for human use, but the distribution is limited to high-risk occupation staff [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Currently there are a few vaccines available for use in livestock: vaccines based on the live-attenuated Smithburn strain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and formalin inactivated virus preparations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The Smithburn virus vaccine is suggested to induce lifelong protection, but has retained the ability to induce abortions and teratogenic effects in livestock [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The inactivated virus vaccines are safe, but less immunogenic and require annual booster vaccinations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Previously, two vaccine candidates have been proposed and tested for their safety and efficacy in animal trials: a naturally attenuated RVFV isolate from a benign human case in the Central African Republic, Clone 13 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and a human virus isolate of RVFV attenuated in cell culture by 5-fluorouracil treatment, MP12 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Although Clone 13 and MP12 were shown to be safe and immunogenic in mice and in cattle and sheep, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the MP12 vaccine was found teratogenic for pregnant sheep if used during the first trimester [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].
