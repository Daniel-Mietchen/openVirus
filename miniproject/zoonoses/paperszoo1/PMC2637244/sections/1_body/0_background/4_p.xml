<p>The RVFV is a three segmented negative stranded RNA virus. The (L)arge segment encodes a RNA dependent RNA polymerase and the (M)edium segment encodes two glycoproteins (G
 <sub>N </sub>and G
 <sub>C</sub>), a 78 kDa protein as well as a non-structural protein (NSm). The (S)mall segment encodes a non-structural protein (NSs) and the immunogenic and highly expressed nucleocapsid protein (N) [
