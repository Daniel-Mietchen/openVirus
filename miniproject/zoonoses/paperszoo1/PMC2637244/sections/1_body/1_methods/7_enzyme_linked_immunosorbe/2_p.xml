<p>Western blot was performed using 
 <italic>E. coli </italic>extracts containing the complete N protein or truncated variants thereof (N1, N2, N3, N1/2, N2/3). The separated proteins were transferred to Immobilon TMP transfer membranes (type PVDF, Millipore Co., USA). Membranes containing the antigens were incubated with serum samples from individual mice at dilution 1:600 in parallel with internal controls, either an anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) diluted 1:5000 or a mouse anti-poly-histidine antibody (ZYMED
 <sup>Â® </sup>Laboratories, S. San Francisco, CA) diluted 1:3000. A horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig antibody (DacoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) diluted 1:2000 was used as secondary antibody. The antibody-antigen complexes were visualised with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden). The blotting and incubation procedures have previously been described in detail [
