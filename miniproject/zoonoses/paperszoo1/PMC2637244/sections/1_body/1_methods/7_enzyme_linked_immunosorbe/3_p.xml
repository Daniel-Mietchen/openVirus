<p>For IFA, BHK-21 cells were grown on cover slips and infected with ZH548 at MOI 1, or transfected with cDNA constructs using FuGene™ reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). At 36 h p.i. or 48 h post transfection the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS (for anti-glycoprotein antibody detection) or methanol (for anti-N antibody detection). Labelling was performed with mouse sera diluted 1:200, followed by visualisation with an Alexa Fluor™ 488 (Molecular probes, Invitrogen) secondary antibody at dilution 1:5000. The expression of the antigens was verified using an anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) diluted 1:5000, positive sera from previously infected mice or monoclonal antibodies directed against the G
 <sub>N </sub>and G
 <sub>C </sub>proteins, kindly provided by Dr. George Ludwig (USAMRIID, Fort Detrick, MD) at predetermined dilutions.
