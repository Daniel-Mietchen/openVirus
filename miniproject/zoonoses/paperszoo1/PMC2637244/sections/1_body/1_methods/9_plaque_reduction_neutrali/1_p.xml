<p>Heat-inactivated mouse sera including positive and negative controls, were serially diluted three-fold in PBS and incubated with a virus suspension containing about 30 plaque forming units (PFU) of RVFV. The mixtures were incubated for 90 min at 37°C and thereafter used to infect monolayers of BHK-21 cells in 6-well tissue culture plates (NUNC tissue culture, Nalgene Nunc International). After an adsorption period of 30 min at 37°C, the cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated with cell culture media containing 1% Carboxy-Methyl Cellulose (Aquacide II, Calbiochem
 <sup>®</sup>, Merck, CA) for six days at 37°C/5%CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The cells were subsequently fixed with 10% formaldehyde, washed with water and counter-stained with 1% crystal violet in water containing 20% ethanol and 0.7% NaCl. The PRNT
 <sub>50 </sub>titer was calculated as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that reduced the number of plaques by 50%, as compared to the virus control.
