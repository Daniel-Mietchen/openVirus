The correctness of each cDNA construct was confirmed by sequencing (MWG-Biotech) and the corresponding gene products were verified through transfection of mammalian cells followed by immunofluorescence analysis. A cDNA construct (pcDNA3.1) encoding the N protein (PUU-N) of the Puumala hantavirus (Puumala virus Umeå/hu [GenBank:

Briefly, 50 μg aliquots of the above plasmid DNA preparations were precipitated on 25 mg of 1 μm gold beads and subsequently used to coat the inner wall of Tefzel tubings according to the manufacturer's instructions (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Each gene-gun cartridge delivered approximately 1 μg of DNA.
