<p>DNA constructs expressing the N protein and truncated N derivatives were expressed in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>(
 <italic>E. coli</italic>) BL21 DE3 (Invitrogen). Briefly, transformed bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani media supplemented with 100 Î¼g/ml carbencillin to OD A
 <sub>600 </sub>of 0.7. Expression of the antigens was induced by the addition of isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The purification of the full length N protein expressed from a poly-histidine-fusion vector was performed with metal chelating chromatography using Ni-NTA Agarose (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany), essentially as described previously [
