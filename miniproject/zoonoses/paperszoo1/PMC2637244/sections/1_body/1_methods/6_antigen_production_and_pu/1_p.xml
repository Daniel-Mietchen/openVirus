<p>For antigen production and prokaryotic expression, cDNA encoding the full-length N protein (aa 1–245) of RVFV was ligated into pET-14b (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) and cDNA encoding truncated N derivatives, N1 (aa 1–100), N2 (aa 71–170), N3 (aa 141–245), N1/2 (aa 1–170) and N2/3 (aa 71–245), were inserted into pET101/D-TOPO
 <sup>® </sup>or pET151/D TOPO
 <sup>® </sup>(Invitrogen). The primer sequences are shown in Table
