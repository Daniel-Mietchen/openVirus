<p>The lymphocyte proliferation assay was performed as described earlier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Briefly, spleen cells of five mice vaccinated with cDNA encoding the full length N protein of RVFV were prepared in RPMI 1640 (GIBCO, Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% FCS, 2 mM sodium pyruvat, 2.5 × 10
 <sup>-5 </sup>M β-Mercaptoethanol and 50 μg/ml gentamicin sulphate. After washing the spleen cells three times in cell culture media by centrifugation at 600 × g, the lymphocytes were resuspended to 4 × 10
 <sup>5 </sup>cells/ml. Aliquots (100 μl) of the cells were seeded to 96-wells flat-bottom microplates (Nalgene Nunc International) in cell culture media containing the antigen at different concentrations. After two days incubation at 37°C/5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, 1 μCi of 
 <sup>3</sup>HTdR (5'-
 <sup>3</sup>H Thymidine spec.act 14.4 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) was added. After an additional 16–18 hr of metabolic labelling, the cells were harvested on GF/C filters (Inotech AG, Basle, Switzerland) and analysed for incorporated radioactivity using a liquid scintillation counter (TriCarb 2500 TR, Packard Instruments, Meriden, CT). Spleen cells obtained from four mice immunised with the plasmid vector without insert constituted the negative control. The stimulation index (SI) was calculated as the ratio of radioactivity incorporated into cells from vaccinated mice and the count rate in cells from control mice.
