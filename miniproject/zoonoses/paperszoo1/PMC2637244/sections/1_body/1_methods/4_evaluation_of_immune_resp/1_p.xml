<p>To evaluate and compare the immune responses after vaccination and infection, eight animals were vaccinated with cDNA encoding N, four with cDNA containing the open reading frame of the G
 <sub>N</sub>/G
 <sub>C </sub>poly-protein and two groups, each containing four animals, were immunised with either the G
 <sub>N </sub>or the G
 <sub>C </sub>construct. To analyse the immune responses after infection, one group consisting of nine mice were infected with 2.4 Ã— 10
 <sup>4 </sup>PFU of RVFV. At day 14 p.i. the animals were euthanized and samples collected. As negative controls, four mice were immunised with the pcDNA3.1 vector without insert and another four mice were injected with sterile PBS and kept under the same conditions.
