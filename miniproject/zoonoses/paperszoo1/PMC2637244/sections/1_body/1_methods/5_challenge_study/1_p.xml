<p>A total of 30 mice were used in the challenge study, eight of which were vaccinated with cDNA encoding the RVFV N protein and eight with the G
 <sub>N</sub>/G
 <sub>C </sub>construct. As controls, eight animals were vaccinated with an irrelevant gene (encoding the N protein of the Puumala virus, PUU-N) and six animals with pcDNA 3.1 vectors without insert. After four rounds of immunisations, half of the mice of each vaccination group were challenged with 2.4 × 10
 <sup>3 </sup>and half with 2.4 × 10
 <sup>4 </sup>PFU of RVFV. Blood samples were collected every alternate day until the end of the experiment at day 17 p.i.
