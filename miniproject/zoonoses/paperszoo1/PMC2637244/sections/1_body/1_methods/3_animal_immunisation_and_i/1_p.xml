<p>Female BALB/c mice, six to eight weeks old, were used in this study. Before immunisation the mice were thoroughly shaved on the abdomen and vaccinated with cDNA encoding the antigens using a gene-gun (Helios™, BioRad Laboratories). The cDNA was administrated four times with two to three week intervals. The primary immunisation was performed using four gene-gun cartridges and the following three boosters with two cartridges. Blood samples were collected three, five, seven and nine weeks after the primary immunisation. In order to study the immune responses post infection (p.i.) and the effectiveness of the genetic vaccines, mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with RVFV diluted in sterile PBS to a final volume of 100 μl. Infected animals were kept in micro-isolator cages inside an animal isolator (Bell Isolation Systems Ltd, Livingston, Scotland) and all manipulations involving infected animals or viable virus were performed within a BSL-3 laboratory. During the experimental procedures the animals were monitored daily and were kept with free access to food and water. Mice found in a moribund condition (fatigue and "hunchback-like posture") were instantly euthanized. This project was approved by The Animal Research Ethics Committee of Umeå University, Sweden.</p>
