<p>In this study, antibodies towards the glycoproteins were induced after genetic vaccination, but virus neutralisation was only observed in sera of mice immunised with cDNA containing the G
 <sub>N </sub>gene. This observation is in accordance with earlier findings, where G
 <sub>N </sub>has been shown to possess antigenic determinants important for protection, while G
 <sub>C </sub>does not [

 <sub>C</sub>, as well as in the G
 <sub>N </sub>protein [

 <sub>C </sub>construct alone might be explained by incorrect folding of the expressed antigen, since neutralising antibodies elicited by the glycoproteins are often found to be conformation dependent [
