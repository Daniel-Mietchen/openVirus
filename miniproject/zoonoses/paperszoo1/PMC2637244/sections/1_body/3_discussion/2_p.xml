<p>We have investigated the prospect of employing genetic immunisation against RVF. The DNA vaccine platform has been extensively studied during the last decade. However, the breakthrough has been on halt until recently when the first licensed products became available, such as the vaccine against West Nile virus infection in horses and a vaccine for use in salmon against the hematopoietic necrosis virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The DNA vaccine technology is especially suitable against pathogens such as RVFV, since the need of elevated biosafety facilities are circumvented and the stability of these vaccines allow distribution in developing countries lacking the logistics to maintain a "cold-chain".
