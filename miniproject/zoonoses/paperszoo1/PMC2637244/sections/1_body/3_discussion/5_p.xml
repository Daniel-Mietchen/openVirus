<p>Previous studies of N proteins of Hantaviruses revealed that strong B-cells epitopes are located near the amino-terminus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. However, this does not seem to be the case for RVFV N. Genetic immunisations are in general believed to mimic the natural presentation of antigens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], but interestingly, while the sera of immunised mice recognized the amino-terminal part (aa 1â€“100) of the N-protein, sera of the infected animals did not. The lack of reactivity towards the central (N2) and the C-terminal (N3) parts could either be explained by a distorted conformation of the encoded antigens or disruption of epitope-regions within the N protein.
