<p>After gene-gun vaccination with the N construct, high antibody titers were repeatedly induced along with an antigen induced proliferative cellular response. Interestingly, no clinical signs were observed after challenge in 50% of the animals (compared to 100% in the control group) despite the lack of detectable levels of neutralising antibodies after vaccination. The observed protection might be explained by cell-mediated immune factors as indicated by the dose-dependent proliferation of spleen cells from the immunised animals. Nevertheless, the characteristics of the proliferating cells remain to be investigated further. Analogous results were previously found after vaccination with the purified RVFV N protein when protection was obtained in 60% of the vaccinated mice [
