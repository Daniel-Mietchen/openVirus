<p>RVF is an important emerging zoonotic infection and early efforts to protect animals and humans resulted in development of attenuated and inactivated virus vaccines. Vaccines based on live attenuated RVFV strains have shown to induce long-lasting protection in contrast to inactivated virus vaccines, which require multiple booster doses to retain a protective immunity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Unfortunately, teratogenic effects and the ability to cause abortions limit the likelihood for wide use and distribution of the current vaccines based on attenuated RVFV strains. As the existing vaccines have such shortcomings, efforts to design safer and more efficient RVF vaccines need to be undertaken.
