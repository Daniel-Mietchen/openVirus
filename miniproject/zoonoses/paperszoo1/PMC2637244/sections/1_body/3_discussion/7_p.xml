<p>The RVFV glycoproteins have been used in several protection studies, utilizing different vaccination strategies and animal models. The protective effect varied from no/low to complete protection depending on the administration strategy, antigen and animal model used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In this study, the majority of the G
 <sub>N</sub>/G
 <sub>C </sub>vaccinated mice were protected against RVF. However, the incomplete protection found was unexpected as a similar study, using analogous G
 <sub>N</sub>/G
 <sub>C </sub>constructs (RVFV
 <sub>-NSm</sub>), reported complete protection of mice after challenge [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. On the other hand, intramuscular inoculation of cDNA encoding the G
 <sub>N</sub>/G
 <sub>C </sub>polyprotein did not induce neutralising antibodies and did not protect against RVFV challenge [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Interestingly, a recent study reported that dual expression of the N and the G
 <sub>N</sub>/G
 <sub>C </sub>proteins may generate RVF Virus-Like Particles (VLPs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], and the formation of VLPs after genetic immunisation is hypothesised to be the reason for the high virus neutralising antibody titers induced by the genetic West Nile virus vaccine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Perhaps, by using a similar approach, and introducing cDNA encoding the N and the G
 <sub>N</sub>/G
 <sub>C </sub>proteins of RVFV, a fully protective immune response might be induced.
