<p>In this study, the immune responses in mice after genetic immunisation with RVFV cDNA encoding the N protein, the glycopolyprotein G
 <sub>N</sub>/G
 <sub>C</sub>, and the separate G
 <sub>C </sub>and G
 <sub>N </sub>proteins were analysed. The N and the G
 <sub>N</sub>/G
 <sub>C </sub>constructs displayed the most promising results regarding the elicited immune response and were evaluated further for the ability to confer protection in a subsequent challenge study.
