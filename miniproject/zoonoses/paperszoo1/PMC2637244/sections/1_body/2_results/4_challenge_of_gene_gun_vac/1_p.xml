<p>To evaluate the degree of protection against RVFV infection after gene-gun vaccination, a new batch of mice was divided into groups of eight and immunised with either cDNA encoding the N or the G
 <sub>N</sub>/G
 <sub>C </sub>proteins. Two control groups, eight mice immunised with the PUU-N construct and six mice immunised with vectors without insert were also included. The groups were further divided into two subgroups and challenged with 2.4 × 10
 <sup>3 </sup>or 2.4 × 10
 <sup>4 </sup>PFU of RVFV (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). As the lethality of the ZH548 strain was found low for the 15 to 17 weeks old BALB/c mice, the protection conferred by vaccination was also based on development of clinical signs and increase in N specific antibody titers (the latter was only applied for G
 <sub>N</sub>/G
 <sub>C </sub>vaccinated mice) upon challenge. In the G
 <sub>N</sub>/G
 <sub>C </sub>vaccination group, all mice responded to the vaccination and sero-converted, while only five out of eight mice developed virus neutralising titers ranging from 25 to 75 (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Mice vaccinated with the N construct induced a strong antibody response, with ELISA titers ranging from 2.5 × 10
 <sup>4 </sup>to 4.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>, after four immunisations (data not shown).
