<p>Since differences in clinical signs could not be ascribed to the different challenge doses, the two subgroups within each vaccine group were consolidated and evaluated together. In the groups of mice immunised with the N or the G
 <sub>N</sub>/G
 <sub>C </sub>constructs, four of eight and five of eight animals, respectively, displayed no clinical signs during the entire experiment (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Despite the large proportion of animals without RVF clinical signs in the G
 <sub>N</sub>/G
 <sub>C </sub>vaccination group, extensive viral replication after infection was indicated by high N specific antibody titers, similar to the titers observed for the control animals (data not shown). Apart from one casualty, due to a moribund condition, in the N vaccinated group, no major differences in the severity of the clinical manifestations were observed between the G
 <sub>N</sub>/G
 <sub>C </sub>and N vaccinated mice after challenge. In contrast, all animals in the two control groups displayed either clinical signs of infection followed by complete recovery (12/14) or were sacrificed due to a moribund condition (2/14) (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Significant protection against RVF clinical signs was observed among the N vaccinated mice (

 <sub>N</sub>/G
 <sub>C </sub>vaccinated mice (
