<p>All mice sero-converted after immunisation with cDNA encoding the G
 <sub>N</sub>/G
 <sub>C </sub>proteins or the G
 <sub>N </sub>protein but only two out of four after vaccination with cDNA encoding the G
 <sub>C </sub>protein, as detected by IFA performed on infected cells. The virus neutralising antibody titers after G
 <sub>C </sub>and G
 <sub>N </sub>vaccination were in the lower range, less than 25 and between 25 to 75, respectively. However, the G
 <sub>N</sub>/G
 <sub>C </sub>vaccinated mice acquired considerably higher titers, up to 225 (data not shown). These results indicate that vaccination with the G
 <sub>N</sub>/G
 <sub>C </sub>construct resulted in higher virus neutralising antibody titers than the use of cDNA encoding for the individual glycoproteins.
