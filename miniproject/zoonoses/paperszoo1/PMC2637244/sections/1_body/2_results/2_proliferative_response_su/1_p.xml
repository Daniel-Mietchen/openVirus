<p>Spleen cells from vaccinated mice were assayed to address the question if genetic immunisation induces antigen dependent cell proliferation. The obtained results indicate that lymphocytes from five animals immunised with the N construct displayed antigen induced proliferation when up to 1 μg/ml of the purified and Triton X-114 extracted N protein was added (Fig 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). However, higher concentrations of the antigen (5–10 μg/ml) resulted in cell toxicity and cell death. The stimulation index (SI) was determined at between 4 and 6 when spleen cells were stimulated with 1 μg/ml of the purified N antigen (Fig 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Background levels, independent of the antigen concentration, were observed in lymphocytes from control mice. Incorporated radioactivity in spleen cells stimulated by 0.5–1 μg of ConA was approximately 10–20 times higher that of the negative controls and 4–5 times higher than any cell sample collected from immunised mice.
