<p>Since previous studies have shown that strong antigenic determinants are located near the amino-terminus of the N protein of other viruses in the 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae </italic>family [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], antigenic regions of the RVFV N protein were investigated in more detail. Serum samples from seven mice immunised with cDNA encoding the complete N protein and nine from infected mice were analysed and compared by Western blot for reactivity towards the N protein and truncated N proteins (Fig 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). A strong and uniform reactivity profile towards the full-length protein was found in all animals and most sera displayed a similar but weaker reactivity towards the truncated N1/2 and N2/3 proteins. Surprisingly, the amino-terminus (N1 protein) was only recognised by sera from immunised mice and not by any serum obtained from infected mice. Furthermore, the central part (N2) and the carboxy-terminus (N3) were neither recognised by sera from infected nor immunised mice (Fig 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).
