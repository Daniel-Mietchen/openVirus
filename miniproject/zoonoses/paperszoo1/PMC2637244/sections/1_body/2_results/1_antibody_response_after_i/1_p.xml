<p>Genetic vaccination with cDNA encoding the N protein resulted in a strong humoral immune response in all mice. Anti-N specific antibodies (total Ig) were detected by ELISA already after the first immunisation and were followed by a large increase in titers after additional vaccination rounds (Fig
