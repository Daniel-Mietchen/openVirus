   <bold>Western blot reactivity towards the N protein and truncated variants thereof</bold>. (A) Schematic presentation of the full length and deleted variants of the RVFV N antigens. Different filter strips represent different recombinant proteins. The sera were obtained from (B) seven mice vaccinated with cDNA encoding the complete N protein or (C) nine mice infected with RVFV. The sera were collected after four immunisations or 14 days p.i., respectively. Antibodies binding to the amino- or carboxy-terminal His-tag or V5-tag of the recombinant proteins were used as positive controls (Ctrl).
