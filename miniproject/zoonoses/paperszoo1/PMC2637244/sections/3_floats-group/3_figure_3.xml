   <bold>Lymphocyte proliferation test performed on spleen cells from mice vaccinated with cDNA encoding the N protein</bold>. The curves correspond to the incorporated radioactivity measured for cells of five immunised mice and the dotted curves represent four control mice immunised with the vector without insert. The error bars represent the standard deviation between replicates. The spleen cells were stimulated for proliferation using the indicated N antigen concentrations (0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 Î¼g/ml).
