<p>Most of the genetic variability of HTLV-1 is represented in Africa, where the virus was originated 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Verdonck1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Mozambique is located on the southeast region of the continent, and the presence of HTLV-1 has also been reported in countries that share borders with Mozambique 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Proietti1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The characterization of HTLV-1 Transcontinental subgroup as the prevalent subgroup driving the HTLV epidemics in Mozambique, and South Africa 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Mota1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> shows that there are, at least, two major endemic lineages of Cosmopolitan HTLV-1 in Africa. One, dominating the Northwestern part of the continent, driven by HTLV-1aD trans-Saharan lineage, as proposed by Zehender 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Zehender1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and a second lineage in Southern countries, determined by Transcontinental HTLV-1 subgroup.
