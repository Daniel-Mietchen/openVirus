<p>The genetic relationship of HTLV-1 Transcontinental subgroup strains from South Africa and Mozambique suggests a common origin of HTLV-1 in both countries, probably due to their common peopling and migration patterns and their intense commercial/migratory linkage and vicinity. It was interesting to find a cluster joining Mozambique, Middle East and India strains that can also be explained by a noticeable Indian population in Maputo city due to the Indians people migration started in the 19
 <sup>th</sup> century as well as, consequence of the migratory movements between India and Austral Africa (1860)

In fact, the reproduction of Mozambican mtDNA haplogroup pattern on the HTLV-1 cohort analyzed in this study, may explain the particularities of HTLV-1 infection in the country. Mozambican mtDNA haplogroup pattern have components from North and South, with a high frequency of moderns haplogroups (L2), haplogroups implicated in Bantu expansion (L1a and L3), but also the ancient haplogroup L1d, characteristic of the extinct Khoisan-speaking ethnic group

 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Salas1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, is present. Due to the diversity of mtDNA haplogroup composite, we could speculate that both ancient and recent introductions of HTLV-1 infection are responsible for the current picture, modulates by breastfeeding and sexual/injecting drug transmission ways, respectively. Of concern, the significant rate of HTLV-1a/HIV-1subtype C co-infection, particularly in the MZ cluster, demonstrates the dynamic of the two viruses. In fact, the HIV-1/HTLV-1 co-infection posses a great challenge in AIDS follow up tests such as CD4 enumeration related to the prognosis
