<p>The sub-Saharan Africa is considered to be endemic for HTLV-1 infection, with overall seroprevalence rates in Western and Central African countries being similar to the ones observed in Eastern and Southern African countries

 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Engelbrecht1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, there is no information on the clinical impact of HTLV-1 in African population. The risk of HTLV-I-associated diseases among carriers differs substantially across geographic areas and according to other population characteristics. ATL is reported to be prevalent among individuals in Japan, while Brazilian patients tend to present the HAM/TSP disease, and in Jamaica these two HTLV-1 related illness are quite frequent, suggesting that particular genetic backgrounds may play a role in the disease development
