<p>The HSV-I mtDNA haplogroup analysis from HTLV-1 infected individuals revealed that all the Mozambican sequences belong to African sub-Saharan haplogroups. It was not possible to establish a correlation between HTLV-1 lineages and a specific ethnics group, since diverse mtDNA haplotypes were observed in the three HTLV-1LTR clusters. All African sub-haplogroups detected in this study (L1a, L1c, L1d, L2a, L3d and L3e) were reported as the major frequencies in Mozambique

 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Gastaldello1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In fact, sub-haplogroups L2a and L1a were detected at the highest frequencies (36% and 28%, respectively), as reported in previous studies of Mozambican population. An mtDNA analysis of 109 unrelated individuals, corresponding to 30 ethnic groups, showed the L2a and L1a sub-haplogroups with the highest frequencies of 47% and 16%, respectively

A larger analysis, using 307 samples from 16 different population groups from Mozambique and boundary areas, also revealed the same haplogroups distribution, with L1a and L2a (28% and 27%, respectively) as the major sub-haplogroups, differently from other geographical regions in Africa 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Salas1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Haplogrup composition and their frequencies are characteristic of main African regions. In South Africa, there is a predominance of mtDNA haplogroup L1d/k, but L2a and L1a are in low frequencies. Central and West Africa, also present high frequencies of haplotypes [L1c and L2* (L2 other than L2a1), respectively], which in Mozambique is less representative 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Salas1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Therefore, we can conclude that the Mozambican HTLV-1 cohort considered in our study is representative of the country population.
