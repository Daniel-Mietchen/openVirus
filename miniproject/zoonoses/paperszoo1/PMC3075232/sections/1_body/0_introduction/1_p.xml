<p>Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 was the first oncogenic human retrovirus to be identified in 1980 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Poiesz1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> In 1982, the second type, HTLV-2, was discovered 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Kalyanaraman1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. These two human viruses originated independently through zoonotic infections from lineages of simian T-lymphotropic virus (STLV-1 and STLV-2). These inter-species transmission events have been occurring in Africa up to recent times

 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Calattini1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, reported the discovery of the third and fourth HTLV types (HTLV type 3 and 4) in asymptomatic Cameroonese hunters. Some studies had revealed Western blot profiles compatible with HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 in those individuals suggesting an appreciable cross-reaction between these viruses
