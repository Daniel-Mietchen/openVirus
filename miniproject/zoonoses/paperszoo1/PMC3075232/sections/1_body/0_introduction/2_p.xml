<p>HTLV-1 has a remarkable genetic stability when compared with other retroviruses such as HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). However, based on the nucleotide diversity of its LTR region, HTLV-1 can be grouped in 6 major genetic subtypes (a–f), most of them linked to some geographic regions

 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Salemi2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> All subtypes are present in Africa with different prevalences, except for HTLV-1c that has, so far, only been identified in Melanesia 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Cassar1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The genetic lineages of HTLV-1a subtype, also known as Cosmopolitan group, are found all over the world. This group can be further divided in distinct sub-groups, which are characteristics of geographical localization of HTLV-1 infections. The HTLV-1a Cosmopolitan subgroups identified as driving the HTLV infection in Africa were HTLV-1aD or North African subgroup, which is prevalent in Senegal, Guinea Bissau, Morocco, and the transcontinental subgroup in South Africa 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Zehender1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. HTLV-1 is the etiological agent of Adult T-Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATL) and Tropical Spastic Paraparesis/HTLV-1-associated Myelopathy (TSP/HAM). Efforts to disrupt its transmission have been taken in some countries, including the screening of blood donors for the presence of HTLV antibodies.
