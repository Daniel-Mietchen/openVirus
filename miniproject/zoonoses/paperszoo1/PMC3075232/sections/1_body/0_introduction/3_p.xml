<p>HTLV screenings performed in many African countries have been limited to sero-epidemiological surveys studies using ELISA and Western Blot criteria for HTLV typing

 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Etenna1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Recently, the epidemiology of this virus was addressed in donors attending the blood bank of the Maputo city showing rates from 0.9 to 1.2%

 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Gudo1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Additionally, a study conducted in 1999 showed that four TSP/HTLV patients from Mozambique were infected with Cosmopolitan HTLV-1 subtype A 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Engelbrecht1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. It has recently been shown that the prevalence of HTLV among HIV-infected patients in Mozambique is 4.5%, much higher than in blood donors 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Bhatt1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Mozambique is one of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa with the highest HIV prevalence rates in adult population. The HIV seroprevalence among pregnant women in Mozambique rise in the proportion of infected women of 14.0% in 2002, 17.8% in 2003, 16.5% in 2004, and 20.2% in 2005 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Melo1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In another serosurvey performed in 2007, a prevalence of HIV infection around 18% was found in women attending antenatal services 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. HIV-1 subtype C is the major variant of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the country 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Abreu1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However, the status of HIV and HTLV co-infections in Mozambique is still poorly documented, as well as, the subtypes/subgroups of these viruses.
