<p>High molecular weight DNA was extracted from whole-blood samples of all 25 subjects using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini kit (Qiagen). The PCR for HTLV typing was carried out as described 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Vandamme1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The HTLV-1 subtyping was performed with amplification of 672 bp fragment from the LTR region under conditions published previously 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Gastaldello1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> using 
 <italic>Pfu</italic> DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Human mitocondrial (mt) DNA hypervariable segment I (HVS-I) (302 bp) was accessed by PCR using conditions formerly described 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-AlvesSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The amplicons were separated on a 2% agarose gel and visualized under UV light after ethidium bromide staining. PCR products corresponding to HTLV-1 LTR and mtDNA HVS-I regions were purified using QIAamp PCR purification kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amplicons were directly sequenced on both strands using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit, with a 3730 Automated DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA) and the bioinformatics pipeline Chromapipe
