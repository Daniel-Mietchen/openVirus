<p>LTR sequences were editing and alignment using BioEdit v5.0.9. (Department of Microbiology, North Carolina State University, USA) and Clustal W programs, respectively. Neighbor-joining (NJ) tree was build by PAUP* software version 4.0b10 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Swofford1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The HKY model with gamma distribution was selected using the Modeltest 3.7 software 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Posada1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The NJ tree was evaluated by bootstrap analysis of 1000 replicates. The mean genetic distance among the Mozambican HTLV-1 clusters were determined using nucleotide p-distance model and standard error estimated by a bootstrap procedures (1000 replicates) on Mega4 software 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Tamura1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Mozambican HTLV-1 sequences are available at GeneBank (accession number GU194504-GU194528).
