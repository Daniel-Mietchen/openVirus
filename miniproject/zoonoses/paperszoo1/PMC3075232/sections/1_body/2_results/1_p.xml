<p>The results of screening for anti-HTLV-1+2 antibodies and confirmed by a Western blot assay (HTLV BLOT 2.4, Genelabs Diagnostics, Switzerland) are in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001038-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Most of blood donors with reactivity to antigens encoded by the 
 <italic>gag</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic> genes were considered as infected by HTLV, according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Two samples were negative to p53 band and one to P19. All HTLV positive samples in our study population were reactive to rgp46-HTLV-I and typed as solely infected with HTLV-1 by Western blot with no reaction to recombinant rgp46-HTLV-II.
