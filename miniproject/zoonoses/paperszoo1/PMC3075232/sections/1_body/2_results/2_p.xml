<p>The genetic analysis of 25 Mozambican LTR sequences, using 32 reference sequences representing all HTLV-1 subtypes and sub-groups, as well as African HTLV-1 sequences, clearly demonstrated that all isolates belong to the Transcontinental subgroup of the Cosmopolitan subtype (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001038-g002">Figure 2</xref>). These new sequences from Mozambique showed an inter-strain genetic distance ranging from 0.0 to 3.4% with an overall mean distance of 1.6% and standard error (SE) estimated of 0.3. This variability is reflected in the grouping of Mozambican LTR sequences in three major clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001038-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Thirteen from 25 Mozambican (MZ) sequences are close together with sequences from South Africa (SA) forming a consistent branch, supported by a bootstrap value of 71%. This cluster, named MZ/SA, has an inter-strain genetic distance of 0.0–2.1% (01.1%; SE = 0.2) and is characterized by the polymorphism C386T (ATK reference sequence). Four sequences with inter-strain genetic distance ranging from 1.0–2.1%, mean diversity of 1.4% (SE = 0.3) are related with the sequence HE (GenBank S76263) from Israel, which belongs to Middle East cluster as showed by Ohkura and others, 1999. Another genetic analysis including more HTLV-1 sequences from this geographical region, based on 490 pb, showed that those 4 Mozambican sequences forming a monophyletic group with sequences from Middle East (ME): KUW3, SAS, IRN4, Abl and India: AP15, TNA (data not shown). The cluster named MZ/ME, is supported by a bootstrap value of 76% and sequences are characterized by a 6 nt deletion between 182–186 nt positions and present the substitutions A240G and A575C. Of note, 6 Mozambican distinct sequences (16 MZ, 217 MZ, 526 MZ, 1180 MZ, 284 MZ, 541 MZ) with mean genetic distance of 0.8% (0.0–01.8%; SE = 0.2) determined the MZ cluster with a high bootstrap support of 89% and characterized by three nucleotide changes: C365T, T573C, and C574T. Some of these HTLV infected individuals (11/25 = 44.0%) were HIV-1 co-infected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001038-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In fact, the HIV-1 subtype found in all HTLV co-infected individuals, the HIV-1 subtype C, is the major HIV subtype circulating in Maputo, as shown by Abreu et al., 2008 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001038-Abreu1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. A slight correlation of HIV/HTLV co-infection with cluster MZ could be observed (5/6 = 83.3%). MZ/ME and MZ/SA clusters have HIV/HTLV co-infection frequencies of 25.0% and 45.4%, respectively (
