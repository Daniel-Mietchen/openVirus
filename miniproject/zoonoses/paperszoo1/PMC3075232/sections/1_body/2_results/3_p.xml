<p>In order to check the representativeness of this sampling in relation to Mozambican population, mtDNA haplogroup analysis was conducted. This analysis, based on HSV-I sequence motifs, revealed that all those Mozambican individuals belong to African macrohaplogroup L, including the sub-haplogroups L1a, L1c, L1d, L2a, L3d and L3e. The African haplotypes were detected at different frequencies of L1a (28%), L1c (8%), L1d (12%), L2a (36%), L3d (12%), L3e (4%) and indistinctly distributed within the 3 HTLV-1 LTR clusters described above.</p>
