  <title>Genetic Analysis of Mozambican HTLV-1 LTR strains.</title>
  <p>HTLV-1 LTR (630 bp) genetic tree of 25 Mozambican isolates with HTLV-1 references and worldwide sequences were constructed using Neighbor Joining method based on HKY model and Î³-distribution. Bootstrap values were calculated by the analysis of 1000 replicates. Only bootstraps values &gt;50 are shown. HTLV strains from this study are in boxes and HIV-1 co-infected samples have a black losange. HTLV-1a sub-clusters are in a circle.</p>
