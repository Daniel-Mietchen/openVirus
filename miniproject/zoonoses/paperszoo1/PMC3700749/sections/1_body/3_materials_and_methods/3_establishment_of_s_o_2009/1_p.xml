<p>Weaned piglets (8–10 kg) and guinea pigs (250–300 g) seronegative for S-O 2009 IV were purchased from the Shandong Taibang Biological Product Co., Ltd. And used for experimental infections. All prevailing local, national and international regulations and conventions, and normal scientific ethical practices have been respected in this study. Two positive- and negative-pressure isolators A and B (Model C.C.JH-1; Tianjin Jinhang Purified Air Conditioning Engineering Company, China) were connected using a closed tube 2 m in length and 8 cm in diameter, to adjust air flow from A to B, which not only prevented direct contact of animals in the aerosol infection group with those in the inoculation group, but also prevented the propagation of droplets (Figure

 <sup>6</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU) of viruses were placed in isolator A, and were designated inoculation group. After 24 h, another three pigs or five guinea pigs were placed into isolator A, and were designated direct contact group. Three pigs or five guinea pigs were placed into isolator B, and were designated aerosol infection group [

Pig and guinea pig experiments were conducted independently and repeated. “The Society for Animal Health Feedings &amp; Animal Welfare of Shandong Province approved the study of “Airbone spread and infection of a novel swine-origin influenza A(H1N1) virus” and agreed to exam the serum samples from 200 pigs and 23 pig farm staff for the experiments of that.
