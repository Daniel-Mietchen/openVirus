<p>After sequencing and analysis of eight fragments from several virulent strains, three strains were identified as the S-O 2009 IV and one of them was used for the aerosol dissemination experiment. Virus shedding and serum antibodies of nasal secretions in experimental animals were monitored and detected to verify if the experimental animals were infected. Nasal secretions from each animal were collected every other day after virus inoculation and after RNA extraction, virus nucleic acids were detected by RT-qPCR [
