<p>After inoculation, the AGI-30 air collection device was used to collect air samples in isolators A and B on each day [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and the virus content in samples was detected using RT-qPCR. To determine the proportion and distribution of aerosol particles of different sizes, at 4 dpi of the second round of the guinea pig model experiments, the Andersen-8-level collector [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] was used to collect aerosolized viral particles in isolators A and B, using a sterile1% gelatin glycerol (1% gelatin PBS and glycerol 1:1 mixed) as the medium, at 28.3 L/min flow velocity for 40 min, and the virus content of every level was detected by RT-qPCR.
