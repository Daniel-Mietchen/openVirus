<p>During the experimental infections in pigs, S-O 2009 IV was detected at 1–2 dpi in isolators A and B, and the maximum amount of virus detected in A and B were and 4.40-4.87 log
 <sub>10</sub>copies/m3 air and 3.27-3.62 log10copies/m3 air, at 4 and 5 dpi, respectively. However, during the two rounds of experiments, the amounts of virus detected were consistently lower in B than in A and virus was not detectable at 12–13 dpi in A and at 10–11 dpi in B. The duration of detectable S-O 2009 IV aerosols in isolator B was shorter and the amounts of virus were lower than those in isolator A, which was likely related with the deposition, survival time, and removal of aerosol particles.
