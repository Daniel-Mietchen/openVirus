<p>Our data indicated that infected pigs located in upwind farms can generate viruses in nasal and respiratory secretions and spread via the wind to downwind farms. Thus, this type of transmission is dependent on weather, where changes in wind force, wind direction, ultraviolet light, temperature or humidity are all likely to affect transmission.</p>
