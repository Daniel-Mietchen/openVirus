<p>During the experiments, pigs and guinea pigs were housed in positive- and negative-pressure isolators, effectively avoiding the contamination with exogenous microbes. Aerosol transmission experiments were conducted so that the air in isolator B came exclusively from isolator A, which were connected using a 2 m closed tube. Therefore, any infection in isolator B would be determined as aerosols (FigureÂ
