<p>Since early January 2011, the S-O 2009 IV epidemic was first identified in two pig farms of eastern China that quickly spread to nearly 20 farms within a week. A geographical analysis of these pig farms showed that these farms were distributed in a close ellipsoid zone with a central axis in line with prevailing northwesterly winds. A collection of 157 air samples from 40 pig farms revealed that 26.1% contained virus with almost 50% of pig farms in the area affected. This transmission was presumed to be via downwind dissemination of S-O 2009 IV aerosols. It appears that the virus was spread by airborne transmission and our findings in experimental models support this.</p>
