<p>The aerodynamic diameter ranges of aerosols in isolator A were determined to be 3.3-4.7 μm and 5.8-9.0 μm; however, in isolator B particle size was typically 1.1-2.1 μm. The loss of large particle droplets was mainly due to sedimentation, and the loss of aerosol particles &lt;5μm was mainly due to the inactivation of virus particles and ventilation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], indicating that smaller particles gathered in isolator B under the effect of ventilation. In the two isolators, particles were typically ≤ 4.7 μm, showing that a higher proportion of viral aerosols can enter the lower respiratory tract via the nasal cavity, whereas particles ≤1 μm can enter bronchioles and alveoli, and deposit in the alveoli, increasing the risk of serious infection. Gustin et al. [

During the flu season, the less than 4 μm (aerodynamic diameter) influenza viral aerosol particles accounted for 53% of the airborne influenza viral count in hospital environments [
