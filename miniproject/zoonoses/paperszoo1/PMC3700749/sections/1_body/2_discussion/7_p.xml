<p>At 4 and 5 dpi, the virus content in air samples reached its peak in the isolator along with the amount of virus in nasal secretions and the number of pigs infected in different groups. These data indicated that the amount of virus contained in aerosols is related to the virus shedding capacity and number of infected animals. Until 11â€“13 dpi, no airborne S-O 2009 IV was detected in the two isolators. Correspondingly, animals in all the experimental groups no longer shed virus. These results suggest that the viruses produced in nasal secretions by animals formed aerosols.</p>
