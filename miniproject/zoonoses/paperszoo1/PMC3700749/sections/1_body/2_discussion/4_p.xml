<p>There is a 2m pipe between the two isolators (upper distal end, 5.3m from the challenged group; FigureÂ  
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>); therefore, infection in isolator B occurred not via droplet but by aerosolized virus particles. Meanwhile the certain wind velocity in the pipe can well simulate natural wind between different pig farms, even between different pig houses in the same farm. Additionally, aerosol infection group and direct contact group were both serologically positive and nasal secretions had evidence of virus shedding. Nonetheless, the number of infections in aerosol infection group was smaller than in direct contact group, there was no difference in the extent of virus shedding and serum titers of infected pigs. These data demonstrated that infection with these viral strains can induce airborne infection.
