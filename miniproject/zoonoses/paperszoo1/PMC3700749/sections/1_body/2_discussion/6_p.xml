<p>Since the respiratory tract of guinea pigs is very similar to that of humans, guinea pigs were regarded as an appropriate mammalian model for use in this study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In the two repeated trials on guinea pigs, the rates of virus detection and seroconversion to the S-O 2009 IV in aerosol infection group were 2/5 and 3/5 (TableÂ  
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), indicating that aerosol infection group was infected by viral aerosols in isolator A and the virus had the capability of airborne transmission among mammals. Therefore, it can be inferred that S-O 2009 IV is likely to be a health risk for farm staff and may be an important point for the prevention and control of new zoonoses, especially swine influenza viruses. It has been reported that the S-O 2009 IV is still persistent among pigs in China and thus remains a major threat to human health [
