<p>In early January 2011, a local animal disease prevention and control center in Shandong, China reported that a pig farm in eastern China emerged the suspected novel S-O 2009 IV disease. More importantly, similar infections occurred successively in some downwind pig farms within a week, and workers of these pig farms developed flu-like symptoms. Isolation and identification of pathogens confirmed S-O 2009 IV infection. Thus, we speculated that airborne transmission played an important role in the spread of this epidemic. Here, we collected indoor air, pig nasopharyngeal swabs, and blood samples to analyze the positive rate of the S-O 2009 IV; and based on both pig and guinea pig aerosol infection models, airborne infection capacity of S-O 2009 IV isolate was evaluated.</p>
