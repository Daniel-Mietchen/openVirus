<p>For the guinea pig experimental infection model, the results of the two rounds of experiments indicated that virus shedding was detected at 1 dpi of the challenged group; S-O 2009 IV aerosols were detected at 1 and 2 dpi, peaked at 4 and 5 dpi (in isolator A and in isolator B) and disappeared at 11–13 dpi. In the two rounds of guinea pig infection model experiments, S-O 2009 IV aerosols were detected at 1 dpi in isolator A, peaked at 4 and 5 dpi (3.93, 3.80 log
 <sub>10</sub>copies/m
 <sup>3</sup> air), and was absent from 12–13 dpi. In isolator B, SO 2009 IV aerosols were detected at post-inoculation 2 and 3 days, peaked at 5 dpi (3.47, 3.49 log
 <sub>10</sub>copies/m
 <sup>3</sup> air), and was absent at 11 or 12 dpi (Figure
