<p>In the guinea pig infection model experiments, viruses were detected in nasal secretions from four guinea pigs in the first round of experiments and three guinea pigs in the second round in the direct contact group. In the aerosol infection group, viruses were detected in nasal secretions from two guinea pigs for the first round of experiments and three guinea pigs for the second round. Serum titers of animals in the direct contact group and aerosol infection group were 320–1280 and 320–1280, respectively (Table
