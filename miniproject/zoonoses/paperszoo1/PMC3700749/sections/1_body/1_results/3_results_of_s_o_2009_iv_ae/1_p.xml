<p>All experimental pigs and guinea pigs in the challenged groups were shown to shed viruses and seroconverted to S-O 2009 IV. In the swine infection model experiments, viruses were detected in the direct contact groups from nasal secretions of three pigs during the first round of experiment and two pigs during the second round. In the aerosol infection group, two pigs were positive during the first round of experiments and one positive during the second round. Pigs with virus detected in nasal secretions were also positive by serological testing. Serum titers of the direct contact group and aerosol infection group were 320–1280 and 640–1280, respectively (Table
