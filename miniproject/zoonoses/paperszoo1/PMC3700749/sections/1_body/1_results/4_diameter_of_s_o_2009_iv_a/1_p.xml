<p>In isolator A, the distribution ratio of viral aerosol particle sizes was highest for a particle diameter of 3.3-4.7 μm (40.95%), and lowest for 0.65-1.1 μm (0.30%). In isolator B, the distribution ratio of viral aerosol particle sizes was highest for particle diameters of 1.1-2.1 μm (41.45%), and lowest for 5.8-9.0 μm (2.28%) (Figure
