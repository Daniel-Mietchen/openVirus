<p>As other receptors for inflammatory chemokines, CCR5 contribute to leukocyte recruitment in a number of inflammatory diseases (reviewed in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B195">195</xref>]). However, owing to the redundancy of the chemokine system, CCR5 could only play a modest role, and blocking CCR5 was predicted to be safe because individuals lacking CCR5 develop normally and seem healthy. Nevertheless, over the years, the CCR5-Δ32 allele has been linked, using epidemiologic studies, with several non infectious human diseases, including multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B196">196</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B198">198</xref>] but the associations have generally been weak or inconsistent between these studies. In another hand, in mouse models of infection, CCR5 has been implicated in host defense against Influenza A virus, 
 <italic>Listeria, Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, 
 <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, 
 <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans </italic>and 
 <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis </italic>[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B199">199</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B205">205</xref>]. In humans, similarly to HIV-1, 
 <italic>CCR5-Δ32 </italic>carriers also have a decreased likelihood of contracting hepatitis B virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B206">206</xref>], but these carriers improved outcomes during hepatitis C virus infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B207">207</xref>] and tick-borne encephalitis virus infections (TBEV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B208">208</xref>]. Moreover, it has been reported that 
 <italic>CCR5-Δ32 </italic>homozygosis was strongly associated with symptomatic West Nile virus (WNV) infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B209">209</xref>], consistent with a previous finding that CCR5 was a crucial antiviral and survival factor in WNV infection in mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B210">210</xref>]. WNV and TBEV are members of the same family (Flaviviridae) and share certain similarities between them. Interestingly, like most of the infectious agents, flavivirus and influenza viruses are endemic in several tropical and subtropical regions and probably CCR5 is implicated in the defense against several other tropical viruses; this could perhaps explain why the 
 <italic>CCR5-Δ32 </italic>allele frequency is relatively weak in these areas, even if this or another null mutation has arisen, they could be rapidly under selected. If our hypothesis is correct, this could explain the quasi-null allele frequency in Australia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B211">211</xref>], in spite that the Aborigines have not been in contact with felids during approximately 50,000 years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B212">212</xref>]. In the context of infectious diseases, CCR5 comprises positive and negative elements that ultimately contribute to the evolution of the gene over time. In flavivirus infections and putatively ancient cat zoonosis pathogenesis, CCR5 is antimicrobial, whereas in HIV pathogenesis, CCR5 is promicrobial.
