<p>Previous analyses suggested that in Europe the 
 <italic>CCR5-Δ32 </italic>allele frequency is negatively correlated with colonization by ancient Mediterranean civilizations principally Romans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. We have the hypothesis that a zoonosis could have played a role in the decrease of the mutation frequency or in the absence of maintenance of the null allele if it would have appeared. As the cat spread throughout Europe is principally due to Romans, a cat zoonosis could be involved. Interestingly, to the exclusion of Oceania, in the countries in which FIV infected felids are found, the lower 
 <italic>CCR5-Δ32 </italic>allele frequency is found in native human populations. Further bibliographic analyses are needed in order to know if FIV could infect human and also if the 
 <italic>CCR5-Δ32 </italic>mutation can be unfavourable.
