<p>In addition, the analysis of the DNA of ancient micro-organisms in archaeological and palaeontological human and animals remains can contribute to the understanding of issues as different as the spreading of a new disease. The molecular resolution of extinct species' genomes raises the hope of discovering infectious agents and pathogens that might have played a regulatory role in historic ecosystems. Potentials, and sometimes pitfalls, of this research field are illustrated by the results of the various research works performed on ancient DNA. For example, DNA of bacteria of the genus

Cumulative research on felid natural history, evolution, phylogeography and ancient DNA analyses will provide important context for FIV emergence. Ancient DNAs from felids are useful not only to phylogenetic analysis but also to population genetic approaches that may increase our understanding of the incipient extinction of modern species [
