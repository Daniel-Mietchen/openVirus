<p>Future studies on ancient DNA will confirm or reject our hypothesis which include a great 
 <italic>CCR5-Δ32 </italic>allele frequency in the ancient European population, followed by a progressively decrease of the frequency southwards due indirectly to Romans and other colonizers which have helped spread a possible cat zoonosis to native populations. These future analyses could also give data for characterisation of ancient European pathocenosis compositions including the genetic responses and changes to epidemic and endemic diseases. Indeed, whereas evolutionary information derived from present-day DNA sequences is, by necessity, indirect, ancient DNA sequences provide a direct view of past genetic variants and infectious agents. Moreover, technical advances in DNA extraction, multiplex DNA amplification and high-throughput sequencing have recently opened new horizons in ancient genomics (references there in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B213">213</xref>]), and studies to elucidate the genetic basis of the environmental adaptations of the human ancestors, compared to humans today is now possible. The presence and frequencies of the 
 <italic>CCR5-Δ32 </italic>variant in past human populations has been studied by several authors. The results of these studies have argue against the possibility that plague was a major selective force that caused a rapid increase in 
 <italic>CCR5-Δ32 </italic>gene frequencies within European populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B214">214</xref>] and have pushed the dating of the 
 <italic>CCR5-Δ32 </italic>allele back to around 5000 BC [
