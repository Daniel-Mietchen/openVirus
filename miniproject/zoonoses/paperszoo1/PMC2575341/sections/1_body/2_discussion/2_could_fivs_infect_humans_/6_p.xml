<p>In natural settings there are substantial behavioural and ecological barriers to cross-species transmission of FIV, a pathogen requiring direct contact for infection to occur. The major mode of transmission for FIV in domestic cats is believed to be biting, although vertical transmission can also occur [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B178">178</xref>]. If we hypothesize that the FIV infected cats before their domestication, this suggests, after this last event, frequent transmissions of FIV by biting from cat to human. Even if it is speculative, several forms of infections could occur and it is important to underline that during Antiquity, the bodies of colonized people faced greater danger from infections new to their immune systems and that numerous infectious diseases have profoundly affected human populations. Infections could induce fever, this might pass unnoticed and moreover, several prolonged or not fevers occurred relatively frequently during Antiquity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B179">179</xref>] and still today, fevers of unknown origin are numerous and several of them are probably zoonoses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B131">131</xref>]. Moreover, even if the virus cannot infect productively human cells, it could induce cell death. The 
 <italic>in vitro </italic>lytic properties of this virus in monkey and human cells suggest possible biological abnormalities associated with human FIV infection. Moreover, infections usually benign alone could have more severe effects on people which were co-infected by several epidemic or endemic pathogenous agents.
