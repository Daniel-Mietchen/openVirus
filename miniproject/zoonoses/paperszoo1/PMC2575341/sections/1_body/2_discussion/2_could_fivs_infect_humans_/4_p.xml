<p>The use of CXCR4 and CD134 as receptors is compatible with our hypothesis, as well as, analogous to primate lentivirus receptor usage, the predominant FIVfca quasispecies changes during the course of FIV infection, in that isolates from terminally infected animals have been reported to be CD134 independent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B168">168</xref>]. However, to date, there are no firm data to support a role for CCR5 in infections of feline cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B160">160</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B172">172</xref>], but a FIV strain could use human CCR5 to infect some human cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B161">161</xref>], nevertheless, this could be the result of a recent shift in coreceptor usage. In another hand, it has been reported that env deletion mutants of FIV have adapted to replicate in human cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B159">159</xref>]. Moreover, the increased cell death that preceded a loss of infectious FIV in infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells supports previous findings that infection of human cells by FIV is cytopathic, which is probably due to the expression of FIV envelope glycoproteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B158">158</xref>]. FIV infection of relatively few cells in culture has been associated with increased cytotoxicity in feline cultures due to the release of cytotoxic molecules [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B173">173</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B174">174</xref>], which is similar to reports of other lentiviruses. Hence, it is conceivable that FIV-mediated cytotoxicity may limit the number of infected and potentially infectable cells leading to the loss of detectable FIV DNA in infected human cultures. So, even if there were not a true infection, a high rate of cellular death and/or an immunological depletion could be deleterious although the infection appeared to be clinically silent. Wolfe et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] have delineated five stages in the transformation of an animal pathogen into a specialized pathogen of humans. According to these last authors, the present hypothesis of human infection by FIV would correspond to the stage 2: a pathogen of animals that, under natural conditions, has been transmitted from animals to humans ("primary infection") but has not been transmitted between humans ("secondary infection").
