<p>If the cause of the change of

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>]. It is probable, as with primate lentiviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B175">175</xref>], that recombination plays a significant role in the evolution of FIV and that different evolutionary patterns would be seen within different viral regions. Although cross-species transmissions have been rare, they likely did occur in the past to produce a pattern of viral evolution in felids that does not completely match the evolution of the Felidae. One of the best examples is the position of hyena FIV-Ccr within felid FIV suggests increased opportunities for inter-species transmission due to a greater elapsed time since the virus entered and disseminated in African felids. Finally, there are now several examples of modern inter-species transmissions (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B176">176</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B177">177</xref>]). However, while there is one case of a free-ranging leopard cat that acquired FIVfca from a domestic cat [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B177">177</xref>], most cross-species transmissions of FIV have been documented in captive settings.
