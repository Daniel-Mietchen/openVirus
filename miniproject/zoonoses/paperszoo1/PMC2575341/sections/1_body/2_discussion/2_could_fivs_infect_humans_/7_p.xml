<p>Moreover, cat zoonoses can be transmitted to man [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and the hypothesis of the role of FIV remains putative. However, the implication of a feline retrovirus could be plausible; indeed, three other species of feline retroviruses, feline foamy virus (FeFV), feline sarcoma virus (FeSV) and Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) can replicate in some human cell cultures with generally production of infectious virus and could sometimes produce morphological cell change [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B180">180</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B192">192</xref>]. Moreover, cat horizontal transmission of FeLV by cat fleas has also been demonstrated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B193">193</xref>] and FeSV can also induce malignant tumours in non felid mammalian including monkeys [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B194">194</xref>]. To date, there has been no evidence of infection of feline retrovirus in humans so far. However, all these reports suggest that numerous cat pathogen agents could have played a role in the putative decrease of the null allele frequency.
