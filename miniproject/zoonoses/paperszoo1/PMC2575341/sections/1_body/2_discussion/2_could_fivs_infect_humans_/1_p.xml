<p>More than half of the 1407 human pathogens are zoonotic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B131">131</xref>] and recent epidemics such as HIV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have changed the view we had about emerging infectious diseases; these epidemics showed evidences that animal reservoirs are important sources of new infectious threats to humans. Contacts between humans and animals are a crucial rate-limiting step in this process, although data describing the variables that influence animal-to-human transmission are relatively scarce. Therefore, a brief analysis of the data supporting cross-species transmissions of Simian retrovirus to humans can be instructive. Data on SIV/HIV dramatize this point; scientists now theorize that SIVs were transmitted from primates to humans on several occasions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B139">139</xref>], eating raw monkey meat, drinking monkey blood, or perhaps through another method of direct exposure to monkey bodily fluids have been suggested as a possible source and remains the best candidate so far [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B125">125</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B134">134</xref>]. These hypotheses are supported by the fact that primate handlers and those who hunt and butcher "bushmeat" (the meat of wild animals that includes chimpanzees, gorilla and other monkeys) have detectable humoral and cell-mediated immunity to SIV. There are at least eight documented incidents of zoonotic transfer of SIV to humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B137">137</xref>] and two laboratory workers have been accidentally infected by SIV, one infection was cleared and the second (a human infection with SIVsmB670), caused a persistent asymptomatic infection [
