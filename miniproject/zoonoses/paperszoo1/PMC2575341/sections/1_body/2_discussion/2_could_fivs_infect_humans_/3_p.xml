<p>To date, concerning the FIV, for which the host is phylogenetically more distant to human than monkeys, there is no evidence that it can infect or cause disease in humans. Researchers and veterinarians who have been bitten by FIV positive cats have been consistently tested negative for FIV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B151">151</xref>]. However, FIV infection was assessed solely by serological tests, confirmation of direct exposure to the virus was limited, and prolonged periods between potential exposure and assessment of infection existed. FIV-specific antibodies were not detected in the cynomolgus macaques (
 <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>), in which FIV infection cause clinical signs, including depletion of CD4+ cells and weight loss, which are consistent with FIV infection; moreover, FIV genes expression has been found in necropsied tissues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. As the most obvious effects of FIV infection in macaques were observed early after exposure, the lack of serum detection suggests that seroconversion is not indicative of prior exposure to the virus. In addition, even if FIV is antigenically distinct from the primate lentiviruses, it shares many biological properties that manifest in its ability to infect productively both primary and immortalized primate cell lines

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B161">161</xref>] and the restricting effect of the host factor TRIM5Î± is fairly substantial in macaque cells, but is rather mild in human cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B162">162</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B163">163</xref>]. However, the ability of FIV to express its LTR in primate cells seems to vary depending upon the viral strain, the experimental protocol, and the cell line used. Most of the restriction to expression seems to be due to limitations imposed by promoter sequences residing within the U3 region of FIV LTR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B158">158</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B159">159</xref>]. Once this restriction is overcome, FIV is able to express in a wide variety of cell types [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Moreover, it is likely that the determinants of feline cell tropism, such as envelope-mediated entry of target cells may also influence infection of primate cells by FIV, which must find cells that express the right combination of receptors and co-receptors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B161">161</xref>]. While the chemokine receptor CXCR4 as an entry receptor and the tumor necrosis factor receptor CD134 have been well established as essential for FIVfca receptor-mediated cell entry, the receptor interactions of puma and lion FIVs are not identified, but in some cases appear to involve other cell surface determinants [
