<p>In addition, the family of SIV is 1 out of 5 primate borne retroviruses known to infect humans. Simian (spumaretro-) foamy viral (SFV) infection, probably acquired through bites, has also been reported in 1 to 5% of persons occupationally exposed to non-human primates in zoos, primate centers and laboratories, mainly in Northern America but also in Europe (reviewed in [

Simian T-cell lymphotropic viruses (STLVs), enzootic in both Asian and African Old World monkeys and apes, may have repeatedly crossed the species barrier, the close relation between human and great ape primate T lymphotropic virus type 1 (PTLV-1) strains in Africa is suggestive of zoonosis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B127">127</xref>], which might result from hunting and slaughter activities. In addition, serologic studies have demonstrated evidence of primate-to-human transmission of simian type D retrovirus (SRV), a retrovirus enzootic among Old World monkeys, in laboratory workers exposed to captive primates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B150">150</xref>]. To date, no disease has been linked to human infection with this retrovirus.
