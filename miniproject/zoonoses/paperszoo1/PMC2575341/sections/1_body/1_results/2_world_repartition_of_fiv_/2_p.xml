<p>FIV, as 
 <italic>Human immunodeficiency virus </italic>(HIV) and 
 <italic>Simian immunodeficiency virus </italic>(SIV) belong to the 
 <italic>Lentivirus </italic>genus of the 
 <italic>Retroviridae </italic>(reviewed in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]). In domestic cat, FIV infection results in disease progression and outcome similar to that of HIV in humans, and offers a natural model to AIDS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. Other felid species which are infected with FIV seem not to develop AIDS-like disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. However, both captive and/or wild FIV-infected lions (
 <italic>Panthera leo</italic>) and pumas (
 <italic>Puma concolor</italic>) exhibited mild to severe CD4+ T-cell depletion and some other clinical health consequences [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>]. These findings raise the prospect that FIV is not completely benign in these species, but rather suppress host immune response and may increase the incidence of opportunistic infections or even spontaneous cancers as AIDS does in humans.
