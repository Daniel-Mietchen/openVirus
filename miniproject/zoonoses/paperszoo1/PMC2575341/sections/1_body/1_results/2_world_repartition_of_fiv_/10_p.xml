<p>Moreover, concerning early European contacts with FIV-infected felids, the Romans displayed lions, tigers, leopards, cheetahs and other felids in menageries, pageants and arena combats [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], but they were rarely tamed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">106</xref>]. In the Roman Empire there were many amphitheatres, e.g. in the second century AD there were more than a hundred amphitheatres in Italy and a similar number in the rest of Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B119">119</xref>]. In addition, there were similar numbers of circuses. The Romans systematically collected animals for display, entertainment and slaughter in arenas, theatres and amphitheatres throughout the Empire [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B120">120</xref>]. Even if the spectacles staged in Rome did not have an equivalent importance elsewhere in the Empire, in the arenas of this large city a great number of felids were massacred. For example, the dictator Sulla (93 B.C.) exhibited lions in the Rome's arena; in 55 B.C. under Pompey's reign on two occasions 500 and 410 leopards fought against Gaetulians armed with darts; in 46 B.C. Julius Caesar had 400 lions imported primarily from North Africa; and after Trajan's victory over the Dacians the games continued for 123 successive days when 11,000 animals were killed in the arena [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. In addition, similarly to Simian retrovirus infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B125">125</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B128">128</xref>], human could be infected during hunting or cutting up, most of the felid species having always been very exploited for their pelts.
