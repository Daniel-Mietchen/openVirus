<p>In summary, with exception of Oceania, historical regions with low or null frequency of 
 <italic>CCR5-Δ32 </italic>allele coincide with historical range of the wild felid species which harbor species-specific FIVs (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Among these nine felid species, four of them have the largest distributions of the members of this family. Leopards have the largest distribution of any felid and were found from South Africa across that continent to the Middle East, Java, and northward to Siberia. According to historical records, lion populations have been distributed in Middle East to India and in Africa except in desert and rainforest habitats. The distribution of cheetahs was almost identical to that of lions, except that they have not been found in Europe, but that they were distributed in semi-deserts. Historically, pumas were found from the boreal forests of northern Canada to the tip of South America. Among the four other felid species, the Pallas' cats inhabited from the Caspian Sea area to parts of Western China through Southern Asia. In nearly half of its distribution range, they were sympatric with lions, cheetahs and/or leopards. The bobcat formerly ranged from southern Canada throughout most of the United States, south to central Mexico. The distribution of the ocelot was almost identical to that of jaguarondi; they were found from Arizona and south west Texas through Central America to South America except in high mountains or plateaux and in the extreme southern cone beyond approximately 45° latitude. In the past, lions and leopards lived in Balkans, but they were not numerous in the historical time and the last specimens became extinct about 2500–2000 years ago [
