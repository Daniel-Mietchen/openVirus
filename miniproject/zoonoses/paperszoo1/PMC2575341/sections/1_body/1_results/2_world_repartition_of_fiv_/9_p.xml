<p>This bibliographic analysis suggests that both in Afro-Asia and in America, numerous people could have been in contact with FIV. However, the principal criticism could be that most of the contacts with felids have restraints to wealthy people. If it is partially true for big cats as lion, leopard, puma and cheetah, but this is not the case for Pallas's cat, Geoffrey's cat and jaguarondi. In addition, four species (cheetah, leopard, lion and spotty hyena) with specific FIV were formerly widespread throughout western Asia and Africa. To date, none wild individuals of these species have been seropositive in Asia; however, at least four empires (Egyptian, Hyksosian, Achaemenian and Greek) have been on two continents, facilitating animal trade across the Sinai Peninsula and importation of African felids in Asian countries and vice-versa.</p>
