<p>As FIV-infected wild felids are present in most of the world countries since at least the end of the last glaciation, it could be interesting to analyse the historical relationship between human and felids in relation with their serological status (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The exact history of human interaction with felids is still somewhat vague; however, as wild felid species are found in all parts of the world, except Greenland, Australia and Antarctica, suggesting that contacts between men and felids were probably very numerous during the last millennia. In spite that archaeological and historical records are sketchy, there are several evidence that throughout history people have had close relationships with felids. Moreover, given that, the single domestication event within the Felidae, apart from these modern hybrids, might suggest that this group is behaviourally poorly preadapted for domestication; it is all the more surprising that in a wide variety of cultures, over many centuries, particular felid species have been "tamed" as domestic pets. In addition, tamed felids have possibly lived in association with humans far earlier than archaeological and historical records imply. A comportemental study has evidenced that numerous species of small cats have an important preadaptation to domestication [
