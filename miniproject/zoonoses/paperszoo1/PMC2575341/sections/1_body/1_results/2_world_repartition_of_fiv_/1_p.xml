<p>If we hypothesize that a cat zoonosis might be transmitted to human, the corresponding infectious agent could also affect other felid species. Among, all the cat zoonoses, according us, only one parasite distribution could be correlated to those of the 
 <italic>CCR5-Δ32 </italic>allele frequency. The corresponding infectious agent is the 
 <italic>Feline immunodeficiency virus </italic>(FIV) which can also infect primate cells 
 <italic>in vitro </italic>and induce clinical signs in a primate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] and references therein). Indeed, historical regions with null or low frequency of 
 <italic>CCR5-Δ32 </italic>allele coincide with historical range of the wild felid species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>] which harbor species-specific FIVs (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The two maps do not correspond perfectly, and we can only conclude that these patterns are not inconsistent with the hypothesis that allele frequency and the old presence FIV-infected felids are causally related. However, as developed below, bibliographical analyses provide several arguments in favour of this hypothesis.
