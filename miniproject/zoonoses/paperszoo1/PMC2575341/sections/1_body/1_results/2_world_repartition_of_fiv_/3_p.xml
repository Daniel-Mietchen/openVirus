<p>The extant felids have arisen from a common ancestor in Asia 10.8 MYA during the Miocene. The 37 felid species form eight distinct evolutionary lineages that have successfully inhabited all continents except Oceania and Antarctica through a series of migrations likely facilitated by sea-level oscillations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]. Among the Felidae, at least 11 free ranging Felidae species harbor FIV antibodies and FIV viral genomes (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Moreover, nine of these species (lion, cheetah, leopard, Pallas cat, jaguarundi, ocelot, domestic cat, puma, and bobcat) have been shown to harbor species-specific FIVs by evaluation of complete or partial viral genomic sequences (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>]). However, the seroprevalence of FIVs varies dramatically by species and geographic areas. African lion and leopard, puma and Pallas cat populations demonstrate very high rates of seropositivity. The seroprevalence of FIV infections in natural settings is nearly 100% in Serengeti African lions and pumas of Wyoming and Montana, respectively [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>]. In contrast, significant numbers of free-ranging lions in Namibia or from Asia were all seronegative [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>]. The absence of FIV-Ple in Namibia is puzzling, but may be explained by the low density of lions in this African area [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>]. Moreover, several Asian lions held in captivity were noted to be 75% FIV seropositive, demonstrating that lions of Asian origin are not intrinsically resistant to infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>]. Interestingly, a similar geographic dispersal of seropositivity was noted for Asian versus African leopards; i.e., free-ranging African populations demonstrate seropositivity of &gt;25%, whereas Asian-born animals are seronegative [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>]. More than 50% of Pallas cats (Manul) tested harboured anti-FIV antibodies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>]. Other species, including the domestic cat, cheetah, and South American Neotropical free-ranging felid populations, tend to demonstrate seroprevalence rates of 10% or less. Asian species other than the Pallas cat are apparently not infected with an endemic FIV, although when during captivity, Asian felid individuals are exposed to other species harbouring FIVs, these animals may become infected (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>]). It must be noted that a species-specific FIV-related virus has also been found in Hyaenidae, which belong to the Feloidea superfamily [
