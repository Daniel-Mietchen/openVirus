<p>The precise origin of FIV emergence into Felidae is not easily discerned by viral phylogenetic analyses due to its recent and rapid evolution, and to cross-transmissions. According to Pecon-Slattery et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>], the widespread occurrence of FIV combined with large interspecies divergence in Africa would suggest that FIV arose in Africa rather than Asia. Moreover, an African origin of all lentiviruses may be posited, indeed, Simian lentiviruses are endemic in Africa infecting over 36 species of primates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">95</xref>], and caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV), bovine immune deficiency virus (BIV) and visna are present in Africa ungulate species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">96</xref>] and references therein]). Moreover, the substantial genetic difference observed among FIV lineages in Africa is consistent with a long residence time within these species, and suggest global dissemination of FIV from Africa during felid transcontinental migrations into Eurasia and the Americas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]. Moreover, the near absence of FIV in Asian species (except for the Mongolian Pallas cats) suggests that the virus did not originate along with ancestral felids of Asia which exclude that the FIV might have arisen in Asia along with the progenitor of modern felids 10.8 MYA. In addition, FIV related strains infect African feline species and the spotted hyena; however, FIV phylogenetic analyses do not support an ancient introduction of this virus to the Felidae and Hyaenidae (i.e., prior to the Felidae/Hyaenidae, using fossil, split is dated at about 47 million years ago) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>] but more probably, a recent African crossspecies transmissions. Lastly, the presence of FIV in both old and new world felids suggests that the current viruses may have descended from transmission events that occurred the last time felid species crossed the Bering Straits in the late Pleistocene (&gt;12,000 years ago [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]), or earlier. By contrast, like the recent emergence of HIV in humans, domestic cat lentiviral infections are relatively new diseases, with more limited distribution and lower seroprevalence than infections noted in lions and pumas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. The domestic cat evolved as a unique felid lineage only around 10,000 year ago [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] from subspecies of wildcat 
 <italic>Felis silvestris </italic>inhabiting Near East Asia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Seroprevalence studies, suggest that FIV is present in nearly all of the close relatives of domestic cat (
 <italic>Felis </italic>genus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]) including European wildcat 
 <italic>F. s. silvestris </italic>[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">98</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">99</xref>]. However, concerning European wildcat, it is due to recent cross transmissions from feral or domestic infected cats. In Europe, hybridization between domestic cats and wildcats are well known [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">100</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">101</xref>], showing evidence that contacts between wild and domestic cats are not rare.
