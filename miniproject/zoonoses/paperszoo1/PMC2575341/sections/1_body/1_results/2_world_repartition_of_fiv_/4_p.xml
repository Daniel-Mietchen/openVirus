<p>As already shown by several authors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>], the FIV phylogenies does not exactly mirror that of its feline host species (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However, the relative differences in genetic diversity among FIV strains be interpreted in the context of the evolutionary and phylogeographical history of each host species. Indeed, in spite of that free-ranging individuals of many species harbor monophyletic, species-specific strain(s) of FIV, viruses isolated from different species seem to group more by geographic region of the host than in groupings concordant with the phylogenetic relationships of host species. Moreover, molecular analyses failed to resolve the origin domestic cat FIV strains as has been already shown by other studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>]. The pattern of the strains infecting domesticated cat (FIV-Fca) which exhibit three monophyletic clades may due rapid viral diversification within the domestic cat world-wide due to the great number of individuals (some estimates put the domestic house cat population at 60 million and the feral cat population at the same number, that's 120 million animals) and to the trans-continental travels and traffics. The extreme divergence between the two highly FIV-Pco clades and the six FIV-Ple clades suggest an ancient origin of FIV infection of respectively, puma and lion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>]. Concerning FIV-Pco, this could be a consequence of two separate introductions of FIV within puma populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>], whereas for African lion virus, each clades correspond with distinct geographic areas of endemicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>]. The strains infecting cheetah (FIV-Aju) and leopard (FIV-Ppa) are closely related, in spite the fact that their hosts have evolved in distinctly different felid lineages, puma and cheetah are closely related, belonging to the puma linage, while lions and leopards are members of the Panthera lineage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]. Moreover, cheetah and leopard could be sympatric; all these data suggest recent inter-species transmission. Due to the date of expansion of cheetah throughout Africa, the FIV-Aju emergence may have occurred within the last 10,000 years, perhaps acquired from leopards [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>]. FIV-Oma is found in wild populations of the Eurasian Pallas cat [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>], a species that arose during the late Pleistocene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]. The monophyletic lineage of Pallas cat FIV-Oma and African lion FIV-Ple observed here could suggest more ancient inter-species transmission as the last time lions and Pallas cats were in geographic contact was during the Pleistocene when lion ranges spread throughout Asia, providing a possible opportunity for FIV transmission between these species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>]. In addition, FIV-Ccr occurs in spotted hyena, a species from the Hyaenidae family within carnivores that co-exist in the same habitats as most African felid species, affording opportunities for cross-species transmission. Interestingly, as already shown by Pecon Slattery et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>], all the FIV strains which infected Afro-Asian Feloidea constitute a monophyletic group. This grouping could suggest a common origin or/and old cross transmissions, in spite that in Asia, no wild seropositive individuals have been found in cheetahs, lions, leopards and hyenas which have a large Afro-Asian repartition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">94</xref>]. Moreover, the geographic partitioning reflected in the amino acid phylogeny suggests evidence for an Old world/New world split (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>]). Lastly, similarly to the cheetah/leopard case, two American species that evolved in distinctly different felid lineages (ocelot and jaguarondi), which have almost identical distribution, are infected with closely related viruses (FIV-Lpa and FIV-Hya, respectively) suggesting recent inter-species transmission. However, with few exceptions, the strong monophyletic origin of each species-specific strain suggests that FIV has rarely undergone effective transmission between species. In addition, the monophyly of FIV sequences within each species suggests that, in most cases, FIV has been successfully introduced once and adapted, expanded, and evolved within the host.
