<p>More than any other civilizations, the Romans have created links between Mediterranean basin and Western and Central Europe and the great routes of infectious diseases went straight through it [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Not only did the first great historical pestilences pass through the Empire, but also the slow insidious penetration of endemic disease (like tuberculosis, leprosy and malaria) has invaded Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Moreover, conquerors and invading armies brought also with them insect and rodent vectors that could introduce or sustain infectious diseases in nonendemic European areas. As, to our knowledge, no known human diseases could explain the decrease of the null allele in Europe, zoonoses might be implicated. Indeed, most of the infectious diseases affecting human populations are considered zoonotic in origin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Close contact with animals is a risk for humans to acquire infectious diseases and it is well known that the domestication of animals has facilitated the passage of animals parasites to human [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Many of the major human infectious diseases, including some now confined to humans and absent from animals, have arisen only after the origins of agriculture (11,000 years BP) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The five animal species (cow, sheep, goat, pig and dog) which have had probably the most epidemic impact on the human populations are explicitly named the Pandora's pentad [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Moreover, few tropical but many temperate diseases arose from domestic animals, because these live mainly in the temperate zones, and their concentration there was formerly even more lopsided [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In Europe, the Romans were the cause of some permanent changes in the distribution of birds and beasts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]; several animals, such as cat, donkey, mule and pheasant have been voluntarily introduced throughout Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and others involuntarily, such as malaria vector mosquito species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. If we consider that the most impact on the decrease of the 
 <italic>CCR5-Î”32 </italic>allele frequency could be principally due to Roman expansion, according to us, among all the domestic animals, cat could be the best candidate. Indeed, once the cat had arrived in Rome; this animal would have spread throughout Europe, quite likely as a camp follower and companion to the constantly travelling Roman armies. Moreover, several parasitic, bacterial and viral zoonoses diagnosed in cats could be transmitted to man [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. To support this view, before investigate the type of disease which could be transmitted, the major steps of the spread of the domestic cat in Europe are summarized.
