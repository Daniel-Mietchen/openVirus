<p>Cat's origin is yet little uncertain; however, several analysis revealed that cats were domesticated in the Near East; wildcats of Near East (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], and likely coincide with agricultural village development in the Fertile Crescent. This is congruent with archaeological studies, the earliest evidence of cat-human association involves their co-occurrence in Cyprus deposits aged at 9,500 years ago [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Similarly, in all the other islands of the Mediterranean Basin far beyond continent (Sardinia, Corsica and Crete), felids originated from African or Middle East wildcats which were voluntarily introduced by Neolithic navigators about 6,000–8,000 years ago [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]; moreover, remains of cats have been found in many of the Roman settlements excavated extensively suggesting that the spread of domesticated cats throughout continental Europe and Great Britain is principally due to Romans [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Moreover, as contrarily to Asia, Africa and America, there was no tameable felid in the Northern Mediterranean countries, therefore numerous substitutes have been found by the European populations, principally Mustelidae species [
