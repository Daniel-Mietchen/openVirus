<p>Previous, statistical analyses suggested a decrease of the ancestral 
 <italic>CCR5-Î”32 </italic>allele frequency in European population due principally to Roman expansion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, this negative selection was not directly due to the military or colonisation spreads, as the gene flows from colonisators to European native populations were too low [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Moreover, statistical analyses suggested that factor(s) responsible for the decrease of null allele frequency had partly diffused beyond the borders of the Roman Empire [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The diffusion of one or more factor(s) excludes the role of climatical changes, the change in allele frequency could be due to the spread of human or animal parasites that affect human populations.
