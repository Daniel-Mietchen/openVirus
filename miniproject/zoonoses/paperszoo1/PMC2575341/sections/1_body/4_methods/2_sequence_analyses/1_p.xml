<p>All the FIV Pol protein sequences have been extracted from GenBank. These sequences have been aligned with the BioEdit software [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B225">225</xref>]. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B226">226</xref>] in PHYLIP version 3.6 alpha 3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B227">227</xref>] accessed at
