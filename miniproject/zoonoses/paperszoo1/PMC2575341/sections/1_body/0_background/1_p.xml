<p>As infection is the greatest killer in human history [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], the strongest evidence for selection in the human genome has been obtained for genes involved in immune defense, including those which encode receptors. One of the most-celebrated examples of adaptive selection is the 32-bp coding sequence deletion, 
 <italic>CCR5-Δ32</italic>, of the chemokine receptor CCR5. This is probably the more recent and complete example of a gene studied from clinical, epidemiological and evolutionary genetics. CCR5 function as co-receptors for the cell entry of HIV-1 and the deletion which leads to a frame shift and generates an inactive CCR5 receptor. Homozygosity for the 
 <italic>CCR5-Δ32 </italic>allele confers almost complete, mendelian resistance to R5-tropic HIV-1 while HIV-infected individuals heterozygous for this allele were delayed in progression to AIDS [
