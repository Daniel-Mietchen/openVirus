<p>The 
 <italic>CCR5</italic>-
 <italic>Δ32 </italic>allele is mainly present in Europeans (10% on average) and the allele frequency exhibits a north-south cline with frequencies ranging from 16% in Northern Europe to 4% or less in Greece and in most of the Mediterranean islands (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]). The broadest area of high frequency is located in North-Eastern Europe, particularly in the Baltic and White Sea regions. From these maximum, the frequency gradually decreases in all directions across Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]; however, some additional peaks of frequency are found in France or Russian areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Moreover, Ashkenazi Jews have high frequencies of 
 <italic>CCR5-Δ32</italic>, but this is likely due to founder effects unique to their history rather than the general process of dispersal that spread the allele in other populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Outside Europe, the mutation can be found at low frequencies in neighbouring regions (North Africa, Middle East, Central Asia); it is absent in Sub-Saharan Africa, East and South-East Asia and in indigenous populations of America and Oceania (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).
