<p>The idea that bottlenecks and founder effects could lead to an increase in damaging alleles in human populations was historically reserved for isolated populations that experienced severe founder effects (for example, Ashkenazi Jews [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and Finns [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]). However, recently signs of a population bottleneck in variability data obtained for a number of genomic loci in European populations were described and also led to the conclusion that a severe bottleneck occurred after the appearance of the anatomically modern human in Africa, and thus presumably during, or after, the emigration out of Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and references therein). Moreover, the earlier European population of hunter-gatherers could suffer severe bottlenecks during the latest ice age (Pleistocene) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. As there is strong evidence for the unitary origin of the 
 <italic>CCR5-Î”32 </italic>mutation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], the null allele could have been already present in the ancestors of the European populations (in spite of their present language differences) at a relatively high frequency, probably &gt;10% as suggested by analysis of ancient DNA from Bronze age [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and Neolithic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], similarly to many other polymorphisms found in Europeans but not in the other populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].
