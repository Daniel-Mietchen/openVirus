<p>Because the AIDS pandemic is too recent to change allele frequencies, other infectious diseases have been suggested as the agent causing the selection of the null allele increase, such as resistance to plague and smallpox infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, analyses of Scandinavian Mesolithic DNA which have pushed the date of the first occurrence back to around 5000 BC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and genomic analyses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] have weakened the evidence for recent selection of the null allele. Due to the north-south spatial gradient, it has been proposed that the actual allele distribution could be explained by migrations of Northern populations. As suggested by Lucotte [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] in its seminal article in the field and by Balanovsky et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] Vikings and Uralic speaking people, respectively, could have brought the deletion in some Southern populations. Moreover, these migrations and/or gene flow cannot explain, according to us, the whole of the European allele frequency distribution. Also, we have proposed an alternative hypothesis in which the actual allele frequency distribution might not be due to the genes spreading, but to a negative selection resulting in the spread of pathogens principally during principally Roman expansion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This hypothesis is supported by several facts.
