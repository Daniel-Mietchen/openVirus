<p>Previous statistical analyses showed strong negative correlations in Europe between the allele frequency and two historical parameters, i.e. the first colonization dates by the great ancient Mediterranean civilisations, and the distances from the frontiers of the Roman Empire in its greatest expansion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, the possible decrease of the ancestral 
 <italic>CCR5-Δ32 </italic>allele frequency was not due directly to the colonizers, as the gene flows to European native populations were extremely low [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This suggests that the role of colonizers were indirect. As evolutionary biologists have shown several evidences that infectious diseases, as a leading cause of human morbidity and mortality, have exerted important selective forces on our genomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], the cause of the decrease of the 
 <italic>CCR5-Δ32 </italic>allele frequency in Southern European populations is probably due to infectious agent(s). It has been suggested that the most important infectious diseases of modern food-producing human populations also include diseases that could have emerged only within the past 11,000 years, following the rise of agriculture [

 <italic>CCR5-Δ32 </italic>allele frequency in the South of the Europe could be due to parasites. The introduction of parasites in naive colonized populations could have induced a breakdown of the pathocenosis and a new equilibrium has been reached through a decrease of the 
 <italic>CCR5-Δ32 </italic>allele frequency. The theoretical framework of pathocenosis, first coined by Grmek [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]) and developed by Biraben [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], offers a synthetic approach to the history of disease. Drawing on the concept of biocenosis, Grmek defines pathocenosis as "the ensemble of pathological states present in a specific population at a given moment in time" and suggests that "the frequency and overall distribution of each disease depends on the frequency and distribution of all the other diseases within a given population". The concept of pathocenosis attempts to offer a synthetic view of disease ecology, which, in our context is defined as all interdependences within pathogens, their hosts (including their genetic responses) and their environment.
