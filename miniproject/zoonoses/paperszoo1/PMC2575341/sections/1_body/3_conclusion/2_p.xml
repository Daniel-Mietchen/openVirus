<p>Bibliographical analysis shows evidence that species-specificity of FIV might be less stringent than previously considered. The abundance of studies demonstrating the capacity of viruses, including retrovirus, to cross species raises questions about ongoing transmissions and renders the study of the adaptations required for viruses to be transmitted from one host species to another increasingly relevant. In addition, although bibliographical analysis shows that the FIV has the ability to infect primate cells 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, it is not our intent to suggest that FIV represents a health hazard. However, the apparent lack of pathogenicity of FIV infection in humans, which is still based on a limited number of cases, contrasts strongly with the 
 <italic>in vitro </italic>lytic properties of these viruses in primate cells. Moreover, as the analyses concern only healthy persons this induces an important bias. Although the risks for human are considered extremely small, from a public health perspective it is often recommended that immunosuppressed people should have limited contact with infected cats. FIV infection in immunocompromised persons, especially those with HIV infection, could also heighten public health concerns because such coinfection is probable during cohabitation with infected pets.
