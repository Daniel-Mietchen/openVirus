<p>In addition, scientific evidence for the ancient spread of a resistance allele or a pathogenic agent could become available through research on ancient DNA and this research field could be determinant in the comprehension of the interrelations with human genome, pathogenic agents and their hosts in the last millennia. Recent advances in ancient-DNA extraction have made it possible to retrieve substantial amounts of ancient DNA sequences from at least Pleistocene remains in order to analyse the pathocenoses and the corresponding genetic responses. As most of the human diseases are zoonoses, analyses of human and animal remains must be made in conjunction.</p>
