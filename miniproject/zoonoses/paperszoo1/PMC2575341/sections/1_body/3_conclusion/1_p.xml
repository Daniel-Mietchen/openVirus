<p>In this study, we have proposed the hypothesis that in Europe, the actual European CCR5 allelic frequencies are the result of a negative selection due to a disease spreading (ostensibly by the Roman Empire or some other colonizers). A cat zoonosis could be the most plausible hypothesis and even if it is speculative, the implication of FIV added to possible deleterious effects of the null allele mutation has been suggested. Future studies will prove or dismiss if in FIV pathogenesis, CCR5 can play an antimicrobial role. Moreover, this study shows that in the future all pieces of the puzzle could be put together to see the whole picture of the
