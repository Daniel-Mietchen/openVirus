   <bold>Geographic distribution of the 
    <italic>CCR5-Î”32 </italic>allele (A) compared with historical range of felids carrying species-specific FIVs (B)
   </bold>. In (A), only the frequencies of Native populations have been evidenced in America, Asia, Africa and Oceania. Map redrawn and modified from [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In (B), the black areas correspond to the range of wild individuals bearing species-specific FIVs in a given continent, America: bobcat, jaguarundi, ocelot and puma; Asia: Pallas cat; Africa: cheetah, leopard and lion. The pale grey areas correspond to the range where individuals of these species have been found seronegative or when their serological status is unknown in a given continent (Asia: cheetah, leopard and lion; Europe: leopard and lion). Areas where these last three species lived in sympatry with Pallas cat are in dark grey. The historical ranges are approximate by 500 BC for Europe, North Africa and Western Asia; since the European settlement in America, and during the 1500's to the beginning of the 1900's in the remainder of Africa, Asia and Oceania. These data were principally inferred from [
