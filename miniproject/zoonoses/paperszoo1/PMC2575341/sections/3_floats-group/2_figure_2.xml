   <bold>Viral-host co-evolution</bold>. The tree on the left shows observed viral sequence relationships [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>,
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>] and references therein) and the tree on the right represents host species relationships [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]. FIV polymerase sequences (158 amino acids included in analysis) were analyzed phylogenetically from nine feline species representing six out of the eight feline lineages [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]. Asterisks indicate significant bootstrap values (â‰¥ 70%). The branch lengths are not in scale. Numbers next to node define estimated time of divergence for each the felid lineages and for the 
   <italic>Felidae</italic>/
   <italic>Hyaenidae </italic>split in million years.
