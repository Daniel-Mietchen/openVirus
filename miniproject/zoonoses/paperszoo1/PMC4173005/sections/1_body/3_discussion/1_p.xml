<p>Private veterinarians are likely to be the first frontline clinicians to encounter emerging zoonoses; which puts them at a higher occupational risk of exposure to these diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Many studies, including Australian studies, have shown veterinarians’ attitudes and behaviours towards IC and zoonotic risks to be suboptimal; however, most studies have failed to explain why this was so [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The aim of this study was not to evaluate veterinary IC adequacy but to identify and understand the barriers to IC and zoonotic risk mitigation in private veterinary practices within the context of the emergence of HeV in Queensland, Australia. Participants reported experiencing difficulties implementing IC and HeV management for a number of reasons (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Many of these issues were interconnected and were in actual fact related to four main barriers to IC and HeV management discussed below: veterinary work culture; private workforce managing biosecurity and public health issues; role of government; and uncertainty about the epidemiology of an emerging disease (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
