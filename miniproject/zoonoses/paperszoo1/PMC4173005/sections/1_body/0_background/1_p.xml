<p>Hendra virus (HeV) is amongst a plethora of zoonoses emerging as new infectious threats to animal as well as human health [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. HeV first emerged in 1994 in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. HeV is a paramyxovirus carried by pteropid bats with low infectivity to other susceptible species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, the virus can sporadically spillover from its natural reservoir to horses with secondary spillover to humans in some instances. HeV has high fatality rates in both species, 75% and 57% respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Humans can become infected with HeV when exposed to blood and bodily fluids from an infected horse [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In 2011, a dog became infected with HeV but did not develop any clinical signs prior to being sacrificed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Since 1994 there have been a relatively low number (49) of self-limiting outbreaks along the eastern coast of Australia between northern New South Wales and Far North Queensland [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These outbreaks resulted in the deaths of 90 horses and a total of three non-fatal and four fatal human infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. So far, all human HeV cases have occurred between August 1994 and September 2009 in Queensland [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].
