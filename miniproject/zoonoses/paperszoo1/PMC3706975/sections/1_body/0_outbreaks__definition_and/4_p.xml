<p>In the past decade, many different kinds of outbreaks have hit the headlines (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), with concern focused on the spread of multi-drug-resistant strains in hospitals (such as MRSA) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] or in the community (such as multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]); the threat of bioterrorism [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]; and 'emerging infections', caused by newly discovered pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or infection with the novel coronavirus 2012 (HCoV-EMC/2012) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], or by novel variants of previously recognized species or strains, such as STEC O104:H4 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Outbreaks are often linked to social factors, including mass travel, migration, conflict or societal breakdown, or to environmental threats, such as earthquakes or floods. They can arise from exposure to a common source in the environment (for example, legionellosis arising from a water source); when the period of exposure is brief, these events are termed 'point-source outbreaks'. Alternatively, outbreaks can be propagated by human-to-human spread or, in the case of zoonoses, such as swine or bird flu, can result from the spread to humans from animal reservoirs. Outbreaks can also be classified according to context, for example whether they occur in the community or in healthcare settings, or according to the mode of transmission, for example food-borne, waterborne, airborne or vector-borne.
