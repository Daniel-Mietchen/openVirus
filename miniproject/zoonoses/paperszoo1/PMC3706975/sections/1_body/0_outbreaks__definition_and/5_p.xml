<p>Here, we examine the applications of new high-throughput sequencing approaches to the identification and characterization of outbreaks, focusing on the application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to outbreaks of bacterial infection. We describe how traditional epidemiological analysis works and show how WGS can be informative at multiple steps in outbreak investigation.</p>
