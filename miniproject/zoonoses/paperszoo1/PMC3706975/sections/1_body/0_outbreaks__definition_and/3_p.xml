<p>Investigation of a suspected outbreak has two aims: termination of the cluster of disease and prevention of similar occurrences by understanding how such outbreaks originate. A key question surfaces at the start of any such investigation: is one really seeing an outbreak in the strictest sense, caused by a single strain, or is one merely seeing an increased incidence of infection, involving multiple unrelated strains? The answer to this question is of more than academic interest, as it dictates how the finite resources available for infection control are best deployed. For example, evidence of cross infection with a single methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus </italic>(MRSA) strain on a ward might prompt an aggressive strategy of patient isolation and decolonization, whereas an increase in infections caused by diverse staphylococcal strains (presumably each derived from the patient's own microbiota) might prompt a look at policies for wound care or antibiotic usage. Similarly, identification and characterization of an outbreak strain or the discovery of its source or mode of transmission influences the behavior of the infection control team - potential responses include removal of the source, interruption of transmission or strengthening of host defenses.
