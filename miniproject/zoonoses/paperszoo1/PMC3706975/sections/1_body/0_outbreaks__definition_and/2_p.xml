<p>In its loosest sense, the term 'outbreak' can be used to refer to any increase in the incidence of a given infection, which can occur in response to local, societal or environmental changes: for example, one might see an increase in the prevalence of staphylococcal wound infections when hospital ward or operating theatre cleaning procedures change, or when there are changes in the use of antibiotics. However, in the strictest sense (which we adopt here), the term implies a series of infections caused by indistinguishable or closely linked isolates, which are sufficiently similar to justify talking about 'an outbreak strain'. Such outbreaks can range in size from a few individuals, for instance in a family outbreak or an outbreak on a hospital ward, to epidemics that rage across countries or continents.</p>
