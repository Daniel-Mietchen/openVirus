<p>Vaccination provides a means of disrupting transmission by removing susceptible hosts from the population. For example, immunity to specific capsule types responsible for pneumococcal infection is targeted by their inclusion in a multivalent vaccine. High-throughput sequencing studies provide clear evidence that capsule switching is occurring in pneumococcal populations in response to vaccination, which has implications for disease control and vaccine design [
