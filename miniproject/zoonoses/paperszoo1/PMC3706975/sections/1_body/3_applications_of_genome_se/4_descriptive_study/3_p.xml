<p>In some cases, it may be possible to hypothesize what determinants underlie the success of an outbreak strain. For example, the 
 <italic>sasX </italic>gene (a mobile genetic element-encoded gene involved in nasal colonization and pathogenesis) appeared to be a key determinant of the successful spread of MRSA in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and genes for the Panton-Valentine toxin were hypothesized to contribute to the spread of a novel MRSA genotype that caused an outbreak in a British special care baby unit [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].
