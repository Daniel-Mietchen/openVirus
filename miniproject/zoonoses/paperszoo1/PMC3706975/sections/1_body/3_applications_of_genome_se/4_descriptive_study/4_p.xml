<p>Prediction of resistance phenotype from genotype has been applied routinely for years to viral pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus, for which the cataloguing of resistance mutations in a publicly accessible database has greatly strengthened the utility of the approach [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Data are accumulating from 
 <italic>S. aureus </italic>[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and from 
 <italic>E. coli </italic>strains that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases showing that WGS can be used to predict the resistance phenotype in bacteria (Nicole Stoesser, Department of Microbiology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, personal communication). Well-maintained databases documenting links between genotypes and resistance phenotypes are likely to add value to such ventures.
