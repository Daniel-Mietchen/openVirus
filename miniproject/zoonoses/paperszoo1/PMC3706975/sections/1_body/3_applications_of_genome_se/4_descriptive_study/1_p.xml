<p>During this phase of outbreak investigation, inferences from sequence data (such as on phylogeny, transmissibility, virulence or resistance) can be integrated with clinical and environmental metadata (such as geographical, temporal or anatomical data) to generate hypotheses and build and test models. For example, in a landmark study, Baker and colleagues [
