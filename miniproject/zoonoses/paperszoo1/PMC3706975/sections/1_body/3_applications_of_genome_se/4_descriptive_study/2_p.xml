<p>During this phase of hypothesis generation, it may be possible to infer hidden transmission events. For instance, when faced with the recurrence of a strain of 
 <italic>C. difficile </italic>in a hospital after more than 3 years of absence, Eyre and colleagues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] concluded that unsuspected community transmission of 
 <italic>C. difficile </italic>was the most likely explanation for their observations. They also noted that most of their 
 <italic>C. difficile </italic>cases were unrelated to other recent cases in the hospital, from which they concluded that their hospital infection control policies were working as well as they could and that further reductions in the incidence of 
 <italic>C. difficile </italic>infections would have to rely on additional and different interventions.
