<p>During this stage, there is often a series of iterative refinements to assumptions and models. For example, in a detailed retrospective analysis of tuberculosis cases in the English Midlands, Walker and colleagues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] first documented the diversity of 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>genotypes in their collection and then explored how the patterns of genome diversity were reflected in contemporaneous and serial isolates from individual patients and among isolates from household outbreaks. This allowed them to define cut-offs in the number of SNPs that could be used to rule isolates in or out of a recent transmission event. In some instances, they could then allocate cases to clusters in which a link had been suspected, but had not been proven, by conventional epidemiological methods. In other cases, where a link had been suspected on grounds of ethnicity, they were able to exclude recent transmission within the West Midlands region.
