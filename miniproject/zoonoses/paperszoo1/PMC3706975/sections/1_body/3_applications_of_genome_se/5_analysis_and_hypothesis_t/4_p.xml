<p>Molecular phylogenies also make it possible to look back over years, decades, even centuries. For example, He and colleagues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] showed that two distinct strains of fluoroquinolone-resistant 
 <italic>C. difficile </italic>027 emerged in the USA in 1993 to 1994, and that these showed different patterns of global spread. Genomic information, together with estimates from the sequence data of the time since isolates had diverged ('molecular clock' estimates) allowed them to reconstruct detailed routes of transmission within the UK. Similar studies have revealed patterns of the global spread of cholera, 
 <italic>Shigella sonnei </italic>and MRSA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].
