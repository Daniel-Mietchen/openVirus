<p>Relatedness between isolates within an outbreak (and more widely) is often assessed by the construction of a phylogenetic tree [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Such phylogenetic inferences can enable the identification of sources or reservoirs of infection: examples include the acquisition of leprosy by humans from wild armadillos and the acquisition of 
 <italic>Mycobacterium bovis </italic>in cattle from sympatric badger populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Integration of phylogeny with geography has allowed the origins and spread of pandemics and epidemics to be traced, including the 
 <italic>Yersinia pestis </italic>pandemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and, controversially, the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti, which has been traced to Nepalese peacekeepers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].
