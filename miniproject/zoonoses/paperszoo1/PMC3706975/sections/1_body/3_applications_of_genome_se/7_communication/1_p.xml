<p>To be useful to clinicians, whole-genome sequence data must be readily accessible in a portable, easily stored and searched, user-friendly format. However, data sharing even through established hospital informatics systems is a non-trivial task, particularly given the current diversity in sequencing platforms and analytical pipelines. Perhaps the answer here is to ensure the involvement of clinical academics with the relevant research credentials and accreditation to make clinical decisions, who might be best placed to pioneer the use of WGS data to manage outbreaks.</p>
