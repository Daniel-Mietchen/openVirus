<p>Case definition within an outbreak usually involves a combination of clinical and laboratory criteria; for instance, a complex of symptoms and an associated organism. This definition can then be used for active case finding to identify additional patients in the cluster. During the German STEC outbreak, rapid genome sequencing together with crowd-sourced bioinformatics analyses led to the development of a set of diagnostic reagents that could then be used in defining cases within the outbreak [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Similarly, during new outbreaks of viral infection, genome-scale sequencing can act as a precursor to the development of simpler specific tests that can be used in case definition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].
