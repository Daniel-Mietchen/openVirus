<p>Metagenomics, that is, wholesale sequencing of DNA extracted from complex microbial communities without culture, capture or enrichment of pathogens or their sequences, provides an exciting new approach to the identification and characterization of outbreak strains that does away with the need for laboratory culture or target-specific amplification or enrichment. This approach has been used to identify the causes of outbreaks of viral infection [

Most recently, diagnostic metagenomics has been applied to stool samples collected during the German outbreak of STEC O104:H4, allowing recovery of draft genomes from the outbreak strain and several other pathogens and showing the applicability of diagnostic metagenomics to bacterial infections [
