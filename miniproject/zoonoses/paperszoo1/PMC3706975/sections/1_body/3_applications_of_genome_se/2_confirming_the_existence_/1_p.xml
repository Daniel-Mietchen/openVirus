<p>When pathogens are endemic, for example, MRSA or 
 <italic>Clostridium difficile </italic>in healthcare facilities, it can be difficult to decide whether one or more outbreaks are under way or whether there has simply been a general rise in the incidence of infection. Eyre and colleagues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] showed that bench-top sequencing of whole bacterial genomes could be used in near real time to confirm or refute the existence of outbreaks of MRSA or 
 <italic>C. difficile </italic>in an acute hospital setting. In particular, they found that the genome sequences from an apparent cluster of 
 <italic>C. difficile </italic>infections turned out to be unrelated and so did not represent an outbreak 
 <italic>sensu stricto </italic>[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].
