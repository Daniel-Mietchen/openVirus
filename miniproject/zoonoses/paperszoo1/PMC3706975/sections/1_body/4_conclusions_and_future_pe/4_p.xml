<p>Estimates of rates of genetic change have been published for some organisms: for example, 
 <italic>S. aureus </italic>mutates relatively rapidly, with 3 Ã— 10
 <sup>-6 </sup>mutations per year, corresponding to 8.4 SNPs per genome per year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], whereas 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>evolves slowly, acquiring only 0.5 SNPs per genome per year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. However, such data are available for only a very limited number of other pathogens. This will need to be expanded significantly before routine use of WGS data becomes a reality. We suspect that there may be consistent differences in the mode and rate of genotypic change between organisms for which an asymptomatic carrier state (for example 
 <italic>C. difficile</italic>) or a latent period (
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>) exists and those, such as measles, for which there is no carrier state.
