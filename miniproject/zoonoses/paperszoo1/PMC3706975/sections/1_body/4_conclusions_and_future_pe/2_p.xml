<p>There is still a need for improved speed, ease of use, accuracy and longer read lengths. However, given the ongoing, relentless improvements in performance and cost-effectiveness of high-throughput sequencing, it is likely that these financial and technical challenges will be met relatively easily over the coming years [

Nonetheless, improvements in the analysis, archiving and sharing of WGS data need to occur before sequencing results can become trustworthy enough to guide clinical decision-making. Significant investment in establishing standards, databases and communication tools will be required to maximize the opportunities provided by WGS in epidemiology. There may also be organizational and ethical issues with data ownership and access [
