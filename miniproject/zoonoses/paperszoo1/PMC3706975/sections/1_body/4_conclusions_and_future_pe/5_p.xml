<p>In conclusion, it is clear that WGS is already transforming the practice of outbreak investigation. However, the dizzyingly fast pace of change in this field, with steady improvements in high-throughput sequencing, make predictions about the future difficult, particularly now that nanopore sequencing technologies are poised to deliver a revolution in our ability to sequence macromolecules in clinical samples (not just DNA, but also RNA and even proteins) [

Portable nanopore technologies might provide a route to real-time near-patient testing and environmental sampling, as well as delivering a combined read-out of genotype and phenotype in bacterial cells (perhaps even allowing direct detection of the expression of resistance determinants). It also seems likely that clinical diagnostic metagenomics [
