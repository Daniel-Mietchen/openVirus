<p>Careful contextualization of WGS data will be needed before robust conclusions can be drawn, ideally within an agreed framework of standard operating procedures. Interpretation of genomic data requires a detailed knowledge of within-host and between-host genotypic diversity, whether defined at a single time point or longitudinally. Readings from the molecular clock provide the temporal information needed to reconstruct the emergence and evolution of lineages and transmission events within an outbreak. This means that extensive benchmarking will be needed to determine the rates of genomic change, which are likely to be species- and even lineage-specific. Only when WGS data have been obtained from a large number of epidemiologically linked and unlinked cases in a given lineage will it be possible to define cut-offs for the genomic differences that allow linked and unlinked cases to be accurately defined. This may also rely on comparisons with an 'outgroup', that is, a group of cases that clearly fall outside the outbreak cluster.</p>
