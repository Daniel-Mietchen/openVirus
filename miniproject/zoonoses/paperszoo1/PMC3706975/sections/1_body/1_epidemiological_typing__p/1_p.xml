<p>Although traditional epidemiology can often track down the source of an outbreak (for example, a case-control study can identify the foodstuff responsible for a food-poisoning outbreak [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]), for several decades laboratory investigations have also had an important role in outbreak investigation and management [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Thus, when suspicion of an outbreak has been raised on clinical or epidemiological grounds, the laboratory can provide evidence to confirm or dismiss a common microbial cause. Alternatively, an increase in laboratory reports of a given pathogen may provide the first evidence that an outbreak is under way.
