<p>This riotous proliferation of genotypic typing methods, often with complex and non-standardized workflows, led Achtman in the late 1990s to coin the phrase YATM for 'yet another typing method' [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and to pioneer, with others, the adoption of sequence-based approaches, notably multilocus sequence typing (MLST) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In this approach, differences in stretches of DNA sequence from conserved housekeeping genes are used to assign bacterial isolates to sequence types, which, in turn, often fall into larger clonal complexes. Sequence-based approaches bring the advantage of portability; in other words, results from one laboratory can be easily compared with those from others around the world. In addition, archiving of information in national or international datasets allows isolates and outbreaks to be placed in the wider context of pathogen population structure.
