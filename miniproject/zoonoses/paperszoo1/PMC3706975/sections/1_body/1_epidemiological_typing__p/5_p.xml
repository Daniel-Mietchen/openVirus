<p>Yet, despite the advantages of sequence-based typing, drawbacks remain. For example, there is a lack of standardization, as evidenced by the existence of multiple MLST databases and even multiple competing MLST schemes for the same species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In addition, costs and complex workflows mean that most pathogen typing is performed in batch mode, retrospectively, in reference laboratories that struggle to provide data with real-time impact - one possible exception is the near-real-time typing of 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </italic>isolates in the UK [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Approaches such as MLST also lack the resolution needed to reconstruct chains of transmission within outbreaks, tending instead to lump together all isolates from an outbreak together as 'indistinguishable' members of the same sequence type.
