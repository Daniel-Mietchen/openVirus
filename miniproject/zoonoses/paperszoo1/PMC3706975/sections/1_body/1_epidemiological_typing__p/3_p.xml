However, the arrival of molecular biology in general and specifically of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) led to a profusion of genotypic approaches, largely documenting differences in patterns of bands seen on gels: examples include pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, ribotyping, variable number-tandem repeat typing, random amplification of polymorphic DNA, arbitrarily primed PCR and repetitive-element PCR [
