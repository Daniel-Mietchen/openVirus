<p>By delivering a definitive catalog of genetic polymorphisms (especially single-nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs), WGS delivers far greater resolution than traditional methods. For instance, whereas MLST identified only a single sequence type for a collection of MRSA isolates, WGS identified several distinct clusters [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Two recent studies of tuberculosis transmission have shown that the resolution of WGS with SNP typing is much higher than that provided by the previous 'gold standard' typing method, mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. WGS also links epidemiology to pathogen biology, delivering unprecedented insights into genome evolution, genome structure and gene content, including information on clinically important markers, such as resistance and virulence genes [
