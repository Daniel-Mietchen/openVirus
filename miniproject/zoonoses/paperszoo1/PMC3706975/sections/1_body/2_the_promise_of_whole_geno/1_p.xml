<p>WGS promises to deliver the ultimate high-resolution genotypic typing method [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Although we recognize that virologists pioneered the use of WGS for pathogen typing, targeting genomes small enough for WGS with traditional Sanger sequencing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], here we will concentrate on the application of WGS to outbreaks of bacterial infection, catalyzed by the recent arrival in the marketplace of a range of technologies that fall under the umbrella term 'high-throughput sequencing' (sometimes called 'next-generation sequencing') [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].
