<p>High-throughput sequencing, especially with the arrival of bench-top sequencers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], brings methodologies for bacterial WGS that are simple, quick and cheap enough to fall within the remit of an average-sized clinical or research laboratory. Through a single unified workflow, it becomes possible to identify all the features of interest of a bacterial isolate, speeding up the detection and investigation of outbreaks and delivering data in a portable digital format that can be shared internationally.
