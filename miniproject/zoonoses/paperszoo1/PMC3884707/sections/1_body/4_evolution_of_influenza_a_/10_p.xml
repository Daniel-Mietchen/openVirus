<p>The availability of large numbers of susceptible piglets and short overall life span of pigs raised for meat production also ensures that the host immune pressure on the virus is less marked in pigs than in humans. Therefore, less antigenic drift occurs in swine influenza viruses than is seen in human viruses (

Currently circulating A(H1N2) swine influenza viruses carry genes originating from humans related to prior reassortment events; however, the decreased immune pressure and slower rate of antigenic evolution in swine could facilitate swine acting as a reservoir for these previously circulating human strains. Populations exposed during the years of prevalence of prior strains would possess long-term immunity to antigenically similar strains, but there may be potential risks to human populations born after the years of prevalence of the older viruses (
