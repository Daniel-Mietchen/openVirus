<p>A(H1N2) influenza in swine is associated with respiratory illness and can cause sudden unexpected deaths in piglets. Modern farming systems have a higher potential than traditional farming for pig-to-pig transmission of virus to occur, because of the confined operation of intensive pig farms, where crowding results in more frequent and prolonged contact with infected swine. On farms that use traditional farming methods, influenza in swine is a seasonal illness; however, on farms that practice intensive swine farming, swine influenza infections occur year-round, peaking in the colder months (

Close contact among swine enhances the transmission of virus from swine-to-swine through the nasopharyngeal route by nasal secretions and aerosol droplets. Weather and environmental factors, along with swine husbandry practices of crowding, contribute to the persistence of the virus in the swine herds (
