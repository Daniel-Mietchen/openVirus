<p>In Egypt, Israel, and the United Kingdom, infected persons were mainly 5â€“15 years of age (

 </xref>). In the United Kingdom, which had the greatest number of reported influenza A(H1N2) cases, it is notable that few adults became infected, that only a small number of viruses were isolated from adults &gt;65 years of age, and that 75% of the viruses isolated were from children &lt;15 years of age. Because a similar number of children &lt;15 years of age also became infected with the A(H3N2) virus in the United Kingdom during the same period, it was considered that these children possibly had a primary infection (

 </xref>). Adults and vaccinated persons &gt;60 years of age appeared to have acquired protective immunity to the new subtype, presumably because a substantial proportion of the population had developed immunity either from previous infections by A(H1N1) or A(H3N2) viruses or by vaccination (

 </xref>). The vaccine in use at the time was expected to provide protection against the H1N2 subtype because it contained the H1 from A/New Caledonia/20/99 and the N2 from A/Moscow/10/99-like viruses, which were both genetically and antigenically related to the novel A(H1N2) viruses (
