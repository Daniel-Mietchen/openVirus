   <p>Note 1. All criteria apply to the geographical settings where the prioritization is conducted; the time-frame applicable to the requested epidemiological data should be defined prior to the process initiation and depend on a frequency with which pathogens are planned to be re-scored. The RKI conducted re-scoring relevant for Germany using a time-frame of 5 years. Indicated numerical thresholds apply to a country where the prioritization process is conducted; when the prioritization is conducted in other geographical settings, different thresholds may need to be considered.</p>

   <p>Note 2. Event is defined as the occurrence of a disease that is unusual with respect to a particular time, place or circumstances. For certain infectious diseases one case may be sufficient to constitute an event (e.g. polio virus). Public health actions are any kind of targeted actions aiming to identify the nature of the event and/or to apply control measures in response to the event occurrence.</p>
