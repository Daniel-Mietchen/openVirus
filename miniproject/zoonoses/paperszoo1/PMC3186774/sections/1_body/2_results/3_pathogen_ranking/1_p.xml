 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0025691-t003">Table 3</xref> presents the allocation of the pathogens into four priority groups according to their weighted total score. The highest priority group contains 26 (20.5%) pathogens. Among those are the pathogens that already received the highest priority in our previous prioritization process, such as HIV, 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> including methicillin resistant strains (MRSA), Influenza virus, Hepatitis C virus, 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Neisseria meningitidis, Legionella pneumophila</italic>, Varicella zoster virus (VZV). It additionally contains a number of pathogens responsible for nosocomial infections (
 <italic>e.g., Klebsiella</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> ssp., 
 <italic>Enterococcus</italic> spp.) and Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) that were not evaluated by us previously. 
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> and Hantavirus now belong to this group, while in 2004 both pathogens held medium priority positions. Other pathogens that were scored highest in 2004 were now assessed to be in the medium priority group (e.g., 
 <italic>Parvovirus B19</italic>).
