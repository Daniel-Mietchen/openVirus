<p>We analyzed weights assigned by the experts working in different areas of medicine: epidemiologists and public health specialists (n = 43), laboratory specialists (n = 35) and clinicians (n = 8) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0025691-t002">Table 2</xref>). Several criteria were assessed similarly across the groups (for example, the criteria “Prevention”, median weight of “8”, or “Trend”, median weight of “5”). At the same time, the criterion “Incidence” was seen as one of the most important by epidemiologists and public health experts (median weight of “8”) and laboratory specialists (median weight of “7”) but was seen as one of the least important by clinicians (median weight of “5.5”). Almost the reverse situation was observed with the criteria “Work and school absenteeism” and “Health care utilization” that were seen to be important by clinicians but perceived as of lower importance by the two other groups.
