 <xref rid="pone.0025691-Krause1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0025691-Krause2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> were further modified according to the feedback received from a broad group of different experts 
 <xref rid="pone.0025691-Gilsdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The newly suggested criteria and their three-tiered definitions were then reviewed by internal and external experts. The initial scoring of all pathogens according to each criterion was performed by the core team and internal experts from the RKI. The data supporting the scoring decisions and references to the data sources, or experts' own explanations were recorded in a structured format. The internal scoring was followed by a modified two-round Delphi consensus process (internal round with RKI and joint round with additional external experts) where scores were discussed.
