<p>To maintain a broader approach, we decided to evaluate pathogens rather than diseases for their importance. A list of pathogens was compiled according to the following selection criteria: (a) notifiable according to the German law for the control of infectious diseases 
 <xref rid="pone.0025691-Gesetz1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, (b) reportable within the European Union 
 <xref rid="pone.0025691-The1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, (c) reportable to the WHO under the International Health Regulations 
 <xref rid="pone.0025691-World1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, (d) agents with potential for deliberate release 
 <xref rid="pone.0025691-Tegnell1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and (e) pathogens represented in dedicated chapters in an established infectious diseases manual 
 <xref rid="pone.0025691-Heymann1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and occurring in Germany. Some pathogens were grouped together when biologically and clinically plausible. The list of pathogens was reviewed by the RKI experts and the Delphi process participants.
