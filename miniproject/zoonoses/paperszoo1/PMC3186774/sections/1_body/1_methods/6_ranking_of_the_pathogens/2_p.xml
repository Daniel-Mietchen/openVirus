<p>Following the experience from Canada 
 <xref rid="pone.0025691-Carter1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, we did not focus on the exact numerical score assigned to a pathogen. The interpretation of the final weighted scores and their corresponding sequential ranks was done in priority groups reflecting four priority levels (the highest, high, medium and low priority). The cut-off limits for the groups were based on the equal ranges of 25 (0–25, 26–50, 51–75, 76–100). Distribution of the pathogens was later compared with their positions in the 2004 priority list.
