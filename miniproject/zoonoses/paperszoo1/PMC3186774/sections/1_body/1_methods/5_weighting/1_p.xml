<p>Independent of the scoring, we invited a panel of external experts to assign a weight to each criterion. This invitation was sent to all 16 federal public health institutions, all 18 national reference centers, 49 consulting laboratories, 9 scientific and professional societies working in the area of control, prevention and research of infectious diseases and to all 72 participants of the 2006 online survey 
 <xref rid="pone.0025691-Gilsdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. External experts were asked to assign a value ranging from 0 to 10 to each criterion, thus reflecting the criterion's contextual importance for surveillance and epidemiological research. The value 0 reflects the lowest and 10 the highest level of importance of a criterion. More than one criterion could be assigned the same weight, similarly to techniques used in other prioritization exercises 
 <xref rid="pone.0025691-Berra1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The final criterion's weight was defined by the median value of all weights assigned by the participating experts.
