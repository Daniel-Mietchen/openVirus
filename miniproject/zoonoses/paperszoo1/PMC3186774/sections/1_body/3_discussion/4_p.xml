<p>RSV remains the most common respiratory pathogen in infants and young children worldwide, often resulting in serious lower respiratory tract infections 
 <xref rid="pone.0025691-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, yet a routine surveillance system for RSV based on virological testing of sentinel respiratory samples has only been initiated recently, and the burden of disease at the population level in Germany is largely unknown. The placement of RSV in the highest priority group is particularly unusual as pathogens causing diseases in limited population groups, i.e. here in young children, are often believed to be of a lower overall importance.
