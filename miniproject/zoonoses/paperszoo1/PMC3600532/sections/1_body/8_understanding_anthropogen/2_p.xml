<p>Additionally, attitudes to bats and bat conservation must be understood to prevent further spillover (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b152">Stone, 2011</xref>). However, when considering zoonotic infections, bat infection spillover events to humans are typically so infrequent that human effects on spillover dynamics may be difficult to detect. For example, did reduced encroachment and intermediate host contact in Malaysia, because of laws preventing fruit farming in pig farming areas, prevent further NiV outbreaks in Malaysia? In Bangladesh, where NiV outbreaks are almost annual, it may be easier to quantify if preventative measures are successful (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b152">Stone, 2011</xref>). However, neither spillover prevention method may be affecting bat infection dynamics themselves.
