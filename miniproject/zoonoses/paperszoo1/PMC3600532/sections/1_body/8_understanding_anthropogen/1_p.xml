<p>Although human–bat interactions are difficult to quantify, it appears that such interactions are increasing and occurring in numerous ways. Increasingly, humans encroach into bat habitats, and bats are utilizing artificial structures as roosts. Examples of bats utilizing artificial structures include 
 <italic>M. myotis</italic> (infected with AstV, CoV and AdV) roosting in homes in Europe (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Drexler et al., 2011</xref>) and RABV-infected 
 <italic>T. brasiliensis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. fuscus</italic> bats in bridges and houses in the Americas (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b166">Turmelle et al., 2010a</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b112">O’Shea et al., 2011a</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b113">b</xref>). CoV-infected 
 <italic>E. fuscus</italic> have been detected in homes in the United States also (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b109">Osborne et al., 2011</xref>). Several MARV spillover cases have been linked epidemiologically to cave activities such as tourism and mining (for review, see 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b163">Towner et al., 2009</xref>) and SARS-CoV is believed to have emerged because of the use of bats as food in live ‘wet’ markets in China (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b177">Woo et al., 2006</xref>). Nipah virus outbreaks have been linked to palm sap collection in Bangladesh and intensification of pig farming, alongside mango (
 <italic>Mangifera indica</italic>) production in Malaysia (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b106">Nahar et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">Khan et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b127">Pulliam et al., 2011</xref>). Hendra virus outbreaks have been suggested to be attributable to increased urban habituation of bats in Australia (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b121">Plowright et al., 2011</xref>). Recent surveys suggest that the numbers of harvested 
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> and 
 <italic>Eidolon</italic> bats (old world fruit bats) in Asia and Africa can be very high (and likely unsustainable, see 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">Kamins et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b155">Struebig et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Epstein et al., 2009</xref>). The harvested numbers estimated from single regions within nations suggest that human–bat interactions are occurring on an enormous scale throughout both continents. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Choisy and Rohani (2006)</xref> used theoretical models to predict that in many systems harvesting may increase the prevalence of infection and size of epidemic peaks in populations of harvested animals, because density-dependent recruitment (through increased survival of young) increases the susceptible pool and hence the size of the epidemic peak in populations. These hunting figures, coupled with the increasing use of human-built shelters by bats, mean that the dynamics at the human–bat population interface are a neglected area of research. We believe that this gap must be addressed if we are to understand spillover risk.
