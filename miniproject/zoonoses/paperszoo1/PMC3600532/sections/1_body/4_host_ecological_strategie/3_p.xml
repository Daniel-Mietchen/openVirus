 <italic>Lasionycteris noctivagans</italic> belongs to a unique group of long-distance latitudinal migrants that roost in trees throughout the year (‘tree bats’). Ecological strategies of tree bats differ from other bats in North America and likely drive RABV dynamics in unique ways. Although there were no dominant RABV variants, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b154">Streicker et al. (2010)</xref> show a propensity for tree bats to asymmetrically infect other bat hosts with RABV. RABV variants associated with tree bats are also among the most recent to emerge (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Franka et al., 2006</xref>). The winter habits of 
 <italic>L. noctivagans</italic> are poorly known, but intermittent torpor with frequent activity at lower latitudes is likely (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Geluso, 2007</xref>). Females migrate to higher latitudes in North America during spring and summer while males tend to migrate shorter distances and occupy mountainous regions (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Cryan, 2003</xref>), and small colonies of adult females and offspring are believed to form in summer (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b115">Parsons et al., 1986</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b93">Mattson et al., 1996</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Betts, 1998</xref>). Almost nothing is known about male group sizes (but they are presumed to be solitary) or survival rates. However, 
 <italic>L. noctivagans</italic> appears to be an ideal species to include in comparative studies to elucidate the effects of host ecology on pathogen virulence and test 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Boots and Sasaki’s (1999)</xref> theoretical work. Virulence factors and life history traits should also be compared to 
 <italic>P. subflavus</italic>, which has recently been described as a migratory species (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Fraser et al., 2012</xref>) and whose RABV variant also causes a disproportionately large proportion of human RABV cases in the USA.
