<p>Despite these theoretical studies, there is currently little empirical evidence for bat host ecology affecting pathogen virulence. The best example comes from RABV, where up to 30 different lineages of bat RABV may exist in the United States (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b94">Messenger et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b154">Streicker et al., 2010</xref>), and it appears that different bats maintain host-specific RABV variants within populations (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b145">Shankar et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b154">Streicker et al., 2010</xref>). Following the control of canine rabies, the majority of indigenously acquired human rabies infections in the United States are attributable to RABV variants associated with bats (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b94">Messenger et al., 2002</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b95">2003</xref>). It is unclear whether this mortality from bat rabies is from unrecognized exposure (e.g. humans being bitten during sleep and so not obtaining post-exposure prophylaxis) or is owing to differences in properties of RABV variants; however, some data are suggestive of the latter. Most human rabies deaths in the United States during the past decade are linked to variants associated with the silver-haired bat (
 <italic>Lasionycteris noctivagans;</italic> almost exclusively this species in the western United States) and 
 <italic>Perimyotis subflavus,</italic> the tricoloured bat (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">Krebs et al., 2000a</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80">b</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b95">Messenger et al., 2003</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Franka et al., 2006</xref>). In most cases of human rabies associated with bat RABVs, there is no definitive bite history (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b139">Rupprecht et al., 2002</xref>). The high proportion (74%) of human rabies cases attributable to bat RABV variants cannot be explained by a higher frequency of exposure to these species, as they tend to be non-synanthropic. Two hypotheses have been proposed to account for this phenomenon: 1) the RABV variants associated with 
 <italic>L. noctivagans</italic> and 
 <italic>P. subflavus</italic> are widespread among bat populations and moving through undetected host reservoirs; 2) these variants are more infectious than others. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b154">Streicker et al. (2010)</xref> provided evidence that neither variant dominates spillover infections into other bat hosts, as indicated by the relatively low proportion of cross-species infections detected with these RABV variants. Concerning the latter hypothesis, laboratory studies suggested higher 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> pathogenicity and neuroinvasiveness of the variant associated with 
 <italic>L. noctivagans</italic> than in a variant isolated from carnivores (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b101">Morimoto et al., 1996</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Dietzschold et al., 2000</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Faber et al., 2004</xref>); however, further studies are required because of the uncertain host origin of one of the viruses isolated from a human case (I. Kuzmin, personal communication). However, studies have not adequately investigated comparative pathogenicity 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> in bats relative to the diversity of bat RABV variants that persist naturally (but see 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b164">Turmelle, 2009</xref>).
