<p>Factors relating to the use of torpor and migration, as well as spatial structure, may select for different optimal levels of virulence in bats, which are long-lived and may acquire immunity to diseases such as RABV (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b167">Turmelle et al., 2010b</xref>). Intrahost pathogen replication is generally very temperature-dependent, and so seasonal torpor usually suspends it (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b141">Sadler and Enright, 1959</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b156">Sulkin et al., 1960</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b91">Luis and Hudson, 2006</xref>). Thus, species and sex differences in torpor behaviour may affect the coevolution of pathogen variants and their transmission rates and generation times (i.e. lineage birth and death processes). 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Boots et al. (2004)</xref> showed theoretically how large shifts in virulence may occur in pathogen populations. They modelled infection in long-lived species that acquire immunity following infection, and as a result of bi-stability in evolutionary dynamics caused by the host’s local contact or social population structure, large shifts in virulence could be predicted (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Boots et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Boots and Sasaki (1999)</xref> demonstrated that greater potential for long-distance spread of the pathogen can increase virulence by reducing local selective pressure on the pathogen by exhausting the supply of susceptible hosts from a population. More work, both theoretical and empirical, is required to understand these phenomena in natural host populations. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Gandon (2004)</xref> used theoretical models to predict the effect of multiple hosts on infection virulence. Interestingly, Gandon’s work predicts that if an infection adapts to the most abundant host, then it may well be maladapted to other, less frequent hosts, and this maladaptation may lead to avirulence or hypervirulence in the new or less common host. Thus, decreased inter-species transmission leads to pathogen adaptation to a more abundant host species, whereas increased inter-species transmission leads to more generalist virulence strategies. These theoretical findings may be especially interesting for studies of bats, because of the very large colony sizes that some bats can reach.
