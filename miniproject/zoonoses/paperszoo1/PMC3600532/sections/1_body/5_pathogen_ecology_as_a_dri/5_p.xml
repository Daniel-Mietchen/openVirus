<p>Large-scale analyses of epidemics, such as for dog rabies (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Drexler et al. (2011)</xref> have shown how multiple infections can be monitored at the population level for bats and serological data can be used to estimate parameters such as force of infection (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Hayman et al., 2012a</xref>). Other than steps proposed earlier to fill these data gaps that exist for almost all bat systems, it is likely necessary that further studies of within-host dynamics, and therefore experimental studies, are necessary to inform how pathogen ecology affects infection dynamics. Experimentally measuring pathogen shedding and transmission of infections with different ecological strategies in a single host may determine whether those with higher virulence (e.g. mortality or morbidity rates in hosts) have higher shedding, whereas those with lower virulence have lower shedding, but less fitness cost. These data can thus inform interpretation of field data and be used in mechanistic models.
