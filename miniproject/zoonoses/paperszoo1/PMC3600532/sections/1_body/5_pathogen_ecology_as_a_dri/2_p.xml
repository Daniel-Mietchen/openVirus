<p>There is little empirical evidence for differences in virulence among viruses of the same genus in their bat hosts, although the phenomenon of differing virulence among virus variants classified taxonomically as a single species is nearly universal. Studies on LBV by 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b92">Markotter et al. (2009)</xref> demonstrated variable virulence among isolates when mice were challenged with different LBV isolates, as did studies with silver-haired bat RABV (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Dietzschold et al., 2000</xref>). Evidence of differing virulence in humans exists for EBOV, with Reston and Cote dâ€™Ivoire ebolaviruses not known to have caused fatal human infections (for review, see 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b100">Morikawa et al., 2007</xref>), whereas other EBOV viruses and MARV have case fatality rates up to 90%. However, the virulence of these viruses in bats (the putative reservoirs) is less well described, but may be low (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b86">Leroy et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b162">Towner et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, experimental studies of henipaviruses in bat hosts have shown that in laboratory situations these viruses do not exhibit high virulence in their putative reservoir hosts (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b174">Williamson et al., 1998</xref>, Williamson et al., 2000; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Halpin et al., 2011</xref>) in contrast to their impacts on other species.
