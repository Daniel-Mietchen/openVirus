<p>It is possible that the dramatic differences in migration, coloniality and torpor among bat hosts may lead to the evolution of different pathogen adaptation strategies. The differences in pathogen infection strategies (e.g. mode of transmission and virulence) and pathogen variants associated with particular hosts may drive disease dynamics beyond differences in the ecology of hosts themselves.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b162">Towner et al., 2007</xref>). RNA viruses have a high capacity for mutation compared with DNA viruses due especially to the low proofreading ability of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that controls replication (but see 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Firth et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, mutations can appear and be fixed in a short period of time relative to the host’s evolutionary time frame (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b102">Moya et al., 2004</xref>). Variation in virulence, infectivity and other important processes can therefore potentially be altered within a relatively short evolutionary timescale and change the infection dynamics. However, the pathogen’s ecology must also balance factors that affect transmission, such as virulence, epidemiological ‘burn-out’ and mechanisms for persistence in complex host populations (e.g.
