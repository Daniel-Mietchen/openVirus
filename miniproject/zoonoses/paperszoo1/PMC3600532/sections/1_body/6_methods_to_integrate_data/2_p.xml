<p>Cyclical changes in contact and transmission rates have been suggested as the causative mechanism of temporal patterns for a variety of diseases and have been investigated using modelling approaches (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Begon et al., 2003</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">Box 1</xref>) should, therefore, integrate hypotheses regarding seasonal behaviours, including migration, coloniality and torpor use, in order to determine the effects of seasonality on disease dynamics. This approach has helped reveal the relative importance of transmission mechanisms in a plague prairie dog system (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">George et al., 2011</xref>). Another set of bat RABV models has been developed, but focuses largely on more detailed immunological hypotheses (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">2008</xref>), whereas other models demonstrate how altered migration behaviour may result in declining immunity within specific colonies, which can lead to more explosive HeV epidemics (
