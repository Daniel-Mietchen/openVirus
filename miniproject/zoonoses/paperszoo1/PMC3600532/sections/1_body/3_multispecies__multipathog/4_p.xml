<p>Research programmes that focus on multiparasite and/or multihost systems, following the approach described previously, will help advance our understanding of the ecology of bat diseases. Particular care is needed to consider the markedly reduced statistical power available when considering the dynamics of co-infections, and modelling to help plan empirical data collection would be particularly beneficial for such studies (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b159">Telfer et al. (2010)</xref>. Additionally, more detailed molecular techniques and robust co-evolutionary studies could be incorporated that tease out cross-species transmission events (e.g. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Cui et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b154">Streicker et al., 2010</xref>) and infection dynamics (e.g. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Drexler et al., 2011</xref>).
