<p>From a multihost community perspective, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Davies and Pedersen (2008)</xref> found that host-relatedness and geographical range overlap were significant predictors of pathogen sharing among primates. Some viruses, notably RABV, are promiscuous, infecting multiple host species. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b154">Streicker et al. (2010)</xref> demonstrated that although RABV variants predominantly circulate within single host species, they are able to spill over into other species. Similar to 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Davies and Pedersen (2008)</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b154">Streicker et al. (2010)</xref> documented highly asymmetrical patterns of cross-species RABV transmission in the North American bat fauna, with host-relatedness and geographical range overlap being the strongest predictors of cross-species transmission, thus also suggesting an important influence of host sympatry. Whether these factors affect cross-species transmission of other lyssaviruses within Chiroptera, or from bats to other mammals, is not known, because isolations are often few and serological findings may be due to cross-reactivity between related species or variants, complicating interpretation (e.g. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b178">Wright et al., 2010</xref>). European bat lyssaviruses 1 and 2 (EBLV-1, EBLV-2) appear to show a very narrow host range in Europe. EBLV-1 circulates in Serotine bats (
 <italic>Eptesicus serotinus</italic>) and EBLV-2 in Daubenton’s bat (
 <italic>Myotis daubentonii</italic>); this host fidelity is, however, not complete, as the first isolation of EBLV-2 was from a Pond bat (
 <italic>Myotis dasycneme</italic>), and in Spain, EBLV-1 sequences have been recovered from several bat species (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b143">Serra-Cobo et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Amengual et al., 2007</xref>). The importance of cross-species transmission events in seasonally changing communities may vary with respect to pathogen or variants of a pathogen, but is not really clear for any system. In some cases, infection cycles may be maintained in co-roosting species without cross-species transmission. For example, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b85">Kuzmin et al. (2011)</xref> discovered that Commerson’s leaf-nosed bat (
 <italic>Hipposideros commersoni</italic>) is a possible reservoir of Shimoni bat virus (SHIBV, a lyssavirus), while Egyptian fruit bats (
 <italic>Rousettus aegyptiacus</italic>) and 
 <italic>Miniopterus</italic> spp. bats in the same caves were seropositive against Lagos bat virus (LBV) and West Caucasian bat virus (WCBV) (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b84">Kuzmin et al., 2008b</xref>), thus suggesting that at least for these lyssaviruses, infections may circulate among specific host species and transmission may be minimal among sympatric bats. Moreover, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Cui et al. (2007)</xref> reported clustering of CoV sequences from geographically separated Vespertilionid bats of the same species, even for co-roosting bats. Coronaviruses from Rhinolophidae bats, however, did not share this feature and appear to have undergone a number of host shifts.
