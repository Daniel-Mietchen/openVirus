<p>Far wider use of capture–recapture techniques is required to obtain estimates of host survival and infection-related parameters. While manual capture has distinct advantages, such as allowing sampling of individuals to obtain infection-related data, it may be impractical in many instances. Thus, wider use of passive integrated responders (PIT; microchips) and readers (see

Thus, improved micro-technologies are required to reduce the size of the transmitters without compromising battery capacity. These technologies are also valuable to locate the sites bats migrate to or hibernate in.
