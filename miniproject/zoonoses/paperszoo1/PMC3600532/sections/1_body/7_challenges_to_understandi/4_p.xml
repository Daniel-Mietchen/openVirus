<p>The quantification of seasonal and sex differences in coloniality, torpor and migration is difficult because of peculiarities in the ecology and life histories of bats themselves. Typically, adequate information only exists for parts of the year (one particular season; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Hayman et al., 2012a</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">b</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Drexler et al., 2011</xref>) or one particular sex (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b172">Weller et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Drexler et al., 2011</xref>). For example, information exists on summer colony sizes of 
 <italic>E. fuscus</italic> and activity patterns of females, but not males; however, population genetic studies have shed some light on sex-biased patterns of dispersal in this species (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b105">Nadin-Davis et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b168">Turmelle et al., 2011</xref>). For other species, such as 
 <italic>E. helvum,</italic> migration patterns are largely unknown, so information is only available from colonies that are conspicuous for parts of the year (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b148">Sorensen and Halberg, 2001</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b135">Richter and Cumming, 2006</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b136">2008</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">Hayman et al., 2010</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">2012a</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">b</xref>). Studying non-migratory colonies of some species may provide insight into the relative effects of migration and other ecological factors (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b116">Peel et al., 2012</xref>). However, group and population sizes themselves may be very difficult to determine (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b81">Kunz, 2003</xref>), and roosting dynamics may be hard to quantify. Individuals in large colonies are difficult to identify and count, and small colonies may be inconspicuous (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b172">Weller et al., 2009</xref>). Often, only roosting or foraging behaviour is known, and tracking over long distances requires more labour-intensive methods, such as tagging with wing bands or following bats fitted with radio transmitters using fixed-wing aircraft (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Cryan and Diehl, 2009</xref>). Precise GPS or satellite tracking systems are currently too large for long-distance tracking of all but the largest bat species (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b147">Smith et al., 2011</xref>), although these studies have shed light on movement of 
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> in the context of NiV and HeV dynamics (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Epstein et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Breed et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b147">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). The use of infrared video cameras has recently been utilized to monitor roost entrances and count the number of bats that emerge each night and associated host thermal energetic profiles (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">Hristov et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b131">Reichard et al., 2010a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b132">2010b</xref>), however, these systems are costly and in their infancy with respect to general use.
