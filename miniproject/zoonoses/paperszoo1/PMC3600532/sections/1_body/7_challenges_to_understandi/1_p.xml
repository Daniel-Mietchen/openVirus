<p>There are substantial difficulties in performing these integrated and multidisciplinary studies in most batâ€“pathogen systems, including those associated with pathogen detection, time series data collection and significant variation in host ecological parameters, both within and among species. The detection of infections with low prevalence, such as those caused by some RNA viruses, can be very difficult and may require non-random sampling, very large sample sizes, specialized techniques or a combination of all three (e.g. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b86">Leroy et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b84">Kuzmin et al., 2008b</xref>). The detection of EBOV RNA in bats is one clear example (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b86">Leroy et al., 2005</xref>). It took decades to discover EBOV RNA in bats, despite intensive efforts and epidemiological and experimental evidence linking the infection to bats (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b157">Swanepoel et al., 1996</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b97">Monath, 1999</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b123">Pourrut et al., 2005</xref>), and to date, the viruses are yet to be isolated by cell culture from any bat. Furthermore, although bats were strongly implicated as reservoirs to SARS-like CoVs and diverse lineages of CoVs have been detected from bats globally, to date there has been no CoV isolate from bats because of the non-permissive nature of extant cell culture systems.
