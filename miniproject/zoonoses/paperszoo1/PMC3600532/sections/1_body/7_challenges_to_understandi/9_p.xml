<p>For better interpretation of infection-related data, immunological tools such as bat-specific reagents, for example, are necessary to be able to understand bat immune responses to infection (whether from field or experimental data). Permissive bat cell lines (e.g. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Crameri et al., 2009</xref>) may be necessary for isolation of viruses, and experimental studies are necessary to understand the within-host dynamics and pathogenesis of infections in bats and modes of transmission. Highly variable serological responses have been observed among individual bats in experimental studies, meaning interpretation of results is not always straightforward (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b167">Turmelle et al., 2010b</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Halpin et al., 2011</xref>). These experimental studies must be designed to better understand empirical field data (e.g. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b156">Sulkin et al., 1960</xref>). In particular, baseline estimates of antibody responses from naive bats (e.g. captive bred) are necessary to better interpret serological results from field studies (see 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b174">Williamson et al., 1998</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b175">2000</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b167">Turmelle et al., 2010b</xref>). Regarding bat immune responses, typically adaptive responses are measured because tools are available to measure antibody responses. However, substantial advancements in the understanding of bat infection ecology will be made once innate immune responses are understood. This is particularly important for infections such as CoV, filoviruses and henipaviruses, which apparently do not cause overt disease in bats. Cytokine expression profiles, for example, will provide a much deeper understanding of bat immune responses following infection (for an example of methods, see 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b140">Sadeghi et al., 2011</xref>).
