<p>Time series data are requisite for tackling complexities in inter-annual variation in disease ecology, but efforts to collect them can be immense. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Drexler et al. (2011)</xref> studied a maternity colony of 
 <italic>M. myotis</italic> bats in the attic of a private house in a suburban neighbourhood in Germany, during 2008, 2009 and 2010. This was an elegant study; however, it was only performed on a single maternity colony and only for a short period of each year; furthermore, samples and data were only available at the population scale. Similar population-level studies have been reported for HeV and NiV in Australia and Thailand (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Field et al., 2011</xref>). All three of these studies, however, captured seasonality in viral shedding. Case submission data have also been used to capture seasonality, such as for RABV submissions used by 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">George et al. (2011)</xref>; however, these data are biased (see 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b179">Klug et al. 2011</xref>) and unlikely to be relevant for infections with low mortality in the host. Studies looking for individuals shedding infection have been less successful. For example, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Hayman et al. (2012a)</xref> failed to detect lyssavirus RNA in oral swabs from 796 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> bats sampled over four years. Despite seemingly large overall sample size, the individual sampling events were unlikely to detect low infection prevalence and were further reduced when the authors accounted for the testing process sensitivity. If detection of the infection can be difficult, determination of the mode of transmission, periods of infectiousness and rates of recovery can be even more challenging and often require experimental studies. However, experimental studies in bats, such as those with RABV and other lyssaviruses (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b157">Swanepoel et al., 1996</xref>) and HeV (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b174">Williamson et al., 1998</xref>) can be very costly, usually involve small sample sizes and highlight the complexities of host response to infection (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Franka et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b167">Turmelle et al., 2010b</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Halpin et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, measuring morbidity and mortality in animals experimentally infected with potentially highly pathogenic infection can raise difficult ethical questions. Although not without their own ethical issues, initially, standard mouse models may be instructive, because they are of known infection history, genetically homologous (thus reducing host heterogeneity that might obscure mechanistic trends), and there are a range of immune markers available that do not exist for bats; however, studies using mice will not address important questions on dynamics of infection in natural hosts. Further difficulties exist in testing some hypotheses, because though apparently widespread in bats, infection such as CoVs and AstV are yet to have been propagated in the laboratory.
