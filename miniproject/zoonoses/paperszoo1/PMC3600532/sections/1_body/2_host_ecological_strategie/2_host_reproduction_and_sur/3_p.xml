<p>In modelling RABV in big brown bats (
 <italic>Eptesicus fuscus</italic>) in Colorado, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">George et al. (2011)</xref> found that interaction between the timing of the annual birth pulse and the RABV incubation period (extending through torpor) was important for RABV perpetuation in the bat population. Host survival rates were important, particularly during hibernation when lower mortality rates facilitated host population persistence, as was the seasonal pulse of susceptible juveniles entering the population in summer (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b113">2011b</xref>). Thus, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">George et al. (2011)</xref> were able to show that seasonality in both births and deaths were important factors in RABV persistence

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b121">Plowright et al. (2011)</xref> examined the transmission dynamics of HeV in Australian pteropid bats using a mathematical model parameterized with field and laboratory data. The authors speculated in models of HeV in Australia that it was population connectivity and immunity that played a key role in the infection dynamics, rather than a simple influx of naïve young. It is noteworthy that incorporating waning maternal immunity into models describing HeV–
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> interactions provided a better fit to the data, therefore demonstrating that not only does the influx of naïve young affect disease dynamics, but that the rate of inflow of susceptible hosts is important in driving pathogen dynamics.
