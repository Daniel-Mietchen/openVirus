<p>Many species of bats in both temperate and tropical zones exhibit highly synchronized parturition (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Anderson and May, 1979</xref>). However, the role and strength of different host reproduction strategies on disease dynamics are as yet unknown, and only rare examples exist in the literature. Simulations of spatial models of raccoon rabies in the USA, a relatively well-studied system, suggest that increasing seasonality in births as latitude increases leads to increasingly asynchronous rabies dynamics (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">Hosseini et al. (2004)</xref> were able to demonstrate that seasonal breeding of house finches (
 <italic>Carpodacus mexicanus</italic>), along with seasonal social aggregation and partial immunity, was key in explaining the specific semi-annual pattern of prevalence seen in 
 <italic>Mycoplasma gallisepticum</italic> conjunctivitis. Many bat species also show marked differences between the sexes in distribution and behaviour during the warmer months, including the use of torpor (discussed below) and degree of coloniality (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b142">Senior et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b172">Weller et al., 2009</xref>). Sex differences in behaviour and distribution of bats during times of year when the potential for disease transmission is greatest may also have important implications for disease dynamics, although typically behaviour and population demographic data exist for only a single sex (
