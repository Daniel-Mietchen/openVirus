<p>Unlike other emerging diseases of bat origin, there is considerable background field and laboratory information on bat RABV; however, even with this relative wealth of information, it was only recently that attempts were made to understand how host ecological strategies influence infection maintenance (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b166">Turmelle et al. (2010a)</xref> showed empirically contrasting temporal patterns of RABV exposure in 
 <italic>Tadarida brasiliensis</italic> at different types of roosts during the reproduction season, which suggested increased RABV exposure after parturition in cave colonies. Specifically, cave colonies in this system are known to harbour up to a million individual bats (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Betke et al., 2008</xref>), mostly reproductively active females, leading to a short window of time where population size doubles following parturition, and contact rates between adult and newborn bats are elevated during early lactation. Individual- and roost-level variation in physiological stress was also demonstrated in this system (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Allen et al., 2011</xref>), although direct impacts of stress on susceptibility or immune response of bats to RABV or other pathogen infections have not been well characterized to date (but see 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b146">Smith, 1981</xref>).
