<p>Assuming a metapopulation model of connectivity, models of HeV predicted that decreased migration of 
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> bats in Australia, possibly because of urbanization and changes in food availability, could influence the intensity and duration of HeV epidemics (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b121">Plowright et al., 2011</xref>). Decreased migration could give rise to more intense but shorter HeV outbreaks after local viral reintroduction. The mechanism proposed for such an increase in epidemic intensity was that decreased bat migratory behaviour could lead to a decline in transmission between colonies and, therefore, reduced inter-colony exposures and resulting immunity within colonies. This proposed loss of immunity leads to increased epidemic size and more rapid fade-out once infection is re-introduced into a susceptible colony. Thus, reduced migration and population connectivity were suggested as a mechanism that could increase the amplitude of the seasonal outbreaks and increase the probability of spillover. This relationship may be relevant to a variety of bat-associated pathogens, where hosts exist as a metapopulation and humans alter connectivity of populations.
