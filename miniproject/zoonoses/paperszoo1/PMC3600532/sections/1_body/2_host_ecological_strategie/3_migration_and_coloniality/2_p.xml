<p>Seasonal variation in the prevalence of infection is likely impacted by changes in density during migration or colony formation, which affect contact rates and thus disease dynamics (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Altizer et al., 2011</xref>). Some of the clearest examples of how seasonality and ‘coloniality’ may affect and drive infection dynamics come from human systems. The episodic dynamics of measles epidemics in the absence of vaccination, for example, driven by school terms (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Finkenstadt et al., 1998</xref>) or fluctuating agrarian systems (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Ferrari et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Bharti et al., 2011</xref>) suggest changes in contact rates of susceptible hosts may be key in driving infection dynamics. As mentioned, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">Hosseini et al. (2004)</xref> also demonstrated that seasonality in coloniality was important for predicting 
 <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> dynamics in house finches. Although not zoonotic, in bat systems 
 <italic>G. destructans</italic> dynamics and the current epidemic in North America appear to be especially driven by coloniality and migration (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Frick et al., 2010</xref>). Comparative studies may help to elucidate the impact of variation in seasonal ecologies among or within species affected by the same species or variant of pathogen. For example, the seasonality in aggregation and population dynamics of big brown bats in relation to maintenance of RABV in temperate Colorado (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">George et al., 2011</xref>) could differ in warm temperate and tropical areas where the host species also occurs (
