<p>Longitudinal infection and demographic data are required to understand how birth, survival, coloniality, migration and torpor affect infection dynamics within bat populations. Frequently, researchers monitor one part of the process, such as survival (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b114">Papadatou et al., 2011</xref>), infection (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Drexler et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Field et al., 2011</xref>) or seroprevalence (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Breed et al., 2011</xref>). However, some studies captured long-term longitudinal data. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Hayman et al. (2012a</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">b)</xref> concurrently monitored each in 
 <italic>Eidolon helvum</italic> African fruit bats, and 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">George et al. (2011)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b121">Plowright et al. (2011)</xref> synthesized demographic data with infection-related data from field and laboratory studies to give insights into potential mechanisms that drive infection dynamics. Capture–recapture data should be collected to allow estimation of both demographic parameters (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b112">O’Shea et al., 2011a</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b113">b</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b114">Papadatou et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Hayman et al., 2012b</xref>), while age-specific infection data are particularly useful because they allow such estimation of factors, such as force of infection (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Hayman et al., 2012a</xref>). Similarly, host population genetic data can be informative to measure connectivity between bat populations, as has been done for NiV and HeV (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b107">Olival, 2008</xref>). Studies should also attempt to capture the seasonal variation, such as pre-, during- and post-parturition and migration or hibernation seasons, and consider the potential effects of often very different migratory behaviours between male and female bats of some species (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b172">Weller et al., 2009</xref>). In all cases, however, longitudinal sampling of individuals in experimental and/or captive studies may be required to interpret field-related data. For example, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b156">Sulkin et al. (1960)</xref> demonstrated that torpor prevents viral replication for the duration of hibernation, and, along with describing antibody titre decays, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b130">Rahman et al. (2011)</xref> demonstrate that recrudescence of NiV may occur in bats, which may be used to interpret field data. Statistical and mechanistic models, such as susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)-based models (see 
 <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">Box 1</xref>), can then be used on these data to determine which factors best predict infection dynamics. Comparison of mechanistic models, using careful statistical approaches to determine model fitting (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b133">Restif et al., in press</xref>), may be required to ascertain whether seasonal birth pulses or changes in contact rates, modelled as step functions (e.g. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Duke-Sylvester et al., 2011</xref>) or seasonal forcing (e.g. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">Hosseini et al., 2004</xref>) for example, drive infection dynamics. Meta-population models may be required to capture all aspects of the system (e.g. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b121">Plowright et al., 2011</xref>), but must also take into account what is observed in small isolated populations (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b116">Peel et al., 2012</xref>).
