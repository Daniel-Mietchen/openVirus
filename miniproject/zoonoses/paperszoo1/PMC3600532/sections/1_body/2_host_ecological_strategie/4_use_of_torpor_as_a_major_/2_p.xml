<p>Multidisciplinary studies, using both experimental data and integrative mathematical models, can be used to determine the importance of temporal changes in torpor use in driving temporal changes in infection prevalence, as was done by 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">George et al. (2011)</xref>. We argue that the effects of both torpor and changes in contact rates during migration and colony formation might only be differentiated using mechanistic process models. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">George et al. (2011)</xref> found a clear indication for torpor being a key factor in allowing perpetuation of RABV through the hibernation period, through prolonged incubation period and reduced mortality; this enabled RABV infection to persist in the population until susceptible individuals from the annual birth pulse could become infected and continue the cycle. However, RABV is also capable of perpetuating in a variety of bat hosts that are not known to utilize torpor, and even the same host species under varied ecological circumstances (i.e. warmer tropical climates), which begs the question of which factors allow RABV to avoid population fade-out under these circumstances (see
