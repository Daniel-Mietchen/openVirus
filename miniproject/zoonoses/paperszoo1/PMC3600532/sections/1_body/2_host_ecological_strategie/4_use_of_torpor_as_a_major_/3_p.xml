<p>An interesting but non-zoonotic example of the importance of torpor on pathogen dynamics is white-nose syndrome (WNS) in bats. The associated fungus 
 <italic>G. destructans</italic> has been detected in 19 US states and two Canadian provinces, and WNS disease has been linked to the deaths of more than five million bats in North America (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Frick et al., 2010</xref>). The causative psychrophilic (cold-loving) fungus colonizes the skin causing devastating lesions by eroding, digesting and replacing living skin tissues with the large surface areas of bat wings being the primary target of infection (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Cryan et al., 2010</xref>). Hibernation depresses all physiological processes, including immunological processes (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Bouma et al., 2010</xref>), and thus during deep torpor 
 <italic>G. destructans</italic>, which grows only at temperatures &lt;20Â°C, is able to replicate more efficiently than would be possible in a bat that has aroused or does not utilize torpor to the same degree. Thus, although 
 <italic>G. destructans</italic> may show the opposite temperature pattern of infection to RNA viruses, it emphasizes the potential importance of torpor on infection dynamics.
