<p>Many species of bats are facultative heterotherms capable of using deep torpor during periods of physiological stress to offset energy and water deficits (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b149">Speakman and Thomas, 2003</xref>). For tropical species, reliance on short-term and shallow torpor to offset energy deficits is less well described and may be more prevalent than is currently appreciated (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b151">Stawski et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b150">Stawski and Geiser, 2010</xref>). The role of torpor in infection dynamics is largely unstudied (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Bouma et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b99">Moore et al., 2011</xref>). Species of bats that differ in their use of migration also often differ in their use of torpor. Torpor typically reduces pathogen replication rates (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b156">Sulkin et al., 1960</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b91">Luis and Hudson, 2006</xref>) and hence lengthens incubation periods (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Bouma et al., 2010</xref>) and prevents host contact; these in turn influence the seasonal force of infection (the rate at which susceptible individuals contract infection). Additionally, it likely provides an efficient mechanism for overwintering of some infections.
