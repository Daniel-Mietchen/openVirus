<p>As anthropogenic activities have been identified as the cause of a significant majority of outbreaks,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref> it is essential to fully understand the mechanisms driving contacts between wildlife and the human population as well as species-jumping infections to set up public health information campaigns. On the contrary, efforts to conserve areas rich in wildlife diversity (13 National Parks were created in 2002 in Gabon) by reducing anthropogenic activity may have an added value in reducing the likelihood of future zoonotic disease emergence in these areas.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref> EIDs in free-living wild animals can be classified into three major groups on the basis of key epizootiological criteria:
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref> (i) EIDs associated with ‘spill-over’ from domestic animals to wildlife populations living in proximity; (ii) EIDs related directly to human intervention, via host or parasite translocations; and (iii) EIDs with no overt human or domestic animal involvement. These phenomena have two major biological implications: first, many wildlife species are reservoirs of pathogens that threaten domestic animal and human health; second, wildlife EIDs pose a substantial threat to the conservation of global biodiversity, with for example the disappearance of the most great ape populations in protected areas in Central Africa after the 2002–2003 ebola virus outbreaks.
