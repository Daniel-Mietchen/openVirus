<p>Tropical forests form the ecosystem harboring the highest species richness of all terrestrial ecosystems and shelter almost 50% of the total global biodiversity.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref> This includes wildlife, flora, multi-cellular organisms as well as an immense diversity of pathogens including bacteria, parasites and viruses. Actually, there is a latitudinal spatial gradient of pathogenic species richness increasing towards the Equator. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref> After the Amazonian Basin, the Congo basin in Central Africa has the world's second largest contiguous block of tropical rainforest, which encompasses many areas that remain largely undisturbed, due in large part to low human population densities and the remoteness of interior rainforests. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref> As wildlife host species richness is a good predictor for the emergence of zoonotic EIDs with a wildlife origin,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref> Central Africa in general, and Gabon in particular are privileged areas for the emergence of zoonotic EIDs.
