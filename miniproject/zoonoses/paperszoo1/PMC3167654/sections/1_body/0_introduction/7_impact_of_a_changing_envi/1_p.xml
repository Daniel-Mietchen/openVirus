<p>Climatic variations and extreme weather events have a profound impact on infectious diseases:
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0056">56</xref> for example, the emergence of vector-borne diseases is highly sensitive to changes in environmental conditions (rainfall, temperature, severe weather events).
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0056">56</xref> Indeed arthropod vectors (that is mosquito, ticks…) are devoid of thermostatic mechanisms, hence reproduction and survival rates are strongly affected by fluctuations in temperature.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0037">37</xref> A rise in arthropodborne EID events due to climate anomalies has been observed during the 1990's.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref> Average global temperatures are predicted to be 1.0–3.51
 <sup>?</sup>C by 2100.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0057">57</xref> Further epidemic events of vector-borne diseases due to climate change are, therefore, to be expected.
