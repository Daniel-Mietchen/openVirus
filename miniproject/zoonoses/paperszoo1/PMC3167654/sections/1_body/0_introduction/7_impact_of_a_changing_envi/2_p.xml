<p>Concerning other zoonotic infectious diseases like ebola, marburg or RVF, too little information is available concerning their ecology to be able to assess the impact of climate changes on the potential emergence or re-emergence of these diseases. However some preliminary reports show a strong association between wet environment (rainfall and hydrographic conditions directly dependent on climate and climate change) and the recent reemergence of ebola fever in Gabon and RDC.
