   <p>The OCEAC (Organisation de coordination pour la lute contre les endémies en Afrique Centrale) is an organization of coordination and cooperation to fight major endemic diseases in Central Africa. Created in 1963, in Yaounde, by the determination of the health ministers of Cameroon, Congo, Gabon, CAR and Chad, it was originally known as the OCCGEAC until 1965. The Equatorial Guinea joined later the OCEAC. Its goals are to (1) coordinate public health policies and actions in Central African region, (2) participate in the training of the medical staff of member countries of the organization, (3) coordinate applied research projects undertaken by national institutions, (4) implement missions of expertise in the different areas of health sciences, (5) contribute to the public health promotion in the member countries and (6) support the actions undertaken in response to health emergencies. Today OCEAC is in charge of regional health programs and projects like the Sub Regional Program against HIV/AIDS, the Harmonization Program for Pharmaceutical Policy, the Regional Program to fight human African trypanosomiasis and research projects on malaria.</p>

   <p>The CEMAC (Communauté Économique des États d'Afrique Centrale—Economic Community of Central African States) is an economic community of the African Union for promotion of regional economic co-operation in Central Africa. Member countries include Gabon, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, CAR, Cameroon and Chad. It ‘aims to achieve collective autonomy, raise the standard of living of its populations and maintain economic stability through harmonious cooperation’. It was established in 1983 and its ultimate goal is to establish a Central African Common Market. However CEMAC may have a role in the public health systems in Central Africa: in 2009, CEMAC signed a memorandum of understanding with Germany, which donated a 23 million euro grant for the prevention of HIV in Central Africa.</p>
