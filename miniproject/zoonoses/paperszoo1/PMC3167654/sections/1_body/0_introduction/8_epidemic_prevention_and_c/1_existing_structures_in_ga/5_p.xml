   <p>The CIRMF (International Medical Research Centre of Franceville), a Gabonese world-renowned scientific research center, inaugurated in 1979, the CIRMF had for an initial focus to study the reasons for infertility in Central African populations. By the mid 1980s, CIRMF broadened its research to focus also on tropical diseases including HIV, trypanosomiasis and malaria. More recently CIRMF concentrated also on EIDs including the deadly ebola and marburg viruses, CHIKV and DENV.
