<p>In Gabon, rainforests cover âˆ¼80% of the territory.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">23</xref> These forests are known for their rich biodiversity of animal and plant species.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">23</xref> The human population, estimated at 1.5 million,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">24</xref> lives more in cities (54%) than in rural areas.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">25</xref> Gabon's economy has relied in the past mainly on petroleum exports, forest exploitation, and mining activities. Forest habitats are now exploited by logging and mining companies, tourism and hunting activities, which produce about 17,500 metric tons per year of game meat. Altogether these human incursions in Gabonese forests for exploitation purposes lead to intensified contacts between humans and wildlife and generate a risk of emergence of zoonotic diseases.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">26</xref> This risk is not strictly restricted to the forest but exists countrywide as the urban demand for bush-meat in Gabon is important &gt;5 kg/per/year
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">27</xref>. Indeed, every Gabonese city has traditional and local food markets where fresh and smoked bush-meat coming from all around the country are available. Potential EIDs due to wildlife in Gabon are thereby plentiful and need to be inventoried.
