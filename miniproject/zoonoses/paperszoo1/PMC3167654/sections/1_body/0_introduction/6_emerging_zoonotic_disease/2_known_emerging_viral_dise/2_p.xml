<p>During the past two decades, several outbreaks of these zoonotic viral diseases have been reported in Gabon. All of them had a major impact on the public health:
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>Zaïre ebola virus (ZEBOV): in Gabon, ZEBOV outbreaks occurred in 1994, 1996, 1997 and 2001;29 primary human cases were generally contaminated by direct contact with dead wild animals, such as great apes (chimpanzee and gorilla), which are highly susceptible to the disease, and therefore human outbreaks were often preceded by an animal epizootic (great apes). Since the first recorded outbreak in 1976, 20 human epidemics have occurred in Central Africa
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">29</xref>, 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0030">30</xref> with three recent outbreaks in RDC and Uganda in 2007 and 2008.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV): CHIKV has recently dispersed to new regions of the world including Gabon where two outbreaks in 2006 and 2007 mainly hit the capital, Libreville.
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0031">31</xref>, 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0032">32</xref> A total of 17,618 human cases were reported.33 The outbreaks appeared concomitantly with the spread in peridomestic urban areas of 
    <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, the mosquito known as the main vector of the most recent epidemics of CHIKV.
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">34</xref> CHIKV disease had reemerged in 2001–2003
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0035">35</xref> in the Indian Ocean after a 20-year gap with a new epidemiological pattern including A. 
    <italic>albopictus</italic> as the main vector of epidemics and an adapted virus strain presenting an original mutation suspected to be responsible for an increase of pathogenicity.

  <list-item>
   <p>Dengue virus (DENV): a DENV outbreak occurred in Gabon simultaneously with the CHIKV outbreak in 2007,
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">33</xref> and concurrent infections of DENV and CHIKV have been reported in towns affected by the two outbreaks.
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">34</xref> Dengue fever and the severe form of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), are caused by the world's most prevalent mosquito-borne virus.
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0037">37</xref> DENV is carried by 
    <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquito, which is strongly affected by ecological and human drivers, but also influenced by climate (temperature, humidity and solar radiation).
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0037">37</xref> Although DENV was known to circulate among mosquitoes within limited areas in West Africa and East Africa, dengue fever first emerged among the African population during the epidemic of Nigeria in 1964–1968,
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0038">38</xref> then in Senegal in 1980
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0039">39</xref> and Burkina Faso and Kenya in 1982.
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0040">40</xref>, 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0041">41</xref> Since then epidemic manifestations were recorded in East Africa (Mozambique, Sudan, Djibouti, Somalia, Eritrea), in Senegal and more recently in Gabon.
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">34</xref>,
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0042">42</xref> It seems that dengue fever is on the edge of emergence in Africa with the potential appearance of the devastating DHF that is yet to be observed on the continent.

   <p>Yellow Fever Virus (YFV): Gabon is officially designated as an infected country. A YFV outbreak occurred in 1994 in Ogooue-Ivindo Province, North East of Gabon with 44 cases reported.
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0043">43</xref> More recently, in 2009, Cameroon reported a laboratory-confirmed case of yellow fever (YF).
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0044">44</xref> YF has become an important public health issue because of its case-fatality rate of 50% and the estimated 200,000 cases and 30,000 deaths that occur each year worldwide. Also, despite the efficiency of the YF vaccine and its inclusion in the national vaccination program, human populations situated in remote areas have a limited access to the public health system.
