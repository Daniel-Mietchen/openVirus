<p>Based on serological evidence, several pathogens identified among wild or domestic animals, are suspected to infect the human populations of Gabon and therefore represent a potential threat to public health. Among them are the follows:
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>Foamy virus: simian foamy virus (SFV), a retrovirus in the Spumaretrovirinae subfamily, is widely prevalent in wild-caught and captive-born non human primates.
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0045">45</xref>, 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0046">46</xref> Contamination between non-human primates and humans can occur via contact with infectious body fluids, through biting,
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0045">45</xref>, 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0047">47</xref> or when manipulating fresh bush-meat.
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0048">48</xref>, 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0049">49</xref> However, the potential for SFV to become a human disease and to spread among human populations after cross-species transmission is not yet fully understood.

   <p>Human monkeypox: Human monkeypox, caused by the MPXV, a member of the genus Orthopoxvirus, is clinically almost identical to ordinary smallpox.
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0051">51</xref> Humans become infected through direct contact with infected wild animals. It seems that monkeys are also incidental hosts as the reservoir species of MPXV remain unknown (most likely one or several rodents living in secondary forests of Central Africa).
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0051">51</xref> Epidemiological surveys recorded 47 cases of human monkeypox (7 lethal) in Central Africa (RDC, Gabon, Congo, CAR, Cameroun, Ivory Cost, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria)
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0052">52</xref> with possible secondary transmission in the human population. Since 1980, the large majority of cases to be reported from the DRC mainly concern children.
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0051">51</xref> In 72% of those cases, an animal source of infection was suspected whereas secondary transmission from human source was presumed for the remaining cases. The longest documented chain of infection did not exceed four generations of person-to person transmission. There is only little probability of a large epidemic spread of MXPV.

   <p>Rift valley fever virus (RVFV): Rift Valley fever is an African disease that affects both livestock and humans. RVF outbreaks are associated with persistent heavy rainfall, sustained flooding and appearance of large numbers of mosquitoes, the main vector. Localized heavy rainfall is seldom sufficient to create conditions for an outbreak;
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0054">54</xref>, 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0055">55</xref> Rift Valley fever is a good example of a disease that is well coupled with climatic anomalies; and Gabon is one of the African countries known to have some evidence of RVFV circulation as antibodies of the disease has been found in humans and livestock.
