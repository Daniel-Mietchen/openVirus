<p>Emerging and re-emerging zoonoses include recently identified infectious diseases, diseases that have recently evolved from a subclinical state to a clinical syndrome, and previously known diseases that have recently displayed an increase in incidence or that have spread to new regions, hosts or vectors.4 However, a disease may not be recognized as zoonotic at the first outset. The disease can spread undetected for a period of time depending on the incubation period (weeks to years), the epidemiological pattern of a subclinical disease to a clinical picture (the emergence of the symptoms depending on host or pathogen factors) or, if the number of cases, in both human and animal populations, is too small and undetectable during the initial stages of transmission to suspect a link between the two events.
