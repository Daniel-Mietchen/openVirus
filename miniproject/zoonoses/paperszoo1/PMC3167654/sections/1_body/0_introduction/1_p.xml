<p>Despite intensive research and considerable effort from public health agencies to prevent or eradicate infectious diseases, emerging infectious diseases (EID) are currently the major threat to public health worldwide.1 Indeed, many new infectious agents, characterized by a high pathogenic potential, have been recently identified. Furthermore, some well known pathogens have been expanding their territories, causing increasing concerns in the recent decades due to changing epidemiological patterns.2 Most of these EID events have involved zoonotic infectious agents: more than 60% of EID affecting humans have a zoonotic origin

Two categories of zoonotic diseases have been described:4 (1) diseases for which transmission events to humans are rare but once occurred, horizontal transmission from human-to-human maintains a more or less sustainable infectious cycle (for example: ebola virus, from naturally infected chiropteran to human epidemics); (2) diseases for which direct or vector-mediated animal-tohuman transmission remains the common source of human infection (for example: Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), mosquito-transmitted from infected domestic ungulates).
