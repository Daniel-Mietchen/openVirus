<p>Zoonotic EID outbreaks result from a now classically accepted phenomenon of concurrency of fundamentals and territories of emergence. Fundamentals include factors related to the host, the vector (if any), the pathogen, and favorable environmental factors (climate) although territories at risk are the product of human activity and high-risk behavior among the human population. For instance, territories (that is: city, district) with an inefficient disease detection system or a failure to control vectors and other carriers of diseases as well as man-made environmental changes (breakdown of the water system, deforestationy) will force an increase in contact between the human population and wildlife.
