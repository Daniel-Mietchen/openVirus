<p>Overall, it should be noted that the estimates of infection prevalence and morbidity provided here are, in many cases, based on limited data. Moreover, there is often spatial heterogeneity of the NTDs within large geographic units, i.e., at the regional or country level. This is particularly true for most of the vector-borne NTDs. From the analysis reported here, two nations stand out has having the largest number of NTD cases and possibly disease burden. Nigeria is estimated to have the highest prevalence of helminth infections such as hookworm, schistosomiasis, ascariasis, trichuriasis, and LF in SSA, as well as the second highest registered prevalence of leprosy (

Similarly, DRC exhibits the highest prevalence of HAT and leprosy in SSA, as well as the second highest prevalence of hookworm infection and trichuriasis (and possibly LF), and the third highest prevalence of schistosomiasis and ascariasis (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000412-t003">Table 3</xref>). Together, Nigeria and DRC account for approximately one-third of the helminth infections and leprosy in SSA, as well as up to one-fifth of the cases of HAT. A targeted approach for these two countries could make a substantial impact on Africa's overall NTD disease burden.
