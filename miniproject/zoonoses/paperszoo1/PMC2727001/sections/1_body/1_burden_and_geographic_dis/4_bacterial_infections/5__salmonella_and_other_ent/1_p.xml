<p>Although well-publicized outbreaks of typhoid fever (
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> infection) have been reported from Kenya 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Brent1" ref-type="bibr">[127]</xref>, the overall incidence of culture-proven typhoid fever may be lower than 1/100,000 person years 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Mweu1" ref-type="bibr">[128]</xref>. In SSA, 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic> infection has been noted to occur in association with schistosome infections 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Crum1" ref-type="bibr">[129]</xref>. Of concern is the emergence of drug-resistant typhoid fever 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Crum1" ref-type="bibr">[129]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-World10" ref-type="bibr">[130]</xref>. Similarly, nontyphoidal salmonella (NTS) infection and bacteremia (some of which are caused by drug-resistant strains) is emerging as an important opportunistic infection in individuals infected with HIV and in children

 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Gordon1" ref-type="bibr">[132]</xref>. In Malawi and elsewhere in SSA, NTS bacteremia typically presents in children less than 3 years of age, especially those with coincident anemia, malaria, malnutrition, and HIV infection

 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Berkley1" ref-type="bibr">[133]</xref>. Among adults, NTS is most commonly associated with advanced HIV disease 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Graham1" ref-type="bibr">[131]</xref>. In Malawi, approximately 75% of the cases of NTS are associated with 
 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimrium and 21% with 
 <italic>S. enterica serovar</italic> Enteritidis 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Graham1" ref-type="bibr">[131]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Gordon1" ref-type="bibr">[132]</xref>. 
 <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> has emerged as a common cause of enteritis in Nigeria
