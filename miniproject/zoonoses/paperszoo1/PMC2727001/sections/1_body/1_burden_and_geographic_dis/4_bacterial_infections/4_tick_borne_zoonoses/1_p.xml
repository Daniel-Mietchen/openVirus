 <italic>Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF)</italic>. TBRF is an acute febrile illness caused by the spirochaete 
 <italic>Borrelia crocidurae</italic> and transmitted by an 
 <italic>Ornithodoros</italic> tick 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Vial1" ref-type="bibr">[124]</xref>. If left untreated, patients develop severe relapsing remitting fever, and in some parts of Senegal and elsewhere in West Africa this infection is second only to malaria as the most common cause of outpatient visits 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Vial1" ref-type="bibr">[124]</xref>. However, detailed information on the precise incidence and distribution of TBRF in SSA is lacking because the disease is underdiagnosed and medical personnel have inadequate awareness of this infection and frequently confuse it with malaria
