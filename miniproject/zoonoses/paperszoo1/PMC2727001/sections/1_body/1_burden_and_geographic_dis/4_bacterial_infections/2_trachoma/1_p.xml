<p>Trachoma is the leading cause of infectious and preventable blindness worldwide

 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Reddy1" ref-type="bibr">[114]</xref>, and the most important bacterial infection in SSA. Of the 63 million cases of active trachoma globally (although some estimates indicate 84 million cases worldwide), 48% occur in SSA (30 million) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000412-t002">Table 2</xref>) 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">[115]</xref>. Nearly half of the global disease burden of active trachoma and a quarter of end-stage trichiasis are concentrated in ten countries alone, with six of these located in SSA 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Mecaskey1" ref-type="bibr">[116]</xref>. Geographically, trachoma is distributed mainly in the savannah areas of East and Central Africa and the Sahel of West Africa 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Polack1" ref-type="bibr">[112]</xref>. Ethiopia has the largest number of cases (10.2 million), followed by Sudan (3.6 million) and Tanzania, Kenya, and Niger (2.0–2.1 million each) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000412-t003">Table 3</xref>). Approximately one-half of the 2.3 million global trachoma disease burden in DALYs is attributed to SSA (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000412-t004">Table 4</xref>). Like the other NTDs, trachoma is sustained in a setting of poverty. Additional risk factors for trachoma transmission include crowding and household clustering, insufficient access to water, poor sanitation and facial hygiene, and young children as the reservoir of infection 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">[115]</xref>. For instance, in southern Sudan, where more than 90% of the people live on less than US$1 per day, and only 27% have access to water and 16% to improved sanitation conditions, the prevalence of trachoma is ranked among the highest worldwide 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Ngondi1" ref-type="bibr">[117]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Ngondi2" ref-type="bibr">[118]</xref>. Hyper-endemic areas in SSA have been found to have an earlier age of onset of trichiasis 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Ngondi2" ref-type="bibr">[118]</xref>, while women are two to four times more likely to have trichiasis due to increased exposure to young children 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Mecaskey1" ref-type="bibr">[116]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-West1" ref-type="bibr">[119]</xref>. Dry zones with limited water accessibility and hot lowlands (altitude &lt;3,000 m) with dense fly populations also promote transmission

 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Alemayehu1" ref-type="bibr">[120]</xref>. Post-conflict conditions, namely in Sudan and Rwanda, have been assessed, but with differing conclusions on their impact on the prevalence of blindness. In southern Sudan, the prevalence of blindness (4.1%) is four times greater than that of the rest of Africa
