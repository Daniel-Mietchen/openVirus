<p>The epidemiology of amebiasis is poorly understood in SSA because few studies differentiate true infection caused by 
 <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> versus infection resulting from the non-pathogenic variant, 
 <italic>E. dispar</italic>
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Stauffer1" ref-type="bibr">[105]</xref>. Based on seroprevalence studies in Sudan, Cote d'Ivoire, and South Africa, however, the distribution of amebiasis is believed to be widespread 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Stauffer1" ref-type="bibr">[105]</xref>. Amebiasis has also been reported from Nigeria 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Okeke1" ref-type="bibr">[106]</xref>. In South Africa it has been observed that invasive 
 <italic>E. histolytica</italic> infection is associated more commonly with amebic liver abscess than colitis
