<p>Through stepped-up public health control efforts over the last decade, the major endemic countries in SSA have made great strides in reducing the number of cases of HAT from 300,000–500,000 cases to approximately 50,000–70,000 cases, along with 17,000 new cases occurring annually (

 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-World6" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Approximately 90% of the cases are caused by 
 <italic>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</italic>, a cause of chronic Gambian HAT 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Fevre1" ref-type="bibr">[100]</xref>, with most of the new cases occurring in DRC (10,369 new cases in 2004), followed by Angola, Sudan, Republic of Congo, and Central African Republic (

 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-World6" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Currently, the only country with both Gambian and Rhodesian HAT is the nation of Uganda, but to date each focus is geographically separated
