<p>Approximately 90% of the world's 200,000 cases of yellow fever (and 30,000 deaths) occur in SSA 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Barnett1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Especially in Francophone West Africa, transmission of yellow fever is maintained by high densities of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes in close proximity to unvaccinated human populations 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Barnett1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Yellow fever is underreported, although a laboratory network in the endemic countries of West and Central Africa was established in 2002 in order to strengthen capacity for diagnosis 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-World2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In 2006, cases of yellow fever were reported in Cameroon, Central African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana Guinea, Mali, and Togo 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-World2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Since 2000, four urban outbreaks have occurred in West Africa, including a 2001 outbreak in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, that required the immunization of 2.6 million people in 12 days 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[137]</xref>. All four dengue viral types have been reported from Africa, although to date no epidemic of dengue hemorrhagic fever has been reported 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Malavige1" ref-type="bibr">[138]</xref>. Epidemics of Chikungunya fever have also been reported in Angola, Burundi, Cameroon, CAR, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Ndip1" ref-type="bibr">[125]</xref>. Rift Valley fever is a bunyavirus infection transmitted by mosquitoes, which is a problem not only for humans but also for sheep, goats, and cattle. Epidemics and epizootics occur after periods of heavy rains 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-LaBeaud1" ref-type="bibr">[139]</xref>. Epizootics are closely linked to excess rainfall resulting from El Ni√±o and sea surface temperature anomalies in the Indian and Pacific Oceans
