 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000412-t002">Table 2</xref> ranks the major NTDs in SSA by their estimated prevalence, the percentage of the population infected, and the percentage of the world's cases found in the region, while 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000412-t003">Table 3</xref> ranks the countries with the highest prevalence of each of the NTDs. Helminth infections, especially the STH infections, schistosomiasis, and the filarial infections LF and onchocerciasis, are the most common NTDs in SSA, followed by trachoma and other bacterial infections

 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and leishmaniasis are the most common serious protozoan infections, especially in areas of conflict where these diseases emerge in the setting of inadequate housing and forced migrations

 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Collin1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. However, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000412-t004">Table 4</xref>, there are more than a dozen important NTDs, including the protozoan infections, amebiasis and toxoplasmosis; bacterial infections such as 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections (both typhoid fever and non-typhoidal salmonellosis), the tick-borne zoonoses, and yaws; and viral infections such as Rift Valley fever, for which there is insufficient information available in order to estimate their prevalence in SSA. Based on global disease burden estimates in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) published previously by the WHO and other investigators

 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Bethony1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, a range of estimates for the NTDs in SSA is provided in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000412-t005">Table 5</xref>. DALY estimates for the STH infections and schistosomiasis were obtained by adjusting a wide range of available global estimates according to the percentage of the total number of cases that occur in SSA, while for the other NTDs the disease burdens were quoted directly from WHO estimates. From this analysis it was determined that the total burden of NTDs in SSA is possibly as high as one-half the disease burden caused by malaria and twice the disease burden caused by tuberculosis in SSA (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000412-t006">Table 6</xref>), suggesting that the NTDs represent a formidable public health challenge in the region. Up to 85% of the NTD disease burden specifically results from helminth infections (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000412-t006">Table 6</xref>). However, even this high disease burden resulting from helminth infections and other NTDs may represent an underestimate because they do not incorporate the full spectrum of chronic sequelae

 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-King2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, and because such estimates do not include NTDs listed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000412-t004">Table 4</xref>.
