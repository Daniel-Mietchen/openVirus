<p>Since the global prevalence of STH infections was first estimated by Stoll over 60 years ago 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Stoll1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, the overall prevalence of the STH infections is believed to have remained relatively constant in SSA, whereas it has diminished elsewhere in the developing world 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-deSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Today, between one-quarter and one-third of SSA's population is affected by one or more STH infections 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-deSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, with children, especially school-aged children, disproportionately affected. Of the estimated 181 million school-aged children in SSA, almost one-half (89 million) are infected with hookworm, ascariasis, trichuriasis, or some combination of these STH infections 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Brooker1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Typically, children exhibit higher STH intensities than any other single population 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Brooker1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and as a result suffer from profound physical and mental deficits

 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Stephenson2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Such deficits partially account for their high disease burden in SSA. Moreover, in Kenya (and presumably elsewhere), these effects also translate into increases in school absenteeism and reduced school performance
