 <italic>Hookworm infection (“hookworm”)</italic>. Hookworm is the most common STH infection and the most common NTD in SSA (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000412-t002">Tables 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000412-t003">3</xref>). It is also one of the most important in terms of disease burden, accounting for up to one-third of the total burden from NTDs in SSA (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000412-t005">Table 5</xref>). Based on previous estimates derived in 2002 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-deSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, it is estimated that 198 million people in SSA are infected with hookworm (29% of the region's population), including 40–50 million school-aged children 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Brooker1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Brooker2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Approximately one-third of the world's hookworm today occurs in SSA (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000412-t002">Table 2</xref>) 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Molyneux1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, with the greatest number of cases occurring in Nigeria (38 million) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC, 31 million), followed by Angola, Ethiopia, and Cote d'Ivoire (10–11 million) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000412-t003">Table 3</xref>). Hookworm is the most widely distributed NTD in SSA and it is pervasive throughout the region (including both rural and urban areas) except in some parts of extreme southern Africa 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Brooker1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Brooker2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Two areas are particularly notable for their high hookworm prevalence and intensity compared to other helminth infections, namely coastal regions 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Mabaso1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, and areas of extremely high temperatures (where land surface temperatures exceed 37–40°C), including those near the Sahel such as Cameroon 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Brooker4" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, Chad 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Brooker5" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and Mali 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Behnke1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-DeClercq1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Through GIS/RS such information can be used to generate predictive maps of areas of high hookworm prevalence as well as their geographic overlap with potential co-infections 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Brooker1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Brooker2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. For instance, it is estimated that approximately 90% of the 50 million school-aged children with hookworm are at risk for coincident co-infection with falciparum malaria 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Brooker2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Brooker7" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Both 
 <italic>Necator americanus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ancylostoma duodenale</italic> are found in SSA, with the former representing the predominant hookworm species 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Albonico1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Because they cause intestinal blood loss, hookworm is a leading cause of iron deficiency anemia in the region 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Hotez4" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Among school-aged children in Zanzibar, 35% of iron deficiency anemia and 73% of severe anemia was attributable to hookworm 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Stoltzfus1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, while in Kenya and elsewhere in Africa, hookworm also is an important cause of anemia among preschool children 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Brooker8" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Albonico2" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Hookworm has also been recognized as an important cause of anemia and morbidity in women of reproductive age in SSA, especially among pregnant women 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Hotez4" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Crompton1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. At any given time, almost 7 million pregnant women in SSA (up to one-third of pregnant women in the region) are infected with hookworm 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Brooker3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Hookworm's high disease burden in SSA reflects its importance as a cause of maternal and child anemia (
