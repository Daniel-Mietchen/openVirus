<p>Among the other platyhelminth infections in SSA, paragonimiasis has been reported from eastern Nigeria and southwestern Cameroon 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Keiser1" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>, although there are no estimates of the number of cases. Cysticercosis caused by the pork tapeworm 
 <italic>Taenia solium</italic> is a major risk factor for epilepsy in SSA except in Muslim areas 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Preux1" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>, and it is hyperendemic in Burundi and elsewhere in eastern Africa 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Nsengiyumva1" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>, southern Africa 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Boa1" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Carabin1" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>, and Cameroon 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Zoli1" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>. It has been suggested that cysticercosis may account for the presence of subcutaneous nodules that erroneously have been linked with onchocerciasis and may be responsible for seizures following mass drug administration with anthelminthics 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Katabarwa1" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>. However, the full disease burden of cysticercosis in SSA remains largely unstudied. Both taeniasis caused by the beef tapeworm 
 <italic>Taenia saginata</italic> and cystic echinococcosis are highly prevalent in East Africa, especially in Ethiopia and Sudan 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Abunna1" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Elmahdi1" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>.
