 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Ottesen2" ref-type="bibr">[93]</xref>. In the 39 countries where LF occurs in SSA, the greatest numbers of people at risk of infection live in Nigeria, followed by DRC, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and Kenya (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000412-t003">Table 3</xref>). All of the LF cases in SSA are caused by 
 <italic>Wuchereria bancrofti</italic>, which are transmitted by a variety of culicine and anopheline mosquitoes 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Ottesen1" ref-type="bibr">[92]</xref>. 
 <italic>W. bancrofti</italic> infection produces a wide range of clinical manifestations, including hydrocele and lymphoedema as the most clinically obvious because of the associated disability, disfigurement, and stigma 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Njenga1" ref-type="bibr">[94]</xref>. Based on global estimates that 12.5% of LF infections are estimated to result in lymphedema and 20.8% in hydrocele 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Ottesen2" ref-type="bibr">[93]</xref>, there are approximately 5 million cases of lymphedema and 8 million cases of hydrocele in SSA. The estimated 2.0 million DALYs lost annually from LF rank it third or fourth behind hookworm and schistosomiasis (and possibly ascariasis) as the most important NTD in SSA (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000412-t005">Table 5</xref>). LF is also associated with huge economic losses, impairing economic activity up to 88% 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Gyapong1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and causes almost US$1 billion in annual losses, mostly resulting from the disability linked to hydrocele in men
