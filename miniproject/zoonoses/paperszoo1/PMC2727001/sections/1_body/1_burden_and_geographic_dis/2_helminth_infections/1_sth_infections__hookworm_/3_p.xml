 <italic>Ascariasis and trichuriasis</italic>. The highest intensity 
 <italic>Ascaris</italic> and 
 <italic>Trichuris</italic> infections occur in school-aged children 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Brooker1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. It is estimated that 173 million and 162 million people are infected in SSA with 
 <italic>Ascaris</italic> and 
 <italic>Trichuris</italic>, respectively, with 36 million school-aged children infected with ascariasis and 44 million with trichuriasis 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Brooker1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. For both infections the largest number of cases occurs in Nigeria, where co-infections with hookworm are common 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-DadaAdegbola1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Tens of millions of cases are also found in Ethiopia, DRC, and South Africa (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000412-t003">Table 3</xref>). Compared to hookworm, both ascariasis and trichuriasis exhibit a more patchy distribution in SSA, with the highest prevalence occurring in equatorial Central and West Africa, eastern Madagascar, and southeast Africa 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Brooker1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In contrast to the high rates of ascariasis and trichuriasis in South Africa 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Saathoff1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Saathoff2" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, hookworm is less common except in KwaZulu-Natal 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Mabaso1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Moreover, higher prevalence rates of ascariasis and trichuriasis are often present in Africa's urban areas compared to rural areas, unlike hookworm, which is more evenly distributed 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Brooker1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. These observations may reflect the ability of 
 <italic>Ascaris</italic> and 
 <italic>Trichuris</italic> eggs to survive in urban environments, so that increased urbanization in SSA may promote emergence of ascariasis and trichuriasis in the future.
