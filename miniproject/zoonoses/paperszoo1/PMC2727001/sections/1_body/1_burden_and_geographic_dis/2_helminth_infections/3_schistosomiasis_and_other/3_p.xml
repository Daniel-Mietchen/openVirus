<p>In addition to the organ-specific pathology described for both 
 <italic>S. haematobium</italic> and 
 <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infections, there is increasing evidence for more generalized morbidity resulting from the chronic inflammation of these long-standing infections 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-King1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-King2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Among the most important are anemia of chronic inflammation and iron deficiency anemia, growth stunting and malnutrition, fatigue and diminished physical fitness, and impaired cognitive development 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-King1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-King2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The current disease burden calculations for schistosomiasis range between 1.7 and 4.5 million DALYs lost annually (1.6 and 4.2 million DALYs in SSA) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000412-t005">Table 5</xref>), but these current estimates do not fully consider the general morbidities outlined above. It has been suggested that the true disease burden for schistososomiasis may be several fold higher than previous estimates 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-King1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, possibly making this infection the most important NTD in SSA. In addition to 
 <italic>S. haematobium</italic> and HIV co-infections 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Kjetland1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>, 
 <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and hookworm co-infections are common in SSA and can lead to severe anemia

 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Hotez5" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>. A relationship has also been proposed between schistosomiasis and malaria
