 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Boatin1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Based on rapid epidemiological mapping of onchocerciasis (REMO), a non-invasive and practical tool for distribution and disease prevalence, it is estimated that the mean infection rate among the 19 countries targeted by the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) is 38.2% with 87 million persons at risk for contracting the infection 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Amazigo1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In SSA, the clinical features of the disease vary from the savanna form, more common in West Africa and associated with high rates of blindness, to the rainforest form more common in Central and East Africa in which high rates of onchocera skin disease (OSD) are characterized by severe pruritus and disfigurement (also known as “troublesome itching”) 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Boatin1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In hyperendemic communities where the prevalence of onchocerciasis exceeds 60%, blindness can occur in 10% or more of some savanna populations, while OSD can affect more than 50% of some rainforest communities 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Boatin1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Both forms are linked with high disability as well as severe socioeconomic consequences. It is estimated that 40% of the DALYs lost from onchocerciasis result from blindness, while 60% are from OSD
