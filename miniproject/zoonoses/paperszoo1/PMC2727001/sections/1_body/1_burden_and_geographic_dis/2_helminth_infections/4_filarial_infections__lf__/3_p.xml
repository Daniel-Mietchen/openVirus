 <italic>Loiasis</italic>. The African eyeworm has a high prevalence in rainforest areas of low socioeconomic status and in some savanna regions 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Padgett1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The infection is common in Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, DRC, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Nigeria, and Sudan

 <italic>Loa</italic> infection is associated with Calabar swellings that result from filarial migrations in the subcutaneous tissues, but the greatest concern about the infection is the risk associated with ivermectin treatments for onchocerciasis co-infections 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Boussinesq1" ref-type="bibr">[98]</xref>. Angola, Cameroon, and DRC exhibit the highest rates of co-endemicity and consequently, represent the highest risk areas for serious adverse events during mass drug administration 
 <xref rid="pntd.0000412-Boussinesq1" ref-type="bibr">[98]</xref>. A rapid assessment method based on a clinical history of eyeworm infection and known as RAPLOA is in use to evaluate local prevalence of loiasis, as well as a spatial model based on environmental factors
