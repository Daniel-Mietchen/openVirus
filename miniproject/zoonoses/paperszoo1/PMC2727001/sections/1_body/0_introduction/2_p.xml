<p>Specific information on the prevalence, distribution, and disease burden resulting from the NTDs in SSA would provide a basis for prioritizing control strategies as a means to address the MDGs. Over the last decade, geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) have facilitated a deeper understanding of the prevalence and distribution of NTDs, particularly for helminth infections in SSA

Here, we review current knowledge on the prevalence, distribution, and disease burden resulting from NTDs in SSA, focusing on aspects particular to the region. The review of the literature was conducted using the online database PubMed from 2003 to 2008 with the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), the specific diseases listed as neglected tropical diseases on the

Reference lists of identified articles and reviews were also hand searched as were databases from the World Health Organization (WHO,
