<p id="P21">PCRs performed on 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> urine samples from Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Zambia and Annob√≥n detected paramyxovirus polymerase gene sequences in 3/23 extraction pools (from Ugandan and Tanzanian sampling sites, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). These showed close relationships with sequences detected previously in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). One PCR-positive pooled sample from Tanzania comprised urine expressed directly from the bladders of 6 individual
