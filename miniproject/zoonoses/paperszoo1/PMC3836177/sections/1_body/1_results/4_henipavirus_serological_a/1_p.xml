<p id="P19">Antibodies binding to NiV soluble G (sG) glycoproteins were detected using Luminex® microsphere binding assays in all populations sampled (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast to the LBV results, henipavirus seroprevalences in all Gulf of Guinea islands (including Annobón) were similar to those in continental populations. Excluding populations with very small sample sizes, as above, the mean henipavirus seroprevalence was 42% (39–44%), with adult seroprevalences ranging from 29–60% (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Using virus neutralisation tests (VNTs), a NiV seroprevalence of 5% (11/222, 3–9%) was detected in bats sampled from Tanzania and 1.7% (2/118, 0.5–6%) in bats from Annobón. For bats from Bioko, São Tomé, and Príncipe, NiV VNTs were performed on a subset of the samples (those with binding assay median fluorescence intensities (MFIs) &gt; 750 (n = 49, 20 and 39, respectively)), of which 32%, 50%, and 51% were neutralising, respectively.
