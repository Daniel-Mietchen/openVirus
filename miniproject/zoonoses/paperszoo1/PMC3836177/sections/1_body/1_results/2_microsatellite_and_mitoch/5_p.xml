<p id="P16">Consistent with these results, Bayesian clustering of individual genotypes revealed three clusters (K=3) based on mean likelihood (log P (X|K) values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>), corresponding to populations from CB, STP, and Annobón. With increasing values of K, the STP and Annobón clusters remained unchanged, and the CB cluster became increasingly subdivided into multiple clusters of approximately equal proportion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>), again indicative of a strong signature of a single panmictic CB population. Analyses run with CB or iIS samples as separate datasets did not reveal additional clusters. Using these three clusters as prior population information to identify potential migrants among clusters, STRUCTURE assignment tests (admixture analyses based on nuclear data), indicated that 19/502 individuals were ‘admixed’ (
 <italic>i.e.</italic> had an assignment probability (p) to any one main cluster of 0.8 &gt; p &gt; 0.2). No bats were classified as recent (first generation) migrants (
