<p id="P12">Overall, results from multiple analyses presented below showed that 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> forms a panmictic population across its continental range, with no evidence of isolation by distance (IBD) or structuring according to migratory routes. The offshore island of Bioko was found to be part of this panmictic population; however, the more isolated island populations in the Gulf of Guinea were genetically distinct from one another and from the continental population.
