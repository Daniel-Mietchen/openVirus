<p id="P13">Of 114 unique cytochrome 
 <italic>b</italic> (cytb) haplotypes identified from 544 individuals, 75% were singletons (only found in a single individual across all populations, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Haplotype diversity, molecular diversity, allelic richness and observed heterozygosity were all higher within continental with Bioko (CB) populations than in isolated island (iIS) populations. Nucleotide diversity was low across all populations, but particularly so in Príncipe and Annobón.
