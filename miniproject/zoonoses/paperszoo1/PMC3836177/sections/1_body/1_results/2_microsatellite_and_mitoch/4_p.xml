<p id="P15">A Bayesian phylogeny (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>) and median joining haplotype network (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>) both recovered three main 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> clades. The star-like network was characterised by a few common haplotypes, surrounded by many haplotypes present in only 1–5 individuals. Thorough spatial mixing was evident, with the central haplotype (Hap2) being shared by 85 bats representing all CB populations plus a single bat from Annobón. Most bats from the isolated island (iIS) populations (253/272; 93%) were divided between two haplotypes at opposite ends of the network (Hap8, predominantly Annobón, and Hap111, predominantly STP;
