<p id="P36">Female reproductive status was assigned as non-reproductive, pregnant, or lactating, assessed visually or via abdominal palpation. Age was assessed by morphological characteristics and all individuals could be allocated into one of four age classes: Neonate (&lt;2mths), Juvenile (J; 2 – &lt;6 months), Sexually Immature (SI; 6 – &lt;24 months) or Adult (A; ≥24 months). For a subset of samples, the timing of sampling allowed further classification of SI individuals into 6-month age groups SI.1, SI.2 and SI.3 (6 &lt;12, 12 – &lt;18, 18 – &lt;24 months, respectively).</p>
