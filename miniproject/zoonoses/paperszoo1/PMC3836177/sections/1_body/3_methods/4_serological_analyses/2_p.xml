<p id="P48">Antibodies against henipaviruses (HeV and NiV) were detected using Luminex® multiplexed microsphere binding assays and VNTs using purified recombinant expressed henipavirus sG glycoproteins

 </sup>, which were conjugated to internally coloured and distinguishable microspheres, allowing multiplexing. Antibody binding to each microsphere was detected after conjugation of bound antibodies with biotinylated Protein A and fluorescent streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin. Binding results are given as MFI values of at least 100 microspheres for each virus type, and an MFI &gt; 500 was considered positive

 </sup>. Alternative, lower cutoffs were also considered based on results from mixture model analyses

 </sup>. These resulted in higher seroprevalences, but no overall change in patterns to the higher, more conservative, cutoff presented here. In VNTs, samples exhibiting virus neutralisation at dilutions of ≥ 1:10 were considered positive. Stronger results were consistently observed in NiV binding assays and VNTs
