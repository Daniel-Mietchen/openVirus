 </sup>. Once priors had been optimised, analyses were run until stationarity was reached, which took ~2–3 months and 1.7 – 46 million steps, depending on sample size, before genealogy sampling commenced. Genealogy information was saved every 100 steps, and sampling was continued until ~100,000 genealogies were available for each pairwise comparison (~ 1 month, depending on sample size). Eight competing colonisation scenarios were explored by analysing microsatellite and mtDNA data using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods in the software DIYABC v 1.0
