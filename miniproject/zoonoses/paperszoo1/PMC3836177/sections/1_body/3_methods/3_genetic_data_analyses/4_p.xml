<p id="P43">Bayesian clustering analyses were performed 20 times for each value of K (K=1 to 13, representing the number of populations) for 1.5 Ã— 10
 <sup>6</sup> iterations with 500,000 burn-in steps using the admixture model with correlated allele frequencies in STRUCTURE

 </sup>. Analyses were repeated for separate continental and island datasets. Symmetric similarity coefficients (SSC) were used to assess consistency among replicate runs for each value of K using the Greedy algorithm of CLUMPP v1.1

 </sup>. To ensure that some loci not in HWE in the Bioko populations (see results) were not affecting clustering from this population, analyses were repeated separately with data from loci in or out of HWE in Bioko. No difference was seen in the results, and therefore remaining analyses were run with 16 loci. Assignment tests were performed in STRUCTURE and admixture was assessed using the USEPOPINFO option, using the clustering partition with the optimal mean log likelihood value as prior population information. Based on their assignment probability, p, individuals were considered non-migrant (p &gt; 0.8), admixed (0.2 &gt; p &gt; 0.8), or a recent migrant (p &lt; 0.2)
