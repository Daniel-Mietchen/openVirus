<p id="P41">The statistical power of the microsatellite and mtDNA datasets to reject a null hypothesis of genetic homogeneity was assessed using the software POWSIM

 </sup>. Values from the empirical datasets (number of populations, population sample sizes, number of loci and allele frequencies) were used to simulate 1,000 random sets of 12 subpopulations with expected

 </italic> values of 0.001 â€“ 0.01. Since mtDNA is haploid, the sample size was halved for mtDNA analyses. Power calculations indicated that the inability to detect population structure among CB populations was not as a result of insufficient power within the dataset, and the estimated probability of falsely detecting significant differentiation was in line with the typically-accepted 0.05 cutoff. Analyses were therefore continued as described below.
