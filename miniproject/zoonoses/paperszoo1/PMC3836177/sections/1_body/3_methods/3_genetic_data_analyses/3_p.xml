<p id="P42">For microsatellite data, departures from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) and the presence of linkage disequilibrium (LD) among loci were assessed using FSTAT v2.9

 </sup> and GENEPOP v4.0.10 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>
 </sup>, respectively. Significance levels were adjusted for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR) method. Genetic diversity for each population and region was assessed by calculating observed heterozygosity (

 <italic>H
  <sub>E</sub>
 </italic>), and average allelic richness (

  <sub>S</sub>
 </italic>) in FSTAT. Population structure was assessed by calculating pairwise

  <sub>ST</sub>
 </italic> values between populations and by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), as implemented in the software ARLEQUIN v3.5 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>
 </sup>. Significance levels were obtained with 10,000 permutations. Data were tested for presence of isolation by distance by regressing natural logarithm-transformed geographical distances between sampling sites (in km) against Slatkinâ€™s linearised

  <sub>ST</sub>
 </italic> (
 <italic>F
  <sub>ST</sub>
 </italic>/(1-
