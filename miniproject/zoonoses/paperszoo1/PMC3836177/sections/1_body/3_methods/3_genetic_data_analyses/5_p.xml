<p id="P44">For mtDNA, in addition to AMOVA and IBD analyses, descriptive parameters of genetic diversity were calculated in the software DnaSP v5.10 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>
 </sup>. Rarefaction down to the minimum sample size was used to calculate haplotypic richness (HR, a measure of diversity standardised across population sample sizes) using the software RAREFAC 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>
 </sup>. Pairwise 
 <italic>φ
  <sub>ST</sub>
 </italic> values were calculated in ARLEQUIN and significance values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the FDR method. Median joining networks (MJNs) were constructed in the software NETWORK v4.6 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>
 </sup>. For comparison, statistical parsimony networks were constructed using TCS 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>
 </sup>, with a 95% parsimony connection limit, however the results were consistent and are not presented here. A phylogeny of unique cytb haplotypes was reconstructed by Bayesian inference in MRBAYES v3.1.2 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>
 </sup>, using the 
 <italic>E. dupreanum</italic> cytb sequence as an outgroup (which was found to be 91% (360/397 bp) identical to the consensus 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> cytb sequence). The most appropriate substitution model (GTR + I) was selected using PAUP* v4.0b10 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>
 </sup> and MODELTEST v3.7 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>
 </sup>. MRBAYES was run with 4 simultaneous chains, sampled every 100 generations, and the first 25% of trees were discarded as burn-in. Generations were added until the standard deviation of split frequencies was below 0.015 (10 ×10
 <sup>6</sup> generations).
