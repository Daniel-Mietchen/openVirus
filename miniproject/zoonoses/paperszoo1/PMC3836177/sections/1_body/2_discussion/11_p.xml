<p id="P32">This study took a multidisciplinary approach, combining ecological, genetic and serological studies, to explore the ways in which the structure, dynamics and connectivity of 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> populations across Africa affects the viral transmission dynamics within them. These critical population-level processes are expected to be important in determining viral persistence within populations, and yet, while the three genetically-distinct populations identified here are also highly likely to be separated epidemiologically, each of these population clusters is capable of maintaining henipaviruses and LBV, apparently without the need for a metapopulation model of persistence via migration and reintroduction.
