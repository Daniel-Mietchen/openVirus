<p id="P28">Further support for the conclusion that distant continental populations may belong to a single epidemiological unit was provided by high nucleotide sequence identities between paramyxoviral sequences detected in 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> urine samples from Uganda and Tanzania and those already reported from Ghana

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
 </sup>, a diverse range of paramyxovirus sequences, including henipavirus-like sequences, were detected within single 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> populations. Further sampling efforts to enable exploration of viral sequence diversity across all the sites studied here would help determine whether different virus variants are maintained by each of these distinct epidemiological units and whether viral diversity may play a role in within-population viral persistence. Additional data are required to fully understand how virus variants are maintained within 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> populations.
