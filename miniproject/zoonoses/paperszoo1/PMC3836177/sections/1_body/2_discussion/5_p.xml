<p id="P26">The Gulf of Guinea ocean channels are likely to have provided a barrier to initial colonisation and inter-island dispersal. Also, we found that the smallest discrete population of 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> (on the island of Annobón) showed genetic divergence and is truly isolated. Our mtDNA and microsatellite results are consistent with those of a previous study that found that

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
 </sup> also concluded that a lack of phenetic differentiation on Bioko, São Tomé and Príncipe suggested gene flow among the islands, our use of multiple nuclear and mtDNA markers, provides further insight. For example, while São Tomé shows greater connectivity with Príncipe (&lt; 150 km apart) than with either the CB or the Annobón populations (which lie &gt;220 km away), the distance separating these two populations is still a substantial barrier to inter-island gene flow, as shown by significant pairwise

 </italic> and 
 <italic>F
  <sub>ST</sub>
 </italic> values. Since São Tomé and Príncipe are within the same cluster, it is not possible to identify migrants between these two islands using assignment tests. Other genetic methods to estimate gene flow and demographic history between multiple populations, including isolation-with-migration models and approximate Bayesian computation, were unsuccessful in obtaining reliable and credible estimates of gene flow between these islands, suggesting that even for our substantial datasets, modelling of low rates of gene flow using current techniques and assumptions is not robust.
