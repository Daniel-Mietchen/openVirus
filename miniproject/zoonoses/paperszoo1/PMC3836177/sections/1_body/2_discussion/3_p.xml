 <italic>E. helvum</italic> population are bats on the near-shore island of Bioko in the Gulf of Guinea (which separated from the African continent ~7000 years ago). Our results indicate that the 32 km stretch of ocean that separates Bioko from the continent is not a significant barrier to dispersal, as might be expected given that individuals are capable of covering such distances during foraging bouts
