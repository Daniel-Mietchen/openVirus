<p id="P33">The findings presented here have potentially important implications for public health. The large population sizes of 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic>, its tendency to roost and feed in close proximity to human populations, its extensive distribution across Africa and its frequent harvesting for bushmeat, present numerous opportunities for the exposure of people to excreta, tissues and body fluids from these bats. The widespread presence of potentially zoonotic viruses in this species across Africa might therefore be of significant public health concern. Despite the possibility for undiagnosed spillover, the lack of detection makes it unlikely that pathogenic henipaviruses from 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> are regularly crossing the species barrier and undergoing significant sustained transmission in humans at this point in time. Spillover of NiV into pig populations in Malaysia may have occurred at least once prior to detection of the major outbreak

 </sup>, and therefore, detection of henipavirus antibodies in pigs in Ghana
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>
 </sup> warrants further study. Although no human cases of LBV infection have been reported, this virus causes clinical rabies in other mammalian hosts
