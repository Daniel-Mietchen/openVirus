<p id="P22">In this study, using data from both mtDNA and microsatellite markers, we demonstrate that the population of 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> is panmictic across its continental African range. An absence of IBD indicated that gene flow was no more likely to occur among neighbouring populations than distant populations of &gt; 4,500 km, making 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> the largest reported panmictic unit of any mammal, and one of the largest of any vertebrate, exceeded only by the bigeye tuna (
 <italic>Thunnus obesus</italic>; &gt; 8000 km)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
 </sup> and the Kentish plover (
 <italic>Chadadrius alexandrines</italic>; &gt; 10,000km)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
 </sup>. Even present day human populations retain genetic structure over such large distances
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
 </sup>. In fact, the range of 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> extends further north and west of the sampling sites in this study, so additional sampling is required to assess whether panmixia extends across this range; a distance of &gt; 6,500 km.
