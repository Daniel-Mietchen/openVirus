 </sup>. In the absence of isolation or full genomic characterisation, it cannot be definitely confirmed whether these sequences represent true henipaviruses. However, a phylogenetic analysis undertaken here, incorporating the most recently isolated henipavirus (CedPV in Australia) and sequence fragments from bat paramyxoviruses worldwide (

 <italic>E. helvum</italic> in Gabon

 </sup> fall within the clade of currently-identified henipaviruses. These sequences therefore likely represent true African henipaviruses.
