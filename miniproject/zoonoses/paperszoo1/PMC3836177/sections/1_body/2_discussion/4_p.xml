<p id="P25">In contrast to the panmictic continental and Bioko (CB) population, populations on the three more isolated Gulf of Guinea islands (São Tomé, Príncipe and Annobón) showed evidence of genetic isolation. This accords with results from studies of other Gulf of Guinea island taxa, including other species of bat

 </sup>, the strong genetic structure detected among the island and CB population clusters and the absence of genetic evidence (using assignment tests) of recent migrants between these clusters, indicate that dispersal between clusters (with successful mating) is likely to be rare: no first generation migrants were detected, although some individuals may have been second or third generation migrants. Additional support for population genetic results in this and other fruit bat species comes from genetic studies of external parasites and their pathogens
