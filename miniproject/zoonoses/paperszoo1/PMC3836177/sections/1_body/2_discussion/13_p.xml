<p id="P34">Changes in bat-human interactions and bat-domestic animal interactions are hypothesised to be a catalyst for the zoonotic spillover of novel viruses from wildlife. Stressors, such as habitat loss, land-use change and increasing bat-human interactions may precipitate viral spillover from bats to other species

Understanding viral persistence and the potential for spillover in African bat populations in the face of extensive hunting, logging, and human population growth is of central importance for both public health and conservation, especially since these processes can be expected to increase over time.
