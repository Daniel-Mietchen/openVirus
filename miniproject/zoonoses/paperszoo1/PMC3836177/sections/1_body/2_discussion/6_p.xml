<p id="P27">While genetic analyses cannot replace direct studies on individual bat movements and demographic connectivity, they can contribute to a broader perspective upon which to base epidemiological studies on transmission and maintenance of viruses among and within populations

 <italic>E. helvum</italic> into three distinct genetic population clusters (CB, STP &amp; AN) is echoed as at least three epidemiologically-distinct populations. A freely mixing, panmictic continental population would likely facilitate viral transmission among 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> colonies across this range. Our serology results are consistent with this, with henipavirus and LBV antibodies being detected across all continental sampling sites at seroprevalences similar to those previously observed for henipaviruses in Ghana
