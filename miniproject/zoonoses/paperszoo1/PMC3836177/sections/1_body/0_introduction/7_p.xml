<p id="P10">To determine the extent of genetic and epidemiological connectivity among 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> populations, and thus gain better understanding of viral transmission dynamics and zoonotic risk, here we combine genetic and serological analyses of populations across Africa. We use mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA analyses to characterise the range-wide metapopulation structure of 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic>, and hypothesise that this would inform our understanding of viral dynamics across the population. Together with serological analyses, we assess the epidemiological consequences of this structure for the speciesâ€™ ability to act as a reservoir host of the potentially zoonotic viruses, LBV and henipaviruses.
