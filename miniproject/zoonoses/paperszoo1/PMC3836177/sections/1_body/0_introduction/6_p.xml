<p id="P9">Many uncertainties also remain regarding the specific viral transmission dynamics in 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic>. Key aspects of this species’ ecology might further increase potential for viral persistence within populations. In particular, it is a migratory species that comprises both permanent and seasonal colonies across much of sub-Saharan Africa
 <sup>

 </sup> and a small number of offshore islands, including those in the Gulf of Guinea
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
 </sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>). However, the widespread and continuous distribution represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref> over-simplifies a more intricate distribution pattern, comprising aggregated populations across a connected, rather than continuous, landscape
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
 </sup>. Annual seasonal migrations result in abrupt fluctuations in the size of permanent colonies, and also in the formation of solely seasonal colonies. For example, the largest known 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> colony in Kasanka National Park in Central Zambia is populated rapidly each year to reach an estimated 1.5 million individuals 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
 </sup>, and persists for just 2 ½ months. Satellite telemetry studies indicate that these bats are capable of migrating vast distances (e.g. up to 370km in one night and ~2500km over 5 months)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
 </sup>. It has been suggested that migration occurs along a ‘north-south’ axis, with seasonal movements following latitudinal shifts of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone weather system
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
 </sup>; however the routes and drivers of migrations are not fully understood. Such large-scale movements are expected to lead to widespread gene flow, and it has been argued that extensive genetic mixing among wildlife populations may increase the potential for viral epidemics
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, to characterise viral infection dynamics in wildlife populations, information on host population structure and connectivity is needed. Indeed, Plowright et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
 </sup> suggested that a large, weakly-coupled asynchronous metapopulation structure might be necessary for population-level persistence of HeV, with either acute ‘explosive’, or slow ‘smouldering’ epidemics resulting from spatial heterogeneity in population herd immunity. We recently demonstrated evidence of exposure to henipaviruses in the small, isolated population of 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> on the Gulf of Guinea island of Annobón, indicating that a metapopulation model may not be required for persistence of all henipaviruses
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
 </sup>. The persistence of lyssaviruses in some temperate insectivorous bat species has been shown to depend on certain life history traits, including hibernation and birth pulses
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
 </sup>, but persistence mechanisms in non-hibernating species, such as 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic>, are unknown.
