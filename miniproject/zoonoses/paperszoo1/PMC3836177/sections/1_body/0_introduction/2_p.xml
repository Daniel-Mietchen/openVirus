<p id="P5">Much of the serological evidence for zoonotic pathogens in bats comes from single cross-sectional studies, with few conducted longitudinally or across a representative proportion of the entire species range. However, longitudinal surveys of 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> colonies in Ghana have demonstrated relatively high roost-level seroprevalences to LBV over multiple years, which increase with bat age

 </sup>. These findings indicate endemic circulation with horizontal transmission, making 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> a true reservoir host of LBV in that country. Moreover, neutralising antibodies to LBV have also been detected in cross-sectional serological surveys in Kenya

 </sup> and Nigeria

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>

 <italic>E. helvum</italic> bats in Nigeria, Senegal and Kenya (reviewed in 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
