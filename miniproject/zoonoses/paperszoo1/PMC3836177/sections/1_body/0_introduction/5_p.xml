<p id="P8">Much is yet to be understood regarding the host response to natural lyssavirus and henipavirus infections in bats; experimental inoculations have yielded inconsistent results across individuals and studies. Bats infected with lyssaviruses may or may not develop clinical signs corresponding to those seen in other mammals (reviewed in 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
 </sup>), whereas no clinical illness has been observed in bats infected with henipaviruses
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
 </sup>. Acute antibody responses have been observed for both viruses after experimental infection, with boosted titres upon reinfection
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
 </sup>. An assumption could follow that these infections are immunising in bats, however seroconversion is not universally observed, and therefore this remains open to challenge. Typically, pathogens causing acute immunising infections require large host population sizes and a ‘critical community size’ (CCS) for persistence is expected unless birth rates are very high.
