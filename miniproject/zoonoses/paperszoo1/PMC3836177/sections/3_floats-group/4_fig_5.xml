  <title>Diversity of paramyxoviruses in 
   <italic>Eidolon helvum</italic> urine collected across multiple African sites detected using 
   <italic>Paramyxovirinae</italic>-targeted PCR
  </title>
  <p>Phylogenetic tree for a 531 bp segment of the polymerase gene of members of the subfamily 
   <italic>Paramyxovirinae</italic>, including sequences generated in this study and publicly available paramyxovirus sequences (with GenBank accession numbers). Relevant posterior probability values are shown. Horizontal branches are drawn to a scale of nucleotide substitutions per site. Individual extraction pools IDs are followed by letters denoting the clone. Groups containing sequences previously uncharacterized sequences that display a common phylogenetic origin supported by high posterior probability values (â‰¥0.95) are highlighted by numbered light grey boxes. Within these boxes, sequences obtained from samples collected from Tanzania and Uganda are further highlighted by darker grey boxes. Pair wise nucleotide identities of the sequences from samples collected Tanzania and Uganda with their nearest phylogenetic relative are shown within the grey boxes. One PCR-positive Ugandan pooled sample (sample 23) contained paramyxoviral sequence with 95% nucleotide sequence identity with sequences detected in Ghana that comprised part of a phylogenetically-distinct lineage of unclassified bat-derived viruses (group 5). Of the two PCR-positive Tanzanian samples, one contained paramyxoviral sequence related to mumps virus (sample 21) and shared 98% nucleotide identity with a Ghanaian sequence (group 2), and the other (sample 13) contained a sequence related to, but distinct from (74% nucleotide identity) sequences detected in Ghana (group 3).
