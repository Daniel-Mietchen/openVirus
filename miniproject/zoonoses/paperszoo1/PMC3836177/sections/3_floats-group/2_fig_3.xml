  <p>No spatial clustering is present in continental African countries or within regions. Each circle represents a unique haplotype, and its size is proportional to its frequency. Lines represent base pair changes between two haplotypes, with the length proportional to the number of base pair changes. Main haplotypes and those containing island samples are labelled by name. Inset in the bottom right shows the relationship between the haplotype network and three clades identified in the Bayesian phylogeny.</p>
