  <p>Evolutionary relationships of phocine distemper virus (PDV) isolates to the other morbilliviruses. The neighbor-joining method [
   <xref rid="B46-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] was used to generate a phylogenetic tree based on the hemagglutinin (H) glycoprotein sequences of seventeen selected PDV, CDV, MV, RPV, PPRV and DMV strains (branch length 1.59). Positions containing gaps were eliminated. Bootstrap analysis [
   <xref rid="B47-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] was used to indicate the percentage number of trees from 1000 replicates in which the virus H glycoprotein sequences clustered equivalently. Branch lengths are identical to the evolutionary distances, determined using the p-distance method [
   <xref rid="B48-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], used to infer the phylogenetic tree. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis was performed using MEGA5 [
   <xref rid="B49-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. PDV accession numbers (Z36979.1; AF479276.1; AF479277.1; AF479274.1; D10371.1; KC802221; AJ224707.1; HQ007902.1 and FJ648456.1), PDV/2-RUS (1988) * (X84998.1) is generally accepted to be a CDV isolate although the name has not been changed. CDV accession numbers (HM046486.1, USA-RI and USA-R252, in submission). Other morbilliviruses, accession numbers, MV (HM439386.1), RPV (NC006296.2), PPRV (FJ750563.1) and DMV (FJ648457.1), were included to show the evolutionary distances across the genus. Feline morbillivirus was not included in this analysis as it is questionable if this virus is a true morbillivirus.
