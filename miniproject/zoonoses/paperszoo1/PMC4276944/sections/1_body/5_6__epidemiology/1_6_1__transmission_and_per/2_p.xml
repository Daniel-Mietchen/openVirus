<p>For horizontally-transmitted, highly-immunogenic infectious agents like morbilliviruses, there is generally thought to be a critical community size below which infection cannot persist without continued introduction of individuals with productive viral infection [

However, CDV can persist among low-density populations of terrestrial carnivores that have a patchy distribution, live in small social groups, and tend to be territorial. Under these conditions continued transmission of the virus probably requires large spatial scales or multi-host transmission for persistence as has been described for wolves, coyotes and cougars in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem [
 <xref rid="B168-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>]. In this system recurring CDV-associated multi-host mortality events are a feature of the disease ecology [
