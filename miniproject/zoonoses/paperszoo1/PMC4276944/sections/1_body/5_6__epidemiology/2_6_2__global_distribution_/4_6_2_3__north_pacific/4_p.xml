<p>Northern sea otters also occur along the Pacific coast as far south as northern California. In Washington State a mortality event occurred between July and August 2000 but the etiology was never established [
 <xref rid="B182-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>]. Retrospective serology on otters sampled from 1992 to 1997 were negative in a PDV and CDV competitive ELISA [
 <xref rid="B179-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>]. However, otters sampled later in 2001 were 80% (24/30) positive to CDV in a neutralization test while 10% (3/30) were positive in 2011 [
 <xref rid="B182-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>]. Differential serology suggested that CDV was the pathogen but PCR testing of nasal swabs proved negative. The conclusion was that terrestrial origin CDV was the cause and a precedent for this was the CDV epidemics among Baikal and Caspian seals in Asia [
