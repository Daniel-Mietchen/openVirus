<p>To date there is very little conclusive evidence for PDV in southern hemisphere pinnipeds. Antarctic crabeater (
 <italic>Lobodon carcinophagus</italic>) and leopard seals (
 <italic>Hydrurga leptonyx</italic>), but not Weddell seals (
 <italic>Leptonychotes weddellii</italic>) showed serological evidence of CDV exposure but there have been no confirmed mortalities [
 <xref rid="B188-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. Infection was likely introduced to Antarctica with expedition sled dogs. A serological survey of a small number of Weddell seals, Ross seals (
 <italic>Ommatophoca rossii</italic>, and crabeater seals from the pack-ice off Queen Maud Land, Antarctica sampled in 2001 showed no detectable PDV antibody levels [
 <xref rid="B111-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. In the New Zealand sub-Antarctic islands, a number of sea lions (
 <italic>Phocarctos hookeri</italic>) and New Zealand fur seals (
 <italic>Arctocephalus forsteri</italic>) had PDV neutralizing titers but there was no evidence of disease [
 <xref rid="B185-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>]. Titers in adult female New Zealand sea lions that died from a 
 <italic>Campylobacter spp</italic>. septicemia epidemic in 1998 were too low to implicate PDV in the deaths and there were no morbillivirus lesions in tissues [
 <xref rid="B186-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. In Australia, a serological survey was conducted on 125 adult female Australian fur seals (
 <italic>A. pusillus doriferus</italic>) sampled at Kanowna Island rookery in Bass Strait between 2007 and 2009 [
 <xref rid="B187-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. A VeroDogSLAM plaque reduction assay for CDV was used but all animals were negative [
