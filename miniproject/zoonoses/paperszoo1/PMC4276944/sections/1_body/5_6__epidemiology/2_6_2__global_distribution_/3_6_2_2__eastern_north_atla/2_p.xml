<p>The initial cases of PDV in both outbreaks were identified in the Danish and Swedish Kattegat with the Danish island of Anholt being the breeding colony where the first cases were reported [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B116-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. However, the reasons why this location is the starting point for the outbreaks remain elusive. An additional puzzling spatial feature was that the epidemics did not spread in a geographically coherent pattern. Whilst initially they spread linearly away from Anholt, new epicenters appeared as time progressed [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], suggesting vectors other than harbor seals (that generally forage coastally from haul-out sites) were responsible [

 <xref rid="B200-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>]. In the North Sea the grey seal, which was exposed but did not show overt infection or mortality [
 <xref rid="B211-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>] remains the most likely source. Indeed studies during the grey seal breeding season in the UK at the end of the 2002 epidemic found that blood samples from females and pups were PDV positive by PCR. Additionally, PCR positive pups with negative mothers were detected late in the breeding season suggesting transfer of virus across the colony [
 <xref rid="B118-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. However, whether grey seals are true reservoirs of infection or subclinical carriers is still to be determined [
