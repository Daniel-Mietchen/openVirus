<p>Marine mammal disease surveillance is more sporadic in the western North Pacific. A serologic survey was conducted on Kuril harbor seals (
 <italic>P. vitulina stejnegeri</italic>) at three locations on the southeastern coast of Hokkaido, Japan, between 1998 and 2005 [
 <xref rid="B183-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>]. Using an ELISA with PDV or CDV antigen, it was shown that at Nosappu, seals were PDV-seropositive in 1998 (50%), 2003 (5%), 2004 (1%) and 2005 (1%). A similar pattern was observed further south at Erimo where the prevalences were 13% (1999), 7% (2003), 50% (2004) and 0% (2005). Sixteen seals sampled at Akkeshi, between the previous two sites, were negative in 2004 and 2005. The authors discussed another report in Japanese [
 <xref rid="B184-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>] in which 19/23 (83%) of Kuril harbor seals from Hokkaido sampled in 1996 and 2/2 sampled in 1997 were PDV seropositive. Furthermore, greater than 50% of an unspecified number of Steller sea lions and spotted seals sampled between 1994 and 1998 tested positive. While no data are provided on stranding rates, mortalities or other diagnostic tests, the authors postulate that epidemics may have occurred around Hokkaido (
