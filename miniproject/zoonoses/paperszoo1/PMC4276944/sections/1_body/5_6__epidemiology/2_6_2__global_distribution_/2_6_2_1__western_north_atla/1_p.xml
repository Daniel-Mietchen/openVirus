<p>Retrospective studies indicate that PDV has been circulating among several phocid seal species, the Atlantic walrus and polar bears in the western North Atlantic since at least the 1970s [

 <xref rid="B190-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>] appears to be a key species in the disease ecology of PDV in this ecosystem, with a population size well above estimates required to maintain endemic infection [
 <xref rid="B167-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. The historical, pre-European colonization, estimates suggest that there were at least eleven million animals in Canadian waters with only a moderate decrease to eight million in 2011 [
 <xref rid="B191-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. Breeding age females sampled in the Gulf of St. Lawrence between 1988 and 1993 were shown to have 83% PDV seropositivity, consistent with endemic infection [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This high level of herd immunity precludes large-scale mortality in a population in which most pups will have maternal antibody and susceptibility limited to a short window when maternal immunity wanes and acquired immunity provides life long protection. In keeping with this, the only confirmed PDV mortality among harp seals has been in juveniles dispersing away from the breeding colonies in spring [
