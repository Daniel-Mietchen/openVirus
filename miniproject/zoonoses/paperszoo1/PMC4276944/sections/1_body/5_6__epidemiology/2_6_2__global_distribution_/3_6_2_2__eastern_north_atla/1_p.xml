<p>The epidemiology of PDV in the northeastern Atlantic has been very well studied [

 <xref rid="B202-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>], and the volume of detailed data collected during both the 1988 and the 2002 events has been crucial in facilitating our understanding of the determinants and dynamics of the infection [

The results of these different approaches have greatly enhanced our understanding of the modes and methods of disease transmission and the factors involved in determining the spread of the disease and the severity of the outbreaks. Most importantly detailed ecological and demographic data was collected from a very large proportion of beached carcasses or animals that died following admission into rehabilitation centers. This included the species, sex, age, condition and stranding location across all the European countries involved [

 <xref rid="B200-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>]. Indeed some of the same researchers were involved in responding to and studying both epidemics which has increased the collective collaborative output as data were gathered using standardized protocols, similar techniques and approaches [
