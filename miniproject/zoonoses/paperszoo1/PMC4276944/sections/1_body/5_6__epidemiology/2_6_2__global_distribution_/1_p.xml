<p>The emergence of PDV as an agent of mass mortality in 1988 changed our perception of the role of infectious diseases in marine mammal ecology and population dynamics. Indeed, following the first epidemic, Harwood and Hall [
 <xref rid="B157-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>] posited that such stochastic events likely play a more important role in population dynamics than density dependent factors. Certainly the magnitude of PDV on harbor seals in western Europe is reminiscent of the impact that other morbilliviruses, RPV and MV, had on previously naïve populations [

 <xref rid="B173-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. Ascertaining the role of endemic morbillivirus infection in regulating marine mammal populations in the western North Atlantic, and the potential for affecting long-term population persistence, particularly of harbor seals, in the eastern North Atlantic is more problematic. The recent emergence of a PDV-like virus in the North Pacific in previously naïve host species, but without large-scale mortality has further complicated an already complex epidemiology (
