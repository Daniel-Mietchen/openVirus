<p>The western Arctic, Bering and Chukchi Seas, and North Pacific Ocean have large and diverse populations of potentially PDV-susceptible marine mammals and some species such as ringed seals and bearded seals have a continuous distribution from the eastern Canadian Arctic to Alaska. Furthermore, some of these species including the northern sea otter, Steller sea lion (
 <italic>Eumetopias jubatus</italic>), northern fur seal (
 <italic>Callorhinus ursinus</italic>) and harbor seal, have experienced population declines through part of their range [

 <italic>Phoca largha</italic>), bearded seals (
 <italic>Erighnathus barbatus</italic>), ribbon seals (
 <italic>Histriophoca fasciata</italic>), Steller sea lions or Pacific walrus (
 <italic>O. rosmarus divergens</italic>) sampled in the Bering Sea between 1984 and 1988 [
