<p>Further comparative modeling studies combining antibody prevalence serology data with a simple SEIR model found some interesting differences between the two outbreaks in the UK [

 <italic>i.e.</italic>, the number of cases generated by an infected individual during the infectious period in an uninfected population and is a combination of transmissibility, contact and duration of infectiousness) of the virus between outbreaks. However, viral transmission characteristics were similar throughout the UK and R
 <sub>0</sub> was uniform within each epidemic. Thus the differences appear to have been mainly due to differences in case mortality. Seasonal differences in behavior resulting in more intense rather than more frequent contact between infectives and susceptibles may have resulted in differences in viral dose and the observed difference in case fatality rate. Higher mortality was seen in the fast growing European populations [
