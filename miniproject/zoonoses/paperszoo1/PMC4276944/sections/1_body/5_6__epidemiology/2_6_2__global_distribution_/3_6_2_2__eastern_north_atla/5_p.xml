<p>The impact that an epidemic has on the future population dynamics of the species is determined not only by the overall mortality rate but also by the sex and age classes that are affected. Both epidemics had differential effects, particularly on the age classes that died [
 <xref rid="B217-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">217</xref>]. Mortality among the young (&lt;1 year) and older (&gt;4 years) age classes was significantly higher than among the sub-adults, and males suffered significantly higher mortality than females. The study concluded that genetic susceptibility could not be the cause of this difference as adult mortality was higher than offspring mortality but that contact rate and susceptibility were likely to be strongly age and sex-specific. However, immunogenetic differences could explain the regional variation seen in mortality rates. For example, a study of MHC class I genes (which are critical for antigen presentation to T and NK cells), found presence/absence differences for some polymorphisms between UK harbor seal populations in southeast Scotland that were PDV survivors, and from southeast England that had died from the infection. However, the sample sizes were too small to draw firm conclusions [

 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] for other immune-related genes, need to be investigated further. Nonetheless, life-long immunity to infection and the rate of acquired immunity development are key drivers of mortality patterns and spread of infection. The effect of acquired immunity on a simulated population of harbor seals subject to repeated PDV outbreaks was modeled and it was concluded that life-long immunity could actually impede the evolution of genetic disease resistance by maintaining susceptible genotypes in the population [
 <xref rid="B205-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>]. However, PDV mediated selection could still drive significant increases in resistance allele frequencies within a century, which would in turn buffer the impacts of future epizootics.
