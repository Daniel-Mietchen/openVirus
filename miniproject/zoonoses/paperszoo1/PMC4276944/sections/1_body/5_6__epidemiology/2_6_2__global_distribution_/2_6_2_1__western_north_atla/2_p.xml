<p>In the eastern Canadian Arctic it was found that the prevalence of PDV antibody in ringed seals was significantly higher where they were sympatric with migratory harp seals [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It is also likely that harp seals act as a reservoir of infection for the less gregarious hooded seals, with whom they share whelping patches on the sea ice in March, and the relatively small Atlantic walrus population, with whom they are also seasonally sympatric [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B107-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>,
 <xref rid="B176-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. From late winter though early summer, harp seals are also sympatric with both grey and harbor seals in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Maritime Canada and along the New England coast. As with harp seals, high levels of seropositivity (73%) were found in adult grey seals sampled in eastern Canada between 1980 and 1994 [
 <xref rid="B106-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Furthermore, as with harp seals, grey seals are a highly gregarious species aggregating in huge numbers for the winter (January-February) breeding season and early spring molt, and wide dispersal of pups of the year [
 <xref rid="B192-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>,
 <xref rid="B193-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>,
 <xref rid="B194-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>,
 <xref rid="B195-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>]. Like the harp seal, the grey seal population in eastern Canadian waters is large and expanding with growth by an estimated 975% between 1977 and 2010 to approximately 348,900 animals [
 <xref rid="B196-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>]. The New England grey seal population has greatly expanded with establishment of breeding colonies in Maine and Massachusetts [
 <xref rid="B193-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>,
 <xref rid="B197-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>]. By contrast, the PDV antibody prevalence in harbor seals in this region over the same period was only 37% [
 <xref rid="B106-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>], but still much higher than in European harbor seals (11%) in post-epidemic years [
 <xref rid="B198-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>]. It was suggested that the smaller population size of this species in eastern Canada and Atlantic USA, its more fragmented distribution, and less gregarious behavior would not be sufficient to maintain endemic infection without contact with either grey or harp seals [
 <xref rid="B106-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Furthermore, the lower level of herd immunity in harbor seals would leave them vulnerable to periodic mortality events. This indeed appears to be the case with a confirmed PDV mortality event occurring along the Atlantic coast from eastern Canada to Long Island, New York, over the winter of 1991/â€™92 that was preceded by mortality in juvenile harp seals in eastern Canada in spring 1991 [
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Juvenile harp and hooded seals stranded on the US Atlantic coast in increased numbers from 1998 to the end of 1999 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-05093-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The event was again associated with circulating PDV [
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and may have precipitated the prolonged increase in multi-species mortality through the first decade of the century in the New England region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-05093-f003">Figure 3</xref>). This latter unusual mortality event included the first cases of clinical disease and death associated with PDV in grey seals in North America [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and the first isolation of a North American strain of PDV from a harbor seal from the US Atlantic coast [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The phylogenetic relationship between this isolate, isolates from the two European epidemics, and the harp seal PDV have yet to be established. Preliminary investigations suggest that mutations in the F and M genes of PDV USA 2006 isolated from brain tissues were not present in isolates from lung, liver, or blood suggesting possible virus persistence in the central nervous system [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Furthermore, PDV USA 2006 has only a few amino acid substitutions in the P, M and F genes compared to the 1988 European Ulster/Netherlands strain of PDV [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Thus, the 2006 isolate from the United States might have emerged independently from 2002 PDV strains and multiple lineages of PDV might be circulating among endemically infected seals in the northwestern Atlantic [
