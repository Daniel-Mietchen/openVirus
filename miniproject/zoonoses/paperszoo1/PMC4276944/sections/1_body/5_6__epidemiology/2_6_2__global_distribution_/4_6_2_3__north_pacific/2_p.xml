<p>Further south in Alaska, including the coasts of southeastern Alaska, Kodiak Island and Prince William Sound, harbor seals were sampled for serology between 1976 and 1999 [
 <xref rid="B177-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>]. While two of 160 seals had low PDV neutralizing titers, these were assumed to be false positive reactions [

A survey of 165 Steller sea lions in the same geographic region sampled between 1998 and 2000 found only one pup with neutralizing antibodies against dolphin and porpoise morbillivirus, but not PDV or CDV, and was negative by a competitive ELISA assay [
 <xref rid="B180-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>]. The authors concluded that this too was probably a false positive reaction. In Boundary Bay, British Columbia, a sample of 21 harbor seals (14 adult, 7 juvenile) were seronegative for all morbilliviruses [
 <xref rid="B106-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Northern sea otters sampled in the western Aleutian Islands and at Elfin Cove in SE Alaska in 1997, and southern sea otters sampled in Monterey Bay, California, from 1995 to 2000 were all seronegative by ELISA [
