<p>The first compelling evidence for the presence of a morbillivirus in Pacific marine mammals was the discovery of 40% seropositivity in a PDV neutralizing test of live-captured sea otters from the Eastern Aleutian Islands sampled in 2004 and 2005 [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-05093-f003">Figure 3</xref>). However, although there was only equivocal evidence of morbillivirus pathology in examined animals, morbillivirus nucleic acid was amplified from 10% of nasal swabs of healthy live-captured otters and from tissues (lung, lymph node or brain) of three of nine beached carcasses found between 2005 and 2008 [

 <xref rid="B117-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. No sequence data was available for the more conserved and functionally significant H glycoprotein gene so speculation as to whether PDV arrived in Alaska along the Arctic Ocean coastline following the 1988 epidemic or one of the subsequent events is premature. More likely is the hypothesis that several lineages of PDV are circulating in endemically infected pinniped populations of the North Atlantic as occurs with CDV in terrestrial mammals [

 <xref rid="B45-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. If PDV has been present in the area since 2004, it is intriguing that there have been no confirmed PDV mortality events on the Alaskan coast. Northern sea otters are sympatric with PDV-na√Øve harbor seals in the Eastern Aleutian Islands and throughout the area of sea otter mortality in 2006. Further mortality surveillance of pinnipeds in this region is warranted.
