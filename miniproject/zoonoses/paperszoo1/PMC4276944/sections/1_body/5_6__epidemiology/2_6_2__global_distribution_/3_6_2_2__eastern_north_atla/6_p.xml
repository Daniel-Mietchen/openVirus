<p>The population level impact and the consequences of repeated PDV epidemics for the long-term population persistence is an essential consideration in the conservation and management of the harbor seal in European waters [
 <xref rid="B218-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">218</xref>]. This question was addressed using a stochastic model to analyze the long-term impacts on population dynamics [
 <xref rid="B219-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">219</xref>]. However, in a response to this work, Lonergan and Harwood [
 <xref rid="B220-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">220</xref>] indicated that their initial analyses did not include immunity in individuals that had survived previous outbreaks. This had a critical impact on the quasi-extinction risk estimates for harbor seals in Europe, where the estimated inter-epidemic interval for PDV is around 14 years [
 <xref rid="B219-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">219</xref>]. Once included, the risk of a population decline to 10% of an initial population of 50,000 over 100 years was about 0.05 and if all the survivors of previous events are immune this declined to less than 0.01. These scenarios were for rapidly growing populations such as is currently seen in the Wadden Sea [

 <xref rid="B222-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>] and extinction risk is understandably more serious for populations that are declining due to other factors, such as those in some regions of Scotland [
 <xref rid="B223-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>]. Of some note is that European populations have largely recovered to their pre-2002 outbreak sizes, and although the recovery was delayed in some populations, particularly those in the Wash, SE England, they too are now increasing rapidly [
 <xref rid="B224-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">224</xref>]. Consequently local population abundance, haul-out density, animal movement and the seasonal timing of any future outbreak could all affect contact rate. In addition, a recent study investigated the effect of maternal immunity on estimating the inter-epidemic interval for PDV in Europe [
 <xref rid="B225-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>]. Depending on the model assumptions, this could range from 6 to 12 years. Thus, risk predictions associated with repeated PDV outbreaks for declining populations remain challenging.
