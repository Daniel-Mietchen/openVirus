<p>The dynamics of infection differed regionally, particularly in Scotland where the prevalence of PDV antibodies was low following both outbreaks, more so in 2002 where the disease did not reach epidemic levels [
 <xref rid="B200-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>]. Lower mortality rates were also seen in England in 2002 compared to the European mainland and the earlier outbreak [
 <xref rid="B202-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>]. These region-specific patterns have therefore been important in improving our understanding of the factors regulating the severity of the outbreaks. Modeling the geographical spread of PDV and the utility of these models in the prediction of future events has been an active area of study, particularly since the 2002 outbreak. For example, spatially explicit modeling studies [
 <xref rid="B213-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">213</xref>] used an individual-based model of seal movement, using tracking data obtained from harbor seals fitted with satellite relay data loggers, to combine realistic representations of animal behavior with traditional SEIR models [
 <xref rid="B214-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>]. It was concluded that the most important factors that affect the regional and temporal spread of infection are linked to the contact rate between infective and susceptible individuals, and that animal movement and haul-out connectivity are highly influential. Since life history stage will also affect activity as animals spend more time on land during breeding and molt [
 <xref rid="B215-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>], season is also a key factor. This approach could be expanded and enhanced in future to include the movements of grey seals as potential vectors or reservoirs of infection.
