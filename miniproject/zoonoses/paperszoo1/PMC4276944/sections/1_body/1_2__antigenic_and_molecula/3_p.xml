<p>A phylogenetic tree was constructed 
 <italic>de novo</italic> from published and unpublished H gene sequences of PDV (Europe 1988, 2002, USA 2006), CDV (R252 canine strain, a wild-type raccoon strain, Baikal seal CDV and Caspian seal CDV), RPV, MV and DMV (representing the cetacean morbilliviruses) to demonstrate the evolutionary relationships of PDV isolates within the wider genus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-05093-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Neighbor-joining methodology was used and the H glycoprotein was chosen as this is under immunological pressure. Furthermore, it is known that there is good correlation between trees generated using H gene sequences and those using the highly variable cytoplasmic tail of the N protein, which is commonly used for morbillivirus genotyping [
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The phylogenetic tree demonstrates that PDV and CDV cluster into distinct, but evolutionary similar, lineages and each lineage has several variants circulating as wild-type virus with slight variations between PDV isolates from the northeastern and northwestern Atlantic.
