<p>A second and equally devastating epidemic occurred among European harbor seals in 2002, with a similar temporal and geographic range to the 1988 event [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The similarities raised the possibility that the virus had persisted in the region in either marine or terrestrial hosts. Epitope mapping of five structural proteins from the 1988 and 2002 isolates using a panel of monoclonal antibodies found no differences between the PDV isolates, suggesting a high degree of antigenic conservation over the 14 year time span [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, phylogenetic analysis of the wild-type H genes from PDV 1988 and 2002 showed distinct differences between isolates from each epidemic, suggesting that the virus circulating in 2002 had been reintroduced into the North Sea and not maintained in either marine or terrestrial hosts over the intervening interval [
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Equally intriguing was the discovery that a PDV isolate from a harbor seal stranded in Maine, USA in 2006 during an unusual mortality event was more similar to the Netherlands 1988 isolate than to the European 2002 isolates when compared using the H gene and deduced amino acid sequences [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The authors concluded that multiple lineages of PDV may be circulating in endemically infected seal populations in the eastern North Atlantic, a situation analogous to that of CDV in terrestrial carnivores [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Given the lifelong immunity and significant cross-protection seen between different morbillivirus strains, the maintenance of multiple strains in seal populations is surprising and further study into survival of strains between epizootics is merited [
