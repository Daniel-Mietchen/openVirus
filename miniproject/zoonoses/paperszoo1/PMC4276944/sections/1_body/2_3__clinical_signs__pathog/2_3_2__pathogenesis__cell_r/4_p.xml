<p>A second mammalian cell surface receptor expressed mainly on the basal-lateral surfaces of epithelial cells, the poliovirus receptor-like protein 4 (PVRL4), also known as nectin 4, has been identified as a receptor for MV, CDV and PPRV [

 <xref rid="B78-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. This receptor is also up-regulated by MV in human brain endothelial cells [
 <xref rid="B79-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Recently, PVRL4 was shown to be a receptor for wtPDV, potentially increasing the host range for the virus as it is a commonly expressed surface molecule on mammalian epithelial cells [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. However, because of the ability of wtPDV to replicate in Vero cells without prior adaptation, it has been proposed that wtPDV may use other host cell molecules such as Toll-like receptors, interferon gamma (IFNÎ³), interleukin-4 (IL4), IL8, IL10, pro-HB-EGF and the vitamin A receptor (RARa) [

 <xref rid="B65-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. It has also been postulated that alternate mechanisms of infection must be used by morbilliviruses to enable infection of neural cells that do not express CD150 or PVRL4, and for intra-cerebral spread in subacute-sclerosing panencephalitis, SSPE, in people [
