<p>In experimental studies using the ferret-CDV model, it was shown that the H protein is a key determinant of virus interaction with CD150, and that variations in this protein may influence tissue tropism [

 <xref rid="B74-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Although the H-protein sequence is overall not well conserved, two clusters of H amino acid residues involved in CD150 attachment (positions 526–529 and 547–548 and amino acid 552) are highly conserved and possibly facilitate overlapping host ranges between PDV and CDV [
