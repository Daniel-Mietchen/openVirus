<p>The complement binding glycoprotein CD46 was first shown to be a competent receptor for MV, possibly with the involvement of a cytoskeletal protein, moesin [

 <xref rid="B60-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. A related glycoprotein CD150 (or SLAM/F1, signaling lymphocyte activation molecule F1) was demonstrated using

 <xref rid="B62-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Recently, expression of CD150 was confirmed on lymphocytes of a wide range of species in the suborders 
 <italic>Caniformia</italic> and 
 <italic>Feliformia</italic> including spotted seals (
 <italic>Phoca largha</italic>) and walrus (

 <xref rid="B65-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. CD150 is a member of the C2 subset of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is expressed on activated B and T cells, constitutively on immature thymocytes, memory T cells, a proportion of B cells as well as activated monocytes and mature dendritic cells [
