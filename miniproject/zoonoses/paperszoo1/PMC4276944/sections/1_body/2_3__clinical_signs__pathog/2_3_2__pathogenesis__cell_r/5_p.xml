<p>Thus, the molecular biology and receptor usage of PDV would presumably parallel that of CDV and MV [

In laboratory studies, ferrets infected with CDV and macaques infected with MV show initial (5 to 6 days post infection) primary replication in lymph nodes and secondary lymphatic organs including those of the lungs, bronchi, and trachea [

Later (12 days post infection), most infected cells of the trachea are of lymphoid or myeloid origin and are located beneath the epithelium. CDV uses CD150 as a receptor to infect lymphocytes and dendritic cells and presumably uses PVRL4 to infect epithelial cells in the respiratory tract and elsewhere in the body where this receptor is expressed on epithelia. The logistical difficulty of working with pinniped species when experimental infections are impossible, may require the use of
