<p>The clinical course of acute PDV infection in free-ranging pinnipeds has most frequently been observed in harbor seals, and occasionally grey, harp and hooded seals, during epidemics or mortality events in Europe and North America [

Signs may include pyrexia, serous or mucopurulent ocular and nasal discharges consistent with conjunctivitis, keratitis, ophthalmitis and rhinitis. Respiratory signs include coughing, mucosal cyanosis, dyspnea with interstitial and subcutaneous emphysema in severe cases increasing buoyancy and impeding normal swimming and diving. Females infected during pregnancy are prone to abortion. Moribund seals remain ashore for longer and may develop pressure necrosis and higher than expected ectoparasite burdens. Neurological signs manifest as depression, lethargy, head tremors, convulsions and seizures. Clinical infection has been described in one juvenile harp seal from eastern Canada that was moribund for one week with lethargy, severe conjunctivitis, multifocal epidermal ulceration, mucosal cyanosis and increased lung density on radiographs [
