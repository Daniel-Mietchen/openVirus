<p>Based on experimental infectivity studies, the pathogenesis and pathology of PDV infection in harbor seals is similar to that of CDV in dogs [

The latter is rarely limited to the lungs with combinations of interlobular, sub-pleural, mediastinal, pericardial, retroperitoneal and subcutaneous emphysema. Bronchial and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are frequent. Primary PDV pneumonia is often complicated by concurrent parasitic pneumonia (
 <italic>Parafilaroides spp</italic>.), bacterial infections (
 <italic>Bordetella bronchiseptica, Streptococcus spp. Clostridium spp</italic>. among others) and viral co-infections (
 <italic>Phocid herpesvirus 1</italic>, 
 <italic>Influenza A virus</italic>). Consequently there may be suppurative and hemorrhagic pneumonia, mucopurulent exudates in airways, pleuritis, hematomas and infarction. Dermatitis is often manifested as focal or locally extensive areas of hyperkertosis on ears, eyelids and foot pads of terrestrial carnivores infected by CDV [
 <xref rid="B95-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Similar pathology has not been reported for harbor seals, the pinniped most susceptible to PDV. However, focal crusting on the dorsal surface of the flippers, head, trunk and tail was described for a juvenile harp seal and hooded seal (
