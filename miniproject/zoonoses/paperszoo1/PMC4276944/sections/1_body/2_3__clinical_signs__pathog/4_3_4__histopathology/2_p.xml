<p>Marked necrosis and depletion of lymphocytes in spleen, thymus, gut-associated lymphoid tissue and peripheral lymph nodes is characteristic. Acidophilic ICIBs may be observed in lymphoid tissues and severely depleted follicles may have central syncytia. Non-suppurative encephalitis in harbor and harp seals is remarkably similar to those of spontaneous CDV in dogs [

 <xref rid="B98-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The distribution is generally cerebral and often with a laminar or multifocal pattern of neuronal and glial necrosis in the cerebral cortex, mononuclear perivascular cuffing, astrocytosis, microgliosis, neuronophagia and focal demyelination in cerebral white matter. Acidophilic ICIBs and INIBs are frequently seen in neurons and astrocytes (

 <xref rid="B98-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The acute phase occurs around three weeks post infection and coincides with the period of viral-induced immunosuppression [

These animals may progress to death, recover after mild or subclinical illness, or develop a chronic or relapsing disease with persistence of the virus in the brain and progression of demyelination mediated by immunopathological mechanisms [

Neither is there evidence for an old dog encephalitis (ODE)-like syndrome in pinnipeds. ODE is an extremely rare condition in dogs manifesting as neurological deficits years after primary CDV infection. It is characterized by an intense inflammatory reaction in the forebrain (frontal cortex, basal nucleus, pyriform lobe, rostral thalamus, and rostral subcortical white matter) with sparing of the hindbrain (cerebellum and caudal brain stem) and occipital cortex (grey and white matter). Histologically, there are prominent perivascular cuffs, neuronal necrosis, astrocytosis, formation of multinucleated giant cells and focal demyelination with ICIBs in astrocytes and giant cells [
