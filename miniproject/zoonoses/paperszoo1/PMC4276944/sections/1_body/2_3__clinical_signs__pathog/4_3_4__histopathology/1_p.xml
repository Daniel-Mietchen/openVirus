Bronchointerstitial pneumonia is characterized, in cases uncomplicated by secondary infections, by serofibrinous alveolar exudates containing leukocytes and macrophages. Serofibrinous exudate is replaced in subacute cases by hyaline membranes and in more chronic cases, fibroplasia in alveolar septa and infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells and other leukocytes. Initial viral replication in type I pneumocytes during acute infection results in their necrosis and eventual replacement by type II pneumocytes in more sub-acute cases. Syncytia are found in bronchioles, alveoli and peri-bronchiolar glands but these are generally less numerous and smaller than the equivalent in cetaceans infected by CeMV [
 <xref rid="B93-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Acidophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (ICIB) and intranuclear inclusion bodies (INIB) of respiratory epithelium have been observed throughout the tract including bronchiolar gland epithelium, type II pneumocytes and in syncytia. Inclusions are generally discrete, ovoid (10–20 µm) with distinct borders. Similar inclusions may be present in transitional epithelium of the renal pelvis and urinary bladder, biliary and pancreatic ducts, tonsils and gastro-intestinal epithelia, and conjunctiva.
