<p>PDVâ€“associated dermatitis has been documented in a harp and hooded seal characterized by a focally thickened epidermis with three distinct layers: a deeply eosinophilic superficial layer of orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis, a zone of hyperplastic basal cells, and middle band with numerous necrotic syncytial cells some of which with as many as 30 to 40 nuclei. These areas resembled syncytial zones rather than discrete syncytial cells. Hair follicle infundibula had similar changes. Eosinophilic ICIBs were observed in epidermal, follicular and sebaceous cells but INIBs were rare. Syncytia were also present in sebaceous glands [
