<p>The high mortality resulting from the 2002 PDV epidemic in Europe enabled a detailed pathological assessment of 369 harbor seal stranded on the coasts of The Netherlands [
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. The seals were aged based on dentin layers in teeth and classed as &lt;1, 1 to 2 years, and 3 years or older. Analysis of the pathology and ancillary diagnostic results enabled insights into the distribution of lesions, temporal presence of viral antigen or genome in organs, and influence of co-infections. The data confirmed the differential temporal occurrence of PDV in lung and brain. As in dogs with CDV, PDV virus persisted much longer in the brain than in lung. As in the 1988 epidemic, a greater proportion of older animals had PDV neutralizing antibodies. This study supported the hypothesis that there was greater mortality among younger age classes and age-related immune compromise in younger seals. The course of disease in older seals may also be longer enabling the development of an immune response. A second age-related observation was the development and severity of extra-thoracic emphysema that increased with age and was possibly related to the more chronic course of disease in older animals or their diving behavior. The study further enabled documentation of the role of PDV-induced immunosuppression in the promotion of secondary bacterial and parasitic infections in older animals.
