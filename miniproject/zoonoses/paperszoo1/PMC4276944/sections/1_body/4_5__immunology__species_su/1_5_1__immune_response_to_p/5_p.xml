<p>Variation at targeted candidate immune genes was assessed in a sample of seals that either died from infection or survived and from several geographic locations [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The selected genes included morbillivirus receptors (SLAM and CD46), proteins involved in immune detection (TLR2), immune regulation (IFNG, IL4, IL8, IL10) and proteins involved in disease physiology (RARa, vitamin A receptor). No variation was found across Europe in protein coding domains for SLAM or CD46, but SNPs were found in SLAM intron 2, and exon 1 of IL8 and RARa. The available sample sizes did not have sufficient power to resolve a significant association with disease status, but consistent with the microsatellite data, there was significant differentiation of allele frequencies at the SNP loci among populations. This was a first attempt to investigate the association between genetics and disease susceptibility for wildlife using samples from an actual morbillivirus epidemic. Future studies incorporating full genome sequencing of the host species should enable a more refined analysis of the role of host genetics in the immune response and disease susceptibility [
