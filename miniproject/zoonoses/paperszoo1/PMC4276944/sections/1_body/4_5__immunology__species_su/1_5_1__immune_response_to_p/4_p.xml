<p>Initial characterization of locus complement and variation of major histocompatibility (MHC) class I genes in eight harbor and four grey seals, found that both species had two expressed MHC class I lineages comprising one classical polymorphic lineage, a second non-classical non-polymorphic class I gene, plus a non-expressed pseudogene [
 <xref rid="B131-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. The highly polymorphic lineage showed the typical pattern of diversity for MHC genes consistent with diversifying pathogen driven selection, but higher levels of variation in grey seals (with 12 genes, 26 allotypes, 1–4 allotypes per locus) compared to harbor seals (with 6 genes, 18 allotypes, 1–4 allotypes per locus). It is still to be determined whether variation at MHC loci contributed to intra and interspecies differences in susceptibility to PDV at a population level. Nevertheless, the findings complement the previous studies on humoral immune response suggesting a greater capacity to respond to and neutralize PDV by grey seals than harbor seals [
