<p>The immunosuppressive effects of CDV on canine lymphocytes was demonstrated

 <xref rid="B137-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. As infection spreads, the response switches to an anti-inflammatory Th2 profile (IL-4, IL-10 and TGFβ) [

 <xref rid="B140-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. An
