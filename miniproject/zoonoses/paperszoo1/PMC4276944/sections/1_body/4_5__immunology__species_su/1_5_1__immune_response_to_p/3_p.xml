<p>Differential mortality within the European harbor seal metapopulation during the 1988 and 2002 epidemics prompted studies of genetic population structure, genome wide genetic variation and variation in immune response genes [

 <xref rid="B130-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>] demonstrated that despite their potential mobility, harbor seal populations in the European epizootic area showed strong genetic structuring. This would allow for differential distribution between populations of alleles contributing to susceptibility at functional loci, but overall levels of genetic variation were similar in populations experiencing high and low mortality. Recently fine scale population structure was identified over short geographic distances within Scandinavian populations [

Further examination of genetic variation using microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Wadden Sea harbor seal population (which showed high PDV mortality in both epidemics) demonstrated a link between individual levels of inbreeding and lungworm infection [

 <xref rid="B134-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Whether individual inbreeding is relevant to PDV mortality remains to be tested, but the latter studies do establish a link between individual genetic variation and the response to an infectious disease in harbor seals.
