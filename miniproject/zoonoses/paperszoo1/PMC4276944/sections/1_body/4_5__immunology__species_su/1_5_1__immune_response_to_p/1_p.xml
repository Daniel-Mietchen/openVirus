<p>Based on natural and experimental infection, harbor seals appear more susceptible to PDV than grey seals [

 <xref rid="B124-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Species susceptibility may be due to multiple factors and include host-specific factors such as cell receptors and differences in immune response such as antigen processing and presentation, or cytokine production. Serologic surveys in Europe during and after the first PDV epidemic showed higher seroconversion rates in grey seals [

 <xref rid="B126-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. Harbor seals that died from PDV infection rarely had antibodies directed against the important F and H glycoproteins but had antibodies directed towards internal N and P glycoproteins of PDV and CDV and in this regard were similar to dogs that developed clinical CDV [

 <xref rid="B127-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>,
 <xref rid="B128-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. Further studies based on the precipitation of radiolabelled CDV proteins by sera from naturally infected grey and harbor seals from North America confirmed that grey seal sera strongly precipitated N protein and the H and F glycoproteins [
 <xref rid="B129-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. By contrast, significantly fewer harbor seal sera precipitated the envelope glycoproteins and responses were weaker than with grey seal serum. Harbor seals that died from PDV encephalitis or pneumonia precipitated the N protein alone or reacted weakly with the envelope glycoproteins [
