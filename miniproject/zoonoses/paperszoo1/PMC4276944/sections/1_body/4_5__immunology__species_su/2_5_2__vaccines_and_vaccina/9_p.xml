<p>Currently, a SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) compartmental model is under development to simulate trajectories of morbillivirus outbreaks in MHI seals. Contact rates will be estimated using social network analysis of individual association data, and a plausible range of other key parameters (such as latency, duration of infectious period, 
 <italic>etc.</italic>) will be extrapolated from other species and outbreaks. Efficacy of response vaccination in the face of a morbillivirus outbreak in the MHI will be evaluated. A key question is whether an adequate response can be mounted to immunize a sufficient portion of the population in time to halt transmission. With regard to a prophylaxis, the proportion of each subpopulation that must be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity will be estimated, along with the uncertainty surrounding these estimates.
