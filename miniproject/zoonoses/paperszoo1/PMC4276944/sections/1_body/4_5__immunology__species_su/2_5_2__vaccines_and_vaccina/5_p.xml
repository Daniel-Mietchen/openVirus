<p>The vaccination plan incorporates three elements: vaccine selection, captive animal testing for safety and efficacy, and vaccination of free-ranging seals. To date, the first two elements have been completed. The candidate vaccine is recombinant CDV (monovalent recombinant canary pox vector expressing CDV antigens, Purevax, Merial) licensed for use in ferrets in the U.S. and used in zoological collections [

 <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.aazv.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.aazv.org</uri>) for use in wild carnivores and it is approved generically for use in Hawaii. Availability of this vaccine is a limitation to its use, as the product has been on manufacturer backorder for two years. Without greater certainty regarding the vaccine's future availability, development and testing of a new vaccine will be required, which may delay implementation of the vaccination plan.
