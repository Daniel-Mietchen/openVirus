<p>It has yet to be resolved whether to: (1) vaccinate only in response to an outbreak; (2) conduct prophylactic vaccination; or (3) combine both approaches. Hawaiian monk seals are distributed in a metapopulation comprising many subpopulations spanning the 2500 km-wide archipelago [
 <xref rid="B154-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. Most of the population resides in the remote Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI), associated with small islands and atolls, all but one of which are reachable only by boat. In contrast, a smaller but growing population occurs in the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI), home also to over one million people [
 <xref rid="B155-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. Because of the remote location, monk seals in the NWHI are monitored for at most a few months during summer. As such, detecting an outbreak in the NWHI could be delayed or completely escape detection. Thus, response vaccination is not a viable option. By contrast, monk seals in the MHI are monitored year round by volunteer observers and the general public. An outbreak of disease here would likely be reported so response vaccination may be a viable control option.
