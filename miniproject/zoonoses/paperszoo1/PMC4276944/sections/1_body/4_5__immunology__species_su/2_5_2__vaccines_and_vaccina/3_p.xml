<p>The Hawaiian monk seal is among the rarest of pinnipeds, with approximately 1200 individuals remaining throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago [
 <xref rid="B148-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. Currently, infectious disease is not known to be limiting monk seal recovery, and serology and post mortem results indicate that the population is na√Øve to PDV [
 <xref rid="B149-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. However, the species has extremely low genetic diversity [
 <xref rid="B150-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>], and although their susceptibility to morbilliviruses is unknown, DMV and CDV have been reported in cetaceans and domestic dogs in the Hawaiian Islands [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and vagrant pinnipeds from the eastern North Pacific, where PDV has recently been reported [
 <xref rid="B117-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>], have been observed on Hawaiian beaches.
