<p>The optimal strategy for vaccinating free-ranging Hawaiian monk seals is currently under investigation. Low population abundance, one of the risk factors for an outbreak, also makes vaccinating a significant portion of the population tractable. Monk seals tend to haul out singly or as small groups on the beach, are individually identifiable, and are readily approachable. Thus, vaccine may be administered either by brief capture and physical restraint or using a pole syringe.</p>
