<p>Vaccination of free living wildlife has rarely been performed to protect the target population from infectious disease, with the notable exception of extensive vaccination of some vectors of zoonoses, such as rabies vaccination of raccoons in the eastern U.S or foxes in Europe. When vaccinating wildlife, vaccines must be selected that can be feasibly given to wildlife effectively, that confer a suitable duration of immunity for the species and disease of concern, and that do not disrupt disease surveillance in the target population. Marine mammals have been vaccinated when in rehabilitation settings to protect them from disease during care or after release [

 <xref rid="B143-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>], but vaccination of free living marine mammals is logistically difficult due to their aquatic life. In general, the use of attenuated live morbillivirus vaccines is contraindicated because of the potential risk of disease to the vaccinated animal, and potential for spread to in-contact animals [
