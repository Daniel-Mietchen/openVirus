<p>Morbilliviruses are notoriously difficult to isolate and propagate in cell culture [
 <xref rid="B121-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. PDV was first isolated by experimentally infecting dogs with spleen, lung, and lymph node homogenate from three naturally-infected infected seals [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The first direct isolation was from a primary kidney cell culture from a naturally-infected harbor seal [
 <xref rid="B122-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Co-cultivation of buffy coat leukocytes from infected seals with Vero cells has also been successful [
 <xref rid="B123-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. More recently, Vero cells expressing the dog CD150 receptor were tested in order to develop a cell culture and isolation methodology that may be more useful for isolating and better understanding the phylogeny and evolution of marine mammal morbilliviruses [
 <xref rid="B109-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Result showed that PDV replication in Vero.DogSLAMtag cells progressed rapidly (on the order of days) and required fewer passages, whereas virus replication in primary seal kidney and Vero cells took much longer (on the order of weeks) and required multiple passages [
 <xref rid="B109-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Thus, these VeroSLAM cells are now used routinely for isolation of marine mammal morbilliviruses, including PDV.
