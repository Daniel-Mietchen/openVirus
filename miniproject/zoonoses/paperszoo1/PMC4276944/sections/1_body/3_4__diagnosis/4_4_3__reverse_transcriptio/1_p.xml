<p>By far the most common PCR assay used for detection of PDV is the “universal” morbillivirus primer set that amplifies a 486 bp fragment of the P gene, followed by nested PCR using specific primer sets that amplify a 384 bp fragment of the PDV and CDV P genes respectively, to ascertain which virus is present [

 <xref rid="B115-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. This assay has been used to detect PDV in live animals (whole blood, nasal, pharyngeal or ocular swabs) and in tissues such as trachea-bronchial lymph nodes, spleen, liver, kidney, lung and brain from carcasses. This assay was used to test tissue samples from the 2002 European harbor seal epidemic [
 <xref rid="B116-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>] and more recently from nasal swabs and archived tissues from Northern sea otters (

 <xref rid="B117-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Stanton 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B113-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>] modified the P gene primers to shorten the amplicon to a 149 bp fragment for use in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. The assay maintained the sensitivity to differentiate CDV and PDV, and was useful for determining that CDV was present in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from a Caspian seal; and PDV in harp, hooded and European harbor seal tissues. A quantitative real-time PCR assay was used during the North Sea European harbor seal epidemic in 2002 to test samples from sympatric grey seals for evidence of PDV infection shortly after the peak of the epidemic [
 <xref rid="B118-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. The TaqMan probe and primers were designed using the PDV H gene sequence from the 1988 epidemic (GenBank accession no. D10371). Primers were also designed to amplify a fragment of the grey seal b-actin gene, as a housekeeping gene to determine the integrity of the cDNA and to confirm PCR efficiency of the assay. Incorporation of the b-actin assay is useful for better interpretation of negative results when using any of the morbillivirus assays. Real-time PCR was chosen over conventional RT-PCR as it allowed for both detection and quantification of the number virus copies in the sample. More recently, Earle 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] designed additional PDV primers to amplify the H, F, M, and P genes using previously published PDV sequences, for confirmation of the USA 2006 PDV outbreak in harbor seals. Selected fragments of the PCR products are then sequenced for virus identification and phylogenetic analysis.
