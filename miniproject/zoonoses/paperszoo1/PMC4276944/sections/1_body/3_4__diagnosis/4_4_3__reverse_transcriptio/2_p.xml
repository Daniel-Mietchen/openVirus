<p>Recently, a one-step duplex quantitative RT-PCR assay (RT-qPCR) based on TaqMan probe technology was developed to quantify PDV along with the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene to simultaneously assess RNA quality [

Another recent development is a pan-marine mammal morbillivirus semi-nested RT-PCR using a degenerate set of primers targeting conserved sequences of the P protein has been described [
 <xref rid="B120-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>], which detects both pinniped and cetacean morbilliviruses. Such an assay is useful for detecting morbilliviruses in multiple marine mammal species.
