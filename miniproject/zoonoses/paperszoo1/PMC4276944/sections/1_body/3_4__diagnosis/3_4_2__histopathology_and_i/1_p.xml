<p>The identification of acidophilic or amphophilic ICIBs or INIBs in hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained tissue sections is strongly suggestive of morbillivirus infection. When dealing with potentially new host species, or new areas of disease emergence, it is recommended to use ancillary tests such as immunohistochemistry to confirm the presence of morbilliviral antigen [

Immunohistochemistry is also extremely useful if the classic histological lesions or inclusions are no longer visible or equivocal as can occur in more chronic cases and in animals where the viral lesions are masked by severe inflammation or necrosis caused by secondary infections. Currently, most laboratories use an avidin-biotin complex (ABC) technique and either a primary monoclonal antibody against the nucleocapsid (N) of CDV (VMRD, Inc., Pullman, WA, USA) or polyclonal rabbit anti-CDV nucleoprotein [
