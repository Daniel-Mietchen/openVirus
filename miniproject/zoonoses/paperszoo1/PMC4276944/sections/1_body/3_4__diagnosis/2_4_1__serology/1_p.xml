<p>Because serological tests do not always measure the same analyte (e.g., IgM 
 <italic>versus</italic> IgG, antibodies directed against different viral antigens), results from different tests are not always comparable. Virus neutralization (VN), and plaque reduction (PR) tests are the most extensively used to determine the presence of antibodies against morbilliviruses in the blood of a large number of pinniped species [

These are also the only available serological tests that can different between CDV and PDV infections in which a differential antibody titer of 4-fold or greater indicates homologous as opposed to heterologous exposure. While both tests are capable of detecting circulating antibodies, PR testing has the added advantage in that it can be used on the more degraded or hemolysed and whole blood samples usually obtained from beached carcasses or from animals harvested for food by indigenous hunters. Testing is usually done for both assays using standard Vero cells. However, use of Vero.DogSLAMtag cells, expressing canine CD150 receptor, which are more sensitive to virus growth, permits reduction of testing time by 1â€“2 days for both the VN and PRN tests, [

It has been shown that serum antibodies raised against one morbillivirus will neutralize the homologous virus to a higher titer than the heterologous morbilliviruses [
