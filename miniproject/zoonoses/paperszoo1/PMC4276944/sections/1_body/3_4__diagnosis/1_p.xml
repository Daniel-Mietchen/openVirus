<p>The clinical signs of respiratory tract infection seen in seals with PDV and the associated oculo-nasal discharge and conjunctivitis are nonspecific and may be seen with 
 <italic>Influenza A virus</italic> and other infections [

 <xref rid="B103-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Similarly, the neurological impairment is similar to that seen following ingestion of marine algal biotoxins such as domoic acid [
 <xref rid="B104-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Gross pathology in cases of acute respiratory infection is highly suggestive of PDV but not pathognomonic. Serology is most useful for population surveillance and less so as a diagnostic tool for individual animals. Antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) have been used on tissue homogenates [
