<p>Considerable advances have been made in understanding the immune response of pinnipeds to PDV field infection and to vaccination by various attenuated and subunit vaccines as reviewed. Although we are closer to deployment of an inactivated vaccine as a strategy to protect the potentially vulnerable Hawaiian monk seal, further work is required to model the efficacy of such an approach. Better characterization of the immune response of different species of pinniped cells to different variants of PDV is required using 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches, and animal models to tease apart the genetic determinants, role of cytokines in immune response and immunosuppression (Th1 
 <italic>versus</italic> Th2 responses), and the components of cellular and humoral immunity.
