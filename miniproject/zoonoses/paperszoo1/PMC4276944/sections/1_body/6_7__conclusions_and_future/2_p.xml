<p>Significant advances in understanding the pathogenesis of PDV have been made by the discovery of specific host cell receptors (CD150 and PVRL 4) that determine tissue (lymphoreticular cells, epithelial cells) and host specificity. Vero cells expressing canine CD150 receptor have since been developed to enhance our capacity to isolate wild-type PDV from field cases and as reagents for serology tests. However, we continue to speculate on the mode of entry of PDV into cells of the central nervous system. Does the virus persist in the protected environment of the brain and even acquire strain differences as has been suggested by some research findings? What determines host specificity and why are some species so susceptible to infection while others appear resistant to clinical disease? Could there be qualitative and quantitative differences in the distribution and affinity of relevant receptors? Answers to some of these questions may be provided by study of seals affected by field infection to assess the distribution of virus in tissues of different species infected by known viral strains. However, understanding of the molecular mechanisms will probably require development of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models to assess attachment, infectivity and replication of the virus in specific cell types. Such studies will provide a greater insight on pathogenicity but will also facilitate the development of more sophisticated vaccines or therapeutics for endangered species such as the monk seals discussed in this review.
