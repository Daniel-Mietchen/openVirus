<p>Advances in molecular biology in the past 20 years have greatly enhanced our capacity to extract and sequence the morbillivirus genome reducing sequencing errors and the effects of adaptation to cell cultures. Complete sequences for the major genes are available for PDV from both European epidemics and from the USA 2006 mortality event affecting harbor seals. These will facilitate the resolution of the phylogenetic classification of PDV and its relationship with other members of the genus. However, similar sequence data are not available for other potential host species and are particularly lacking (apart from partial P gene sequence) for the harp seal. As this species is still the best candidate for reservoir of infection in the greater North Atlantic ecosystem, isolation of the virus and mapping the genome of PDV from harp seals should enable a better understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of infection. Similarly, more complete genetic mapping of the northern sea otter PDV genome is needed to determine the origin of this virus and its relationship to the North Atlantic variants.</p>
