<p>Since the discovery of PDV in 1988, it has become the most ecologically significant pathogen of pinnipeds, certainly in the northern hemisphere. At the First International Symposium on Morbillivirus Infections in Hannover, 1994, a workshop was convened to discuss the current understanding on the new marine mammal pathogens in the morbillivirus genus [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In retrospect, our knowledge at that time was quite limited. We understood the basic pathology and serology because of the similarities with CDV, could determine antigenic and genetic relationships to create rudimentary phylogenetic trees, and were beginning to grasp the intricacies of PDV epidemiology. Twenty years later, this review is testament to a huge corpus of research that has been generated largely because of the continued high profile of PDV as an agent of mass mortality for European harbor seals and smaller die-offs in eastern North America, and the recent emergence of infection in the North Pacific. The Princeton RAPIDD workshop was convened at this juncture to capture the advances in disparate fields of research pertinent to this deadly infection, to identify significant knowledge gaps, and to harness and channel the expertise of the assembled scientists into coordinated investigations on viral pathogenesis, immune response, phylogenetics, ecology and population dynamics.
