<p>The two major epidemics in Europe provided an unprecedented opportunity to develop various mathematical models from which predictions about the recurrence and impact of future events. In particular, the distribution of the outbreaks across largely the same geographical region, has allowed for a comparative approach with collaborative teams in several countries teasing apart the effects of time, space and seal ecology on disease transmission and expression. The use of individual-based models of seal movement from satellite tracked animals enabled researchers to combine realistic representations of animal behavior with traditional SEIR models and show how contact rate, animal movement, and haul-out connectivity are highly influential in epidemic dynamics. Significant knowledge gaps still exist for the northeast Atlantic and not least is where does PDV reside in the inter-epidemic interval? Does the more disease resistant grey seal play a role as vector around the coasts of Europe? What role does the eastern harp seal population play? What are the determinants of case fatality rate in harbor seals across metapopulations? How do immunogenetics and immunotoxicology impact the epidemiology? Developments in genomic technology now allow us to take a population genomic approach to assess genetic contributions to intra and interspecies differences in PDV susceptibility, building on the earlier studies of neutral markers and candidate genes.</p>
