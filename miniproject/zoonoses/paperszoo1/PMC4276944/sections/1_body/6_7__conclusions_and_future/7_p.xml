<p>Perhaps the greatest unknown to emerge from the RAPIDD workshop is the status of morbillivirus infection in the North Pacific. A PDV-like virus appears to have crept silently into central Alaska in the early 2000s and may or may not have been associated with a mortality event in northern sea otters in 2006. Preliminary data suggest that infection, based on serology and PCR, may now also be widespread in pinnipeds in the region. Given the propensity for PDV to cause epidemics in na√Øve phocid populations, the apparent lack of mortality among potentially vulnerable sympatric Pacific harbor seals is difficult to explain. Partial sequence data on the sea otter morbillivirus P gene indicates similarity to PDV from the North Atlantic; however, virus isolation and substantially more sequence data are required before the phylogenetic relationships can be determined. Equally intriguing is whether or not this virus or yet another variant is circulating in the coastal waters of Japan and Russia and possibly causing localized epidemics among Kuril harbor seals. Further surveillance in the North Pacific in general is required before we can speculate on the ecology of PDV in this region.</p>
