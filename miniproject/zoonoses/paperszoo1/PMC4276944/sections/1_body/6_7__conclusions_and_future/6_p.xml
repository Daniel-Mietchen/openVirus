<p>In the western North Atlantic PDV appears to have been endemic in the larger and more diverse populations of pinnipeds for quite some time. While harbor and grey seals are found on both sides of the Atlantic, a key difference is the very large harp seal population that is seasonally resident on the sea ice of Maritime Canada and in close proximity to both grey and harbor seals. A second significant difference between east and west is that grey seals in UK waters, where the largest European population resides, breed in November, well before harbor seal breeding season in early summer. Therefore by the time the PDV epidemics started in Europe in April or May, the grey seal juveniles were already six months old and probably less vulnerable to infection. By contrast, in Canada and Maine, grey seal pups are born in February, harp and hooded seals in March, and harbor seals from April through early summer. Thus although there is high herd immunity in harp and gray seals, and moderate in hooded and harbor seals, there is an enormous influx of susceptible animals into the ecosystem each spring/summer. In this scenario, PDV has the potential to cause repeated but limited mortality events that can involve multiple species, mostly juveniles, but also older susceptibles for species like the harbor seal with lower herd immunity. While pinniped populations are higher in Atlantic Canada and the USA, large-scale epidemics as occur in Europe are never likely to occur because of the level of herd immunity. While this much we know, there is much more to understand about the dynamics of viral transmission and maintenance in this complex multi-host ecosystem.</p>
