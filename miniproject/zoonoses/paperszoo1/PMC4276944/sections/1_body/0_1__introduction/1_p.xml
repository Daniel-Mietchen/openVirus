<p>Beginning in late 1987 seemingly unprecedented epidemics spread through pinniped populations from Siberia to Western Europe. The series began with the mass mortality of Baikal seals (
 <italic>Pusa sibirica</italic>) in land-locked Lake Baikal [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The event followed an outbreak of canine distemper virus (CDV) infection in terrestrial mammals and a variety of diagnostic tests later confirmed that CDV was implicated in the seal deaths [

 <xref rid="B2-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Shortly afterwards, beginning in April 1988, an epidemic swept through breeding colonies of European harbor seals (
 <italic>Phoca vitulina vitulina</italic>) around the coasts of the North, Baltic and Irish seas killing up to 18,000 of this species and possibly a few hundred sympatric grey seals, 
 <italic>Halichoerus grypus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, while the clinical presentation and pathology were similar to CDV infection, antigenic characterization and gene sequencing demonstrated that the virus was a novel and distinct member of the 
 <italic>Morbillivirus</italic> genus, phocine distemper virus, PDV [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-06-05093" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
