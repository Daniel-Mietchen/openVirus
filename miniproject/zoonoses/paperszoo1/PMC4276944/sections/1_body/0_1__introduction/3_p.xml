Twenty years later, August 2014, a Research and Policy for Infectious Disease Dynamics (RAPIDD) workshop was convened on marine mammal morbilliviruses at Princeton University, USA, to discuss recent advances in research on PDV pathology, pathogenesis, transmission, species susceptibility, immunology and development of vaccination strategies for na√Øve threatened species such as Mediterranean (

 <italic>M. schauinslandii</italic>) monk seals, and future directions for research. As an outcome of the workshop and round table discussion, we review the pertinent research in these relevant fields that has been published in the past 20 years and identify knowledge gaps requiring further research investment.
