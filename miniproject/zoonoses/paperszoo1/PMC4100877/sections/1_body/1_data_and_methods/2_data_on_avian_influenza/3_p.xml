<p>In Vietnam and Madagascar, data on avian influenza were obtained from previous serological surveys using multistage sampling strategies that have been described elsewhere

 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Desvaux2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Briefly, two repeated cross-sectional surveys were conducted in the Red River Delta (Vietnam). They were based on a stratified, one-stage clustered design with a random selection of the clusters (the flocks for semi-commercial farms or the villages for backyard poultry) and a random selection of the birds within each cluster. Poultry samples were collected in December 2008, January, March and June 2009 (first survey), then monthly from March to June 2011 (second survey). In total, 3234 sera were collected from unvaccinated chickens and ducks in 83 villages and tested using a HI (hemagglutination inhibition) H5 test. In the Vietnam highlands, a serological survey was carried out with poultry samples collected monthly from April 2005 to September 2006. Within each district of Ha Giang province, four communes were chosen to represent all of the ethnic groups and to cover a wide range of environmental conditions and farming systems. Six to eight villages per commune, 6–8 farmers per village, and one or two birds in each household then were randomly selected. Our study finally included 1531 chicken sera collected in 167 villages and tested using an AIV type A ELISA competition test and a H5 pseudoviral particles assay. In Madagascar, the serological survey was based on a stratified, two-stage random sampling scheme with villages and farmers as the first- and second-degree units. A sampling fraction of 10% of villages within municipalities, and 30% of farmers within villages was set as the sampling objective. Our database included 980 sera collected in August 2008 (n = 276) and May 2009 (n = 704) from chickens, ducks and geese on 147 farms located in 14 villages. Sera were tested against avian influenza type A using an ELISA competition test (IDVET©).
