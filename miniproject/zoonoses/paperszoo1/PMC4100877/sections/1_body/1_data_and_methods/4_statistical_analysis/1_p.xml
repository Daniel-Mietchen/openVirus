<p>The statistical analysis was based on spatial generalized linear models, which were run using the MASS package of the R software. Due to differences in data collection, the dependent variable was binomial (village infected/not infected by H5N1) in Thailand, while it was the proportion of seropositive birds in Vietnam (H5 village-level seroprevalence) and Madagascar (farm-level AIV type A seroprevalence). Putative risk factors were first screened using univariate analysis. In a second step, multivariate models were run, including all of the significant covariables from the univariate analysis (

This spatial dependency between observations was accounted for by introducing a correlation structure in the univariate and multivariate models (see details in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0101958.s005">Material S1</xref>). The extent of spatial autocorrelation was specified according to the range estimated from the spline correlogram of influenza positivity (Thailand) or prevalence (Vietnam, Madagascar) data. An exponential function was selected for the correlation matrix, as indicated by the shape of the spatial correlogram. To verify whether spatial autocorrelation was correctly accounted for, we inspected the residuals of the logistic models using a Monte Carlo method. This consisted of comparing the observed variogram with variogram ‘envelopes’ that were computed by simulating 999 permutations of the data values across locations
