<p>Layers of the road networks were obtained from the Royal Thai Survey Department in Thailand, the National Cartography House in Vietnam, and from DIVA-GIS (

Euclidian distances from all study locations to the closest major road were calculated. Environmental variables were obtained for the four sites through diverse means. In Thailand, a land cover map including rice fields, rivers, lakes, canals and ponds was provided by the Royal Thai Survey Department. In Vietnam, a series of MODIS images collected in 2005 at 500-m resolution (

 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Guerrini1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The Euclidian distances from each study location (village or farm) to the nearest permanent body of water were calculated. The percentage of area occupied by rice paddy fields in a 1-km radius around points was calculated. Before modeling, distances as well as human and poultry densities were log-transformed to improve the fit of the linear relationship between these variables and the outcome. The rice variable was dichotomized to discriminate landscapes with predominant rice production (percentage of paddy fields in a 1-km neighborhood â‰¥0.80) from others.
