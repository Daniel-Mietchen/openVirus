<p>Poultry census data were collected in Thailand at the village level during the X-ray survey organized in February 2005 by the DLD. Chicken and duck densities (birds/km
 <sup>2</sup>) were calculated using a village area estimated from Delaunay triangulation between village centroids. In Vietnam, chicken and duck densities were estimated by extracting mean values from poultry density rasters
