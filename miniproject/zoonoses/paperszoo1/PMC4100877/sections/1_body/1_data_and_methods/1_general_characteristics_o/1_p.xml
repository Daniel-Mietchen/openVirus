<p>The present work is part of a large-scale research project, “GRIPAVI”, launched in 2007 to improve understanding of the ecological and epidemiological factors involved in the maintenance and spread of avian influenza viruses in tropical countries. In collaboration with national and international research groups, field surveys were conducted over five years in six study sites located in Vietnam, Mauritania, Mali, Ethiopia, Madagascar and Zimbabwe

To develop a comparative approach, we selected two GRIPAVI sites with similar agro-ecosystems based on rice cultivation and duck farming: the Red River Delta in Vietnam and Lake Alaotra in Madagascar. We added two other study sites featuring similar ecological characteristics, one in the Vietnam highlands, and the other in lower-Northern Thailand, where we previously had conducted extensive field work to gather information on AIV
