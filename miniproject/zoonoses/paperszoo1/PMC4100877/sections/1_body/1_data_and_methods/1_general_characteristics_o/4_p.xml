<p>In Vietnam, two study sites were selected in two regions presenting contrasting agro-ecological features. The first study site was in the Red River Delta, which is characterized by low elevations and a combination of duck farming with intensive rice cultivation. This site was chosen because HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in Northern Vietnam mainly were concentrated in this type of agro-ecological area
