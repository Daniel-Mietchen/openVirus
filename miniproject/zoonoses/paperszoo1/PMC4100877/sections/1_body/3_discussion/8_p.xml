<p>It is noteworthy that we did not find avian influenza to be associated with human population density in any of the four study sites. This contrasts with previous studies carried out at the village level in Indonesia 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Loth1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and Thailand 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-VanBoeckel1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. We considered two possible explanations. Firstly, the association that has been observed between the risk of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks and human population density may be a reflection of the increased detection sensitivity of surveillance in highly populated areas. This might be particularly applicable to studies based on avian influenza data collected through passive surveillance systems. It is reasonable to assume outbreaks are more likely to be detected and reported in more densely populated places. The fact that we did not observe an association between AIV circulation and human population density may simply confirm that such detection bias was limited in our study, which had a much more limited spatial extent. This hypothesis sounds reasonable in Vietnam and Madagascar, as AIV data were collected using cross-sectional serological surveys designed without any restriction on village size or accessibility. This hypothesis also makes sense in Thailand, where H5N1 outbreaks were detected by comprehensive active detection surveys involving several hundred thousand volunteers searching door-to-door for evidence of infection in even the smallest villages and remote areas. Secondly, human population density has also been used as a surrogate for poultry markets and areas of intensive poultry trading activities that may in turn support an increased risk of AIV transmission through flows of contaminated poultry or fomites 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Paul1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. From our study, one also could hypothesize that human population density may not be a relevant proxy for poultry trading activities in fine-scale studies focusing on a limited geographic area. When working with fine resolution data (farm or village level) on small study areas, it may be necessary to use instead variables which reflect more closely the organization of poultry trade on the ground. The distance to the closest wet markets or the presence of a poultry trader in the village 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Desvaux1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> could constitute better risk indicators for avian influenza than human population density in this case.
