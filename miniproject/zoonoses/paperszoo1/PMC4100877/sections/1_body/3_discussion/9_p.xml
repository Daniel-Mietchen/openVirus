<p>This study had some limitations. Firstly, each study site presented specific constraints. In Vietnam and Madagascar, the presence of antibodies against AIV was evaluated using commercial Elisa tests with imperfect performance; this may have resulted in the overestimation of seroprevalences 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Ward1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In Madagascar, the poultry density data may have had an insufficient resolution (commune) given the scale of analysis (farm). In addition, the study protocol in the Red River Delta (Vietnam) included 83 villages, resulting in a limited statistical power. This may have led us to erroneously conclude that some potential risk factors did not have effect on avian influenza prevalence in this site when they did. Secondly, not all data were collected according to the same procedures across the four study sites. This limited the possibility of a pooled analysis. In lower-Northern Thailand and Vietnam highlands, we believe that the data collection process allowed to obtain a fair picture of AIV circulation over a one year period. Indeed, it is acknowledged 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Goutard1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> that HPAI H5N1 surveillance in Thailand was comprehensive during the study period we considered (second wave of epidemics). In Vietnam highlands, despite time variations in their numbers, poultry samples were taken monthly over more than one year and provided an acceptable overall view. In the two other study sites, however, we captured only a partial picture of the AIV situation with poultry sera collected in August and May only in Madagascar, and from December to July in the Red River Delta (Vietnam). A seasonal pattern has been observed for occurrence of HPAI H5N1, with higher risk of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks from November to January and April to June 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Tran2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Temporal variations were also previously described for seroprevalence of low pathogenic avian influenza, including H9N2 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Tombari1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and cannot be excluded in Madagascar highlands 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Guerrini1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Given this discrepancy in data collection across study sites, we may thus have compared the yearly situation captured in Thailand and Vietnam highlands, with a “high-risk” period in the Red River Delta (Vietnam) and with an AIV situation corresponding to the dry season only in Madagascar. The temporal pattern of AIV circulation in poultry could be explained by different factors including varying contacts between poultry and wild birds, virus survival under climatic conditions, proportion of land covered by flooding 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Thanapongtharm1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, but also seasonality of poultry production and trade 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Guerrini1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Despite the fact that data on the distribution in space and time of both AIV and all these factors are very difficult to obtain at high resolution, further studies should seek to include simultaneously agro-environmental, climatic and poultry trade related variables to eliminate any possible confounding. The difference in the size of the study areas also made it difficult to compare the range of spatial autocorrelation for avian influenza between sites. However, it is noteworthy that the extent of the spatial correlation we found in Thailand (35 km) and Vietnam (10 and 25 km) is consistent with results from previous studies carried out in the same countries 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Minh1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Souris1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. The AIV data were nevertheless obtained from good-quality protocols which guaranteed the representativeness of the respective poultry populations in each study site 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Trevennec1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-RasamoelinaAndriamanivo1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Desvaux2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Great care was also undertaken to obtain the highest quality ecological data in an effort to offset potential uncertainties associated with multi-country ecological comparisons.
