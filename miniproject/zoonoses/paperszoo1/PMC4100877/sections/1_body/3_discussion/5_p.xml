<p>In the Red River Delta of Vietnam, we found that higher H5 prevalence at the village level was associated with a shorter distance to water. This is worth noting as none of the studies carried out so far in Vietnam have found this association significant

 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Desvaux2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Vaccination campaigns may have disturbed the overall spatial pattern of H5 circulation in poultry, rendering its analysis very challenging. Although only non-vaccinated poultry were selected for our analysis, they benefited from “herd immunity”, and were thus partially protected against infection. This may be the reason why we did not find an association between poultry densities and AIV circulation. We also did not find any association between predominance of rice cultivation and H5 circulation. Rice is cultivated throughout the Red River Delta, and data showed little variability in the percentage of rice fields present around villages (

While rice cultivation alone did not appear to be a significant variable in our study, local variations in the number of rice cycles practiced per year may be influencing the spatial pattern of H5 avian influenza circulation in the study area 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Gilbert3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. As we intended this study to be a comparative work, we decided not to test the effect of rice cropping intensity because this would not have been meaningful for the Vietnam highlands and Madagascar, where only one rice cycle is produced each year. This question nonetheless should be investigated further. It could be integrated into much needed studies of the spatial pattern of H5 circulation in the presence of vaccination in Vietnam.
