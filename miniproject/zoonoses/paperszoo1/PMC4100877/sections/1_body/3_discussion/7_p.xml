<p>It is striking that in Lake Alaotra, Madagascar, several risk factors found in Southeast Asia also are present and play a significant role in the circulation of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses. Indeed, we found that variations of low pathogenic AIV seroprevalence in Lake Alaotra were largely correlated with distance to wetlands and predominance of rice fields around poultry farms. Experimental studies have proven that low pathogenic AIV can remain infective in water for longer periods of time than HPAI H5N1 viruses 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. It is probable that water from the lake, rivers and rice paddy fields play an important role in the transmission dynamics of low pathogenic AIV in the poultry population of Lake Alaotra through an oral-fecal route. In Lake Alaotra, AIV circulation also may be favored on farms located close to water bodies by the presence in these areas of important wild waterfowls congregations 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Guerrini1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, which are a natural reservoir of low pathogenic AIV 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Olsen1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Another interesting characteristic of Lake Alaotra is the presence of flocks of ducks and geese, which are brought during the day to graze on rice paddy fields like in Southeast Asia. We thus expected to observe an association between duck density and AIV seroprevalence in Madagascar similar to that found in the Southeast Asian sites in relation to H5 subtype. However, we did not find this association. This may be due to an insufficient resolution of the duck density variable, which was collected at the commune level and varied little between farms in Madagascar. Another possible explanation is that the strength of the association of duck density with low pathogenic AIV is lower than that with HPAI H5N1 and the statistical power of our study did not allow its detection. An alternative interpretation of our results is that, as suggested by a recent study on HPAI H5N1 in Thailand 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-VanBoeckel1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, duck density may be associated with the risk of AIV only when ducks are raised in intensive systems, or when their numbers are large for extensive systems. In Madagascar, flock size is considerably lower than in Vietnam or Thailand (10 ducks on average in Madagascar 
 <italic>vs</italic> 1000 to 4000 in Thailand and Vietnam), and the low duck density (median: 9.2 ducks/km
 <sup>2</sup>, interquartile range IQR: 4.6–11.8) may not reach the threshold that would be necessary to influence AIV seroprevalence in poultry populations 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Gilbert4" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In contrast, in the Vietnam highlands, where duck farming also is mainly extensive but with higher densities (median: 29.5 ducks/km
 <sup>2</sup>, IQR: 16.2–75.9), we found a positive association between duck density and H5 seroprevalence. In lower-Northern Thailand, although the median value (4.2 ducks/km
 <sup>2</sup>) was the lowest among the study sites, duck density had a wide range (IQR: 0.1–40.5) and included both extensive and large-scale intensive systems. Here also we found an effect of duck density on the probability of an HPAI H5N1 outbreak. Our observations from three contrasting agro-ecosystems thus support the hypothesis that for extensive systems, duck density influences AIV circulation only when it is above a threshold which may allow frequent contacts between ducks and between ducks and chickens. Massive vaccination campaigns carried out in the Red River Delta, Vietnam, impede from generalizing this hypothesis to this study site and thus to intensive duck farming systems.
