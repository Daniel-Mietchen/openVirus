<p>Despite these limitations, to our knowledge this analysis is the first to compare risk factors for avian influenza across a variety of countries using fine-scale field data. We found a great deal of consistency across much of the study sites. Results confirmed the importance of wetlands-rice-ducks agro-ecosystems in the epidemiology of H5 avian influenza in Southeast Asia, and also showed that a similar agro-ecosystem contributed to the circulation of low pathogenic AIV in Madagascar. Mapping these agro-ecosystems could be useful to identify hot spots of AIV circulation across various countries. Moreover, this multisite study revealed that the relative contribution of these risk factors in the circulation of AIV differed between local environmental conditions. The analysis of agro-environmental variables collected at a very fine scale may allow the identification of villages and farms presenting a high risk for AIV circulation, and thus could help to tailor surveillance and control measures to local conditions.</p>
