<p>In contrast with the Red River Delta, we identified an effect of duck density on H5 circulation in the Vietnam highlands. Combined with observations from lower-Northern Thailand, this finding confirms that in the absence of poultry vaccination, domestic ducks play a key role in the circulation of H5 viruses. As in the Red River Delta, we also found in the Vietnam highlands an increased H5 seroprevalence at shorter distance to water bodies. In addition, distance to major roads was found to be a key variable, and one which was unique to the situation of the Vietnam highlands. In this site, which is characterized by sparse habitations and traditional poultry farming systems, the national road which connects the study area (Ha Giang province) to China may have favored H5 virus introduction from Yunnan. HPAI H5N1 is indeed considered endemic in China despite vaccination programs. The illegal import of live poultry from China is important, and veterinary controls at the border have limited impact on this trade. The risk of direct or indirect exposure of the Vietnamese poultry population to the HPAI H5N1 virus released by infected poultry illegally imported from China has been assessed as high
