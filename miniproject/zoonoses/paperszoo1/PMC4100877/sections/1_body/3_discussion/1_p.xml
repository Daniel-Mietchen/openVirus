<p>The design of this study enabled a large sample of avian influenza data coming from various agro-environmental settings to be analyzed in parallel. All of the study sites had similar agro-ecosystems featuring the farming of domestic ducks and rice cultivation. The four study sites corresponded to different AIV situations. During the data collection period, HPAI H5N1 virus was circulating widely in lower-Northern Thailand

The present study is, to our knowledge, the first to use the same analytical and statistical approach to examine the distribution of risk factors of avian influenza in four study sites located in three different countries. This made it possible to compare the influence of the same set of agro-environmental determinants on the circulation of avian influenza viruses in different contexts (
