<p>In lower-Northern Thailand, the multivariate model evidenced that duck density and rice paddy fields were important drivers of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks at the village level. This finding is consistent with a previous study carried out using a coarser epidemiological unit (sub-district) in Thailand 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Paul1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However, it contrasts with the results of a recent study by Van Boeckel et al. 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-VanBoeckel1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> showing that the presence of water from rivers and flooding tended to replace rice cropping intensity as a driver of AIV circulation at a fine spatial resolution (village). The authors of this study suggest that the association between rice cultivation and HPAI H5N1 outbreaks observed in Thailand actually may be mainly explained by the frequent flooding of rice fields in intensive systems, which in turn contributes to HPAI H5N1 spread through waterborne transmission 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-VanBoeckel1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The discrepancy between our results and the Van Boeckel et al. study may derive from a difference in the explanatory variable, i.e. distance to water bodies 
 <italic>vs.</italic> proportion of area covered by lakes, rivers or floods in a 1 km neighborhood around each village location. In addition, the variable we used did not capture flooded areas which coincided with HPAI H5N1 outbreaks and which were specifically targeted by Van Boeckel et al.
