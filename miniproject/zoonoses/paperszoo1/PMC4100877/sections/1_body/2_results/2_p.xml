<p>Agro-environmental characteristics contrasted between the four study sites (

 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.25) associated with AIV in the univariate analysis (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0101958-t002">Table 2</xref>). The simultaneous introduction of chicken and duck density in the models resulted in a multicollinearity problem for the Vietnam highlands and Madagascar (VIF&gt;5), which may partly be due to significant correlation between these two variables (œÅ&gt;0.6). Given its previously established role in the epidemiology of avian influenza 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, only duck density was finally included in the multivariate models. After backward selection, the final model included one variable in the Red River Delta of Vietnam, two in Thailand and Madagascar, and three in the Vietnam highlands (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0101958-t003">Table 3</xref>). Higher AIV prevalence was associated with a shorter distance to a water body in the Vietnam delta and highlands, as well as in Madagascar. Duck density was found positively associated with AIV in the Vietnam highlands and lower-Northern Thailand. A positive association was found between landscape with predominant rice production and AIV infection in Thailand and Madagascar. Finally, AIV prevalence decreased with increasing distance to the closest major road in the Vietnam highlands.
