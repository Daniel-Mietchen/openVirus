<p>In lower-Northern Thailand, 163 out of the 1032 villages (15.8%) in Phitsanulok province had laboratory-confirmed HPAI H5N1 outbreaks between July 2004 and 2005. In the Red River Delta (Vietnam), we found a bird-level H5 seroprevalence of 13.0% in non-vaccinated poultry. Seropositive birds were found in 47 out of the 83 villages (56.6%) included in the study. In the Vietnam highlands, bird-level H5 seroprevalence was 3.3% and 20 villages out of 167 (11.9%) had at least one H5 seropositive bird. In Madagascar, we found a bird-level seroprevalence of 14.6% for low pathogenic AIV. Seropositive birds were found on 74 out of 147 farms (50.3%). The range of spatial autocorrelation estimated from correlograms was 35 km in Thailand, 25 km in the Vietnam highlands, 10 km in the Red River Delta of Vietnam, and 1 km in Madagascar (
