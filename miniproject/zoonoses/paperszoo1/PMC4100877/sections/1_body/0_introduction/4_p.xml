<p>In our multisite study, we aimed to identify and compare the local combinations of environmental factors associated with avian influenza circulation in different settings. In parallel, we applied the same analytic framework to study fine-scale data collected from four contrasting study sites. One was in Thailand, where HPAI viruses have circulated in the past, two were in Vietnam, where HPAI viruses have and continue to circulate, and the last was in Madagascar, where HPAI viruses have not yet been detected. Despite remarkably similar features with Asian agro-ecosystems, only low pathogenic avian influenza circulation has been found in Madagascar to date 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-RasamoelinaAndriamanivo1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Findings from this study should help to identify local combinations of risk factors for AIV circulation, and thus could be useful for tailoring prevention, surveillance and control at a very fine spatial scale.
