<p>The degree to which AIV spread and are maintained in poultry populations is highly variable and may partly be explained by variations in landscape or agro-environmental features around farms 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Hogerwerf1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Three main drivers for the spatial distribution of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreaks have been identified in previous studies 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Gilbert1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The first is density of domestic ducks, which can shed the virus with minimal clinical signs and spread it silently in poultry populations 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The second is anthropogenic variables, as the risk of HPAI H5N1 has been found to be greater in areas that have high human population densities and are located close to transportation networks 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Loth1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Tiensin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. This may be explained by a higher probability of outbreak detection in these areas, but also by an increased virus transmission through movements of contaminated poultry or fomites. The third driver consists of water-related variables

 <xref rid="pone.0101958-VanBoeckel1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> because AIV can persist in water for extended periods of time
