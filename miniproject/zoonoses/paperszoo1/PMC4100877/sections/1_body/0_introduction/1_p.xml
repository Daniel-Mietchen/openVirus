<p>A new, atypical influenza virus infection caused by the H7N9 subtype 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> emerged in March 2013 in Eastern China. As of 25 October 2013, it has been associated with 137 confirmed human infections and 45 related deaths 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This event raises renewed questions regarding the potential of avian influenza viruses to infect humans and of human pandemicity 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Morens1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Controlling the spread of avian influenza viruses (AIV) in poultry may contribute to reducing the risk for human infection by limiting poultry-to-human transmission and preventing the emergence of a viral form with efficient human-to-human transmission 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Alexander1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. To achieve this goal, a better understanding of the local conditions that favor the circulation of avian influenza viruses in poultry is necessary.
