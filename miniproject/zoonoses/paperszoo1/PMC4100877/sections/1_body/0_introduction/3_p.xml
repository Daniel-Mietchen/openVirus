<p>Many studies have examined associations between agro-environmental factors and the presence of avian influenza outbreaks

The comparison, based on field data, of risk factors across countries would be useful for analyzing similarities and differences in transmission patterns and subsequently improving detection and control policies. However, such a comparison is complicated by several factors. First, the studies involved used different data collection protocols and analytical methods, rendering comparisons across countries difficult. Second, while correlations between agro-environmental determinants and AIV persistence have been fairly well-studied at a broad scale, the processes operating at a fine geographic scale are complex and remain poorly documented 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Gilbert1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Third, although the geographic co-distribution of H7N9 outbreaks with H5N1 outbreaks in China suggests that some areas might be a common ground for transmission of emerging low and highly pathogenic AIV 
 <xref rid="pone.0101958-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, the current lack of studies on low pathogenic AIV renders it difficult to draw conclusions.
