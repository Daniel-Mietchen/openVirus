  <title>Transmission rate and mean titer of infectious viral particles present in saliva of 
   <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> at different days after ingestion of an infectious blood-meal containing WNV (A) and RVFV (B).
  </title>
  <p>We exposed a 
   <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> colony, Tabarka (Tunisia) to an infectious blood-meal containing 10
   <sup>7.8</sup> PFU/mL of WNV or 10
   <sup>8.5</sup> PFU/mL of RVFV. At day 3, 6, 9, 14 and 21 post-infection, 20 females were analyzed. Saliva were collected using the forced salivation technique. After removing wings and legs, the proboscis of mosquitoes was inserted into 20 µL tip filled with 5 µL of Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). After 45 min, medium containing the saliva was collected into 45 µL of L15 medium. The number of infectious particles per saliva was estimated by titration on Vero cells and expressed as log
   <sub>10</sub>PFU/saliva. Lines refer to TR and bars to Log10 pfu/saliva.
