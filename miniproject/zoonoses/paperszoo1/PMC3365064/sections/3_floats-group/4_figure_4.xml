  <title>Disseminated infection rate, Transmission rate and mean titer of infectious viral particles present in saliva of 
   <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> at day 14 (A,B and C) and 21 (D,E and F) post-infection with RVFV.
  </title>
  <p>F1 mosquitoes (autogenous AU and anautogenous AN) were orally challenged with RVFV at a titer of 10
   <sup>8.5</sup> PFU/mL using an artificial feeding system. After completion of the blood-meal, mosquitoes were maintained in BSL-3 insectaries at 28Â°C. At day 14 pi and day 21 pi, saliva was collected from surviving females using the forced salivation technique. The number of infectious viral particles present in saliva was estimated by plaque assay on Vero cells. After salivation, females were tested for the presence of RVFV on head squashes by IFA. In brackets, the number of mosquitoes tested. Error bars show the confidence interval (95%) for DIR and TR, and the standard deviation for Log10 pfu/saliva.
