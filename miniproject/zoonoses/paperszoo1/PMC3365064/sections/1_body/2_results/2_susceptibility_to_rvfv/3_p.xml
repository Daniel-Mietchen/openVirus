<p>At day 21 pi, 78.6% (11 strains among 14 tested) of mosquito strains developed a disseminated infection with DIRs varying from 5% to 36% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036757-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). 91% mosquito strains were able to excrete infectious saliva with TR ranging from 6.2% to 50% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036757-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). When available, comparisons between AU and AN mosquitoes from a same collection site, did not show any significant difference of DIRs and TRs (Fisherâ€™s exact test: p&gt;0.05). 85.7% of strains were capable to deliver infectious particles in saliva with a number varying from 0.3 log
 <sub>10</sub>PFU to 2.4 log
 <sub>10</sub>PFU (

Thus, increasing the extrinsic incubation period from 14 days to 21 days increased the proportion of mosquito strains with positive DIRs and TRs. Moreover, the number of infectious viral particles in saliva increased concomitantly even if not statistically validated (Wilcoxon rank-sum test: p&gt;0.05). Autogenous mosquitoes were more capable to ensure the viral dissemination and transmission. At day 14 pi, 61.5% of samples capable to ensure viral dissemination and transmission were AU mosquitoes and 38.5% were AN mosquitoes. At day 21 pi, 57.1% of samples able to ensure dissemination and transmission were AU mosquitoes and 42.9% were AN mosquitoes.
