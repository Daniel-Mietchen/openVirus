<p>When considering each mosquito strain and comparing the DIRs estimated 14 days after infection with WNV and RVFV, significant differences were found with highest DIRs obtained with WNV (Fisher’s exact test: P&lt;0.05). When analyzing the TRs estimated 14 days after infection with WNV and RVFV, significant differences were obtained for 4 strains among 13 (Fisher’s exact test: P&lt;0.05). However, the number of infectious particles in saliva was not significantly different when examining each mosquito strain infected with WNV and RVFV (Wilcoxon rank-sum test: p&gt;0.05).</p>
