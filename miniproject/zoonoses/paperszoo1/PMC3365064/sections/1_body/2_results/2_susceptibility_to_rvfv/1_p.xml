<p>With the colony 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> from Tabarka, RVFV started to be detected at day 3 pi with a TR of 10% and 1.3±0.2 log
 <sub>10</sub>PFU in saliva (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036757-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). TR remained steady until day 14 pi and reached a maximum of 40% at day 21 pi. The number of infectious particles was at its highest level at day 6 pi with 1.6±0.4 log
 <sub>10</sub>PFU and decreased from day 9 to day 21 pi. As a compromise, we chose to estimate DIR and TR at day 14 and day 21 pi when mosquitoes were exposed to RVFV.
