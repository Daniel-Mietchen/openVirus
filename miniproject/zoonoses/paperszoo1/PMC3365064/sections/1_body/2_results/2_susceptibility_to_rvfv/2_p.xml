<p>Fourteen days after exposure to RVFV, 69.2% (9 strains among 13 tested) of mosquito strains developed a disseminated infection with DIRs ranging from 6.2% to 38.1% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036757-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Among strains exhibiting positive DIRs, 77.8% (7/9) of strains had virus detected in saliva with TRs varying from 10% to 47.1% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036757-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, two strains, A1_AU and T1_AN were not capable to get infected saliva after the dissemination of the virus from the midgut. When available, comparisons between AU and AN mosquitoes from a same collection site, did not show any significant difference of DIRs and TRs (Fisher’s exact test: p&gt;0.05) except for the T1 strain from Tunisia for TR (Fisher’s exact test: p = 0.004). The number of infectious particles in saliva varied from 0.6±0.5 log
 <sub>10</sub>PFU to 1.7±0.7 log
