<p>Fourteen days after exposure to WNV, all mosquito strains tested developed a disseminated infection and were able to deliver virus through saliva (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036757-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Strains presented DIRs ranging from 59.1% to 100% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036757-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) and TRs varying from 25% to 83.3% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036757-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). When comparing autogenous (AU) and anautogenous (AN) mosquitoes from a same collection site, DIRs and TRs were comparable (Fisher’s exact test: p&gt;0.05) except for two strains from Morocco: strain M1 for DIR (Fisher’s exact test: p = 0.02) and strain M2 for TR (Fisher’s exact test: p = 0.01). The number of infectious particles in saliva varied from 1.0±0.6 log
 <sub>10</sub>PFU to 3.5 log
 <sub>10</sub>PFU (
