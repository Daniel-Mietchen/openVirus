<p>The colony 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> from Tabarka (Tunisia) was firstly tested to determine the day post-infection (pi) to collect mosquito saliva and assess TR of field-collected samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036757-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). WNV started to be detected in the saliva at day 3 pi with a TR of 5% which increased slightly until day 9 pi. At day 14 pi, 40% of saliva tested were infected and the number of infectious particles in saliva reached its maximum (mean ± standard deviation: 1.9±1.2 log
 <sub>10</sub>PFU). At day 21 pi, TR continued to increase until 80% and the number of infectious particles started to slightly decrease to 1.7±0.9 log
 <sub>10</sub>PFU. Thus, day 14 pi was considered to estimate DIR and TR when mosquitoes were challenged with WNV.
