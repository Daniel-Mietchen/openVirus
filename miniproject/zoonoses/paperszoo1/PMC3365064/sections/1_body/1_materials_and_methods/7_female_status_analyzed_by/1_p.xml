<p>After salivation, females were sacrified and tested for the presence of WNV and RVFV viruses on their head squashes by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Kuberski1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The presence of virus in head squashes results from the viral dissemination in the hemocele after passing through the midgut. The disseminated infection rate (DIR) corresponds to the proportion of mosquitoes with infected head squashes among tested mosquitoes.
