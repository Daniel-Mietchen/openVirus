<p>The number of infectious particles per saliva was estimated by titration on Vero cells and expressed as log
 <sub>10</sub>PFU/saliva. Briefly, six-well plates containing confluent monolayers of Vero cells were infected with serial 10-fold dilutions of virus. Cells were incubated for four days (WNV) or five days (RVFV) under an overlay consisting of Dulbecco’s MEM (DMEM), 2% Fetal Bovine Serum, 1% antibiotic-antimycotic mix (Invitrogen, Gibco) and 1% agarose at 37°C. The lytic plaques were counted after staining with a solution of crystal violet (0.2% in 10% formaldehyde and 20% ethanol). The transmission rate (TR) corresponds to the proportion of mosquitoes whose saliva contains infectious viral particles among mosquitoes presenting a disseminated infection.
