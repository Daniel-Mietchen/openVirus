<p>Infection assays were performed with 7 day-old F1 females which were allowed to feed for 30 min through a pig intestine membrane covering the base of a glass feeder containing the blood-virus mixture maintained at 37°C. The infectious meal was composed of a viral suspension (1∶3) diluted in washed rabbit erythrocytes isolated from arterial blood collected 24 h before the infection
