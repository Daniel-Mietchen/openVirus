<p>Eight populations of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> were sampled in different sites in Algeria (4), Morocco (2) and Tunisia (2) during summer 2010 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036757-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Sites were classified according to the habitat (urban, suburban or rural) and the type of breeding site (aboveground and underground). The mosquitoes were collected as larvae and reared until imago stage. Batches of 200 larvae were reared in pans containing 1 liter of water supplemented with 1–2 of yeast tablets. This standardized rearing procedure allows obtaining females of similar size, making them likely to take equal quantities of blood and to ingest a similar number of viral particles. Placed on cages, adults were fed on 10% sucrose at 28±1°C with 80% relative humidity and a 16 h∶8 h photoperiod. Females able to lay eggs without any blood-meal were qualified as autogenous (AU) and those which required a blood-meal as anautogenous (AN). Thus from each of the 8 F0 collections, two F1 strains were obtained: AU and AN (

The parameters of vector competence used for field-collected samples were defined using the F6 generation established from a sample collected in Tabarka in 2010 (Tunisia). This strain is adapted to laboratory conditions and feeds well on artificial blood-meals.
