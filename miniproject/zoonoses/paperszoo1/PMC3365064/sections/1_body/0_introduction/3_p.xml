<p>Determining the vectorial parameters influencing pathogen transmission is a critical step in understanding patterns of transmission and developing effective control interventions. The vector competence of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> is poorly defined in North Africa. In this paper, we show that populations of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> from the Maghreb are efficient experimental vectors of WNV and to a lesser extent, of RVFV.
