<p>West Nile virus (WNV) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) are two arthropod-borne RNA viruses transmitted mainly by mosquitoes. WNV (Flaviviridae family, 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus) was first isolated in Uganda in 1937 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Smithburn1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and is now the most widely distributed arbovirus through the world 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Kramer1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This virus is maintained and amplified in nature within an enzootic transmission cycle, among birds and mosquitoes, whereas humans and mammals including horses are accidental dead-end hosts (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Weaver1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>). West Nile fever (WNF) was not of public health concern until its unexpected emergence outside its native range of distribution. In the early 1990s, outbreaks began to occur more frequently, especially in the Mediterranean Basin. In the Maghreb, human cases of meningo-encephalitis with fatalities occurred in Algeria in 1994 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-LeGuenno1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and in Tunisia in 1997 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Triki1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> whereas epizootics in horses were reported in Morocco in 1996 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-ElHarrack1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In the following years, cases were reported again: in Tunisia in 2003 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Garbouj1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and 2008 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-BenHassine1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and in Morocco in 2003 and 2010 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Schuffenecker1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-OIE1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> indicating that WNV is still circulating in the region. RVFV (
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> genus, 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> family), first identified in Kenya in 1931 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Daubney1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> was responsible of numerous outbreaks affecting livestock and occasionally, humans in Sub-Saharan Africa. The first emergence of Rift Valley fever (RVF) outside Africa occurred in 2000â€“2001 in Saudi Arabia and Yemen 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Ahmad1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Illegal trading of livestock between RVF-endemic regions with their bordering countries stresses the risk for RVF emergence in the Maghreb
