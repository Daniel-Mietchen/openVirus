<p>WNV and RVFV are transmitted by mosquitoes of the 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> complex including 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> which are ubiquitous mosquitoes in temperate and tropical regions, respectively. 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> is the most widely distributed mosquito species in the Maghreb

 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Krida1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In this region, 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> presents different eco-physiological characteristics. In urban areas, most 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> populations colonize underground sites, are autogenous (lay first batch of eggs without taking a blood-meal), stenogamous (mate in confined spaces) and anthropophilic (biting preferentially humans)
