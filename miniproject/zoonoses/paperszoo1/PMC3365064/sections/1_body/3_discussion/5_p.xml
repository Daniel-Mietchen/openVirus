<p>Our strains contain a mix of autogenous (AU) and anautogenous (AN) mosquitoes. The two forms are thought to have different vector competences (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Farajollahi1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>). Indeed, we found evidence that when challenged with RVFV, AU mosquitoes were predominantly capable to ensure the viral dissemination and transmission, 14 days after the exposure to the infectious blood-meal (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036757-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Surprisingly, AN mosquitoes were characterized by a delay in RVFV transmission; AN populations were more likely to transmit 21 days after feeding on an infectious blood-meal (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036757-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). We suggested that epizootic outbreaks of RVF can be initiated by

 <italic>Ochlerotatus</italic> mosquitoes which are present in high densities in rural areas

 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes. Based on their low vector competence, we hypothesized that AN mosquitoes in rural areas weakly take part to RVFV transmission. AU mosquitoes are more likely to serve as a bridge vector between animals and humans. A RVF cycle could then be initiated when AU mosquitoes reach densities high enough to trigger an epidemic/epizootic outbreak. The Maghreb region shares borders with RVF-endemic countries. In 2010, a severe outbreak has been reported in an extremely arid region of Mauritania close to borders with Morocco and Algeria 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-ElMamy1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Introduction of infected livestock raised concern for future emergences of RVF. Indeed, the RVF outbreaks in Egypt in 1977 and in Saudi Arabia in 2000 were caused by the trade of viremic animals
