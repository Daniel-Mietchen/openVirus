<p>When exposed to an infectious blood-meal containing WNV, all mosquito strains collected in 8 different sites in the Maghreb, were capable to ensure efficient viral dissemination and transmission at day 14 pi. Our findings are in line with the predominant role of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> in the transmission of WNV. DIRs varied from 59% to 100%, and TRs from 25% to 100%. The number of viral particles delivered with saliva was up to ∼ 12800 particles. Vector competence is mainly influenced by viral dose, incubation period and temperature. We used a viral titre of 10
 <sup>7.8</sup> PFU/mL and an incubation temperature of 28°C, both factors affecting viral dissemination 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Indeed, the minimal infectious doses required to infect 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> should be greater than 10
 <sup>5.0</sup> PFU/mL 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Turell1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and high temperatures increase viral replication 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Reisen1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Previous studies have shown spatial variations in WNV vector competence of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic>
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Vaidyanathan1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Kilpatrick1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. We also observed geographic variations in vector competence without assignment of high performances to a given country or a collection site.
