<p>We used for RVFV, the Clone 13 which is a naturally attenuated strain with a deletion of 70% of the gene NSs playing a key role in the pathogenesis of RVFV 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Billecocq1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-LeMay1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. It has been shown that this deletion could affect viral replication in mosquitoes. It has been shown that dissemination was higher when exposed mosquitoes to a virulent RVFV 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Moutailler1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. We found that 14 days after exposure to RVFV, 69.2% of mosquito strains were able to develop a disseminated infection with DIRs up to 38.1%, values higher than those previously found for 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> populations from Tunisia 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Moutailler2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> but lower than DIRs for laboratory colonies of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic>
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Faran1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Most strains (77.8%) were able to transmit the virus with up to âˆ¼ 620 viral particles detected in saliva. The midgut infection was the most important barrier to viral dissemination 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Hardy1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The moderate ability of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> to transmit RVFV is mostly due to the inefficiency of virions to escape from midgut epithelial cells to infect secondary target organs 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Turell2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. When increasing the incubation period up to 21 days, 78.6% of mosquito strains develop a disseminated infection and 91% were able to deliver infectious particles in saliva. Thus, 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> with disseminated infection that did not have infectious saliva at day 14 pi may have viral infections to develop a week later 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Faran2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Moreover, the midgut barrier appears to be operating by delaying the release of the virus into the general cavity of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> infected with RVFV 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Turell2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. A sporadic dissemination of virus from the midgut was likely to operate rather than a complete blockade of the virus inside the midgut epithelial cells.
