<p>Like WNF, RVF could become epizootic and epidemic in the Maghreb if introduced. Unless vaccines are available and used on a very large scale to limit their expansion, both WNF and RVF will continue to be a critical issue for human and animal health. In a near future, protection of the public health will continue to rely on mosquito control. Further studies are required to understand the bio-ecology of
