<p>To be transmitted to a vertebrate host, an arbovirus must be able to reach and infect the salivary glands. After feeding on a viremic vertebrate host, the ingested virus must penetrate into the midgut epithelial cells, replicates and subsequently, escape from the midgut. The virus disseminates within the body cavity infecting tissues and organs including salivary glands. Infectious viral particles are injected into a new vertebrate host along with saliva. Barriers to the overall sequence leading to transmission are described: the midgut and the salivary glands (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0036757-Kramer2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>). The efficiency of these barriers determines the level of mosquito vector competence. For both viruses tested, WNV and RVFV, the time interval between the ingestion of a viremic blood-meal and the ability of a mosquito to transmit a pathogen, described as the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) was 3 days with
