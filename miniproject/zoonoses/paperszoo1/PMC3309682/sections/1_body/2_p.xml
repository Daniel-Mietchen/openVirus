<p>The main objectives of a prioritization method are to optimize financial and human resources for the surveillance, prevention, control, and eradication of infectious diseases and to target surveillance for early detection of any emerging disease. Our method is based on widely used multicriteria analysis, which consists of listing criteria to assess pathogens, evaluating pathogens on the basis of these criteria (scores), determining the relative role (weight) of each criterion, and aggregating scores and weights of criteria into 1 global score per pathogen (
