<p>For each criterion, a coefficient of 0â€“7 was assigned to each option (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) according to its role, effect, or rate. Coefficients were correlated with severity: the more severe the effect, the higher the coefficient. For example, a case-fatality rate &lt;1% has a coefficient of 1 and a case-fatality rate &gt;90% has a coefficient of 7. For nonzoonotic agents, a coefficient of 0 was fixed for criteria included in the PH category.
