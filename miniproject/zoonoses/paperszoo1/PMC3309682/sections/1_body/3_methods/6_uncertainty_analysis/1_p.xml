<p>Uncertainty of the weighting method was estimated by using a probabilistic method. All weights were converted into a function (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) and computed by using @Risk software version 5.5 (Palisade Corporation, Ithaca, NY, USA). Functions were then combined through an aggregation method by using a Monte-Carlo simulation with 1,000 iterations to obtain a function of the overall weighted scores per disease with a 95% CI.
