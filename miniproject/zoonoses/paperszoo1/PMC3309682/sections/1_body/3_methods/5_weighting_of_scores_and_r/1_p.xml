<p>After experts weighted the different criteria, an overall weighted score was calculated for each disease (
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>19</italic>
 </xref>). To perform the ranking, we used an aggregation method that combined 2 types of weighting. First, intracategory weighting consisted of multiplying the coefficient (0–7) allocated to the criterion by the average of points (weight) distributed by the experts for that criterion. A global score for a category was obtained by summing the weighted scores obtained for each criterion. Second, multicategory experts performed intercategory weighting. The mean number of points allocated by these experts to each category of criteria (weight) was multiplied by the global score obtained for each category after the first weighting. The overall weighted score of each disease resulted from the summation of global scores obtained from the 5 categories, as shown in the equations OWS = Σ
 <sub>cat</sub> (GSC
 <sub>j</sub> × IrW
 <sub>j</sub>) and GSC
 <sub>j</sub> = Σ
 <sub>crit</sub> (C
 <sub>i</sub> × IaW
 <sub>i</sub>), where OWS = overall weighting score of a pathogen, GSC
 <sub>j</sub> = global score of a category of criteria, IrW
 <sub>j</sub> = intercategory weight for each category of criteria (average for deterministic method), C
 <sub>i</sub> = initial coefficient per criterion, IaW
 <sub>i</sub> = intracategory weight for each criterion (average for deterministic method), Cat = categories of criteria, and Crit = criteria.
