<p>Two tasks were assigned to the experts. First, they were asked to give their opinion on the pertinence of criteria proposed by indicating their degree of agreement. They were then asked to assign a score of 1 if they strongly disagreed with a criterion, 2 if they disagreed, 3 if they simply agreed, and 4 if they strongly agreed. In instances of strong disagreement, experts were asked to justify their decision and propose alternative options. Second, they were asked to weight criteria. Because all criteria do not have the same role in terms of risk and consequences within the same category, experts were thereafter asked to apply a Las Vegas method between the criteria according to their relative roles (or weights) (

Because the number of criteria differs between categories, the number of points to distribute was proportional to the number of criteria per category: 90 for EP and PH, 60 for PC and EC, and 30 for SO. This method was necessary to prevent criteria classified as major by experts (in terms of points distributed) from receiving fewer points because they belonged to a category that included more criteria. Finally, 6 multicategory experts from international organizations were asked to apply the Las Vegas method for intercategory weighting by distributing 100 points between the 5 categories of criteria.
