<p>Some methods applied a weighting system to criteria (DEFRA) (

 </xref>) because it is not appropriate to consider all criteria on the same scale. For example, the human case-fatality rate should not be placed on the same scale as classification of zoonoses. Even if individual experts differed in their views on the relative role of various criteria and indicators, veterinary epidemiologists and experts in public health reached the conclusion that the epizootic/epidemic potential and case-fatality rate were the 2 major criteria in their respective category of expertise.
