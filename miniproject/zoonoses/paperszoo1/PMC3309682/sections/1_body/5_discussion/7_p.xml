<p>When one considers overall ranking of diseases, all top 20 diseases are zoonotic/common, which is expected because their global score involves the whole public health aspect. CART analysis also illustrates the correlation between PH and SO, which is not surprising because consumer behavior might be influenced when a zoonotic/common agent is involved (

Nevertheless, CARTs might lead to slightly biased results in relation to variable selection: identification of distinct subgroups does not enable estimation of net effects of independent variables because subdivision of data into 2 groups is based on only 1 value of only 1 explanatory variable (
