<p>The decision to start with the disease and not the animal species is in contrast to the method developed by Heffernan, who suggested that errors might be amplified throughout the weighting method (

 </xref>). Nevertheless, by starting with the disease, the role of species is balanced by the EC category because the effect of different industries is taken into account. If an industry is not well developed in a specific area, the effect will be minimized. When the prioritization method is started with the species and its particular effect in the area/country, it makes the model applicable only in this specific area. However, if one starts with the disease and takes into account the economic role of the species in another category of criteria, the model can be applied anywhere.
