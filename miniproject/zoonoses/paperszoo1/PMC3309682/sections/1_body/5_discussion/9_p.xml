<p>In conclusion, the current method is a generic tool applicable on different geographic scales in a variety of contexts because it is not restricted to well-defined field of actions. The standardization of criteria ensures transparency and reproducibility of the model in other context and for other diseases. It enables adaptations (vaccination becoming available, increased knowledge of a pathogen, viral mutations or genetic reassortments increasing host specificity). In the same view, the model could be applied to diseases affecting domestic (dogs, cats) pets or exotic pets (reptiles). Conversely, it could also be used with enzootic conditions to better retarget the surveillance system and readapt control measures worldwide.</p>
