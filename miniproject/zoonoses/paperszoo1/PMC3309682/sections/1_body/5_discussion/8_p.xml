<p>The analysis can be applied only to the 100 diseases included in the model. Nevertheless, its predictive value is useful. The model we developed could be presented as generic and should not be confined to the 100 diseases included in the current application or to exotic diseases as with the method developed by French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety (

 </xref>). If added to the pathogens involved in animal diseases, all of these pathogens could also be added to the prioritization method, with a preliminary categorization step. As specified in the work performed under the aegis of the European Council, the prioritization exercise should be performed regularly as the epidemiologic situation of diseases constantly evolves: biotechnological improvements are constantly achieved in terms of vaccination, treatment, and diagnostic tests (

 </xref>; S. Vandeputte et al., unpub. data). The critical point of our method relies on the possible lack of independence between some criteria. Several of these criteria might be substantially dependent on each other. Although coefficients for ranges of illness and case-fatality rates were arbitrarily fixed, which may results in a loss of precision, they were accepted by experts. A Delphi method would have been more appropriate for reaching a consensus on the criteria to be used.
