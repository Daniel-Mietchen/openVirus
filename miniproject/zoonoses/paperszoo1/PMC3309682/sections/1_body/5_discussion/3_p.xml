 </xref>). In our study, a Delphi method was initially planned but for time, rationale, and economic reasons, criteria were defined and established before being proposed to experts. Because our method includes qualitative and semiquantitative criteria, it is not completely numerically based, in contrast to the multicriteria analysis developed by Kurowicka et al. (

  <italic>5</italic>
 </xref>). Their method is applicable only for quantitative criteria and not always to all diseases in all contexts. Furthermore, they used a limited number of attributes for pathogens. Even if one relies on a quantitative method, which is less arbitrary than a semiquantitative method, the model developed by Havelaar et al. (
