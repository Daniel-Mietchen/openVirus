<p>Opinions of experts on proposed criteria were taken into account to adapt the list of criteria. For example, in the EP category, 3 rates were proposed to experts: morbidity (illness), mortality, and case-fatality. The experts suggested deleting mortality rate because case-fatality rate better reflects the gravity of the disease. Some modifications (clarifications) were made to definitions of each criterion and its coefficients. The final database of criteria, their coefficients, and definitions used for prioritization are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The relative weight of each category of criteria was 20 points (mean and median) for EP, 19 (mean) and 18 (median) for PC, 23 (mean) and 28 (median) for EC, 25 (mean and median) for PH, and 14 (mean and 15 (median) for SO.
