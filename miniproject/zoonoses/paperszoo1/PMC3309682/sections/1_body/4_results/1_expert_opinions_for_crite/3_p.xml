<p>Public health was considered the major category of criteria in terms of prioritization. Weighting of criteria as proposed by experts is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Epizootic potential and case-fatality rate (%) were regarded as the 2 major epidemiologic indicators (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, panel A). Effectiveness of prevention and vaccination were weighted as the 2 major PC criteria (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, panel B). Loss of productivity and limitation of importation and exportation were the 2 major EC criteria (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, panel C). Case-fatality rate and epidemic potential were weighted as the 2 major PH criteria (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, panel D). Effect on animal welfare and biodiversity and lower consumption were the 2 major SO indicators (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, panel E). Nevertheless, within each category, differences between criteria were scarce. Conversely, the range in weights of each criterion was large, as shown by high SDs, which indicated variability among opinions of experts. To take variability into account, we used a probabilistic method to estimate the overall weighted score per disease.
