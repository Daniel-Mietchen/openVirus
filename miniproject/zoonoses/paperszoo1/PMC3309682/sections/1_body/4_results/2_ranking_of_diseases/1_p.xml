<p>Final ranking of diseases according to their overall weighted scores and use of a probabilistic method is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Few differences were observed between deterministic (mean of each weight) and probabilistic methods (function of weights) (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.999; p&lt;0.0001). This finding is probably associated with a few problems in subjective interpretation or dilution of individual discordances among the large number of experts.
