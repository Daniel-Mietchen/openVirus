<p>FMD was considered as a zoonotic disease. However, FMD could be included in the nonzoonotic category. In such an instance, it would be the highest ranked nonzoonotic disease. Newcastle disease was included in the zoonotic/common category, which could be questioned because of its limited effect on PH. The top 5 ranked diseases were all zoonotic/common: Nipah virus encephalitis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, influenza caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, West Nile fever, and botulism.</p>
