<p>A qScript one-step fast MGB RT-qPCR (Quanta, Rox) kit was used to amplify WNV RNA. Reactions were carried out with a total volume of 20 µL, containing 1.8 µL of each primer (10 µM), 0.2 µL of each probe (5 µM), and 5 µL of template RNA. Extracted RNA from a lineage 1-stem (access no. AF375045) was used as a positive control, and sterile water as a negative control. After an RT-step at 48°C for 5 min and an activation–denaturation step at 95°C for 30 sec, 45 cycles of 95°C for 3 sec and of 60°C for 30 sec were carried out.</p>
