<p>A total of 729 ticks were analyzed for the presence of WNV-RNA using a one-step RT qPCR on an ABI 7,900 instrument. Eighteen of the 747 collected ticks were not analyzed due to technical problems. The binding sites of the primers were identified according to Linke et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref>). These sites were then verified by comparing them with all available WNV sequences in GenBank. A few sequences were eliminated from the alignment due to their geographical origin and considered irrelevant in the present analysis. Degenerate primers were then designed with respect to all remaining sequences (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>). Two separate nucleotide probes were used, one according to a previously described protocol (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref>), although redesigned as a RGB probe, to detect WNV lineage I and II, as well as a second probe that was designed to detect WNV lineage III, the so-called Rabensburg virus (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref>).
