<p>The dorsal and ventral sides of each tick were photographed with a Dino-Lite Long 90Ã— (AM4013TL) USB-microscope (AnMo Electronics Corp., Taiwan). The pictures were analyzed in order to determine the stage and species of the tick. Due to the well-known difficulties in morphological species identification of immature 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> ticks (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>), a molecular approach was applied to confirm the identifications based on tick morphology on 10 larval and nymphal tick specimens identified morphologically as 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> sp. and considered to be representative for the entire sample. Available sequences of the different genes of 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> species were compared in GenBank, and the mitochondrial 12S rDNA was used as a target gene.
