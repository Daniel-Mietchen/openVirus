<p>Ticks were homogenized using a Qiagen TissueLyzer (Qiagen) in tubes containing Buffer RLT (Qiagen) with 1% β-mercaptoethanol and a 5 mm steel bead for 2 min at 25 Hz. Each series of RNA extraction also included one NTC and one positive control spiked with Encepur
 <sup>®</sup> tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) vaccine (Novartis Vaccines, Basel, Switzerland) and B31 
 <italic>Borrelia</italic> spirochetes. After homogenization, RNA extraction was performed in a Qiagen M48 BioRobot using the MagAttract
 <sup>®</sup> RNA Tissue Mini M48 kit. The extracted RNA was stored in a -70°C freezer and later used for the WNV screening. Some of the extracted RNA was used for immediate cDNA synthesis. For this, we used a CAS-1200™ Precision Liquid Handling Robot (Corbett Research, Cambridgeshire, UK) to convert RNA into cDNA with the Illustra™ Ready-to-GO RT-PCR beads kit (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). Random hexamer primers pd(N)6 were used to ensure that total RNA was converted. The cDNA was stored in -20°C freezers and then used for the tick species identification.
