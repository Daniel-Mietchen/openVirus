<p>A total of 14,824 springtime migratory birds of 78 different species were captured in mist nets at Capri bird observatory and at Antikythira bird observatory in Italy and Greece, respectively (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0002">Table 2</xref>). From these birds, we collected 747 ticks (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0003">Table 3</xref>). One or more ticks were found on 2.7% of the birds, and the majority of the collected ticks were larvae and nymphs of the 
 <italic>Hyalomma marginatum</italic> species complex (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0003">Tables 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0004">4</xref>). DNA sequencing of the 10 selected 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> ticks was in accordance with the morphological identification (see the ‘Materials and Methods’ section) (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref>). In total, 29% of the identified ticks were larvae and 70% were nymphs (i.e. 99% of the ticks were immature).
