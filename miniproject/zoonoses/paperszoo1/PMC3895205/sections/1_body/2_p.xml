<p>Although mosquitoes are the primary vectors, the virus has been isolated repeatedly from both ixodid and argasid ticks, and ticks have been proposed as reservoirs for the virus during bird-associated transfer of the virus between geographical regions (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>). In order to predict and control a potential further geographical spread of this virus, knowledge about its ecology is of outmost importance. To date, not enough data are available to assess the role of ticks in the maintenance and spread of the virus (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>). This study aimed to investigate if ticks, which had infested migratory birds in Africa, may be infected with WNV when they arrive on their avian hosts in southern Europe. Thus, at two stopover sites, we net-captured birds that had just crossed the Mediterranean Sea, on their way from their wintering grounds in WNV-endemic Africa to their breeding grounds in Europe. A total of 729 ticks were collected from the birds and individually screened with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of WNV RNA.
