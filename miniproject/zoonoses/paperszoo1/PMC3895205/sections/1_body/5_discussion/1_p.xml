<p>WNV infection is considered an emerging infection, and its spread from endemic areas is facilitated by migrating birds (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">23</xref>). Consequently, as viremic birds may not constitute the only method of viral dispersal from endemic to non-endemic areas, we considered the possibility that hematophagous arthropods infesting migratory birds might contribute to this process. Ticks in WNV endemic areas may attach to migratory birds. Such ticks, possibly acting as reservoirs for WNV and perhaps other pathogens, could then be carried by their avian hosts from WNV-endemic areas in Africa to Europe (
