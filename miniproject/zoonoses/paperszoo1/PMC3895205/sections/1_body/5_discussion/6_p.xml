<p>Laboratory experiments have revealed that 
 <italic>H. marginatum</italic> became infected with WNV after a blood meal from viremic hosts. The infection rates of the larval, nymphal, and adult ticks were 3, 33 and 75%, respectively. Both transstadial infection and the capacity of nymphal and adult ticks to transmit the virus to previously uninfected hosts were demonstrated (

 <italic>Argas arboreus</italic> pools were positive, but none of the 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> ticks. This is in agreement with our study. The authors suggested that some tick species may play a role in maintaining the infection in Israel (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0031">31</xref>) investigated the ability of transstadially infected 
 <italic>Ixodes pacificus</italic> to transmit WNV to song sparrows and western fence lizards (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0031">31</xref>). Based on their results and previous studies, these scientists concluded that there are indications that ixodid ticks are not able to experimentally transmit WNV and therefore most likely would not be important vectors in WNV transmission cycles.
