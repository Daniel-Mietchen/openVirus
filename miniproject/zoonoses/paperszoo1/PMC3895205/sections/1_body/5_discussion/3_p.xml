<p>The results from this study do not support the above hypothesis, as none of the analyzed ticks were PCR positive for WNV. Importantly, however, epidemics of WNV have been reported recently from locations close to Antikythira, Greece, and Capri, Italy. In 2008–2009, about 20 people contracted West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND) in and around the Veneto region of northeastern Italy, and in 2010 the epidemic had spread to other regions of Italy, namely Sicily and Molise, both of which are close to the island of Capri (
