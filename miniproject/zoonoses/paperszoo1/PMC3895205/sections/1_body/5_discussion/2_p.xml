<p>The birds were caught during rapid northward migration on the small islands where birds normally stop over briefly just after crossing the Sahara Desert and the Mediterranean Sea. Also, most of the collected ticks were either half-fed or fully engorged nymphs, which usually attach to the host already as larvae. This indicates that most or all of these ticks had attached prior to their hostsâ€™ migration (i.e. probably in sub-Saharan and/or North Africa). We therefore speculated that springtime migrating birds, caught at stopover localities in the Mediterranean area, may carry ticks infected with WNV from endemic areas in Africa, and thereafter transfer this potential human pathogen to regions of Southern Europe where outbreaks have recently occurred.</p>
