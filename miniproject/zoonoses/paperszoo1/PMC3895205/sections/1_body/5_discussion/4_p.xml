<p>Most of the collected ticks were larvae and nymphs that appeared to belong to 
 <italic>H. rufipes</italic> in the 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>marginatum</italic> complex. These results are similar to those of Hoogstraal et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">28</xref>) since, in both investigations, nearly all ticks were identified as immatures that appeared to be 
 <italic>H. rufipes</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">28</xref>). The tick infestation rate of 2.7% that was recorded in this study is also similar to that of Hoogstraal et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">28</xref>). They found a tick infestation rate of 3.0% on birds captured in Egypt during their spring migration from East Africa to Europe.
