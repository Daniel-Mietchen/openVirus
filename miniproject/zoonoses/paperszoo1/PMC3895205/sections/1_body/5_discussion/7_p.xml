<p>Our results do not support the hypothesis that 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> ticks play a major role as a WNV reservoir on their avian hostsâ€™ northward flight from Africa to Europe. The information so far obtained regarding the potential role of ticks as reservoirs and vectors is inconclusive. Further laboratory experiments on the reservoir and vector competency of different tick species are needed. Also, investigations based on a larger number of ticks of different species and geographic origins are needed to better understand the potential role of ticks in the ecology of the WNV.
