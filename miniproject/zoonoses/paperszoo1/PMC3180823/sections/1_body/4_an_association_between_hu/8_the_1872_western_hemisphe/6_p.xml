<p>At a time when horses were ubiquitous in virtually all rural and urban settings, it is thus conceivable that they played a role in influenza virus maintenance and evolution analogous to that of pigs in the modern era. Although the cause of the 1889 influenza pandemic is unknown, various archeserologic data suggest the possibility of an H3 HA, and possibly also an N8 NA.

 </xref> Equine influenza‐like disease was common in the 1889 pandemic, but the virus clearly spread globally by means of person‐to‐person spread.

 </xref> The possibility that the 1889 pandemic was caused by an H3N8 equine influenza virus that had become adapted to humans, and which then spread pandemically, is highly speculative but cannot yet be ruled out. Alternatively, if the 1889 pandemic virus was truly of H3N8 subtype, it is conceivable that, in a manner analogous to the persistent “classical” swine H1N1 virus derived from the 1918 pandemic virus, it was at some point transmitted from humans to horses and the virus or some of its gene segments may persist in horses today.
