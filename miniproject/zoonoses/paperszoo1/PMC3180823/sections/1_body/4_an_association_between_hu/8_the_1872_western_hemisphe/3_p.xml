Complications included pneumonia and dropsy: “oedematous swellings of the limbs, beneath the chest and belly, and in the lower part of the head”.

 </xref> Almost all urban epizootics were explosive with urban attack rates approaching 100%. The death rate was in the range of 2%, including not only acute deaths from pneumonia but also dropsical complications, the latter occurring in about 1–15% of surviving horses and associated with a fatality rate of 20–50%. Dropsy appeared as a “trailing” epizootic about 3 weeks after the peak of epizootic influenza; it predominated in some cities, but not in others, and was widely observed to occur in older horses that had been over worked or poorly cared for when ill with influenza (
