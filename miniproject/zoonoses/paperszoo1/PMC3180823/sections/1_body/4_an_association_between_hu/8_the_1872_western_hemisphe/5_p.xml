<p>Were the countless reports of influenza‐like diseases in horses, recorded over centuries, really influenza? We are unaware of pathological material available before modern times that might answer this question definitively. Circumstantial but arguably strong evidence for equine influenza includes the consistency of clinical signs, the temporal–geographic association with human influenza, high explosivity and rapid horse‐to‐horse spread – with increased explosivity in crowded stables – and a consistent incubation period for both equine and human secondary cases. Eighteenth and nineteenth century authorities believed the two diseases were the same disease and believed them to be transmitted in both directions. The infrequency in the differential diagnosis of other clinically consistent respiratory diseases of high explosivity is also of note.</p>
