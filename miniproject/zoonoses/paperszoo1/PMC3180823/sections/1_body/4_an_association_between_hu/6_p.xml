<p>Although these were non‐pandemic years, the equine association appears to have been about as strong during major (e.g., European‐wide) epidemics as during more local outbreaks. When the next pandemic appeared (in 1729), equine cases were again seen.

Moreover, it came to be understood that although human non‐pandemic influenza in this era was often a seasonal (winter) event, when epidemics were associated with equine epizootics they tended to occur in the spring or fall, the usual seasons in which equine influenza prevailed. Conceivably, during the warmer months horses and humans alike were more likely to be traveling and moving about in agricultural work, and thereby more likely to acquire and transmit influenza.
