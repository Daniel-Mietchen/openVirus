<p>From 1658 until the early 20th century, outbreaks consistent with equine influenza were associated with major human outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics more often than not. Considering several hundred published reports of major influenza occurrences between 1688 and 1888 that we have examined (obviously subject to errors related to, among other things, the possibility of not recognizing outbreaks that occurred), and considering only those with reasonably complete historical information, by our count there were 112 (of 200) years in which either significant epidemics/pandemics or equine epizootics of apparent influenza were documented in Europe. Of these 112 years, combined equine epizootics/epidemics were documented in 67; equine epizootics only in 25; and epidemics only in 20. The pattern in the western hemisphere during the same interval was somewhat different: of 56 years in which human or equine influenza was documented, both horses and humans were involved in 21 years; humans only in 25 years, and horses only in 10 years.</p>
