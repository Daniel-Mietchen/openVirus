<p>Although IAV are rightly considered to be avian viruses resident in a large reservoir comprised of many species of wild waterfowl and shorebirds, they are uniquely promiscuous in undergoing an extraordinary degree of genetic change within their primary hosts, and within the host’s aquatic environment – comprised of water, mud, and organic material – and they frequently switch hosts to infect many other avian and mammalian species. The genetic elements of IAV circulate globally in an extensive ecosystem comprised of many avian and mammalian species and a spectrum of environments around the world. In their natural reservoirs, IAV can be thought of not as stable viral entities but as transient genome constellations.

 </xref> Genomic stability seems to be an unnatural state and may be only attainable when an eight‐gene segment constellation finds its way into an “unnatural” secondary host. What IAV can do when they become stabilized by adaptation is not fully explored, but the breadth of the viral repertoire is inferred by the historical literature suggesting viral infection of, adaptation to, and onward transmission by a variety of hosts including humans, horses, pigs, dogs, and domestic poultry. It may be desirable to more broadly conceive of IAV as being adapted not just to a few avian reservoir hosts but to a complex environment populated by many different species in a variety of stabilizing environmental milieux. The historical literature on influenza, though frustrating in its general lack of corroboration by modern scientific methods, suggests that IAV may be more evolutionarily flexible than we have realized. It would not be surprising if additional secondary reservoir hosts were involved in viral maintenance, evolution, and transmission. Influenza history suggests that there is still much to learn, and many surprises probably still await us.
