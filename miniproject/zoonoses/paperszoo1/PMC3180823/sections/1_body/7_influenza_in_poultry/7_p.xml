<p>The epizootic poultry disease – amply recorded in the national press, but apparently not studied scientifically – could have been caused by other agents. “Chicken cholera” (linked to 
 <italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic> in 1878) was well known in 1872 but was considered to be a different disease than the 1872 epizootic disease (
 <italic>The</italic> [New York] 
 <italic>World</italic>, 19 November 1872). Newcastle disease was not recognized until 1926, does not seriously affect horses, pigs, or humans, and in any case seems somewhat less consistent with epizootic features described in 1872. The consistent clinical features and epidemiologic evidence, coupled with a remarkable temporal–geographic association between equine influenza and poultry outbreaks of an explosive and fatal illness, appear consistent with influenza transmission. Although “back‐transmission” of a mammalian‐adapted influenza virus to an avian host would seem unlikely based on current (but limited) understanding of IAV host switching, it is noteworthy that both classical swine H1N1 and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus have caused symptomatic epizootics in turkeys;
