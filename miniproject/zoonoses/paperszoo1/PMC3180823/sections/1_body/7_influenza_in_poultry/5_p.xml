<p>With this historical picture in mind, it is curious to note that between 15 November and 15 December 1872, 6 years before the recognition of “fowl plague”, an explosive, fatal, and still mysterious epizootic in poultry, prairie chickens, turkeys, ducks, and geese occurred over much of the populated United States in temporal–geographic association with the panzootic of equine influenza that had just begun.

 <italic>The New York Times</italic>, 16 November 1872), whole flocks were usually struck simultaneously, with fatality at or near 100%. Prominent features included upper respiratory signs of “a cold or influenza”, slimy discharge emitted from the beak, dark streaks in the neck, “dizziness” or “staggering fits”, crawling away from the flock into holes or corners, and in most cases death within 12–18 hours (
