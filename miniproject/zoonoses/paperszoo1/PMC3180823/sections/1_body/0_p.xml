<p>The importance of understanding how pandemic influenza A viruses (IAV) emerge, and the nature of their relationship with IAV of birds and mammals, has been emphasized by the 2009–2010 H1N1 swine‐origin influenza pandemic, and by 13 years of enzootic/epizootic/human “spill‐over” circulation of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian IAV (HPAI) that have not yet, despite grave concerns, become pandemic. The threat of animal influenza is, however, not new [

Lacking such organized historical information, in this brief review we nevertheless draw attention to events, themes, and trends in the occurrence of (apparent) non‐human influenza as reported in scientific and non‐scientific sources up to the beginning of the “microbial era”.
