<p>Numerous influenza subtypes isolated from pigs cause either enzootic infections or self‐limited outbreaks globally. Since 1998, several lineages of triple reassortant viruses containing genes from “classical” swine H1N1, human H3N2, and avian influenza viruses have emerged to cause enzootic disease in pigs in the United States and elsewhere.

 </xref> Other fully avian or human IAV‐derived viruses, or reassortant viruses containing genes of avian, swine, and/or human IAV origin, have been associated with less widespread disease in swine, e.g., H1N1, H1N2, H1N7, H2N3, H3N1, H3N2, H3N3, H4N6, and H9N2 subtypes.
