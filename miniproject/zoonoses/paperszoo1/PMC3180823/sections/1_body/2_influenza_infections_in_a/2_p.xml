<p>Human influenza can nevertheless be provisionally recognized historically when there is evidence of such unmistakable clinical and epidemiologic features as explosive epidemic febrile coughing that kills the young, the old, the infirm, and pregnant women. Looking for historical evidence of animal influenza is more complicated. Until the late 1700s, there were no veterinarians or veterinary schools, and until the late 19th century no organized poultry industry. Reports of animal diseases generally came as anecdotes or “asides” from physicians, farmers, or interested citizens; diseases we now recognize to be of different etiologies were frequently confused with each other, and until the 20th century many believed that what we now know to be different diseases based on their different etiologies were instead single diseases whose manifestations differed under the influence of various ill‐defined environmental, or telluric/atmospheric/climatic influences. The quality of this patchwork animal disease record remains poor until the late 19th century. Reference works on the historical occurrences of human and animal influenza are widely available,
