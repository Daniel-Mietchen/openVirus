<p>As will be discussed, IAV maintained in wild birds have frequently switched to such new hosts as horses, swine, humans, and most frequently domestic poultry. But the mechanisms by which avian IAV cross species barriers, whether causing “dead‐end” infections or onward transmission in the new hosts, are largely unknown. Stable host switching likely involves acquisition of numerous mutations, depending on the virus and the host species
