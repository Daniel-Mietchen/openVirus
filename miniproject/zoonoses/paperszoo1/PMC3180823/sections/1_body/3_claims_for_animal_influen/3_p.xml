<p>The emphasis in these early accounts on horses, birds, and dogs is curious but inconclusive in implicating influenza. Domestic animals like horses and dogs were ubiquitous and probably suffered from many endemic and some epidemic illnesses that were considered indistinguishable from each other at the time. It would not be surprising if, during epidemic prevalences, coincidental observations of clinically similar illnesses in domestic animals would be noted by observers who lacked a scientific understanding of infection. References to avian deaths might also reflect formulaic Greek literary traditions attributing bird deaths to epidemics of any sort, or arguments favoring miasmatic spread. While tantalizing, many references to deaths of birds and domestic animals associated with possible human influenza outbreaks in the ancient literature are ultimately inconclusive.</p>
