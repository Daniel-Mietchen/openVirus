   </xref> Among other factors, the devastation of the fire has been attributed to the ongoing influenza panzootic (
   <italic>Boston</italic>, 11 November 1872). Because most of the equine work force was incapacitated, fire stations throughout the United States recruited teams of men to pull fire wagons. The slow response times of the Boston teams are believed by many to have led to the fire getting out of control. Above, onlookers on Devonshire Street assemble around Steamer Number 10, from the Fire House on Mount Vernon Street. At far right a fireman with a hose sprays the ruins.
