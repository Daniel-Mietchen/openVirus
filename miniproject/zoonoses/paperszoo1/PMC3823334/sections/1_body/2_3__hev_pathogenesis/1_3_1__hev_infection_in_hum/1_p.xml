<p>In humans, HEV causes an acute icteric disease that varies in symptoms from subclinical to fulminant hepatitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-ijerph-10-04507">4</xref>]. The asymptomatic patient typically clears the virus rapidly, while the symptomatic patient experiences clinical signs including anorexia, hepatomegaly, myalgia, jaundice and sometimes abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and fever [

In immunocompromised patients such as organ transplant recipients, lymphoma and leukemia patients, or patients with HIV infection, the course of disease may progress to a chronic state with cirrhosis of the liver and persistence of viral shedding [
