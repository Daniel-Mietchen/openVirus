 <italic>Hepeviridae</italic> and consists of four recognized genotypes and at least two putative new genotypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-ijerph-10-04507">5</xref>]. Genotype 1 causes large outbreaks of acute hepatitis E in humans in Asia. Genotype 2 causes outbreaks in humans and includes one Mexican strain and several African strains. Genotype 3 is associated with sporadic, cluster, and chronic cases of hepatitis E in humans, mostly in industrialized countries. Genotype 3 HEV is known to be zoonotic and has also been isolated from domestic and wild swine, deer, mongoose, rats, and rabbits [
