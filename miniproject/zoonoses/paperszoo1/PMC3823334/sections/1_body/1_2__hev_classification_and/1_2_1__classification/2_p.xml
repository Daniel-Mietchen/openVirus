<p>Avian HEV from chickens only shares approximately 50% nucleotide sequence identity with mammalian HEV; therefore, avian HEV likely represents a separate genus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20-ijerph-10-04507">20</xref>]. The genus 
 <italic>Avihepevirus</italic> has recently been proposed to include all three known genotypes of avian HEV in chickens (Genotype 1 in Australia and Korea, Genotype 2 in the United States, and Genotype 3 in Europe and China) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-ijerph-10-04507">1</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-ijerph-10-04507">21</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22-ijerph-10-04507">22</xref>]. The recently-identified rat HEV shares approximately 59.9% and 49.9% sequence identities with human and avian HEV, respectively, while the ferret HEV shares the highest sequence identity with rat HEV at 72.3% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18-ijerph-10-04507">18</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23-ijerph-10-04507">23</xref>]. The genus 
 <italic>Orthohepevirus</italic>has has recently been proposed to encompass both the rat and ferret strains of HEV as well as a novel wild boar HEV strain recovered in Japan that differed from the known Genotypes 1–4 HEV isolates by 22.6–27.7% in nucleotide sequence identity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-ijerph-10-04507">1</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24-ijerph-10-04507">24</xref>]. A bat HEV was recently identified from African, Central American, and European bats, and due to high sequence diversification from known HEV isolates at 47% amino acid sequence identity, the bat HEV forms a novel phylogenetic clade [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25-ijerph-10-04507">25</xref>]. The genus 
 <italic>Chiropteranhepevirus</italic> has been proposed to include all variants of the bat HEV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-ijerph-10-04507">1</xref>]. Finally, a strain of HEV was also identified in cutthroat trout in the United States with only 13–27% sequence homology with mammalian or avian hepeviruses leading to a proposal of another tentative genus, 
 <italic>Piscihepevirus</italic>, within the 
 <italic>Hepeviridae</italic> family [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-ijerph-10-04507">1</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26-ijerph-10-04507">26</xref>]. The nomenclature of HEV will need to be modified in the near future as more genetically-divergent animal strains of HEV are identified.
