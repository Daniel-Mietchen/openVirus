<p>The HEV replication cycle is currently not well understood due to a lack of an efficient cell culture system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38-ijerph-10-04507">38</xref>]. Heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) likely act as receptors for the attachment of the viral capsid protein, and the heat shock cognate protein 70 may be involved in HEV entry into the cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38-ijerph-10-04507">38</xref>]. Following uncoating in the cell, the HEV genomic RNA is likely utilized to translate the non-structural proteins and the viral RdRp is used to produce progeny virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38-ijerph-10-04507">38</xref>]. Both ORF2 and ORF3 are translated from a bicistronic subgenomic RNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32-ijerph-10-04507">32</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39-ijerph-10-04507">39</xref>]. The negative-sense HEV RNA indicative of virus replication is detectable in hepatic and extrahepatic tissues of experimentally-infected rhesus macaques and swine [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40-ijerph-10-04507">40</xref>]. Post-translational processing of proteins and mechanisms of virus assembly and release have yet to be fully elucidated, and the viral-host interactions leading to a disease state are also poorly understood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-ijerph-10-04507">5</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20-ijerph-10-04507">20</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38-ijerph-10-04507">38</xref>]. Development of a robust cell culture system to efficiently propagate HEV in the future should be a priority, and will facilitate our understanding the biology of this important virus.
