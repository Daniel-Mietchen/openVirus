<p>Professionals working in close proximity to swine, swine manure, or sewage may become infected with HEV during occupational activities [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104-ijerph-10-04507">104</xref>]. For example, swine workers in Valencia, Spain were found to be 5.4 times more likely to be positive for anti-HEV IgG than those not exposed to swine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104-ijerph-10-04507">104</xref>]. Utilizing a Bayesian model to account for imperfections in sero-assays leading to differences in the interpretation of serology results, Bouwknegt 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103-ijerph-10-04507">103</xref>] found that approximately 11% of swine veterinarians, 6% of non-swine veterinarians, and 2% of the general population were positive for anti-HEV antibodies. Variation in assays, validity of serologic tests for determining HEV prevalence, the lack of standardized diagnostic tools, the potential for multiple routes of transmission, and incompletely understood transmission routes particularly in small defined populations lead to difficulty in assessing the exact risk factors for HEV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B105-ijerph-10-04507">105</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106-ijerph-10-04507">106</xref>]. For example, Vulcano 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107-ijerph-10-04507">107</xref>] identified male housekeepers and specific pig breeders as carrying a higher prevalence of IgG anti-HEV seropositivity than previously identified in Italy and found a 5.5% seropositivity in subjects from Rieti in comparison to 2.5% from Rome, despite an overall lack of association with swine contact. In addition, pig farmers and the general population in Sweden were found to have 13% and 9% seropositivity respectively, which was higher than previously reported for populations in Europe (1â€“9%) and contributes to uncertainty in our current knowledge of transmission routes and risk factors for HEV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108-ijerph-10-04507">108</xref>]. Again, standardized serological and molecular diagnostic tests are in critical need for the study of HEV transmission and prevalence. During natural contact routes of transmission, HEV RNA is also detectable in the urine of infected swine, which likely contributes to the ease of spread in confined swine operations and may pose as an alternate route of exposure for humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109-ijerph-10-04507">109</xref>]. Contaminated water and sewage may serve as sources for HEV infection in both humans and other animals. Current research indicates the potential for transmission through these sources; however, further analysis of these sources in regards to all genotypes of HEV will better assess the overall public health risk.
