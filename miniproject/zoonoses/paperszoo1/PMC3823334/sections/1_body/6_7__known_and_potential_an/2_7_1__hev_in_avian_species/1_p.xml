<p>Avian HEV was identified as such in 2001 from chickens with Hepatitis-Splenomegaly (HS) syndrome in the United States [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34-ijerph-10-04507">34</xref>]. Likewise, Big Liver and Spleen Disease virus (BLSV) in Australia presented similarly with an approximately 80% nucleotide sequence identity to avian HEV [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73-ijerph-10-04507">73</xref>]. These two previously identified syndromes (HS and BLS) are assumed to be caused by variant strains of the same virus, avian HEV, which now encompasses three distinct, but related genotypes worldwide [
