<p>Deer have been implicated both acting as animal reservoirs for HEV and acting as vehicles for human infection [

The Sika and Yezo deer in Japan carried a 3% and 35% anti-HEV seroprevalence respectively, with a positive association with HEV infection in humans and nearly identical nucleotide sequence identity with HEV strains from local wild boars [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B170-ijerph-10-04507">170</xref>]. Increasing management of deer including feeding, watering, movement of groups, and fencing for hunting purposes in Mexico offers the ability for pathogens such as HEV to transfer between groups of deer and humans readily and may serve to disseminate pathogens to animals within the United States [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B170-ijerph-10-04507">170</xref>]. Sharing of habitats between wild boar and deer may play a role in the ability to harbor and transmit HEV to humans. However, without additional direct evidence of transmission within the deer species, it is difficult to determine whether deer acts as incidental or natural hosts to HEV infection [
