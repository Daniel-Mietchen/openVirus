 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B188-ijerph-10-04507">188</xref>]. In The Netherlands, ferrets carried a strain of HEV that shared a 72.3% nucleotide sequence identity with that of the rat HEV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23-ijerph-10-04507">23</xref>]. The cutthroat trout in the United States also carried a unique strain of HEV with only 13% to 27% sequence identity with known mammalian and avian HEV strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26-ijerph-10-04507">26</xref>]. The zoonotic potentials of these novel animal strains of HEV are not altogether understood, but the ever-expanding host range and high levels of anti-HEV seropositivity among mammalian species suggests transmission is common and thus may pose a potential public health concern.
