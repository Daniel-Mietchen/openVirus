<p>Contact exposure to infected animals leads to an elevated risk for HEV transmission in humans. Swine veterinarians in the United States were shown to have a 27% seropositivity to Genotype 3 swine HEV in comparison to 16% of the normal blood donors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B189-ijerph-10-04507">189</xref>]. Individuals from states in which swine production plays a key role were more likely to be seropositive to HEV than other non-major swine states [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B189-ijerph-10-04507">189</xref>]. Incidents such as needle sticks while working with swine were found to be1.9 times more likely positive for HEV antibodies in swine veterinarians [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B189-ijerph-10-04507">189</xref>]. Pig handlers such as veterinarians, breeders, and farmers in China, Thailand, The Netherlands, Sweden, Moldova, and the United States were also more likely seropositive to swine HEV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103-ijerph-10-04507">103</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108-ijerph-10-04507">108</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B190-ijerph-10-04507">190</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B191-ijerph-10-04507">191</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B192-ijerph-10-04507">192</xref>]. In Sweden, 13% of pig breeders were positive for antibodies to HEV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B190-ijerph-10-04507">190</xref>]. In The Netherlands, 11% of swine veterinarians were positive in comparison to 6% of non-swine veterinarians and 2% of the general population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108-ijerph-10-04507">108</xref>]. In North Carolina, swine handlers carried a 4.5 times higher rate of seropositivity in comparison to non-swine workers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B191-ijerph-10-04507">191</xref>]. In Moldova, 51% of swine farmers were positive in comparison to 25% of non-swine occupations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103-ijerph-10-04507">103</xref>]. Taken together, swine are a major reservoir for HEV and occupational contact with infected swine is a risk factor for zoonotic HEV transmission in humans.
