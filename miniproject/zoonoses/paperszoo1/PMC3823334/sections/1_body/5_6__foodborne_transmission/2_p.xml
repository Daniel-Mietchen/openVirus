<p>Consumption of undercooked or raw organs or tissues from infected swine has been linked to numerous cases of hepatitis E worldwide. For example, three cases of hepatitis E in Japan were associated with the consumption of undercooked or raw pork presumably from the same barbeque restaurant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B131-ijerph-10-04507">131</xref>]. Nine of ten clinical cases of hepatitis E from 2001 to 2002 had a history of consuming undercooked pork 2–8 weeks before the onset of clinical signs and 1.9% of pig livers tested from local groceries in Hokkaido, Japan were positive for Genotype 3 or 4 HEV RNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13-ijerph-10-04507">13</xref>]. Consumption of pig liver or intestines is considered as a risk factor for HEV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B131-ijerph-10-04507">131</xref>]. Cases of hepatitis E in Japan were also linked to the consumption of contaminated wild boar meat [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B135-ijerph-10-04507">135</xref>]. Wild boar populations in Italy and South-eastern France had detectable levels of HEV RNA in 2.5% of liver samples and 25% of bile samples, respectively [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B137-ijerph-10-04507">137</xref>]. Boar meat consumption was positively associated with HEV infection in a case-control study in Germany [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B138-ijerph-10-04507">138</xref>]. Cases of acute hepatitis E associated with Genotype 4 HEV have been confirmed in South Korea, presumably due to the consumption of raw wild boar bile juice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B139-ijerph-10-04507">139</xref>]. Human patients with acute HEV infections in France were linked to the consumption of figatellu sausage (Corsican raw pig liver dish). The HEV sequences recovered from the figatellu products in local grocery stores were essentially indistinguishable from the viral sequences recovered from the human patients, thus providing compelling evidence for foodborne HEV transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-ijerph-10-04507">11</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B140-ijerph-10-04507">140</xref>]. The HEV present in the pig liver sausage from manufacturers in France was shown to be infectious utilizing a 3D HEV cell-culture system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B141-ijerph-10-04507">141</xref>]. Commercial pig livers tested in the United States, Germany, and The Netherlands also carried detectable levels of HEV RNA in 11%, 4%, and 6.5% of the samples tested, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B142-ijerph-10-04507">142</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B143-ijerph-10-04507">143</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B144-ijerph-10-04507">144</xref>]. At slaughterhouses in Bavaria, Germany, 68.6% of the serum samples and 67.6% of meat juice samples were tested seropositive for HEV antibody, indicating animal exposures to HEV prior to slaughter [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B145-ijerph-10-04507">145</xref>]. In Italy, an overall 87% anti-HEV seropositivity was detected in slaughterhouse swine and 64.6% were positive for HEV RNA indicating both a high level of exposure to HEV and a similarly high level of active virus infection at the time of slaughter [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B146-ijerph-10-04507">146</xref>]. Similar investigations of pork production chains in the Czech Republic, Spain, and the United Kingdom revealed detectable, infectious HEV at both processing locations and point of sale [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B147-ijerph-10-04507">147</xref>]. Genotype 4 HEV has also been identified in a small percentage of pig livers collected from markets in India and carry a 90–91% nucleotide sequence identity with the local swine HEV isolates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B148-ijerph-10-04507">148</xref>]. Other reports identify Indian strains of Genotype 4 swine HEV as genetically distinct from Genotype 1 human HEV strains circulating in the region further convoluting the route of transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B149-ijerph-10-04507">149</xref>]. Human consumption of Genotype 4 HEV-contaminated pork livers leading to disease has not yet been reported in India, which may be due to differing culinary habits [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-ijerph-10-04507">11</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B140-ijerph-10-04507">140</xref>]. It is likely that the Genotype 4 swine HEV in India does cause sporadic cases of acute hepatitis E in humans through zoonotic infection, although such rare and sporadic cases of Genotype 4 hepatitis E may be masked by the more prevalent and explosive form of Genotype 1 hepatitis E in India.
