This review article encompasses a comprehensive literature review with a focus on food and environmental safety and zoonotic risk of HEV. Due to the narrow scope of the topic and space constraints, many important articles regarding HEV may be unintentionally excluded from this review. We have attempted to include the most recent publications including review articles in order to provide the reader with up to date and comprehensive information on the topic.</p>
