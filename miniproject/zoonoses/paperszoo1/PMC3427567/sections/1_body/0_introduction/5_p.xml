<p>A clear institutional framework has recently been proposed for responses to emerging zoonotic diseases that require a multidisciplinary, ‘one health’ approach for their management [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C20">20</xref>]. Such an approach recognizes the interdependence of human health, animals and ecosystems, but provides little guidance for researching these in an integrated manner. More specific inclusion of the drivers of spillover events is essential if we are ever to use our research to develop long-term programmes and strategies that reduce the future likelihood or frequency of spillover events. Further, approaches for the study of these complex ecological events must include study of the relevant institutions themselves, as their policies shape local and larger scale responses and perceptions.
