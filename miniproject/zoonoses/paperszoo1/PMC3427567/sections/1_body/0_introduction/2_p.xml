<p>There is a growing awareness of the increasing threats presented to humans by emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C1">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C3">3</xref>], with the majority of human EIDs being zoonotic—originating especially from wildlife reservoirs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C4">4</xref>]. Emerging diseases have a huge impact on human societies across the world, affecting both current and future generations. Changes in human living patterns, along with environmental and climate changes, pose unprecedented challenges to the global health of people, animals and ecosystems. Ecosystem health correlates with human health [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C5">5</xref>], but the precise relationships remain poorly understood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C6">6</xref>]. Understanding and responding to the ecological, social and economic conditions facilitating disease emergence and transmission represent one of the major challenges for humankind today [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C7">7</xref>]. The risk is not uniform [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C2">2</xref>]: 53 per cent of global EID outbreaks from 1996 to 2009 were in Africa, yet the continent lags behind severely in infectious disease detection and emerging epidemic warnings [
