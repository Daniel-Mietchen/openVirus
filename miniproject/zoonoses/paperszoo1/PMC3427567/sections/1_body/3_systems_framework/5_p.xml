<p>Our framework also captures how intermediate hosts, such as livestock, can play key bridging roles in such spillover events. Bridging species have been particularly important for many of the most serious bat-derived human pathogens, including the horse for Hendra virus [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C49">49</xref>], non-human primates in the case of Ebola [
