<p>The dynamics of individual spillover events are based around the concept of the pyramid (triangle here) of pathogen emergence first proposed by Antia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C26">26</xref>] and developed further by others, including Lloyd-Smith 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C27">27</xref>]. It is proposed that humans are constantly challenged by animal-derived pathogens (the so-called pathogen, or viral, ‘chatter’), but that only a small proportion manage to invade individual humans. Of those invading, most will be controlled by innate immunity and not replicate efficiently. Of those (proportionally) few that manage to replicate within the new host, most will not be able to transmit between individuals, or will do so only very poorly. As reviewed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C27">27</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C48">48</xref>], the major determinant of whether these replicating pathogens will then invade human populations is the rate at which they can transmit between humans.
