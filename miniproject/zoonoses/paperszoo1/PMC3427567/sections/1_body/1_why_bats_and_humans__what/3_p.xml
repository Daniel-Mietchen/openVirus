 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C22">22</xref>] (Baker

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C25">25</xref>], have demonstrated the amazing breadth and diversity of microbial populations in different bat species. An unknown proportion of the detected infections will have the ability to cross the species barrier, with or without adaptation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C26">26</xref>]. The spillover infection dynamics will, however, be very different between different species of bat and microbe, with additional and marked geographical variation influenced by environmental factors and human behaviours.
