<p>Determining the processes by which viral pathogens are transmitted within bat populations, and spillover between bats and other animals, is a critical step towards understanding spillover to humans and its regional and temporal variation. Critical questions include: 
 <list list-type="simple">
  <list-item>
   <p>— Is there evidence for endemic circulation of zoonotic viruses in bat populations and how is such circulation affected by bat population dynamics and life history?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>— What aspects of viral pathogen dynamics in bats and bat–domestic animal interactions influence the likelihood and frequency of zoonotic spillover events?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>— What environmental factors drive viral pathogen dynamics and spillover between bat species and across locations and seasons?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>— Do bats harbour an unusually wide range of viruses highly pathogenic in other species?</p>
  </list-item>
 </list>The development of mathematical models that integrate information from all the empirical research components is a critical foundation of this theme [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C45">45</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C47">47</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C49">49</xref>]. These models should investigate the potential roles of different mechanisms that can influence infection dynamics, including host–pathogen interactions at the individual level, virus circulation within and among bat colonies (which requires detailed understanding of host ecology) and inter-species transmission (impacted by viral tropisms and human–bat interactions).
