 <italic>Drivers of spillover</italic>, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20120228F1">figure 1</xref>, may include environmental and climate changes, as well as socio-economic, demographic and political drivers of relevant processes, such as agricultural intensification, livestock keeping or bushmeat hunting [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C106">106</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C107">107</xref>]. Such drivers are rather poorly understood for most zoonotic systems, so even improved qualitative study would be valuable, asking: 
 <list list-type="simple">
  <list-item>
   <p>— How are local pathogen spillover events, Old World fruit bat ecology and human–bat interactions influenced by wider drivers, operating at local, national and regional scales?</p>
  </list-item>
 </list>Contextual descriptions of key drivers identified for each locality should be constructed by drawing on existing environmental, social and historical literatures, including qualitative analyses, to track up from key processes identified in the 
 <italic>human–bat interactions</italic> and 
 <italic>bats and ecology</italic> themes to identify national and international influences on these. Optimally, this would be complemented by empirical modelling techniques [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C2">2</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C108">108</xref>] to investigate the correlation of disease spillover events and their drivers at different spatial scales. Spatially explicit ecosystem data, such as land use, wildlife densities, livestock densities, human population densities, climate and socio-economic variables are increasingly available for such analyses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C2">2</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C108">108</xref>]. With a careful interpretation, empirical models can quantify the impact of different spatial drivers on risk of initial spillover and subsequent spread and at what spatial scales these may be important. On the basis of time series analyses, risk maps could be generated that predict spatio-temporally changing ‘hot zones’ for spillover, thus contributing to forecasting.
