<p>The practices and health system factors that influence how prevalent spillover risks are, and how these are detected in different settings, need specific study in most developing world situations. Key questions here include: 
 <list list-type="simple">
  <list-item>
   <p>— To what extent do Old World fruit bats present EID threats to public health?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>— What epidemiological links exist between human demographic and behavioural factors (including livestock interactions) and spillover?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>— How are disease detection and diagnosis shaped by surveillance, health system and health-seeking infrastructures and practices?</p>
  </list-item>
 </list>In this challenging theme, the obvious epidemiological and public health approaches must be integrated with anthropological perspectives that emphasize how prevailing social and cultural values, legal, political and economic factors and organizational norms influence disease classifications and diagnoses [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C103">103</xref>]. Critical medical anthropology [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C104">104</xref>] has directed the attention towards the social and political determinants of ill health, disease distribution and access to health care. Recent approaches in health systems research understand health care systems not merely as structures of services, goods and personnel, but as knowledge economies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C105">105</xref>] involving health markets that include formal and informal practitioners, with a range of factors influencing people's understandings of illness and health-seeking behaviour. These concepts should underpin the investigation of the extent to which bat virus spillover events are recognized by a range of groups and how diagnosis and public health responses are shaped by institutional factors and health care workers' practices. From socio-epidemiological perspectives, an investigation of how behavioural and socio-demographic factors can predispose people and their domestic animals to spillover infections would be very valuable. Relevant biomedical syndromes must be considered alongside enquiry regarding the extent to which zoonotic disease risk is recognized by local people and features in their concepts of illnesses and perceptions of relevant causes of morbidity and mortality.
