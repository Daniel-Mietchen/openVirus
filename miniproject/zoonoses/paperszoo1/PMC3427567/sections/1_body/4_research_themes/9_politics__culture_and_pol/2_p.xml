<p>Building on more local focus in the 
 <italic>human–bat interactions</italic> and 
 <italic>public health impacts</italic> themes, work here should explore broader interpretations and representations—framings—held by a wide range of different interested parties (often termed ‘actors’ in the social sciences) across multiple scales: 
 <list list-type="simple">
  <list-item>
   <p>— How do local, national and international actors frame bat–human–disease interactions, spillover and risks according to their cultural backgrounds, institutional positions and political interests?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>— How do these framings shape responses, policies and interventions?</p>
  </list-item>
 </list>This work could be valuably informed by social science and science–policy perspectives on framing and by the construction of (policy) knowledge through social and political processes and cultural logics [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C110">110</xref>]. It has been shown that framings often take the form of ‘narratives’ or underlying storylines which drive and justify different kinds of intervention and response [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C112">112</xref>]. Different framings are associated with different actors, institutions and policy communities, linked in different ways across scales [
