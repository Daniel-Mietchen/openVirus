<p>Human–bat interactions are critical to shaping people's exposure to zoonotic pathogens, but this key driver of spillover has been insufficiently studied. Relevant questions include: 
 <list list-type="simple">
  <list-item>
   <p>— How do people perceive and interact with bats, including through intermediate hosts and indirect contact with bat secretions, according to their living environment and via livelihoods, bushmeat consumption and ritual practices?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>— How do these practices differ by gender, ethnicity, age and wealth, and so shape differential risks of disease exposure?</p>
  </list-item>
 </list>Such thematic research should most obviously be grounded in ecological anthropology, political ecology [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C79">79</xref>], seeking to understand human–bat interactions in their ‘biocultural–political complexity’ [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C80">80</xref>]. Although there is a growing body of livelihood-focused literature (e.g. on bats and bushmeat [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C81">81</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C82">82</xref>]), specific mention of bats is very limited in general bushmeat studies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C83">83</xref>]. Early ethnographic accounts focused on material culture, such as the construction of nets for bat-catching [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C84">84</xref>] and on structural analyses of people's classification schemes of fauna and flora [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C88">88</xref>], and frequent reference is made to bats' ritual, symbolic and liminal roles [
