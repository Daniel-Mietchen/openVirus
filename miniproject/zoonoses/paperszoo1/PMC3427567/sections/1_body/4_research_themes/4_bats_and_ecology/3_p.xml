 </list>Bat species differ markedly in their ecologies, which may influence spillover. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, 
 <italic>Eidolon helvum</italic> and 
 <italic>Rousettus aegyptiacus</italic> are the most widespread and possibly the most abundant fruit bats, often living in colonies of up to several million individuals. 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> often roosts in trees in urban settings, whereas 
 <italic>R. aegyptiacus</italic> roosts predominantly in caves and in more rural areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C54">54</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C55">55</xref>]. 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> is migratory, probably following the burst of fruits and flowers with the onset of the wet season [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C56">56</xref>], but where they go during this time is largely unknown [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C57">57</xref>]. While some individuals have been shown to migrate over 2500 km [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C58">58</xref>], not all individuals migrate. In West Africa, 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> colonies can be very large (with roosts of more than one million individuals), while in East Africa 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> colonies appear to be smaller and more fragmented with reportedly less-pronounced migratory behaviour. In Southeast Asia, pteropodid fruit bats also may be highly mobile, though are sometimes perceived to be sedentary, living in small, fragmented colonies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C59">59</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C61">61</xref>]. In Australia, flying foxes often live in very large, shifting colonies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C47">47</xref>]. All these species have one pup per year during a synchronized birth pulse. In Bangladesh, where Nipah virus spillover occurs annually [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C62">62</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C63">63</xref>], and in Asia, there is a temporal association between bat reproduction and potential zoonotic spillover events [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C47">47</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C64">64</xref>]. In West Africa, 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> bats probably birth and mate during migration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C65">65</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C67">67</xref>], which might be linked to, or even driven by, the nutritional needs of the females and their offspring, but the timing and place of these remain largely unknown [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C65">65</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C68">68</xref>]. It is possible, therefore, that spillover events occur on the migratory route of this species. Knowledge about migration, time and place of the reproductive cycle in conjunction with the number of animals at any given time and place, and resource availability will provide crucial information about these ecological keystone species, and point to where and when potential spillover to humans should be researched. Alternatively, bats may use migration to escape from areas with high disease load, or lower pathogen prevalence during migration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20120228C69">69</xref>].
