<p>Up to now, it has been impossible to predict outbreaks of influenza epidemics. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to provide a mathematical framework to understand the outbreak of influenza and to determine specific gene mutation sequences of avian flu virus required for human-to-human transmission capacity by mutation, and this process could be simulated by continuous-time Markov model.</p>
