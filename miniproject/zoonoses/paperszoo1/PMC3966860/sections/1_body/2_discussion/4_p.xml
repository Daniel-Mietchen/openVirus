<p>It is very common to explore the source of a virus by sequence alignment. However, with increasingly massive amounts of the virus genome data becoming available, it is not realistic to compare all the flu virus strains by sequence alignment. Therefore, it is necessary to find a new strategy to identify the origin of the H7N9 virus. Unlike the study by Liu et al 
 <xref rid="pone.0093094-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, we believe the HA and NA genes restructured into other virus strains and discarded the other genes that have no direct relationship with the recognition between the epithelium mucosa and virus capsid. Through the above research, we found the HA7 of A/H7N9/2013_China originated from water birds from the Yangzi River system and existed in this region for at least three years. It did not originate from South Korea. Liu et al tried to identify the origin of A/H7N9/2013_China using a very different strategy of comparing sequences of all H7N9 viruses 
 <xref rid="pone.0093094-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Considering the fast re-assortment and quasi-evolution of avian influenza and the migration of water birds, Liu’s strategy is not appropriate. Furthermore, we found NA9 sequences from Hu Nan (H6N9), Nan Chang (H2N9) and a HA7 sequence from Hu Nan (H7N1) exhibited high similarity with A/H7N9/2013_China, and the similarity between these sequences in China is significantly higher than that between A/H7N9/2013_China and H7N9 from South Korea. Indeed, a recent study by Zhu et al 
 <xref rid="pone.0093094-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> found that the viruses from southern China’s water birds are the major contributors of the 2013 H7N9 influenza epidemic, and this is consistent with our result.
