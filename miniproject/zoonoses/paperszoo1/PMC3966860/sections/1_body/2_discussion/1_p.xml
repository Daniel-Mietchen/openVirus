<p>The evolution of avian influenza virus is quite different from that of eukaryotic species in that it is a kind of quasi-species evolution. In this situation, high mutation rates and accumulation of errors will cause error catastrophe and lead to extinction. However, genetic re-assortment provides a shelter mechanism to preserve certain gene sequences. In other words, a harmful gene could be conserved within a genetic pool. In terms of the origin of A/H7N9/2013_China, we found that crucial sequences of this virus have existed in water birds for a long time.</p>
