<p>Although the mutated loci of HA protein of A/H7N9/2013_China in its primary structures are far apart from each other, all mutated loci in tertiary structures are close by. For HA protein, all mutated loci are located in spherical heads, which contain the sialic acid binding sites. This is a clue to why H7N9 avian influenza viruses posed limited poultry-to-human transmittable capacity.</p>
