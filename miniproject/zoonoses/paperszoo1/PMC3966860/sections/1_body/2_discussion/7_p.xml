<p>We examined the time required for A/H7N9/2013 to become a human-to-human transmittable virus. We determined it could have the capacity of human-to-human transmission in 11.3 years [95% CI: 11.2â€“11.3 years, HA gene]. As we know, the interval between the influenza pandemics of 1957/1958 and 1968/1969 was around 10 years 
 <xref rid="pone.0093094-Pandemic1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0093094-Potter1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and these two pandemics originated from Hong Kong, China. Therefore we concluded that if the next pandemic originates from the current bird-to-human A/H7N9/2013_China by means of mutation, it could quite possibly happen in 2023/2024. Nevertheless, we should be cautious, as this prediction is fairly conservative because re-assortment is not considered in the current model.
