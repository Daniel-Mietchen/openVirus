<p>In April 2013, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) published an article on the novel H7N9 viruses 
 <xref rid="pone.0093094-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In their opinion, the origin of A/H7N9/2013 derives from the re-assortment of the HA gene of A/duck/Zhejiang/12/2011(H7N3) and the NA gene of A/wild_bird/Korea/A14/2011(H7N9)_South_Korea. We do not agree with China CDC on their explanation of the origin of A/H7N9/2013. We argue this because China CDC’s research did not include A/Baer’s Pochard/Hunan/2010/H7N1, A/duck/Nanchang/2000/H2N9 and A/duck/Hunan/2007/H6N9 in their phylogenetic tree; although we found that A/duck/Zhejiang/12/2011 (H7N3) shared 95.5% similarity with A/H7N9/2013, which is consistent with China CDC’s findings. All three highly homological influenza viruses existed before A/duck/Zhejiang/12/2011(H7N3) and wild bird influenza viruses from South Korea (H7N9). Our phylogenetic analysis indicates that the South Korea wild bird influenza virus shares high similarity with A/H7N9/2013_China (96.3%), and it shares 95.7% similarity with A/duck/Nanchang/2000/H2N9. This indicates that A/duck/Nanchang/2000/H2N9 is a common ancestor of the NA genes of both A/H7N9/2013 and A/wild_bird/Korea/A14/2011(H7N9) South_Korea (
