<p>Nanchang is a city in Jiang Xi Province and is close to Po Yang Lake, the largest body of water in China. The second largest body of water in China, Dong Ting Lake, is in Hu Nan Province. The two lakes are linked by the Yangzi River. Every winter, migrant water birds fly from northwestern to southern China; Po Yang and Dong Ting lakes are important winter habitats for these birds and the wet land of Zhe Jiang Province is a major water stop on the birdsâ€™ migration route (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093094-g003">Figure 3A, 3B</xref>). The HA gene of A/H7N9/2013 most likely came from birds in Dong Ting Lake. The NA gene of A/H7N9/2013 most likely came from birds in Po Yang Lake and persisted in the Po Yang-Dong Ting water system. In southern and eastern China, ducks generally are bred in a natural water body and could easily contract influenza viruses from wild birds

 <xref rid="pone.0093094-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. We therefore conclude that A/H7N9/2013 is a re-assortment virus that acquired HA and NA genes from migrant water birds in China.
