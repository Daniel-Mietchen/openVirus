<p>Quasi-evolution explains why a virus can transfer from one strain to another. Generally speaking, quasi-evolution is the accumulation of a replicating mutant spectrum with interfering mutant genomes prompted by enhanced mutagenesis. This process plays a key role in the sharp transition of virus populations into error catastrophe that leads to virus extinction. Nevertheless, when we consider the impacts of both re-assortment and quasi-evolution, we found that extinction and the diminishment of specific genes are two different things. HA7 and NA9 genes could drift between different avian virus quasi-species. The original virus H6N9_Hunan _1997 and H2N9_Nanchang_2001 may have been extinct in birds, but their sequences are still preserved and transmitted among the bird populations.</p>
