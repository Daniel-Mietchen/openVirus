<p>Mutation velocity of A/H7N9/2013_China was calculated based on the comparison of HA amino acid sequence variations between viruses from seven H7N9 cases. The dates of illness onset were obtained from China CDCâ€™s report. We set the closest human-to-human transmittable virus (H3N2) HA amino acid sequence as the outcome and entered A/H7N9/2013_China into the Markov model to calculation the time required for A/H7N9/2013_China to become human-to-human transmittable.</p>
