<p>Our work included five steps: 1) clustering HA and NA genes of A/H7N9/2013_China and all influenza viruses (HA7 or NA9) from human, avian and swine of China since 1983 into the phylogenetic tree; 2) measuring distances between A/H7N9/2013_China and the viruses from the nearest nodes of the phylogenetic tree and finding ancestors of H7N9; 3) comparing amino acid sequences of HA protein between A/H7N9/2013_China and closely related viruses to screen mutated loci; 4) locating mutated loci in the tertiary structures of the HA protein; 5) employing the Markov model to establish evolutionary dynamics and to predict how long will it take for the avian A/H7N9/2013_China virus to mutate into a human-to-human transmittable virus.</p>
