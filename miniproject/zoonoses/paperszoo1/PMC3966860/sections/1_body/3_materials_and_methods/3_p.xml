<p>Gene mutations caused amino acid mutations. In amino acid sequences of HA protein in influenza virus, mutations at key loci determines bird-to-human and/or human-to-human transmission capacity. Thus, we focused on amino acid sequence mutations of HA protein of A/H7N9/2013_China. Analyzing the phylogenetic relations of HA genes between A/H7N9/2013_China and other human-to-human transmittable influenza viruses, we found that the closest neighbors of H7N9 are two H3N2 viruses from Kunming (A/Kunming/H3N2/2005, EPI356039) and Nanjing (A/Nanjing/H3N2/1983, EPI92288) of China. We then set HA amino acid sequences and their tertiary structures of H3N2 influenza virus as comparison subjects. We obtained typical HA (ExPDB ID: 1ti8) amino acid sequences and their tertiary structures of H3N2 from Protein Data Bank (

We used the getpdp function from MatLab Bioinformatics Toolbox to re-construct the tertiary structures of A/H7N9/2013_China and visualized the mutated amino acid loci in protein HA.
