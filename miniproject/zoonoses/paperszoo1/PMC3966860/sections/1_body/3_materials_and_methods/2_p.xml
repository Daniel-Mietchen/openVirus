<p>We obtained gene sequences from A/H7N9/2013_China and all other influenza viruses from human, swine and avian in China in 1983â€“2013 from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) website 
 <xref rid="pone.0093094-The1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. We transformed the original data to readable structures for MatLab (2011b, MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, US) using E-Utilities software. These MatLab readable structures represented eight genes of the influenza virus. We used the Thompson-Higgins-Gibson algorithm to align gene sequences. The JC69 algorithm was used to establish a phylogenetic tree for all the viruses
