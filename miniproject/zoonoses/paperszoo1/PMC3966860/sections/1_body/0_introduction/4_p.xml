<p>Addressing the second issue is more difficult. Because of the high possibility of re-assortment and mutation, evolution of RNA viruses like influenza is quite different from other species 
 <xref rid="pone.0093094-Lauring1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Previous studies have tried to address the human-to-human transmission issue by studying quasi-evolution

 <xref rid="pone.0093094-SalazarGonzalez1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Although some researchers suggested that the error catastrophe would lead to a biological gap between different strains of virus 
 <xref rid="pone.0093094-Crotty1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0093094-Graci1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, some researchers found that the virus can be “hidden” in the genome of other species and is able to cross the error catastrophe gap 
 <xref rid="pone.0093094-Holmes1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0093094-Bull1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In this case, influenza viruses could transfer from one strain to another through accumulation of mutations. Accordingly, we could compute the time required for the transformation from non-human-to-human virus to human-to-human transmissible virus from the mutation ratio.
