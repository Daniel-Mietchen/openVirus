<p>To address the first issue, we have a set of well-established methods. We compared genetic distances between viral sequences and traced H7N9 back to its origin. However, with the recent progress in sequencing technology, the use of influenza genome sequencing data is growing quickly. This poses a new challenge: how to decide the appropriate strategy to screen for the candidate gene to obtain sequence alignment and establish the correct evolutionary phylogenetic tree?</p>
