However, if human-to-human transmission ever occurred, an outbreak of influenza pandemic is quite possible. Because of the high fatality rate (mortality rate ∼27%), prevention of this pandemic is a global priority. Discovering the origin of H7N9 and predicting when it will become transmittable between humans is crucial for monitoring and prevention in China and other countries worldwide.
