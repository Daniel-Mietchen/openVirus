<p>The main process of evolutionary phylogenetic analysis is to calculate the distance between two sequences. Distance estimation is based on the expected number of nucleotide substitutions per site in a nucleic acid sequence. Continuous-time Markov model are commonly used for this purpose because the nucleotide sites in the sequence are generally assumed to evolve independently of each other

It means that when one nucleotide mutates into another, it only depends on its current state, not on how the current state is reached. We chose the JC69 model (Jukes and Cantor 1969) that assumes that every nucleotide has the same mutation rate (Î»)
