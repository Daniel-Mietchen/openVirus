<p>After analyzing phylogenetic relations between A/H7N9/2013_China and other influenza viruses from China in the past 30 years, we found 95.5% similarity in the hemagglutinin (HA) genes between A/H7N9/2013_China and an H7N1 avian influenza virus of a water bird (A/Baerâ€™s Pochard/Hunan/2010/H7N1, EPI 387555) from Hu Nan Province (
