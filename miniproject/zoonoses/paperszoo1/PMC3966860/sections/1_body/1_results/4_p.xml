<p>Next, we considered the time required for A/H7N9/2013 to become a human-to-human transmittable virus. It is well known that HA is a key gene for human-to-human transmission 
 <xref rid="pone.0093094-Wilks1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. We found 38 mutations in the HA7 amino acid sequence of influenza viruses since 2010. We then employed the Markov model to compute the mutation velocity of this sequence of HA7 amino acids and established a mutation dynamics model. We determined that A/H7N9/2013_China could become human-to-human transmittable in 11.3 years (95% CI: 11.2â€“11.3) by mutations in the HA gene.
