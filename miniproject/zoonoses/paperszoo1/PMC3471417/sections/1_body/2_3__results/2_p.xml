<p>The survival rates of H7N1 and H5N2 viruses in freshwater were found to be 74.3%, and 68.2% respectively, regardless of storage temperature. While the survivability of H5N2 virus in brackish water was 64.7% (−20°C) and 47.0% (−30°C), it was appreciably lower in salty water, namely 58.8% (−20°C) and 41.2% (−30°C). Grossly, higher viability of both the viruses was observed during storing at −20°C, as compared with storing at −30°C, except for the viruses seeded in freshwater. About 1.5 and 1.3 Log higher titer of H5N2 and H7N1 viruses, respectively, was found in case of viruses seeded in brackish water stored at −20°C than the viruses seeded in same water but stored at −30°C (Figures
