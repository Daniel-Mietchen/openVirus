<p>Observational data regarding protracted genetic conservation taking place within a variety of IAVs, as published in different works, are profiled in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>. While the first case presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>—strain A/pintail duck/Akita/714/2006—points out conservation exhibited by a virus we isolated and analyzed, all the other cases presented in that table are mentioned elsewhere, as referenced. The data presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref> reflect an array including considerable durations of viral-protracted genetic conservation, from as little as 3 to as much as 82 years, and pertain to examples of avian, porcine, and human viral strains, isolated throughout 1977 to 2006.
