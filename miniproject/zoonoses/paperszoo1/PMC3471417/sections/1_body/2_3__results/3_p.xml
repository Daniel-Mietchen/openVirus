<p>In order to ascertain the postulation that influenza viruses can survive repeated freezing and thawing, two tubes of H7N1 viruses seeded in freshwater and stored at −20°C were used at seven months after seeding. Four freezing-thawing cycles were thus monitored. The results of this experiment are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>. The cumulative reduction of virus titer at 4th cycle of repeated freezing and thawing was about 25.7% log10 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>. In other words, the viability of H7N1 virus was about 74.3% log10 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>. Most of the reduction, 20%, occurred during the first two cycles, reflecting abiotic selection of the majority of cryobiologically unfitted virions.
