<p>To substantiate the assumptions that influenza virions can endure freezing and persist viably in the frozen state in nature until thawing occurs, two low-pathogenic H5N2 and H7N1 AIVs were seeded separately in three different types of environmental water (salty, brackish, and fresh water), at the dose rate of 8.5 (H5N2) and 8.75 (H7N1) log10 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL and stored at −20 and −30°C. Survivability of these viruses was appraised monthly for 12 months in Caco-2 cell line and expressed as log10 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>. Besides, survivability of one of these two viruses throughout repeated freezing and thawing cycles was also evaluated. All three types of water were confirmed as negative for contamination with AIVs before seeding with the tested viruses. In general, live viruses were detected in all types of water stored at different temperatures at the end of the freezing period, namely, 12 months after seeding. However, the rate of survivability was found to vary among water types, between freezing temperatures, and between virus subtypes. The survivability was found in decreasing trend, meaning, fresh water &gt; brackish water &gt; salty water, irrespective of virus subtype, and storage temperature (Figures

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). The titer of H5N2 virus stored at −20°C decreased from initial 8.5 to 5.8 log10 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> at 12 months after seeding in fresh water, whereas in case of brackish and salty water the titer decreased to 5.5 and 5.0 log10 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>, respectively (
