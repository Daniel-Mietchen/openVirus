<p>Breban et al. [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] observed that abiotic environmental perpetuation of AIVs ought to regularly take place for periods of 2 years at least, due to offering a parsimonious explanation of the 2â€“4-year periodicity of avian influenza epidemics; provision of a virus persistence mechanism within small communities where epidemics cannot be sustained by direct transmission only (i.e., communities smaller than the critical community size); and the very low levels of environmental transmission (i.e., few cases per year) that are sufficient for avian influenza to endure within populations where it would otherwise vanish. Year-by-year perpetuation of AIVs in Alaskan lakes occupied during summertime by migratory waterfowl has indeed been pointed at by Ito et al. [
