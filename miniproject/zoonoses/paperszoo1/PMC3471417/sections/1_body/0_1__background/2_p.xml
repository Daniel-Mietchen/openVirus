<p>Influenza A virus (IAV) is prevalent within some mammals, including man, and multiple avian host species. It is well established that wild birds infected with avian influenza viruses (AIVs)—usually sub-clinically—are infectious for approximately 6–10 days, during which they continuously shed vast concentrations of viral particles in their feces [

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Large portion of this viral mass is deposited into water by aquatic birds, which are highly permissive of AIVs and frequently infected. A part of the deposited virions are then ingested by susceptible birds occupying the water, thus completing the fecal/oral transmission route [

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This apparatus is well recognized throughout the Tundra and the Taiga belts. In arctic marine environments, various sea-birds, as well as seals and whales harboring IAVs, cyclically introduce them into local melting-freezing seawater. During spring and summer, sub-clinically AIV-infected migratory aquatic birds are prone to reach any frozen water body across the sub-arctic and arctic regions upon thawing, and seed those water bodies with viruses until freezing reoccurs. During fall, those avian populations are inclined to reach poultry farms, especially in Southeast Asia, thereby allowing for a dynamic viral interface with agricultural- and human-derived influenza strains.
