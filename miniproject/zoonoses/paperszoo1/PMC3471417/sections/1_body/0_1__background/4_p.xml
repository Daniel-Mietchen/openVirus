<p>The feasibility of viable preservation of AIVs in lake ice has been proposed by Shoham [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Webster et al. [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Experimentally, IAVs were indeed found to be fairly cryotolerant, in general [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], as elaborated on below. In addition, occasional unconformities between expected and empirical rates of nucleotide substitutions evidenced within AIVs indicate possible pauses of years without virus replication [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. At the same time, influenza viruses are not known to and most probably do not undergo dormant phases in their hosts, meaning that there has to be some abiotic mechanism accounting for such genetic conservation. Also, fundamentally, the following open question surfaces anyway: what practically happens to influenza virions—which are known to commonly be found in lake water occupied by waterfowl—when freezing takes place in arctic and subarctic regions, in terms of virus survival?
