<p>On those grounds, the present study assumes, conceptually, what follows.
 <list list-type="alpha-upper">
  <list-item>
   <p>Influenza virions can survive in lake water during the relatively short period of time between ice thawing and refreezing, in sub-arctic and arctic regions.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Biophysically, influenza virions are capable to:</p>
   <p>
    <list list-type="simple">
     <list-item>
      <label> </label>
      <p>survive freezing;</p>
     </list-item>
     <list-item>
      <label> </label>
      <p>persist viably in the frozen state until thawing occurs next year (or later);</p>
     </list-item>
     <list-item>
      <label> </label>
      <p>survive thawing;</p>
     </list-item>
     <list-item>
      <label> </label>
      <p>persist again in lake water until recontracted by waterfowl.</p>
     </list-item>
    </list>
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Portions of the virion population survive repeated cycles of freezing and thawing until eventually contracted by waterfowl.</p>
