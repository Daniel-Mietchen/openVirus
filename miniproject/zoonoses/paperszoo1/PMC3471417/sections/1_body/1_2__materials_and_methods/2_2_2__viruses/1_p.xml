<p>Two low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses, A/Northern pintail/Akita/714/06 H5N2 (Akita/714/06 H5N2) and A/Northern pintail/Aomori/395/04 H7N1 (Aomori/395/04 H7N1) [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], were used for longitudinal observations. The viruses were isolated from fecal materials of migratory, apparently healthy northern pintail (
 <italic>Anas acuta</italic>) ducks in Japan. The viruses were isolated in embryonated chicken eggs (ECE). Working stocks of viruses were prepared by the third passage in ECE, and allantoic fluid was harvested at 3 days after inoculation (dpi).
