<p>Before virus seeding, collected waters were checked twice in ECE and confirmed as negative for any haemagglutinating viruses. Allantoin fluid containing each of the viruses was diluted (1 : 5) with each of the three types of water and aliquot (500 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/tube). The waters seeded with viruses (thereafter referred to as sample) were then stored at −20° and −30°C. At each temperature six sets of sample (each virus in 3 types of water) were stored. Besides, allantoic fluids containing each of the two viruses (500 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/tube) were also stored at −80°C. Samples were taken at predefined interval for titration.
