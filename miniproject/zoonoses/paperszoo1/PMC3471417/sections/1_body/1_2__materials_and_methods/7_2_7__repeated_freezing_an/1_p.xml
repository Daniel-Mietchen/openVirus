<p>Seven months after seeding (which is roughly an average longevity of seasonal lake ice across the Tundra and Taiga), sample (two tubes) containing the H7N1 virus Aomori/395/04 seeded in fresh water and stored at −20°C was taken out and incubated at 10°C for 10 min to facilitate melting. Subsequent to melting, 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of sample from one tube was aliquot and kept on ice. The Rest of the samples (both tubes) were allowed to freeze at −20°C for 75 min. Subsequent to freezing, the sample was taken out again and allowed to melt, aliquot as mentioned, repeatedly up to 4 times. The samples were then prepared as mentioned above, except addition of 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>L 100x antibiotic instead of 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>L, and titrated as mentioned.
