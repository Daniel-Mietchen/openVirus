<p>For titration, each of the samples from each temperature was taken out and mixed with the equal volume (500 
 <italic>μ</italic>L for each tube) of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS pH7.2) supplemented with 100x antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and incubated at room temperature for 2 hrs. This gives the virus (virus in sample) dilution 1 : 10. Upon incubation, the sample was transferred into Eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 12000 ×g for 3 min. Allantoic fluid stored at −80°C also incubated at room temperature for 2 hrs.
