<p>The viruses were titrated monthly in Caco-2 cells supplemented with tosylamide phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-(TPCK-) treated bovine pancreatic trypsin (Sigma, USA), at the dose rate of 2 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL (final concentration) [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Titrations were done using standard protocol. Briefly, a 96-well tissue culture plate (Cellstar, Greiner Bio-one) was seeded with ~7 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well. To remove floating dead cells, at 100% confluent monolayer, cells were washed thrice with PBS (pH7.2) and finally replaced with serum-free medium (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/well) containing trypsin of 4 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. A 10-fold serial dilution of each of the sample was prepared with 2x serum free medium. After inoculation of cells with diluted samples (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/well, which brings trypsin concentration of 2 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and four wells for each dilution), the plate was incubated at 37°C for 3 days. Wells defined as negative control were inoculated with serum free medium. Presence of virus in the culture fluid was determined by haemagglutination test at 3 dpi, and the virus titer, namely, median tissue culture infection dose (log10 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>), was determined [
