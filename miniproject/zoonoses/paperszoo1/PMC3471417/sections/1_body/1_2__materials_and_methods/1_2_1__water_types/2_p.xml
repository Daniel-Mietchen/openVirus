<p>Water temperature, pH, and salinity at collection time are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>. These locations were chosen because migratory birds regularly (every winter) congregate and sojourn in these locations. This means water conditions were not harmful or deleterious for the birds, and, presumably, for the viruses concurrently circulated by the birds.
