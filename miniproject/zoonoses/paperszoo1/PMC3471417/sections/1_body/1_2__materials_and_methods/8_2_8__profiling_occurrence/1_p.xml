<p>Independently of the above, and in order to fundamentally examine the feasibility of viral genetic conservation taking place due to environmental cryopreservation, we profiled the occurrences of apparent protracted genetic conservation, in terms of literary observational data, with reference being made to a variety of IAV strains at large. “Protracted genetic conservation” is here methodologically regarded as such that represents a mutational rate lower than the minimal ordinary one, compatibly with the following, well-established empirical array. Mutational rate of IAVs has been established, empirically, at 0.001 to 0.007 per nucleotide per year, a variance attributed to different gene segments and different hosts [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Each gene resembles a biomolecular clock which indicates a regular genetic mutational drift, a delayed drift, or a dormant state. The validity of the biomolecular clock mechanism has been further demonstrated, instantly, for the NS and the HA genes within different host-related strains isolated from humans [

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], horses [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], pigs [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], wild ducks [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], domestic ducks [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and chickens [
