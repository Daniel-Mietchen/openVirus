<p>Inland, dabbling ducks reach most northern lakes and ponds via seasonal migration during summer, following the northerly progressing line of ice melting, until the end of August. Marine environments are less studied. Seagulls commonly host AIV and serve as origin of strains that infect seals and whales. Additional seabirds (Alcidae, at the rate of infectedness of 1.4%), and sea ducks (Anatidae, tribe Mergini, 0.7%), are known to host AIVs [

 <italic>Somateria mollissima</italic> and 
 <italic>S. spectabilis</italic>, resp.) are prevalent throughout the Arctic Ocean islands and coasts, even during wintertime, yet they associate with dabbling ducks across the arctic tundra lakes during summer, while breeding, and are thus exposed to freshwater viral strains, as well. Viral diversity and circulation are amplified by seals and whales. All in all, arctic sea water is continuously seeded with avian and mammalian influenza viruses. While immense virus dilution is caused by sea water, virus survival in the Arctic Ocean might be supported by very low water temperature and long-lasting ice.
