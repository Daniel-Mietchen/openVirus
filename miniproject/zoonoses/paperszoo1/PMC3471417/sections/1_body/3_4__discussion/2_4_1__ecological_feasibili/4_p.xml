<p>In Antarctica, AIVs were detected only serologically (in penguins [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]), but the Antarctic cryosphere should not be excluded as having, to a certain degree, a cryobiological role which is similar to the northern cryosphere, regarding the ecology of IAV. Antarctica, albeit the paucity of waterfowl found in it (only the southern pintail 
 <italic>Anas eatoni</italic> and speckled teal 
 <italic>A. flavirostris</italic>), is frequented by multiple seabirds—part of which hosts AIVs, potentially—and comprises (in difference of the Arctic Ocean) a huge land with many freezing-thawing freshwater bodies. Also, an interface between holarctic and antarctic aquatic birds exists and presumably introduces multiple AIVs into southern avifaunas. The arctic tern (
 <italic>Sterna paradisaea</italic>), a species known to host AIVs and migrate from pole to pole [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], conspicuously illustrates this apparatus.
