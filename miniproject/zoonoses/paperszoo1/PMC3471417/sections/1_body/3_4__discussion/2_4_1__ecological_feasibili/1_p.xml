<p>Biogeographically, the overall system of aquatic bird pathways forms a global mosaic that interconnects in effect any water body worldwide through the migration routes of innumerable species. As a result, throughout any whole given year (starting in spring), any current or ice-released AIV strain can in principle be conveyed between any two watery loci on Earth, by means of one avian host species, or, consecutively, more than one species. Therefore, in the long run, there exists a constant cycling of the biotic and abiotic pools of viruses. </p>
