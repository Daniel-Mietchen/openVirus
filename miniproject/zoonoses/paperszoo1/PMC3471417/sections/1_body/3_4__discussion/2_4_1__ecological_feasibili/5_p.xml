<p>In the present study, we used ordinary AIV strains isolated from typical migratory ducks that prevalently occupy ponds and lakes in Canada and Siberia each year from about April to October, thus following the ecological paradigm mentioned above. We therefore used surface water from freshwater lake and brackish water lake that are seasonally resided in by pintails (and other migratory ducks), as well as sea water, for comparison.</p>
