<p>Large portions of the entire cryosphere may be regarded and explored as chief IAV abiotic reservoir and supplier. The related viral inventory is hence fully conveyable, conceivably, thanks to the permanent presence of many influenza virus-permissive waterfowl, shorebirds, seabirds, and marine mammals (seals and whales) up to the northerly marginal ice zone. Moreover, they are mostly nomadic and therefore are readily capable of acting as effective disseminators of the virus strains.</p>
