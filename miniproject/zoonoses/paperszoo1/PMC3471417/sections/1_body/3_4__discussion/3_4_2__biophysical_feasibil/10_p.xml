<p>In conclusion, the more northerly a given aquatic biotope is located, the greater is the feasibility of the described cryobiological apparatus, because:
 <list list-type="simple">
  <list-item>
   <label> </label>
   <p>temperature of liquid water is closer to 0°C, thus lengthening survival of virions found in it;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <label> </label>
   <p>average temperature of ice is lower, hence more supportive;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <label> </label>
   <p>meteorologically, sunlight and UV radiation are further reduced during the period of frozen state (roughly from September to May) and viruses are thus less damaged;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <label> </label>
   <p>optically, ice diminishes the penetration of UV radiation (in comparison to liquid water):</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <label> </label>
   <p>larger portion of water freezes annually;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <label> </label>
   <p>larger portion of frozen water remains in the form of perennial ice.</p>
