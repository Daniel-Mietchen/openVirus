<p>In the present study, the main results presented are of the effect of storage in ice at −20°C and −30°C for 1–12 months. As expected, there is no much difference between 1 month and 12 months, much of the loss of viability taking place during the freezing and/or thawing process, with the duration of storage frozen having minimal effect. Biotic virus recirculation is much dependent, though, upon the viability of virus after thawing. Birds may not get infected immediately following the thawing of the ice, and whether the virus remains viable in close-to-freezing temperatures for many days in such waters is a vital property, then. AIVs are indeed prone to have that property particularly that the postthawing virus population is a derivative of the water-enduring prefreezing virus population. The findings are compatible with the proposed natural cryopreservation apparatus. We thereby showed that two ordinary avian strains—H5N2 and H7N1—isolated from a typically widespread migratory duck (northern pintail) proved appreciably stable during 12 months of frozen phase, with its three stages. It can be deduced that natural cryopreservation in perennial ice would be as supportive.</p>
