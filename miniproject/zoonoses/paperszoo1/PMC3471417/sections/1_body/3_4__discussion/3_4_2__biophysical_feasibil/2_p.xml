<p>Virus survival in environmental water is a prerequisite for subsequent frozen phase, and endurance in freshwater for months has indeed been evidenced. It was found that AIVs persist viably in freshwater, brackish water, and sea water, in converse correlation with temperature and salinity, for up to several months, usually [
