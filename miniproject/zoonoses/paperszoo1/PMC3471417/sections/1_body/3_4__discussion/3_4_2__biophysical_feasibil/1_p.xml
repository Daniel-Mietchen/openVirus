Viruses and bacteriophage (as prophage) frozen in glaciers can be preserved for over 100,000 years [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. As for influenza virus, the thermal amplitude is much more complex, since the virus has to be adaptable to body temperatures of mammals and birds—meaning from 37°C to 41°C—at the same time. A variety of RNA and DNA viruses hosted by homoeothermic species, including influenza viruses, were found to withstand experimental freezing, storing, and thawing—even cyclically (refrozen)—to appreciable or full degrees [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Specifically, the recovery rate of influenza A viruses, subsequent to experimental prolonged freezing and thawing, was shown to be marked [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. However, the viruses tested were human strains, whereas avian strains presumably constitute the natural, primarily ice-adaptable strains.
