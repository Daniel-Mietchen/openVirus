<p>Biophysically, the frozen phase is rather complex, since it actually includes three stages—freezing, frozen state, and thawing—each coped with by the virus. Viruses with lipid envelopes, such as influenza, are often less stable than nonenveloped viruses at ambient temperatures, but survive well at ultralow temperatures [

 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Specifically, it has been observed that the envelope of IAVs in general (as demonstrated in the strain ×31 Japan) is remarkably and uniquely stable with freezing and thawing, gradually solidifying from an oily fluid into a hardened gel, without sudden changes, while temperature is decreasing [
