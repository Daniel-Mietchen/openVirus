<p>One study monitored viable persistence of AIVs in experimentally frozen lake water, at −10°C. Viruses isolated from waterfowl (mallard, teal, and swan) were thus found to viably persist for 182 days (starting virus titer of 104.14/mL); 182 days (starting virus titer of 104.5/mL); 224 days (starting virus titer of 105.14/mL) [

Although virus viability was not assayed in the latter study, it was observed that these sediments could constitute a year-to-year reservoir of viruses, which serve to infect birds occupying the ponds [
