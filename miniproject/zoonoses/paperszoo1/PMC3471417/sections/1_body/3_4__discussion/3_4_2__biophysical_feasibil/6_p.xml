<p>Further, by electron cryomicroscopy, it was shown that the human IAV strain PR/8/34 in frozen state has two different sub-populations, one exhibiting high viability and composed of filamentous and small spherical virions, and another one exhibiting low viability and composed of large spherical virions. The envelopes of most of the filamentous and small spherical, viable virus particles showed a combination of a thin—hardened gel, probably—lipid monolayer (plus a thick protein-containing inner layer), while the envelopes of most of the large, nonviable virus particles comprised phospholipid bilayers (that did not harden, apparently) [
