<p>Moreover, we assayed one of the two avian strains that survived for 7 months at −20°C for further survivability under repeated freezing-thawing cycles, and it exhibited considerable endurance, which means, inferentially, that virions released from melting environmental ice and not contracted thereafter by an avian host until refreezing occurs would likely undergo further frozen phase, extending their endurance into another year.</p>
