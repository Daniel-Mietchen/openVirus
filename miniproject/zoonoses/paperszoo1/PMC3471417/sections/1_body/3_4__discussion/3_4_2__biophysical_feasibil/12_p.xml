<p>Besides, the parameters of salinity and sub-zero temperature are influential, both separately and in conjunction. In liquid water, the persistence of H5 and H7 AIVs was found inversely proportional to temperature and salinity, while significant interaction exists between the effects of temperature and salinity on the persistence, in that the effect of salinity is more prominent at lower temperatures [
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Our findings, in ice, demonstrate that while no difference in survivability due to varying salinity was observed in −20°C, markedly lower survivability was observed in −30°C as salinity was higher. The water cryodynamics property causing this variance is not clear, but is nevertheless significant since transitions from −20°C to −30°C are quite often in the Arctic and sub Arctic.
