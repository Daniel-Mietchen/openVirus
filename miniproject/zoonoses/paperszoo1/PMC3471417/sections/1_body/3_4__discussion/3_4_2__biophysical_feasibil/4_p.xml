<p>Notably, variation in cryotolerance and thermostability of influenza virus isolates begins at the level of virus population. While a given propagating population continuously shapes into more adaptable sub-populations through ongoing genetic changes, a given population undergoing an abiotic liquid or frozen phase cannot alter genetically during such phase. The latter population is therefore merely passively selected, while certain given sub-populations of it-which are more survivable in water or iceâ€”can endure. The presence of AIV sub-populations with high thermostability has indeed been pointed at, suggesting that avian viruses can persist in water longer than previously estimated [
