<p>The main purposes of this study are (1) to conceptualize that AIVs are capable to and probably do undergo and survive frozen state in various types of environmental water, which are naturally and regularly seeded with AIVs, while occupied by aquatic bird and thereby (2) to better comprehend the entire life cycle and evolution of AIVs, with its broad implications. Beyond the biophysical feasibility of such cryotolerance, the related components of ecological feasibility and genetic feasibility are vital, too, in that they are altogether interlinked and would hence conjunctively substantiate the paradigm posed in the present study. Therefore, those three feasibilities are herewith discussed in details, and each of them pertains to the characteristics and results of the present study.</p>
