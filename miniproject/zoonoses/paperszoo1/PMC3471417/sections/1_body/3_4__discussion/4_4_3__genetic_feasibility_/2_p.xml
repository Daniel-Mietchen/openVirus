<p>The present study highlights the hypothesis that authentic (namely, not artificially-produced, either knowingly or accidentally) protracted genetic conservation revealed in IAVs is mostly an outcome of preservation in environmental ice, considering that IAVs do not prevail in the form of latent infection. Empirically, protracted genetic conservation has repeatedly been observed in IAVs, both avian and mammalian (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>), and is significantly in support of the genetic feasibility of the mentioned hypothesis. For instance, the Eurasian porcine-originated NA and M genes of the recent pandemic H1N1 2009 strain exhibited protracted genetic conservation, alongside with whole genome-protracted conservation (around 20 years at least) recognized within 2% of various swine strains [
