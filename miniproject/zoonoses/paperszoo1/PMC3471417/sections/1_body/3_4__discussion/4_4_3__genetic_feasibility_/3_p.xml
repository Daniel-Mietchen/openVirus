<p>AIVs isolated by us during 4 years from pintail ducks wintering in Japan—including the two strains exhibiting marked cryotolerance in the present study—show persisting genotypic interhomology, which may result from virus preservation in lake ice in the ducks' Siberian breeding grounds [
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Further, we found that the NS gene of one of those isolates (H5N2) has 98.3% nucleotide homology with a H3N8 virus isolated from duck in 1972 in Chabarovsk, a Russian region lying aside the principal Siberian route of migratory waterfowl. [
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] Arithmetically, this means that for at least 11 years, the NS gene has been conserved, considering the ordinary minimal yearly mutational rate (
