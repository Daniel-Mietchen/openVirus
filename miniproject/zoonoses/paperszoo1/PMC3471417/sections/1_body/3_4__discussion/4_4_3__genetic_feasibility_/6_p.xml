<p>Temporally, abiotic virus preservation in annual (seasonal) ice may consume 33% of the time (4 out of 12 months per year, in the southern Tundra), and up to 83% (10 out of 12 months per year, in the northern Tundra). In accordance, during a decade, for instance, utmost discontinuous preservation taking place in such manner (not necessarily in the same lake) would accumulatively bring about genetic conservation of 40 to 100 months, respectively.</p>
