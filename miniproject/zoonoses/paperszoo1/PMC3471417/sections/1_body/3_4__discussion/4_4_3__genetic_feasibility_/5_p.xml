<p>Worobey strongly depreciated the possibility that evolutionary stasis—whether due to preservation in ice, or otherwise—takes place in effect within IAV [
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Contrastingly, however, Webster observed that influenza viruses perpetuated within aquatic bird populations do undergo evolutionary stasis, for already decades (to the least) [
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. This lasting equilibrium is interrupted only by the contraction of different strains harbored by nonaquatic birds [
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. At any rate, instead of primarily examining the actual feasibility, or evidencing infeasibility, of the proposed virus preservation in environmental ice, Worobey principally discredits such mechanism and concentrates, resultantly, on trying to repeatedly prove laboratory artifacts, contamination, outwards leakages, and alike—which are potentially important misleading factors, certainly, hence can endlessly serve for plausible argumentation, ostensibly—as true explanations for each and every finding of protracted gene/genome conservation. Thus, well-established phylogenetic paradigms of fully continuous evolution are used in order to negate any findings of such conservation, while in reality such findings are of course not intended to constitute an alternative paradigm, but a complementary one. Rather more objectively, findings of protracted influenza gene or genome conservations were elsewhere referred to as such that “may point to surprising new biology but are perhaps more readily explained by stock contamination or other errors in the sequencing laboratories” [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The issue, however, is not one of new biology, but an approach elucidating unusual findings through a feasible, mostly unnoticed natural mechanism—which is not supposed to replace existing concepts—rather than just considering such findings to be artifacts. Anyhow, it should be emphasized that although at least some, rather than none, of the various controversial findings of protracted genetic conservation can be regarded as reliable, they constitute at any rate but a secondary rationale for the present study. The primary and adequate rationale is the plain challenge to explore the feasibility-which is remarkably meaningful, potentially-that influenza virions commonly found in environmental freshwater (and, apparently, seawater) upon freezing are consequently preserved viably in the frozen state and thereafter released infectious from the melting ice. In case some of the protracted genetic conservation findings are valid, then they are significantly supportive of such feasibility, whereas even if none is valid, which is fairly improbable, this would not at all depreciate the cryobiological apparatus proposed here. In practical terms, a sound body of observational data and experimental findings obtained in our study and elsewhere, as detailed, altogether readily substantiates the cryobiological concept posed in the present study, and the related ecological, biophysical, and genetic feasibilities too are well compatible with that concept, as demonstrated.
