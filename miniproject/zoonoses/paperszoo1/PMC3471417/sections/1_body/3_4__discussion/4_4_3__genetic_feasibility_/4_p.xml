<p>A fairly comprehensive genomic study by Hayashida et al. led them—according to their findings, as detailed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>—to the general conclusion that “frozen replication is not a rare evolutionary event, but is reasonably expectable in influenza virus evolution” [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In practice, any duration of a genetic conservation (nonreplicative) phase can be attributed to preservation in environmental ice (particularly that global temperatures heighten). For instance, if a gene of an avian strain isolated in a certain year exhibits maximal nucleotide sequence homology to a gene of an avian strain isolated 30 years earlier, while the degree of homology arithmetically reflects mutational stasis of 10 years, it means that this gene was preserved in environmental ice for 10 years in total, either continuously or discontinuously, during those 30 years. Basically, the genetic conservation phase may last for thousands of years, and one can assume that such a frozen genetic inventory includes certain portions indicating the historical genomic evolution of IAVs, whether in the form of genetic material or viable virions.
