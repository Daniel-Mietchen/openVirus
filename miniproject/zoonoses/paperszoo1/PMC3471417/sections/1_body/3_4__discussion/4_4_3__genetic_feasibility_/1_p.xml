 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref> demonstrates that protracted genetic conservation occurs both at the level of gene segments and whole genomes. Indeed, due to the commonness of viral gene reassortments marking IAV, practically any IAV gene segment (though not any genome), whether mammalian- or avian-derived, can tentatively be contracted by migratory aquatic birds, and thereby disseminated and perpetuated worldwide [
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. As a result, virtually any viral gene (though not any genome) of IAV can undergo preservation in annual or perennial environmental ice, thereafter reappearing genetically conserved to an extent that cannot be accounted for by ongoing regular mutational clock. Since genetic reassortments may occur immediately after ice thawing and resultant recontraction of ice-released viruses by aquatic birds, single-gene segments showing such protracted genetic conservation are as representative of preservation in ice as entire genomes (with which they were necessarily affiliated at some point in the past).
