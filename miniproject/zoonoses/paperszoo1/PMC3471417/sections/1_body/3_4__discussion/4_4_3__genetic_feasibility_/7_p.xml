<p>Genetically, since influenza gene pool harbored by avian hosts includes human and porcine genes [
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], the proposed cryobiological apparatus principally allows for such genes as well to undergo the same course and thereafter be contracted by aquatic birds and conveyed onto poultry and pig farms. Intact avian influenza genomes too are most probably prone to resurface and recirculate in that fashion. Perennial preservation in ice may basically last for few up to thousands of years and can thus significantly affect evolutionary, epizootical, and pandemic mechanisms.
