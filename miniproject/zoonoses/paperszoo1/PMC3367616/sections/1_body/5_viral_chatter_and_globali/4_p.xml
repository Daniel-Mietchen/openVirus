<p>One of the crucial questions in disease emergence is: What environmental or evolutionary changes cause the R
 <sub>0</sub> of wildlife viruses to rise above 1 in human populations? In mathematical models for density-dependent transmission, 
 <italic>R
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic> is proportional to host density, so that there is a critical threshold of human population density (known as the threshold density, N
 <sub>T</sub>), below which a pathogen will fade to extinction. Increasing densities of human populations in urban centers close to bushmeat hunting areas and the increasing rates of movement of people between village, town, and city, will increase 
 <italic>R
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic> and the risk for new epidemic zoonoses. Alternatively, changes to human behavior that increase the transmission of viruses between people (e.g., sexual contact, injected drug use, or fluid contact by means of medical procedures) will increase 
 <italic>R
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic> and may also assist in driving their emergence.
