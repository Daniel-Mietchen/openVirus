<p>Monkeypox and Nipah viruses are examples of the second stage towards global emergence. These viruses have shown limited human-to-human transmission in a number of relatively small epidemics before fading out (

 <italic>R
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic>), which measures a pathogen's ability to cause an outbreak. 
 <italic>R
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic> is the number of secondary cases in a population caused by a single case, assuming that all other members are susceptible (

  <italic>8</italic>
 </xref>). When 
 <italic>R
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic> is &gt;1, the pathogen will amplify within a population and cause an outbreak. In the environmental conditions in which monkeypox and Nipah viruses emerged, 
 <italic>R
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic> was &lt;1, and ultimately the epidemics faded out (
