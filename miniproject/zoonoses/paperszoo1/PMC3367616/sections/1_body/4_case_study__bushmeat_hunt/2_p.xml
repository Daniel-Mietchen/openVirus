<p>A key factor driving the bushmeat trade in Cameroon is the large and growing urban demand for bushmeat in conjunction with the opening up of logging concessions in the East Province. The construction of the World Bank–funded Yaoundé–Douala truck road in the mid-1980s and the European Union–funded extension of this road to the border of the timber-rich East Province in 1992 dramatically reduced the cost of extracting timber and increased access to these areas for bushmeat hunters. One of the most important non-timber forest product activities within this region is the poaching of bushmeat by market hunters. The bushmeat market among households for sauce preparation in Yaoundé alone is estimated at ≈$4 million annually (International Institute of Tropical Agriculture [IITA], unpub. data). A recently conducted consumption study showed that bushmeat plays an important dietary role among poor households and is not a luxury product eaten mainly by the rich. Across income classes, the poorest 2 quantiles spent 16% and 17%, respectively, of their meat budgets on bushmeat versus 7% for the richest quantile and 9% overall (IITA, unpub. data). Finally, our work in Cameroon has shown that not only bushmeat hunters but also persons who keep various species of vertebrate pets or butcher and handle meat are at risk for zoonotic transmission due to bites, cuts, and other exposures to fluids or tissue (
