<p>Neutralising antibodies to LBV were detected at a dilution of &gt;1∶9 in 1 of 72 samples (bat #352). This result was confirmed using the pseudotype assay, where neutralisation was observed at a dilution of &gt;1∶80. An additional two samples showed weak neutralisation to LBV pseudotype particles (1∶20), and no samples neutralised WCBV, DUVV.131 or MOKV.NIG68-RV4.</p>
