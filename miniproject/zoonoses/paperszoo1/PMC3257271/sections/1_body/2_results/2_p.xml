<p>Consistent with previous studies in Ghana 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Hayman2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and in continental Africa (unpublished data), Luminex binding MFIs were higher against NiV than HeV in all samples above background levels. We interpret this as a greater cross-reactivity (and presumably relatedness) between African henipaviruses (or henipavirus-like viruses) and NiV, than with HeV. For this reason, although the full set of results is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0030346.s001">Table S1</xref>, the data discussed below refer to NiV only. In a previous study 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Hayman2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, three times the average MFI of negative bat sera was used as a threshold for positive reactivity for the binding assay and samples with an MFI&gt;200 were considered positive. Here, 51% of Annobónese samples had MFI values&lt;200, and the remaining samples ranged in MFI from 200–2055 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030346-g004">Figure 4</xref>). While adult individuals displayed a wide range of MFI values (6 – 2056), values for individuals from younger age classes were restricted within a lower range of MFIs. For example, 16/19 individuals in the youngest age class (8 months) had MFI values of &lt;200, and the highest MFI was only 629 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030346-g005">Figure 5</xref>). A similar pattern was seen in the 20 month age class (including primiparous individuals), where 6/10 individuals had MFIs under 200, and the maximum was 1188 (Bat # 331). Luminex inhibition assay results were in agreement with binding results (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0030346.s001">Table S1</xref>). No significant differences in MFI values were observed between males and females overall, or between the sexes within age classes (p&gt;0.05, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030346-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Of 69 samples with sufficient plasma to enable testing by VNT, one sample (#331) neutralised HeV at 1∶40 dilution and NiV at 1∶80 dilution. Presence of antibodies was confirmed using western blot analyses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030346-g007">Figure 7</xref>) in 7 of 11 samples tested using this method. Reactivity to the recombinant NiV nucleocapsid protein, varied among positive samples from strong (#302, 353) to intermediate (#301, 331, 317, 323, 328). All bats with positive results in western blot analyses were adults, except for bat #331, a primiparous female.
