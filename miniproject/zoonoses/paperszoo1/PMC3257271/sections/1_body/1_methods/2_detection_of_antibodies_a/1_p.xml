<p>Antibodies against henipaviruses (Hendra and Nipah viruses, HeV and NiV) were initially detected using Luminex multiplexed binding assays as previously described 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Hayman2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Bossart1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Briefly, recombinant HeV and NiV glycoproteins were conjugated to internally coloured and distinguishable microspheres, allowing multiplexing. Antibody binding to each microsphere was detected after conjugation of bound antibodies with biotinylated Protein A and fluorescent streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin. Binding results are given as median fluorescence intensities (MFI) of at least 100 microspheres for each virus type. Samples were further analysed using Luminex inhibition assays and virus neutralisation tests (VNTs) as previously described 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Hayman2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Bossart1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. VNTs were undertaken at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL).
