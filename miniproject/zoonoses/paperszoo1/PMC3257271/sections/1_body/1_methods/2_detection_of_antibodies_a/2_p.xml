<p>Western blot analysis was performed on 11 sera with the highest MFI values in the binding assays (&gt;750) using a purified recombinant NiV nucleocapsid protein 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Briefly, 50 µg of protein was electrophoresed on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. The protein was electroblotted overnight onto a nitrocellulose membrane which prior to this had been blocked in 5% skim milk powder (SMP) and subsequently cut into strips. The strips were then incubated for 1h with individual sera (diluted 1∶50 in 5% SMP). Polyclonal rabbit sera raised against the recombinant protein (1∶2000) as well as known NiV neutralising 
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> bat sera (1∶50) were used as positive controls. Strips were washed and then incubated for 1h with Protein A/G conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Thermo-Fisher Scientific Inc., USA). Strips were washed and then allowed to develop in the presence of alkaline phosphatase reagents for 15 minutes. The marker used was Benchmark prestained protein ladder (Invitrogen, UK).
