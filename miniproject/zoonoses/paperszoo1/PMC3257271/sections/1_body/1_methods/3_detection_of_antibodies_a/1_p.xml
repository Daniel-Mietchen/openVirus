<p>Antibodies against LBV (LBV.NIG56-RV1) were detected using a modified Fluorescent Antibody Virus Neutralisation (mFAVN) test, with positive and negative controls, as previously described 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Hayman1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Brookes1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Confirmatory testing was undertaken on a subset of 2 positive and 16 negative mFAVN samples using a lentivirus pseudovirus neutralisation assay which had been previously validated against the mFAVN for 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> plasma

 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Wright2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In this study, assays were multiplexed with two viruses per assay LBV (as above) + Mokola virus (MOKV.NIG68-RV4) and Duvenhage virus (DUVV.RV131) + West Caucasian Bat Virus (WCBV) 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. All samples were analysed in duplicate in both assays.
