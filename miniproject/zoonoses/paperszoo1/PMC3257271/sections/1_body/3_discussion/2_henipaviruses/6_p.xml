<p>The presence of other bat species might also contribute to virus persistence on Annobón. There is only one record of another bat species being present on the island (the Mauritian tomb bat, 
 <italic>Taphozous mauritianus</italic>), a species which has a widespread distribution across Africa, similar to that of 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic>
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Juste2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. However, 
 <italic>T. mauritianus</italic> has not been observed in subsequent surveys in Annobón, and if it is still present on the island, appears extremely unlikely to be contributing to henipavirus persistence in 
 <italic>E. helvum annobonensis</italic>.
