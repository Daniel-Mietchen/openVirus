<p>An alternative hypothesis is that there is persistence of henipavirus infection within individuals with recrudescence, such as during times of stress or breeding. The related HeV in Australia has the ability to persist and fatally recrudesce in both horses 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Payne1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and humans 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-OSullivan1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. NiV has also been shown to recrudesce as encephalitis in humans from several months to as long as 4 years after the initial infection 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, and could also have this ability in bats in Malaysia 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Sohayati1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Rahman1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, but population-level studies are lacking. Whilst henipavirus antibodies and virus have been detected in island fruit bats in Asia 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Chua1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Breed1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, study species were either in contact with migratory species or of sufficient proximity to the mainland or larger island populations that they cannot be considered isolated from the metapopulation as a whole 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Epstein1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Breed2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. The presence of previously-infected bats in the very small population on the most isolated island, Annobón, may provide evidence from wild bat populations for viral persistence within individuals, with recrudescence as a mechanism for population-level persistence. More information on, for example, henipavirus pathogenesis in 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic>, within-host viral dynamics and immune responses to henipaviruses is needed to clarify this. Longitudinal serological surveys of the bats on Annobón would enable further interpretation of data and the investigation of factors currently hypothesised as important for virus persistence on the island.
