<p>It is unclear how soon 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> arrived on Annobón island after it was formed 4.8 Mya. No known records exist as to whether 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> bats were present on the islands at the time of Portuguese colonisation in the late 15th century, however the degree of genetic and morphological differentiation present in 
 <italic>E. helvum annobonensis</italic> is indicative of independent colonisation by the bats prior to this time. In the absence of viral sequences from Annobón, it is not possible to conclude whether henipa- or henipa-like viruses demonstrated here were introduced to Annobón at the time of 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> colonisation, or by rare dispersal events. Support for the former lies in the long evolutionary history between fruit bats and henipaviruses

 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Halpin3" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, but is dependent on whether future experimental studies are able to demonstrate further evidence for individual-level persistence and recrudescence as a mechanism for population-level persistence.
