 <italic>E. helvum</italic> is known for its close contact with human populations in continental Africa 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Kamins1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, and this is also the case on Annobón, where bats and pigs feed on fruit trees within the main town, Palé. A recent study by our group demonstrated antibodies against henipaviruses in a sample of domestic pigs in Ghana 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Hayman4" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Our results, therefore, could have important public health implications, but more information is required on the viruses involved, their infection dynamics within the bat populations, potential spillover routes, and bat population dynamics before any risk can be assessed. Challenging transport and working conditions in this remote setting precluded the gathering of reliable viral molecular data; this will be the focus of future sampling trips.
