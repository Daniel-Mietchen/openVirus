<p>Multiple studies have identified 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> as reservoirs of henipaviruses and lyssaviruses in continental Africa. After the original isolation of LBV in 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> in Nigeria 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Boulger1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, it has subsequently been isolated from this species in Senegal and Kenya 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Kuzmin1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Pasteur1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and LBV antibodies have been reported in 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> populations in Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Kuzmin1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Hayman1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Dzikwi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Antibodies against henipaviruses and against henipavirus-like viral RNA have been detected in 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> in mainland Africa 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Drexler1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Hayman2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. This is outside the range of 
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> fruit bats, the established reservoir hosts of henipaviruses 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Halpin1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. HeV has been isolated from bats in Australia 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Halpin1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and NiV from bats in south east Asia 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Chua1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, however an African henipavirus has not yet been isolated. Our morphological analyses are consistent with earlier studies, highlighting the distinctiveness and isolation of 
 <italic>E. helvum annobonensis</italic>. The results presented here raise intriguing questions on viral maintenance in small, isolated populations.
