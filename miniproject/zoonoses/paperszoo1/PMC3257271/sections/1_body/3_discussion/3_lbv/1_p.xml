<p>One adult male bat (# 352) demonstrated neutralising antibodies to LBV using the gold standard mFAVN and a validated lentiviral pseudotype assay. This observation adds to the numerous reports of the presence of lyssavirus neutralising antibodies in otherwise-healthy bats (as reviewed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Banyard1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>). In contrast to bat #331, there was nothing about this individual's morphology to suggest that it may have been an immigrant. With a single positive individual, evidence for the presence of LBV in this isolated population of 
 <italic>E. helvum annobonensis</italic> is unclear, and the contrast with reports of LBV seroprevalences of circa 40% in 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> populations in other regions of Africa is marked. These data suggest that this population of 
 <italic>E. helvum annobonensis</italic> is refractory to LBV infection, that mixing of 
 <italic>E. helvum annobonensis</italic> with mainland 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> is sufficiently rare to prevent inter-population transmission of LBV, or that the population is too small to support persistent transmission.
