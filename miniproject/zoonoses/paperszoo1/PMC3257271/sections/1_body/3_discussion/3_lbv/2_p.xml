<p>While lyssavirus prevalence is usually low in bat populations (&lt;4%), seroprevalence is often much higher (e.g. up to 70% for rabies in Brazilian free-tailed bats,

 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Banyard1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. The extended incubation periods known to exist for lyssaviruses may provide a mechanism that allows LBV persistence within isolated populations, by avoiding fade-out before new susceptibles are provided by the seasonal birth pulse. Natural and experimental studies on lyssavirus transmission, pathogenesis and serological response in bats, however, have produced highly variable intra- and inter-study results (as reviewed by 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Banyard1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>) and further studies are required.
