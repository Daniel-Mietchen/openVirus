<p>Reservoir host population size and density play a critical role in the ability of a species to maintain viruses that cause acute or immunising infections, reflected through epidemiological principles such as the critical community size (CCS) and the effective reproductive number (R
 <sub>eff</sub>). The CCS is a theoretical population threshold describing the minimum number of individuals in a population required for virus persistence 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Bartlett1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. It is unrealistic to consider this threshold absolute; rather it should be viewed as ‘the host population size above which stochastic fadeout of a disease over a given period is less probable than not’ 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-LloydSmith1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Typically, pathogens causing acute immunising infections require large host population sizes to maintain an adequate supply of susceptible individuals to maintain transmission 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Holmes1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, unless birth rates are very high. Also important in shaping pathogen transmission dynamics is host population density, via its effect on R
 <sub>eff</sub>: the expected number of secondary infections that arise from each primary infection in a partially immune population 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-LloydSmith1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Together, these factors mean that host species which exist in large population sizes and in high densities are capable of acting as reservoirs for a greater number of viruses than smaller, low density populations
