<p>In addition to its widespread continental distribution, 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> exists on a small number of off-shore islands, including those in the Gulf of Guinea: Bioko, Príncipe, São Tomé and Annobón

Although all four islands are part of the Cameroon volcanic chain, Bioko was previously connected to the mainland via a land bridge, while Príncipe, São Tomé and Annobón formed independently 31, 13 and 4.8 million years ago, respectively

 <italic>E. helvum</italic> population on Annobón is significantly smaller in body size than populations on the nearest islands or on continental Africa. Additionally, allozyme analyses identified corresponding genetic differentiation, with the rate of gene flow between Annobón and other islands or continental populations approaching the minimum required for independent divergence by random drift 
 <xref rid="pone.0030346-Juste1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In fact, Annobón's geographic isolation has resulted in sufficient genetic differentiation of 
 <italic>E. helvum</italic> on the island for its designation as a separate subspecies, 
 <italic>E. helvum annobonensis</italic>
