<p>The first vaccine discovered in modern times was in 1798 by Britain's Edward Jenner, who found that cowpox administered as an inoculum could prevent smallpox 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002808-Bazin1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>; the term vaccine is derived from 
 <italic>vacca</italic>, the Latin term for “cow”. Because smallpox produced such devastating and massive killer epidemics (especially among indigenous populations in the New World), the first vaccine almost immediately attained international acclaim in the first years of the 19th century

For example, from 1800 to 1805, Jenner corresponded widely and internationally and advised countries as diverse as Russia, Spain, and Turkey and Native American tribes and nations in Canada and Mexico on how to prepare and administer the smallpox vaccine

Among the earliest examples of vaccine diplomacy, in 1801 Dr. Edward Gantt, the chaplain of the US Congress, vaccinated Native American diplomats who were visiting Washington, D.C., and in 1803 the Lewis and Clark Expedition was provided smallpox vaccine intended for Native Americans living on the western frontier, although it is unclear if successful vaccinations were actually performed

 <xref rid="pntd.0002808-Bazin1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Jenner was honored in France and wrote in a letter to the National Institute of France that “the sciences are never at war,” while Napoleon was supposed to have once stated, “Jenner—we can't refuse that man anything”
