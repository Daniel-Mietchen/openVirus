<p>Vaccine science diplomacy entered its golden age during the Cold War between the US and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Between 1956 and 1959, Dr. Albert Sabin from the US traveled to the USSR and collaborated with his Soviet virology counterparts, including Dr. Mikhail Chumakov, to develop a prototype oral polio vaccine and test it on 10 million Soviet children and ultimately 100 million people under the age of 20

Similarly, between 1962 and 1966, the USSR pioneered a freeze-drying technique for smallpox vaccine and provided 450 million doses of vaccine to support global smallpox eradication campaigns in developing countries, while the US provided key financial support

Later, in the 1980s and following the visit of US Nobel Laureate Fred Robbins to India, the Indo-US Vaccine Action Program (VAP) was established to foster international collaboration in the areas of epidemiology, laboratory investigation, and vaccine clinical trials, quality control, and delivery
