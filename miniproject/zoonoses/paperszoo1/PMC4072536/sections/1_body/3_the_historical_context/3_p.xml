<p>The next set of vaccines, including a new rabies vaccine, was developed almost one hundred years later by France's Louis Pasteur.

Around this time (from 1892–1897), Dr. Waldemar Haffkine, a Jewish scientist from Ukraine working in France and Switzerland, traveled to India in order to inoculate tens of thousands of people with his prototype cholera and plague vaccines, but he did so only after first testing the vaccines on himself
