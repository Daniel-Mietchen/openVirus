<p>Among the initiatives relevant to vaccine diplomacy in the 21st century are international efforts to ensure universal or equitable access for low- and middle-income countries to urgently needed vaccines for diseases of pandemic potential. It was noted that many developing countries were on the “outside looking in” when it came to having access to influenza vaccines, including the vaccine for the H1N1 pandemic influenza in 2009 and prototype H5N1 avian influenza vaccines

 <xref rid="pntd.0002808-Fidler4" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. As a result, Indonesia went through a period in which it refused to share timely influenza surveillance data with the WHO 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002808-Fidler3" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. It was noted that IHR 2005 did not adequately spell out provisions on providing equitable access for vaccines 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002808-Fidler4" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, and it was probably not intended for this purpose. In 2009, an Intergovernmental Meeting (IGM) was held on pandemic influenza preparedness as a means to establish a framework for sharing influenza and other vaccines with developing countries

Issues of developing country access again arose when cholera emerged in sub-Saharan Africa and Haiti; there was no mechanism to rapidly mobilize cholera vaccine, and calls went out to stockpile cholera vaccine as a humanitarian and diplomatic resource 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002808-Waldor1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Also, in 2008 when yellow fever vaccine supplies were depleted during the first urban yellow fever outbreak in the Americas in decades, countries neighboring Paraguay helped to ensure that the vaccine was made available in that country 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002808-Andrus1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. In 2012, following the earlier launch of the Decade of Vaccines Collaboration 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002808-Decade1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) was endorsed by the 194 Member States of the World Health Assembly as “a framework to prevent millions of deaths by 2020 through more equitable access to existing vaccines for people in all communities” 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002808-World2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. A World Health Assembly resolution was adopted that recognizes access to vaccines as a fundamental right to human health 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002808-World3" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. The diplomatic community was also called on to address critical issues of noncompliance for polio and other vaccines intended for vulnerable populations living in Islamic countries. In 2003, a boycott of polio vaccinations in three northern Nigerian states from fears that the vaccine was contaminated with antifertility drugs (in order to sterilize Muslim girls) necessitated diplomatic intervention from the Government of Malaysia and the OIC 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002808-Kaufmann2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Similar interventions are now required in Pakistan, where the Taliban and other extremist groups have assassinated vaccinators and other aid workers 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002808-Scientific1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Some assassinations may have been carried out in retaliation for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)'s alleged role in establishing a fake vaccination campaign in Abbottabad, Pakistan, as a ruse in order to confirm the identity of members of Osama bin Laden's family 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002808-Shah1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Such activities represent a significant setback to vaccine diplomacy.
