<p>A subset of vaccine diplomacy is vaccine science diplomacy, which is a hybrid of elements of global health diplomacy and science diplomacy. I use the term “vaccine science diplomacy” narrowly to refer to the joint development of life-saving vaccines and related technologies, with the major actors typically scientists. Of particular interest, the scientists may be from two or more nations that often disagree ideologically or even from nations that are actively engaged in hostile actions. This definition is along the lines of what Katz et al. would call informal global health diplomacy based on peer-to-peer scientific interactions
