The power of vaccine and vaccine science diplomacy has been underexplored despite a noble track record that included promoting peace between the Cold War powers of the 1950s and 1960s, which also led to the development, testing, and delivery of two of the most important 20th century health interventions, i.e., the freeze-dried smallpox vaccine and oral polio vaccine, and the resulting global eradication of smallpox and near elimination of polio. The historical lessons from these accomplishments still have critical relevance to global health and blue marble health.
