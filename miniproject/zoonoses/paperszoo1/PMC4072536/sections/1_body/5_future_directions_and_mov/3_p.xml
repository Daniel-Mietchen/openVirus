<p>Our Sabin Vaccine Institute and Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development (Sabin), a nonprofit product development partnership (PDP) that uses industry practices to develop and test neglected disease vaccines, could occupy a key niche in vaccine diplomacy. Sabin's vaccine portfolio targets neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) that specifically affect the poorest people living in low- and middle-income countries. Because NTDs have been shown to promote poverty through their adverse effects on worker productivity, the health of girls and women, and child development, the vaccines under development at Sabin are sometimes referred to as the “antipoverty vaccines”

Furthermore, both cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis have emerged as the most significant infections arising in settings of ongoing conflict, with the former affecting hundreds of thousands of people in Syria and Syrian refugees, while the latter was the leading killer in the war between northern and southern Sudan during the 1980s and 1990s

Some of these diseases are also widespread in some Latin American countries where leaders have expressed varying degrees of anti-American sentiment. While Sabin is currently conducting joint vaccine development with public-sector vaccine manufacturers in Brazil and Mexico, it is ready to embark on joint vaccine development with countries such as Cuba, Indonesia, and Iran, i.e., nations with either strained or even overtly hostile foreign relations with the US in past and recent years. As a form of projecting soft power with both allies and potential adversaries, such activities are consistent with what former Secretary Hillary Clinton termed “civilian power”
