<p id="par0040">The reproduction number, 
 <italic>R</italic>, which measures the average number of secondary cases from each infected person, is a useful metric for assessing the transmission potential of an emerging pathogen such as MERS-CoV (
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Lloyd-Smith et al., 2009</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Wolfe et al., 2007</xref>). If 
 <italic>R</italic>  &lt; 1 then infections occur in isolated clusters as self-limited chains of transmission, and persistence of the disease requires continued animal-to-human infections (
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Anderson and May, 1991</xref>). When averaged over all reported cases, two recent studies have estimated an overall 
 <italic>R</italic> (denoted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>overall</sub>) to be in a range of 0.42–0.92 (
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Breban et al., 2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Cauchemez et al., 2014</xref>), thus diminishing the concern of MERS-CoV epidemic spread. In contrast, when 
 <italic>R</italic> is evaluated for just the index cases originating from animal-to-human transmission, estimates (denoted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>) can be as high as 1.5 (
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Cauchemez et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that epidemic spread is possible.
