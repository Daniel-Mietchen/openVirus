<p id="par0045">In order to implement effective surveillance and control measures, it is important to understand the reason for the difference in inferred values of

 <sub>overall</sub> and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>. One possibility is that secondary (human-to-human) cases transmit less than index cases, either because of intrinsic biological differences, or because of less effective control measures for index cases relative to secondary cases. A second possibility is that the transmission potential of index and secondary cases is similar, but many weakly transmitting index cases are unobserved. The tendency to identify and report larger clusters (whose index case cause a higher than average number of new cases) would lead to an overestimation of
