<p id="par0050">To gain perspective on the troublesome wide range of 
 <italic>R</italic> estimates straddling the epidemic threshold of 1 associated with the 2013 outbreak of MERS-CoV, we develop a stochastic transmission model that distinguishes the transmission of index cases from secondary cases and incorporates different reporting scenarios for index cases. In order to relate case observation to disease severity we also distinguish cases that are sick enough to become hospitalized from those who are treated entirely in the community. We use a Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo estimation technique to match our model with observed MERS-CoV 2013 case data, provide estimates of the reproduction number, and revisit earlier estimates (
