 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Alagaili et al., 2014</xref>). Meanwhile, there is considerable uncertainty about the extent of human-to-human transmission and it is unclear whether MERS-CoV has the potential for epidemic spread. Transmission appears limited among family members but may be amplified in health care settings (

 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Breban et al., 2013</xref>). An understanding of the MERS-CoV epidemiology and transmission pathways are critically needed to devise effective surveillance, prevention and control strategies.
