<p id="par0200">Based on our model, we estimate that a 20% reduction in the transmissibility of hospitalized cases would decrease the total number of secondary cases by 27%, and an 80% reduction in hospital transmission would decrease the number of secondary cases by 72%. By contrast, a 20% and 80% reduction in community transmission would only lead to a 12% and 28% reduction in numbers of secondary cases, respectively.</p>
