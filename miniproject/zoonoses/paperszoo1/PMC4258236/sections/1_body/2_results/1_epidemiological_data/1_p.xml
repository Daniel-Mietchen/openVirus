<p id="par0175">The course of the MERS-CoV outbreak in Saudi Arabia from April-8 to October-31, 2013, can be reconstructed from reported and imputed dates of symptom onset (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). Of the 122 reported MERS-CoV cases during this period, 58 cases were putatively associated with exposure from a yet to be identified MERS-CoV reservoir source, and hence considered ‘index cases’. The remaining 64 cases were epidemiologically linked to an earlier case and hence classified as secondary cases. Of the 64 secondary cases, 47 were symptomatic and 17 did not exhibit symptoms. Of the 47 secondary symptomatic cases, 35 were linked to nosocomial transmission (hospital-based secondary cases in our terminology).
