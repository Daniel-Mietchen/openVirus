<p id="par0180">Convergence of our MERS-CoV transmission model fit was excellent for both the surveillance bias and differential transmission scenarios, as indicated by the corresponding Geweke indices (
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The average daily rate of MERS–CoV spillover events was estimated at 0.5 (95% CI: 0.36, 0.63) cases a day for the ‘surveillance-bias’ scenario A. The spillover rate estimate was somewhat lower under the ‘differential transmission’ scenario B, with

 <italic>β</italic> and 
 <italic>l</italic> values in 
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, our simulation study revealed a significant negative correlation between these parameters (Spearman rho = −0.96, 
 <italic>P</italic>  &lt; 0.001), which precluded a reliable identification of these two parameters from data. Nevertheless, we were able to find reasonably well-bounded estimates of
