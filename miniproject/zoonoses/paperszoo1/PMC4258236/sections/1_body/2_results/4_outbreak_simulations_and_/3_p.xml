<p id="par0215">Under the ‘differential transmission’ scenario, although reproduction number estimates were more dependent on various assumptions about the natural history of disease, endemic transmission remained improbable since

 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> ranged from 0.72 to 2.46. For index cases the ratio of the contribution of hospital-based to community-based transmission to the reproduction number ranged from 2.4 to 4.4 while the percentage contribution of hospital-based transmission ranged from 69.4% to 84.0%. A similar contribution of hospital-based transmission to the reproduction number of secondary cases was obtained. Geweke convergence statistics showed excellent convergence for all estimated parameters in sensitivity analyses (average &gt;0.95).
