<p id="par0205">Overall, the extrapolated daily curves of cumulative symptomatic cases followed closely the surveillance bias model's predicted uncertainty bounds except for the early part of the study period when a substantial number of secondary cases were reported, in association with the large hospital outbreak (
 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> ). Based on the ‘surveillance bias’ scenario, we estimated that a total of 98 spillover cases (95% CI: 81–119) and 86 secondary cases (95% CI: 42–132) occurred during our study period, so that only 59% of index cases and 55% of secondary cases were symptomatic cases reported through active surveillance. These results are in line with the original assumption of unbalanced detection probability between index and secondary cases. For illustration,
