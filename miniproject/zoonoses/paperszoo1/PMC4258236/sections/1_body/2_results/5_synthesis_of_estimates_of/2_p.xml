 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Cauchemez et al. (2014)</xref> use a similar method, but more data, to produce a 95% confidence interval of 0.47–0.85 for 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>overall</sub>. However, they also utilize an additional technique that incorporates data on the specific timing of cases (but assumes perfect observation of cases) to infer two separate 95% confidence intervals for 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> that span 0.67–1.50. Based on the approach of taking the observed data at face-value these prior results are best compared to our differential transmission scenario.
