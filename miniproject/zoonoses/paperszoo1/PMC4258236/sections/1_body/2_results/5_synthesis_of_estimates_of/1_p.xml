 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Breban et al. (2013)</xref> use an inference method that assumes the transmission of index cases is similar to the transmission of secondary cases to produce two estimates of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>overall</sub>. Two separate estimates for 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>overall</sub> (0.60 and 0.69) are reported based on whether ambiguously classified cases are favored to be primary or secondary cases. When these estimates are combined, the 95% confidence interval for these reproduction numbers spans 0.42–0.92. In their model, the inferred value for 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> is also 0.42–0.92, because no distinction between 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>overall</sub> is made.
