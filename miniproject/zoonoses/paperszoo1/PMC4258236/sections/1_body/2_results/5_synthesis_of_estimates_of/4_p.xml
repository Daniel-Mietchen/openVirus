 <xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). First, although some of the models include the possibility that 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>  &gt; 1, none of them suggest that 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>overall</sub>  &gt; 1. This argues against the possibility that MERS-CoV is self-sustaining in humans. Rather, continual introduction from a non-human reservoir is needed for persistence. However, because some models predict 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>  &gt; 1, it is unclear whether the lack of endemic spread is due to effective control interventions or intrinsically weak human-to-human transmissibility. Second, when observation bias is incorporated into parameter estimation, the range of possible values for both 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>overall</sub> shift to smaller values. This may appear counter-intuitive because the existence of unobserved cases might suggest that transmission was under-estimated previously. This apparent paradox is a result of our assumption that asymptomatic index cases (rather than secondary cases) are the least likely to be observed.
