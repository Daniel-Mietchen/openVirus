<p id="par0075">To reflect uncertainty in the observation process of MERS-CoV cases, we considered two epidemiological scenarios. In a ‘surveillance bias’ scenario (scenario A), we assume that index and secondary cases have similar transmission properties, but only the hospitalized index cases are detected (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). This scenario assumes the reason all observed index cases required hospitalization is that the observation process is flawed and can only detect severe index cases. In a ‘differential-transmission’ scenario (scenario B), we assume that all index cases develop severe disease, require hospitalization, and thus contribute more to the overall transmission process than a typical secondary case (
