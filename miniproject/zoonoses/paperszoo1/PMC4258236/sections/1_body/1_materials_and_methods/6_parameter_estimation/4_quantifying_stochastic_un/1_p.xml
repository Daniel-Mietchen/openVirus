<p id="par0165">We reconstructed the stochastic uncertainty in the outbreak progression (number of spillover and human-to-human transmission events) by parametric bootstrapping in order to generate conservative uncertainty bounds for parameters. Specifically we simulated 200 epidemic realizations of our best-fit MERS-CoV transmission model (

 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">Gustafsson and Sternad, 2007</xref>). We then estimated model parameters for each of the 200 stochastic outbreak realizations by the MCMC approach described above and used the distribution of estimated parameter values to construct 95% confidence intervals. Parameter convergence for each of the 200 runs was assessed by the Geweke diagnostic method (
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">Geweke, 1992</xref>). This “hybrid” estimation approach allowed us to accomplish two goals: (1) estimate conservative parameter uncertainty bounds and (2) assess identifiability of model parameters.
