<p id="par0055">Our analysis focuses on the progression of the MERS-CoV outbreak in Aprilâ€“October 2013, a period when pro-active surveillance was in place in Saudi Arabia (
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Memish et al., 2014</xref>), the country where most cases have been reported thus far. The beginning of our study period coincides with the onset of a large hospital outbreak on April 8, 2013 (
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Assiri et al., 2013a</xref>), which prompted an increase in the incidence of MERS-CoV case reports in the country (

 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">Penttinen et al., 2013</xref>), resulting in a steady case detection rate (
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Memish et al., 2014</xref>) and a balanced male-female ratio. Our study period ends in October 2013 so that our estimates can be compared with earlier studies focused on the early phase of the MERS-CoV outbreak (
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Breban et al., 2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Cauchemez et al., 2014</xref>); in particular we do not consider the resurgence of cases reported in Spring 2014 (
