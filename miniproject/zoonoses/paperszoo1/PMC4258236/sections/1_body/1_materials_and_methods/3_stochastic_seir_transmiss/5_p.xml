<p id="par0100">We fit simulations to three types of observed MERS-CoV epidemiological data. First, we use the cumulative number of index cases reported during the Apr-Oct 2013 study period, which is the number of cases progressing to the 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> compartment in our model and follows equation 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>t</italic>) (Text S1). Second, we use the cumulative number of secondary symptomatic community cases, which is the number of cases progressing to the 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>s</italic>
 </sub> compartment in our model and follows equations 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>s</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>t</italic>). Lastly, we consider the cumulative number of symptomatic secondary cases that are generated by hospitalized patients, including inpatients, health care workers, and visitors of hospital patients, which is given by equation 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>IH</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>t</italic>) in our model.
