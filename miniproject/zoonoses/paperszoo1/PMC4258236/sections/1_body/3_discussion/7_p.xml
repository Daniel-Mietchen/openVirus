<p id="par0270">More elaborate models either based on dynamic systems or branching processes could be developed for MERS-CoV to incorporate more realistic mixing structures and possibly refine the spillover transmission dynamics. Although our model assumes homogeneous mixing within community and hospital populations, our results did not warrant further model heterogeneity given limited available data. As more data become available, these assumptions could be refined particularly if the pathogen's intrinsic transmissibility increases or if the virus spreads to poor areas where nosocomial transmission may be amplified. An important issue in modeling outbreaks in the Arabian Peninsula is the lack of information on age- and gender-specific contact rate patterns, as it has been done for European countries (
