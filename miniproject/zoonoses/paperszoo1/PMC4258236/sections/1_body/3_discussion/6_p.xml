<p id="par0265">Our study is prone to limitations, as we made important simplifying assumptions to safeguard tractable inference. First, we assumed that the rate of zoonotic introductions into the human populations was constant. This assumption may be reasonable if MERS-CoV prevalence level in the zoonotic reservoir has reached an endemic state and the rate of animal-to-human contacts was stable throughout our study period. Similarly, we have not attempted to quantify changes in the baseline transmission rate or the relative transmissibility of hospitalized cases over time, but we fit our model solely to cases that occurred when pro-active surveillance was implemented in Saudi Arabia (
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Memish et al., 2014</xref>). Further, we assume that asymptomatic cases do not transmit infection. However, given that MERS-CoV secondary cases have typically been traceable to an index case it seems unlikely that there can be much asymptomatic transmission as this would lead to difficulty in reconstructing transmission chains. Another limitation of our model is that parameters 
 <italic>β</italic> and 
 <italic>l</italic> were not uniquely identified, although we were able to find reasonably well-bounded estimates of 
 <italic>R</italic>. This is not entirely surprising, as a similar phenomenon occurs when a simple SIR model is fitted to the early exponential phase of an epidemic. In such a simple model, both 
 <italic>β</italic> (the transmission rate) and 
 <italic>γ</italic> (the recovery rate) are not identifiable. Yet, the ratio beta/gamma =  
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is often identifiable in practice.
