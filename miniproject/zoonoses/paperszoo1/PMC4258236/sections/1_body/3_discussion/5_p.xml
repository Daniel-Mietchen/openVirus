 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">Blumberg and Lloyd-Smith, 2013a</xref>), and the rate of MERS-CoV reports appears to increase (
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Cauchemez et al., 2014</xref>), there is strong motivation to ascertain the potential impact of control interventions. A key finding of our analysis was that the number of MERS-CoV cases caused by hospital-based transmission was 4.3 to 4.6-fold higher than community-based transmission and estimates were robust to a variety of sensitivity analysis. These findings are reminiscent of SARS (

The reasons for increased hospital transmission could include increased intensity and duration of viral shedding, or increased contacts with particularly vulnerable patients (
