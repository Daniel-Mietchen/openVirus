<p id="par0255">Despite these reassuring findings of weak secondary transmission based on 2013 MERS-CoV cases, we cannot rule out that transmissibility of index cases

 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>

 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>s</italic>
 </sub> was less than one. One possibility is that control interventions around identified secondary cases were particularly effective in 2013. If this were the case, it is imperative to identify which of these interventions were most effective so that they can be rapidly implemented in the event that MERS-CoV spreads to a new geographic region. A similar situation arose in the last days of smallpox eradication, as stringent control measures were put in place once cases were identified, limiting the transmission of secondary cases (

Alternatively, it may be that there is an intrinsically biological phenomenon in which humans infected by a zoonotic reservoir experience more clinically severe disease, and in turn a higher transmission potential than those infected by humans. In this case, further adaptation of MERS-CoV to humans would be required for sustainable transmission to occur. A definite identification of the reservoir for MERS-CoV would help to shed light on potential variation in doses and route of exposure between index and secondary cases, which may account for the observed differences in onward transmission.
