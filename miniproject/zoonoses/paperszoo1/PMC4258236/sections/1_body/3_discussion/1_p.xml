Our analysis has focused on resolving uncertainty surrounding the transmissibility of MERS-CoV in its early dissemination phase, and quantifying the specific contributions of index, secondary, community and hospitalized cases, as well as surveillance bias, to the overall level of transmission. In the process we have provided perspective on the broad ranges of reproduction number estimates presented in two recent studies of the MERS-CoV outbreak (

 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Cauchemez et al., 2014</xref>). All of the models consistently suggest that human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV remained subcritical in 2013, arguing against the possibility that the outbreak was self-sustaining in humans. However, some models predict that the reproduction number of zoonotic cases may be higher than 1, which may support the effectiveness of control measures applied among contacts of identified cases, and could signal a potential acceleration of the epidemic if these measures were to be relaxed.
