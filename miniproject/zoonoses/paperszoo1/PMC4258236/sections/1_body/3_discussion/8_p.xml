<p id="par0275">In conclusion, modeling of available MERS-CoV case data reported during Aprâ€“Oct 2013 in Saudi Arabia found robust support for the lack of persistence of the infection in humans without continued reintroduction from the reservoir. However, as with all emerging zoonoses, the potential for viral adaptation towards increased transmissibility is a real threat that needs careful monitoring. We have highlighted how observation bias (particularly the difficulty in observing asymptomatic and less severe index cases) can skew the inference and interpretation of transmission parameters. In particular, more data on the surveillance process is needed so that the transmission potential of index cases can be more rigorously ascertained both retrospectively and in the on-going 2014 outbreak. The relative transmissibility of primary and secondary cases has important implications for the efficacy of current control measures and the potential for spread in other regions that are more resource-limited. As a focal point of control, we have found that over 80% of transmission events are likely occurring in a hospital setting. We hope that future surveillance efforts can elucidate specific mechanisms of hospital-based transmission and effective control so that targeted interventions can be rapidly implemented if MERS-CoV spreads globally or adapts to humans.</p>
