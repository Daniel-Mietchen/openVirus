  <p>Temporal variation in MERS symptomatic cases associated with index (zoonotic) events and secondary (human-to-human) transmission as predicted from the model fit to the data according to epidemiological scenario A (‘Surveillance bias’, top). The mean (red solid line) and 95% uncertainty bounds (gray shading) generated from stochastic simulation as described in the text are shown. The blue dashed line is the approximate observed progression of symptomatic MERS-CoV cases by date of symptom onset (onset dates imputed as in 
   <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The overall percentage contribution of index cases, hospital-based symptomatic cases, community-based symptomatic cases, and asymptomatic cases to the total number of cases according for each epidemiological scenario are also shown (bottom). The radius of the pie chart for scenario B (‘transmission bias’) was scaled proportionally according to the total number of cases predicted from scenario A.
