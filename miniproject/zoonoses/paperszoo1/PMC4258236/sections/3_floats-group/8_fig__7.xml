  <p>Synthesizing available estimates for the reproduction number of MERS CoV. The 95% confidence intervals for the reproduction number averaged over all cases (
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>overall</sub>) and averaged over index cases (
   <italic>R
    <sub>i</sub>
   </italic>) are shown. Besides the two transmission scenarios considered in this study (black and gray dots), the plot includes results of 
   <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Breban et al. (2013)</xref> and 
   <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Cauchemez et al. (2014)</xref>. The key distinction among the models are that 
   <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Breban et al. (2013)</xref> modeled primary and secondary transmission as being similar; 
   <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Cauchemez et al. (2014)</xref> used the timing of cases to estimate 
   <italic>R
    <sub>i</sub>
   </italic>; our differential transmission model accounts for the higher observed disease severity of index cases; and our surveillance bias model considers the possibility that all weakly transmitting and asymptomatic index cases are unobserved. A modified version of Breban et al. and Cauchemez et al. are also shown in the plot that compensate for the possibility of unobserved index cases and thus allow direct comparison to our surveillance bias model. Cauchemez et al.â€™s results are presented as a confidence region because their inference of 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>overall</sub> was separate from their inference of 
   <italic>R
    <sub>i</sub>
   </italic>. All the other models contain an intrinsic dependence between 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>overall</sub> and 
   <italic>R
    <sub>i</sub>
   </italic> and so these results are presented as a curve.
