 <caption>
  <p>Schematic representation of the transition of cases (indicated by arrows) among the different epidemiological states in our model (Text S1).</p>
  <p>Under ‘surveillance bias’ scenario A, index (zoonotic) and secondary cases follow a similar epidemiological progression (full model).</p>
  <p>Under ‘transmission bias’ scenario B, index and secondary cases follow a different epidemiological progression: all index cases are symptomatic, develop severe disease, and require hospitalization (i.e., compartmental model in which the dashed arrows and compartment are removed).</p>
  <p>We assume that only the symptomatic cases are observed. The description and corresponding estimates of the epidemiological parameters are given in
