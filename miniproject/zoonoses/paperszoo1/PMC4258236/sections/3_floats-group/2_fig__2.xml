 <caption>
  <p>Temporal progression of MERS-CoV symptomatic cases according to exposure history by date of symptom onset, 08-April 2013 to 27-October 2013, Saudi Arabia (A and B). The gray shading shows the range of 500 cumulative curves obtained from the imputation strategy because the date of symptom onset was not available for all cases. The red solid line is the mean of the ensemble of curves. The overall percentage contribution of index cases, hospital-based symptomatic cases, community-based symptomatic cases, and asymptomatic cases to the total number of reported cases are also shown (C).</p>
