 <caption>
  <p>The effect of control interventions relatively to ‘surveillance bias’ scenario A (targeting hospital or community-based transmission) as well as the effect of potential pathogen adaptation to humans (increase in baseline transmission rate), and geographic spread with potential increases in reservoir spillover rate (via parameter alpha) or hospital-based transmission (via parameter l). The percentage contribution of index cases, hospital-based symptomatic cases, community-based symptomatic cases, and asymptomatic cases to the total number of cases according for each epidemiological scenario are shown. The radiuses of the pie charts were scaled proportionally according to the total number of cases predicted from the baseline scenario A.</p>
