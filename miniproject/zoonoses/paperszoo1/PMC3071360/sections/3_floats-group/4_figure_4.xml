 <caption>
  <title>A maximum clade credibility phylogenetic tree of the Africa 1 rabies viruses (RABV) lineage.</title>
  <p>405base-pair regions of the RABV nucleoprotein (N) from Africa 1 lineage viruses derived from Ghanaian samples and full length RABV N sequences from pan-African countries from GenBank and the VLA archive were analyzed. Branches are coloured according to inferred ancestral location, and posterior support for key locations discussed in the text is shown. The scale bar represents 20 years.</p>
