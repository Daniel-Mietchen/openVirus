<p>A novel reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (RT-LAMP) was applied to a limited panel of ten samples systematically taken from the larger randomly numbered Ghanaian panel. Previous reports applied this technique to viruses from a range of countries

 <xref rid="pntd.0001001-Saitou1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> or to fixed rabies virus 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001001-Fooks1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The assay is composed of two sets of primers (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001001-t001">Table 1</xref>). The first, designated Rab1, amplifies viruses belonging to the cosmopolitan lineage. The second, Rab4, amplifies viruses belonging to the arctic lineage. A reaction mixture incorporating a combination of all 12 primers amplifies viruses from both groups (data not shown). 1 µg of each RNA sample was added to a reaction mixture containing each of the 12 primers at the final concentration indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001001-t001">Table 1</xref>, Isothermal Mastermix (GeneSys Ltd) and 0.12 units Thermoscript reverse transcriptase (RT) (Invitrogen) in a final reaction volume of 25 µl. A cosmopolitan RABV obtained from a Turkish dog that had been used to develop the assay (data not shown) was included as a positive control. A no-template control sample (HPLC grade water) was used as a negative control. The reaction was incubated at 65°C for 1 hour. A 10 µl aliquot was removed and mixed with 2 µl sample loading buffer and loaded onto a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and separated at 80 volts for 1 hour. The amplification products were visualized by UV irradiation. The RT-LAMP assay was further adapted for use with a lateral flow device (LFD) for visualization of RT-LAMP products. The assay was run with the above conditions and reagents, but with the alternative loop primer sets (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001001-t001">Table 1</xref>: Rab1 FLOOPFlc, Rab1 BLOOPBtn, Rab3 FLOOPFlc, Rab3 BLOOPBtn, Forsite Diagnostics). The LFD (Forsite) uses a mouse anti-biotin monoclonal antibody (MAb) in the “get wet” strip to indicate the LFD run succeeded and a mouse anti-fluorescein MAb to bind the LAMP product to the fluorescein tag to show a positive result. The product was diluted in 1∶500 volumes of HPLC grade water and 60 µl added to the LFD test well.
