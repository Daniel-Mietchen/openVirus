<p>Spatio-temporal models of rabies in eastern and southern Africa show large-scale synchrony of rabies epidemics across both regions 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001001-Hampson1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. The analysis by Hampson 
 <italic>et al</italic> provided evidence that movement of infectious animals, or animals in the incubation period, and localized regional or national vaccination campaigns during epidemics, are likely to lead to rabies synchrony 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001001-Hampson1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. However, evidence provided by rabies control programmes in both Europe and the Americas show that large-scale control programmes can be successful

 <xref rid="pntd.0001001-Lembo1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. A subsequent analysis by Hampson

 <xref rid="pntd.0001001-Hampson2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Our molecular study suggests introductions of RABV from neighboring countries into Ghana are not infrequent, demonstrating that without substantial support for continuous vaccination or coherent regional cooperation, Ghana will be unable to eliminate rabies and maintain a rabies-free status. In addition to this, our analysis provides evidence of a virus that shares a recent common ancestry with viruses from East Africa, therefore providing further evidence that regional control programmes must be implemented and that once rabies is eliminated, vigilance and technical expertise must be maintained in order for new introductions to be controlled
