<p>Each of the 76 brain samples used in this study was positive for RABV antigen. The overall topology of the phylogenetic tree produced by our analysis of the RABV N-gene sequence data available from a sample of rabid African dogs and cats in Ghana was consistent with those previously described 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001001-Talbi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001001-Kissi1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001001-Delmas1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. This analysis of Ghanaian rabies cases is the first phylogenetic analysis of RABV from Ghana. Where this analysis is distinct from reports of RABV in other West African nations is in the diversity of viruses detected within Ghana. The samples were all taken from a relatively small geographical region with those samples not from within the greater Accra region originating from towns relatively close to Accra. These included eight viruses from Tema and five from Cape Coast (25 and 142 km from Accra, respectively). There was no evidence of infection with Africa 3 RABV (detected in mongoose in southern Africa)

 <xref rid="pntd.0001001-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, Africa 4 RABV (detected in north-eastern Africa) 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001001-David1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> or other 
 <italic>Lyssavirus</italic> species such as Lagos bat virus, against which a high seroprevalence of antibodies has been detected in bats from Accra 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001001-Hayman1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. However, our analysis suggests that rabies epidemiology is much more complex than at first thought from previous studies within West Africa. Indeed, whilst West African countries typically have defined lineages circulating within them, only Nigeria and the Central African Republic have previously been described as having Africa 1 and 2 lineage viruses co-circulating within their national borders 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001001-Talbi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001001-DeBenedictis1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. We detected both in Ghana, and propose that Ghana's recent history and geography may explain why both virus lineages were detected.
