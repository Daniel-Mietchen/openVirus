<p>Phylogeographic analysis of the newly sequenced Ghana Africa 1 sequences with pan-African 1 sequences (Table S2, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001001-g004">Figure 4</xref>) confirmed a monophyletic group of Africa 1a viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001001-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This clade is estimated to have emerged 23–31 years ago from Gabon (posterior probability = 0.944). The spatial analysis also provides high support for the introduction of the single Africa 1b virus from Kenya (posterior probability = 0.937) 15–22 years ago (95% HPD) (
