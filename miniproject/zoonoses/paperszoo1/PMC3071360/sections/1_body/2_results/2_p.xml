<p>The MCMC tree of a 405 bp region of the 76 RABV N gene sequences analyzed with 20 African RABV sequences from GenBank is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001001-g002">Figure 2</xref>. The topology is similar to other analyses of African RABV N genes 
 <xref rid="pntd.0001001-Kissi1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> that included Africa 1, 2, and 3 lineages. Rabies viruses from Ghana clearly form two lineages, Africa 1 (49 viruses) and 2 (27 viruses). Within each lineage sequences are separated into sub-lineages, in the case of Africa 1, or clades in that of the Africa 2 lineage. Our analysis estimates that the Africa 2 lineage diverged approximately 181 years ago (73â€“313 yrs, 95% HPD).
