<p>The trade and resulting movements of ruminants, the composition and abundance of the vector population and many other environmental and anthropological factors determine the nature of the RVF viral cycle. In order to elucidate how RVFV persists in the Union of Comoros, longitudinal and cross-sectional livestock surveys were conducted between April 2010 and August 2011 in six separate geographical zones. Mosquito populations were categorized in parallel over the same period via a longitudinal entomological survey. Additionally trade frequencies were analyzed, providing an estimate of regional ruminant flux and allowing for evaluation of the risk associated with animal importation, and the likelihood of RVFV persistence in the Comoros islands.</p>
