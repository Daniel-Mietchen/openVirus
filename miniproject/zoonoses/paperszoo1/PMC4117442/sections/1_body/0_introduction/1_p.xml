<p>Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an arthropod-borne zoonotic disease caused by a RVF virus (RVFV), a member of the 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> genus of the family Bunyaviridae 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Daubney1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. RVFV causes significant morbidity and mortality among sheep, goats, cattle and also affects humans. In livestock, abortion storms and high mortality observed among the younger animals cause significant economic losses

 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Rich1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Humans are usually infected by contact with infectious animal tissues through inhalation or aerosols generated by slaughtering and necropsy 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-McInstosh1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Arthropod vectors play an important role during the onset of epidemic and inter-epidemic periods 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Bird1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In endemic areas, RVFV is maintained in the environment through an enzootic vertebrate-arthropod cycle 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Zeller1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. RVFV has been isolated from many vectors in the field 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Fontenille1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, such as ticks and sand flies which are able to transmit the virus in experimental conditions

 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Dohm1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, mosquitoes are the main insects involved in the spread of RVFV during epidemics. RVFV has been isolated from at least 40 species of mosquitoes belonging to 8 genera but only some of them are susceptible and able to transmit RVFV under laboratory conditions 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-AFSSA1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. RVF is widely present in Africa and has been spreading to Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula

 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Madani1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In 2007, RVF outbreaks were reported in several eastern and southern African countries 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Outbreaks1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. A few weeks later, and for the first time, RVFV was detected in the Comoros archipelago following the hospitalization of a young Grande Comorian boy showing symptoms of severe encephalitis 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Sissoko1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In addition, during the 2008 and 2009 rainy seasons, outbreaks due to RVFV strains imported from mainland Africa were reported in Madagascar causing 59 confirmed human cases and seven deaths
