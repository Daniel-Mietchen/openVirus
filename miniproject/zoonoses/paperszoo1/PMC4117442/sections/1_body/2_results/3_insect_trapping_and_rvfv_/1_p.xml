<p>Twelve trapping days were conducted in each of the four zones under study (zones 1, 3, 5 and 6, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003045-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Blood-sucking insects were trapped in five out of the twelve trapping days in central Grande Comore (zone 1), in eight trapping days in southern Grande Comore (zone 3), eleven trapping days in Moheli (zone 5), and in seven trapping days in Anjouan (zone 6) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003045-t004">Table 4</xref>). Out of the 1,568 blood sucking insects caught with the double-net goat baited trap, 1,548 were identified as mosquitoes and 20 were identified as 
 <italic>Stomoxys niger</italic>. A total of 1,133 insects were collected in Moheli (zone 5), 291 in Anjouan (zone 6), 108 in southern Grande Comore (zone 3) and 36 in central Grande Comore (zone 1). Although the number of comparisons was not large, the average number of trapped mosquitoes per trapping day per zone was significantly higher in Moheli (average was 113 insects) and Anjouan (average was 42 insects) compared to Grande Comore zones 1 (average was 7 insects) and zone 3 (average was 14 insects) (
