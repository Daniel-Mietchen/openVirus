<p>In August 2011, to determine the RVFV antibody prevalence, a total of 275 ruminant samples (i.e. 163 cattle and 112 goats) were tested for the presence of RVF IgG antibodies. A total of 37 ruminants (20 cattle and 17 goats) came from the longitudinal follow-up study and 238 ruminants (143 cattle and 95 goats) were randomly selected in the six separate study zones.</p>
