<p>The overall annual incidence of RVFV antibody acquisition for the Union of Comoros was estimated at 17.54% (n[animal risk time] = 91), with a 95% confidence interval (CI) [8.95–26.14]) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003045-t002">Table 2</xref>). A significant difference was found when incidence of RVFV antibody acquisition was compared between zones (Fisher exact test, p&lt;0.001) or between islands (Fisher exact test, p&lt;0.001) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003045-t002">Table 2</xref>). Zone 5 (Moheli) incidence of RVFV antibody acquisition (72.3% 95% CI [0.255–1.000]) was significantly higher than in others zones (
