 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003045-t001">Table 1</xref> presents by date and per zone the number of animals that acquired RVFV antibodies over the duration of the livestock longitudinal survey. A total of 15 animals out of the 191 sampled acquired RVFV antibody during the study. Each of the 13 RVFV IgG ELISA positive samples were confirmed by VNT. Only one RVFV IgM ELISA positive sample was not confirmed by VNT (July 200, Moheli). This animal was confirmed RVFV IgG ELISA positive and VNT positive four months later in November 2010. Out of the 112 RVFV IgG ELISA negative samples randomly chosen, all were found negative by VNT. RVFV IgM antibodies acquisition was detected in three animals and RVFV IgG antibodies acquisition in 12 animals. Only one RVFV IgM ELISA positive animal in Moheli converted to RVFV IgG antibodies. The two others RVFV IgM ELISA positive ruminants were lost or slaughtered before the next sampling session (
