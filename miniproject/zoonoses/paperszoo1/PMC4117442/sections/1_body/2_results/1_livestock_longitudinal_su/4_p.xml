DLST, NLST (MODIS data) and cumulative rainfall (MEWS data) were similar in all six zones at the time of fourteen out of fifteen seroconversions occurred. There was one exception when the last RVFV seroconversion was recorded in Grande Comore in May 2011 (zone 3). Between March and May 2011, DLST, NLST and cumulative rainfall recorded in Grande Comore (29째C, 25째C and 730 mm respectively) were higher than those recorded in Moheli and Anjouan at the same time (DLST : 24째C, NLST : 22째C and cumulative rainfall : 420 mm). No RVFV seroconversion was recorded on Moheli and Anjouan during this period.
