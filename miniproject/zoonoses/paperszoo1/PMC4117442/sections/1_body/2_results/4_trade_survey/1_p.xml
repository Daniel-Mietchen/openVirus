<p>The study highlighted movements of live ruminants between the three islands of the Union of Comoros, the African mainland, Mayotte and Madagascar (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003045-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Data recorded by veterinarians and technicians showed movements of live ruminants from i) the east coast of Africa to Union of Comoros and ii) between the three islands of the Union of Comoros (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003045-g002">Figure 2A</xref>.). Animals were observed being landed on beaches without any controls or in secondary “ports” like Chindini in the south of Grande Comore. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003045-g002">Figure 2B</xref> represents the dynamics of live animal importations in Union of Comoros from May 2010 to July 2011. We recorded up to ten fold more ruminants imported in Grande Comore than in Moheli or Anjouan.
