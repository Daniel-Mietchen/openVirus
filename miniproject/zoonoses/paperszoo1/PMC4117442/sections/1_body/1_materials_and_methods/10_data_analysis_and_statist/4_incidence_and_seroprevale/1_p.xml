<p>To assess whether location had an effect on the RVFV antibody prevalence, different zones with specific ecosystems were included in the follow-up study. A Fisher's exact test was used to compare the difference in incidence of RVFV antibody acquisition and RVFV antibody prevalence between zones and islands. Incidence was analyzed and hypotheses were proposed about relationships with environmental and climate conditions.</p>
