<p>In order to generate hypotheses on potential associations between the estimated RVFV incidence and prevalence with environmental risk factors for RVF infection, we collated climatic variables 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Anyamba1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Two remotely-sensed MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data sets were sourced from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (

In addition, rainfall data were obtained from the Malaria Early Warning System (MEWS) program, freely available in the MEWS repository (

DLST, NLST and rainfall values were extracted within a 5-km radius buffer around each farm corresponding to the maximum daily distance for cattle (grazing and watering). For each sampled animal that became RVFV antibody positive, MODIS and MEWS data recorded at the time of the seroconversion in the zone concerned were compared with MODIS and MEWS data recorded at the same time in the other zones.
