<p>The livestock longitudinal survey was conducted in the six separate zones detailed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003045-g001">Figure 1</xref>. From 20 to 30 ruminants were individually identified in each zone using ear tags. The number of animals sampled per zone was based on the previous survey, with a RVFV antibody prevalence ranging from 20% to 50% 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Roger1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> with 70% relative precision 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Toma1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. To avoid colostral immunity, animals were selected as follows: cattle were between 10 months and one-year of age, and small ruminants were between three to eight months of age. Animals were sampled monthly from April 2010 to August 2010 and every four months from August 2010 to August 2011. The first series of serological tests determined the RVF serological status of each sampled animal. Only RVFV antibody negative animals were included in the livestock longitudinal survey and continued to be sampled until their IgG RVFV antibody positive status and were then excluded from the study. When possible, new ruminants were included in the study to substitute lost, dead or RVFV IgG positive animals.
