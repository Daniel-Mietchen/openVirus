<p>Based on the results of a previous RVFV antibody prevalence study in 2009 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Roger1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, six zones were selected in the Union of Comoros (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003045-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Four zones were selected on the island of Grande Comore: zones 1 and 2 located in the center of the island where low RVFV antibody prevalence was found, and zones 3 and 4 located in the south with high RVFV antibody prevalence 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Roger1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Zones 2 and 4 are located along the coast (0–200 m above sea level (asl.)) where ruminants are mostly goats stall reared or ranging free within and outside villages. Zones 1 and 3 are located at a moderate altitude (500–650 m asl.) where ruminants are mostly cattle reared in pastures (zone 1) or raised in stalls in the forest (zone 3).
