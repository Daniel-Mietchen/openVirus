<p>Sera were first tested by two ELISAs (enzymelinked immunosorbent assay) the Immunoglobulin (Ig) G IDScreen RVF Competition ELISA (IdVet, France) and the IgM capture ELISA 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Paweska1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. To confirm their status, each of the RVFV ELISA antibody positive samples and some randomly chosen RVFV ELISA negative samples were tested using the virus neutralizing test (VNT), considered as the gold standard method described by OIE 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-OIE1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Briefly, duplicates of two-fold serial dilutions of sera starting from 1∶5 were added to 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of Smithburn RVFV in 96-well microtiter plates and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Next, 100,000 Vero cells were added to each well and the plates were incubated with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 5–6 days at 37°C. Titers were expressed as the inverse highest dilutions giving 50% of CPE. A positive control serum was included. A serum sample with a titer of 1∶10 or higher was considered seropositive.
