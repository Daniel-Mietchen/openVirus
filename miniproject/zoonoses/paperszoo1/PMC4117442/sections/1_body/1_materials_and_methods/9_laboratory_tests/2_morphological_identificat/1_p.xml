<p>Specimens were collected by direct aspiration with a home-made vacuum system and anesthetized with chloroform. Each specimen was morphologically identified by microscopy in the field. Insects were pooled (1 to 10 individuals), per species per trap and per zone and stored in liquid nitrogen in the field and at −80°C in the laboratory. Engorged females were not included in the pool.</p>
