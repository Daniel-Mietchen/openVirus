<p>The pooled insects were ground up with 400 Âµl of PBS 1X (Phosphate Buffered Saline) twice for 30 seconds with two 3-mm diameter stainless beads using the TissueLyser system (Loudet, France) and transferred to a 96-well plate. Total RNA was extracted with the Biomek NX robot (Beckman Coulter, USA) using the NucleoSpin 96 Virus kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany). For RVFV RNA detection, the L-Segment based SYBR-Green real time PCR was used
