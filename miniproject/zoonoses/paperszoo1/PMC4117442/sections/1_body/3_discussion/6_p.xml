<p>The abundance of mosquitoes trapped in Anjouan (zone 6) was similar to that in Moheli (zone 5) and three mosquito species known as RVFV potential vector have been caught during our study. However, RVFV antibody prevalence in Anjouan was the lowest and appeared to be decreasing. Moreover in 2011, only one ruminant exhibited a RVFV seroconversion. Anjouan shares some similar environmental characteristics with Moheli that could allow mosquitoes to survive all year round but Anjouan has some characteristics that could limit the circulation of RVFV. For example, the landscape is comprised of hill slopes and irrigated field rice is not cultivated on the island. Ruminants are mainly reared in stalls in the highlands in the eastern part of the island. For that reason, the probability of contact between infected vectors and ruminants may be lower in Anjouan than in Moheli and the maintenance of a vector-ruminant cycle may be harder to get. More investigations in other cattle-rearing areas are thus needed to conclude on RVF circulation in Anjouan.</p>
