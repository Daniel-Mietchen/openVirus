<p>On Moheli and Anjouan, the oldest islands, the landscape includes permanent rivers 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Manicacci1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> and, as a result, many artificial and natural breeding mosquito sites exist. Moheli has a wide variety of natural and artificial sites in which mosquitoes can breed all year round 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Manicacci1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-UNEP1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. The presence of clay, resulting from the decomposition of volcanic soils, ensures the presence of abundant surface water impoundments. It allows the cultivation of irrigated rice hence and favors the development of diversified mosquito populations 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Manicacci1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. A greater number of mosquito species were caught in Moheli (15 species) than in the other islands which is in agreement with Brunhes' inventory in 1978, including two mosquito species known as RVFV potential vectors. Thus, favorable conditions for RVFV persistence being present a better chance for a possible RVFV cycle involving vectors and animals is suggested.
