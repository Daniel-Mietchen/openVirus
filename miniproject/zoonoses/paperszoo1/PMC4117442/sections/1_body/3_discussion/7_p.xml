<p>Incidence of RVFV antibody acquisition and the RVFV antibody prevalence in Grande Comore are hard to explain based only on entomological parameters. Presence of steep slopes with decomposed and highly permeable soils characterize Grande Comore, the youngest island of the country 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Manicacci1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Surface water is rare and only artificial containers (such as tanks and troughs) and some natural breeding sites (such as coconut shells and hollow trees) enable the development of Culicidae. Our results were in accordance with these observations as fewer blood-sucking insects were caught in Grande Comore when compared to Moheli and Anjouan. Thus, mosquito abundance in Grande Comore was likely correlated with the number of breeding sites that appeared after rainy episodes, as observed for the seroconversions we detected in Grande Comore following on from a major increase in cumulative rainfall. Two out of eight mosquito species caught during our study have been described as RVFV potential vectors. Consequently, environmental conditions for a local mosquito-mammalian host cycle could be met after important rainy episodes but a continuous circulation of RVFV in Grande Comore all year round is less likely to happen. However, regular introductions of the virus through the arrival of live animals from Tanzania
