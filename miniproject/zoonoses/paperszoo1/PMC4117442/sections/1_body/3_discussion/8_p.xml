<p>Analysis of trade in live animals confirmed observations reported by Cêtre et al., in 2012 in an overview of the movement of live ruminants between east Africa and the Comoros archipelago, as well as within the archipelago. Per year, more than 3000 live ruminants are imported from Tanzania (Chief Veterinary Officer of Comorian Vet services, personal communication), where RVF is endemic 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Sumaye1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. These animals enter the Union, mostly Grande Comore, without any quarantine or clinical examination. The risk of the introduction of new exotic strains of RVFV is consequently quite high and could affect the country in the same way as many other diseases in the past 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-DeDeken1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Tanzanian ruminants are imported for “great weddings” which are usually celebrated in July and August in Grande Comore. During these traditional weddings, villagers sacrifice ruminants without any particular sanitary rules. However, no major cases in humans and no ruminant seroconversions were reported during the “great weddings” period during our study but to date, human and veterinary health surveillance networks remain not very efficient. Occasional imports of Tanzanian ruminants into Moheli and Anjouan have also been reported; so new RVFV strains could have been also introduced on these islands. The regular introduction of live ruminants from Anjouan and Moheli could also contribute to the regular introduction of RVFV in Grande Comore as well.
