<p>Rift Valley fever epidemiology in the Union of Comoros is complex and further virological investigations should help to explain the origin of the RVFV strain(s) circulating within the islands. However, based on the results of the present study, RVFV seems hardly to persist on Grande Comore through a local vector cycle only but repeated reintroduction of viruses is possible. The situation regarding Rift Valley fever in Anjouan and Moheli appeared to look like that in Mayotte, Madagascar, Tanzania, and Mozambique

 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Lernout2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> where RVFV seroconversions have also been observed in the dry season without any apparent clinical signs. These findings could identify Moheli and Anjouan as endemic areas for RVFV. Given the incidence of RVFV seroconversions and antibody prevalence, RVFV is more likely to be circulating in Moheli than in Anjouan. However, additional data are needed to firmly conclude on the circulation of RVFV in the Union of Comoros. Wildlife such as bats and lemur species in our zone should be investigated even though no wildlife reservoir has been identified in any other country so far
