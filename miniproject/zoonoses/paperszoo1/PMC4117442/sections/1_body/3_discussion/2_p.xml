<p>Fifteen RVFV seroconversions were observed in the Union of Comoros between 2010 and 2011 giving an overall incidence of RVFV antibody acquisition of 17.5%. These results suggest continuous circulation of RVFV on the three islands. However, significant differences in incidence were observed between islands (p&lt;0.001). The incidence of RVFV antibody acquisition was higher in Moheli (72.3%) than in Anjouan (5.8%) and in Grande Comore (8.2%). This is in accordance with differences in RVFV antibody prevalence between the Union of Comoros islands recorded in 2009 and 2011. In 2011, RVFV antibody prevalence in Anjouan was still below the one in Grande Comore, whereas RVFV antibody prevalence remained the highest in Moheli. However, in Grande Comore and Anjouan RVFV antibody prevalence in 2011 appeared to have decreased whereas in Moheli, RVFV antibody prevalence remained similar to the level recorded in 2009, despite herd replacement estimated at 12% (L. Cavalerie, personal communication). These results suggest the existence of island specific RVF circulation patterns.</p>
