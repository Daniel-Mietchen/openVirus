<p>No clinical signs were reported in the Union of Comoros during the period of our study, as reported in Madagascar, Tanzania, and Mozambique in recent years

 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Fafetine1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, but the fifteen seroconversions observed suggest that RVFV could be circulating in the Comorian environment thanks to local mosquito-mammalian host cycles even if the numbers of caught mosquitoes were not large nor positive for RVF RNA. Out of the 1,568 blood-sucking insects caught, none were found to be RVFV RNA positive by PCR but in the absence of RVF outbreaks, chances of detecting RVFV in vector populations are known to be very low 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Linthicum1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In 1978, Bruhnes described 30 mosquito species in the Union of Comoros 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Brunhes1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Four of them: 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. fowleri</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. circumluteolus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> are considered as RVFV potential vectors because the virus has been already isolated in these species in the field and because of their capacity to transmit RVFV under laboratory conditions 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-McIntosh1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Turell2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. All these species, except 
 <italic>Ae. fowleri</italic>, have been caught at least on one island during our study, suggesting a role for this mosquito species to be involved in the transmission cycle on each of the islands. Five other mosquito species caught during our study, 
 <italic>Er. quinquevittatus</italic>, 
 <italic>An. arabiensis</italic>, 
 <italic>M. uniformis</italic>, 
 <italic>An. coustani</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. simpsoni</italic> were previously identified as RVFV RNA positive by PCR in the field 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-McIntosh2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Lernout1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. 
 <italic>An. coustani</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. simpsoni</italic> were found RVFV RNA carrier for the first time in the Indian Ocean area: respectively in Madagascar in 2011 and in Mayotte in 2009 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Ratovonjato1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Lernout1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Thus, some of these mosquito species may play a role in RVFV transmission in the Union of Comoros. Geological inaccessibility, sampling design and climatic conditions likely explain the small number of specimens caught and the heterogeneity of entomological findings between islands 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003045-Hightower1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. These volcanic islands are characterized by a tropical climate with only slight variations in daily temperatures and abundant rainfalls, which theoretically should enable populations of Culicidae species to persist throughout the year. Nevertheless, each island has its own environmental characteristics, as the age of the three islands decreases westward: Moheli is 2.73±0.20 million years old, Anjouan, 1.18±0.03 million years old, and Grande Comore is 0.13±0.02 million years old
