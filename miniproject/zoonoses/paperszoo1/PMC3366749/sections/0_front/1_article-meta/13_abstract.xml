<abstract>
 <p>An Oropouche virus strain was isolated from a novel host (
  <italic>Callithrix</italic> sp.) in Arinos, Minas Gerais State, southeastern Brazil. The virus was identified by complement fixation test and confirmed by reverse transcriptionâ€“polymerase chain reaction. Phylogenetic analysis identified this strain as a genotype III isolate previously recognized only in Panama.
