<p>Phylogenetic analysis carried out for 44 OROV N gene sequences (693 nt) with MP and NJ methods resulted in trees with similar topology, even though slightly low bootstrap values had been assigned for the MP consensus tree. The NJ tree suggested that the strain BeAn 626990 was more closely related to those included in genotype III. Bootstrap support values of 100%, 74%, and 100% were assigned for the genotypes I, II, and III, respectively (
