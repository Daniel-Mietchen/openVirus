<p>Mice injected with the strain BeAn 626990 showed signs of disease 48â€“72 hours after intracerebral injection. By CF, the suspension prepared from the brain of infected mice showed positive reaction with the MIAF prepared for the Brazilian prototype strain of OROV BeAn 19991 (&gt;32/16). No cross-reactivity was observed with any other MIAF prepared for the most common arboviruses currently circulating in the region. The monkey strain was then identified as OROV.</p>
