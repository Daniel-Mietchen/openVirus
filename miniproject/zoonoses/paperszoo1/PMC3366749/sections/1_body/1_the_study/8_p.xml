<p>Two overlapping open reading frames were determined. One consisted of 693 nt (231 amino acids) and was predicted to encode the N protein. The other open reading frame consisted of 273 nt (91 amino acids) and was predicted to encode the NSs proteins. Both coding regions were flanked by 2 noncoding regions, located at the 5´ and 3´ terminals that were 44 nt and 14 nt in length, respectively.</p>
