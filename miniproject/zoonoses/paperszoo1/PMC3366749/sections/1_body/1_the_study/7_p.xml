<p>The N gene was found to be 693 nt in length, while the 5´ and 3´ terminal regions showed 290 and 161 nt, respectively. After the sequences assembly, accomplished by using the Seq Man program (DNA STAR software package, DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, USA), the full-length SRNA was determined (754 nt). The multiple sequence analysis for the entire N gene of the strain BeAn 626990, when Mega 2.1 software was used, showed homology with different OROV strains previously sequenced (92%–100%), as described (
