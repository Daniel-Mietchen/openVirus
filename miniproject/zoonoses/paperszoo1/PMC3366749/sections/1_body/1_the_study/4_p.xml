<p>Molecular studies were conducted to confirm the serologic results. Viral RNA was extracted by using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) technique as described elsewhere, and the entire SRNA segment was amplified, applying a 1-step reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay using the primers ORO N5 (5´ AAAGAGGATCCAATAATGTCAGAGTT CATTT 3´), ORO N3 (5´ GTG AAT TCC ACT ATA TGC CAA TTC CGA ATT 3´), ORO 1A (5´ AGTAGTGTACTCCACTAT 3´) (
