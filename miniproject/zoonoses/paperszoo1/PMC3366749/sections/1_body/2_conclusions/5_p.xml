<p>The potential impact of OROV in Brazil can be better assessed by viewing it in its demographic context. The southeast is the most populated region in Brazil, comprising urban areas such as the cities of Belo Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro, and SÃ£o Paulo. The entire region has intense intra- and interregional migration, fostered by improved technology and transportation, which may lead to increases in the dissemination of both human and animal pathogens along these areas. Therefore, further studies on the ecology, epidemiology, and molecular epidemiology of OROV are needed, not only to improve knowledge about the epidemiology of this arbovirus but also to find out if its epidemic area is spreading outside the Amazon region and toward the southeast and other populated regions in Brazil. This situation is of particular concern because Oropouche fever epidemics have been reported in several small villages in the Brazilian Amazon region in 2003 and 2004 (Vasconcelos PFC, unpub. data). As a consequence, the risk of spreading OROV to susceptible areas has increased considerably in Brazil. More research and program development are needed to control this potential epidemic arboviral disease.</p>
