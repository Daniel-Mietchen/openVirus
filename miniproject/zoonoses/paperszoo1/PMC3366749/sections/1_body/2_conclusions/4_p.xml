<p>The genetic data obtained in this study, for the S segment of the strain BeAn 626990 (S: AY 117135), suggest its genetic relationship with other OROV strains. Phylogenetically, the monkey strain was shown to be more closely related to genotype III OROV isolates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) and is the first report of genotype III in southeastern Brazil. More importantly, OROV was detected for the first time outside the known epidemiologic area for OROV transmission in South America. Our findings also represent the first report of OROV isolation from a monkey.
