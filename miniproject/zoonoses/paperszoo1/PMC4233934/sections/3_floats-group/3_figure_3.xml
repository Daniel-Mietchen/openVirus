   <bold>Observed integrated area-severity index for Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) in the Americas, 1920–2010</bold>. Integrated Area-Severity (IAS) index (
   <italic>dark solid line</italic>, left axis, log10 scale, 5-year point-centered moving average) for Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) in the Americas, based on reconstruction of actual disease incidence reported in literature, 1920–2010. Hypothetical reconstruction of expected levels of VEE, 1920–2010, achieved by sequential repeat of the average IAS index levels over Outbreak Two (1950–1979) and Outbreak Three (1980–2009) (
   <italic>dashed line</italic>, right axis, log10 scale), with standard error of mean added (
   <italic>light vertical lines</italic>). Outbreak One (1920–1949) values excluded from average due to lack of solid data. Subdued levels of VEE over Outbreak Three could be the result of assertive mosquito control programs related to dengue fever epidemics, and/or improved VEE management approaches and infrastructure (see text for details).
