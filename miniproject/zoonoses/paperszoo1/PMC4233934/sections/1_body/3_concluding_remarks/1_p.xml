<p>The threat of zoonotic diseases to human and animal populations in the Mexico–US border along the Rio Grande is documented here. Attention is called to a gap in understanding of the pathogenic landscape for zoonotic vector-borne diseases in this transboundary region. Among other things, research on ecosystem processes, land use, and human behaviors is required because the region analyzed functions as a pathway for the movement of humans and animal migrations, and thus links Central America/Mexico with the US and Canada. The One Health approach for international collaboration on veterinary and public health research is proposed to generate the knowledge base that can translate into strategies to mitigate the risk of zoonotic diseases in the US–Mexico border.</p>
