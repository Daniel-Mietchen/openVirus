<p>These scenarios acquire special relevance in the US–Mexico border, one the largest and longest-sustained routes of human migration. From the human migratory standpoint, the States of Chiapas and Tabasco in Mexico play a vital role as transit points for large numbers of people. In this regard, the ports of entry are the Ocosingo and Tapachula surroundings in Chiapas, and Tenosique in Tabasco. Veracruz is therefore the transition point for the nearly 400,000 individuals, representing approximately 50 nationalities, who traverse Mexico each year with the ultimate goal of reaching the US (Migration Department, Mexican Interior Ministry 2006).

Consequently, the “One Health” approach is required to enhance the ability to recognize zoonotic pathogens in humans, domestic, and wildlife reservoirs and the associated vectors in the US and Mexico transboundary region. This concept states simply that clinicians, researchers, agencies, and governments must work together seamlessly for the benefit of animal and human health as well as for the welfare of the global environment.
