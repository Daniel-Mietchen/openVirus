<p>The United States (US) and Mexico share a border spanning 3,100 km from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean. Approximately 14 million people reside within the area found roughly 100 km on either side of the international line between the two countries, with 7.3 million residing in the US and 6.8 million in Mexico (

A bi-national effort is in place to protect the environment and public health in the US–Mexico border region that is consistent with sustainable development. The sector encompassing the border States of Texas, Tamaulipas, Nuevo León, and Coahuila includes at least 29 municipalities on the Mexican side and 168 cities and towns on the US side, covers portions of the Southern Texas Plains and Western Gulf Coastal Plain ecoregions of Texas, and lies within a zoonotic disease hotspot (

In addition, recent studies showed that migrants displaced due to adverse weather conditions related to climate change, are predicted to increase during the twenty-first century (
