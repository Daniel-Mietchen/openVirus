<p>As the world globalizes in terms of Nation’s economies and increased travel, borders are opened for a constant flow of goods, products, and pathogen dissemination. Likewise, as human populations expand into new geographical regions, the possibility that humans will come into close contact with infectious agents’ potential hosts, which can transmit pathogens to human beings, increases. Such factors, combined with increased human density and mobility, stand as a serious human health threat. Additionally, climate change is increasingly becoming a concern in the emergence of zoonotic infectious diseases (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). For the past 70 years, most of the newly emergent diseases have been identified as zoonoses (60.3% of EIDs), and the majority (71.8%) has originated in wildlife (

Thus, according to the transboundary zoonotic disease concept, understanding how these pathogens emerge in different geographical regions will directly benefit global trade and public health. Here, we review several diseases that could impact a geographically strategic region in the US and Mexico border area. Insights gained understanding the pathogenic landscape of these zoonotic diseases could help enhance predictive tools, which might be applied to study the epidemiology of other transboundary pathogens. Pathogenic landscape is a term used to describe attributes of an ecosystem that influence spatial variations in disease risk or incidence (
