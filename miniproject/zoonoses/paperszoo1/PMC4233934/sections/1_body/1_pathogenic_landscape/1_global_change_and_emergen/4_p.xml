<p>Human migration and economic trade can exacerbate climate change influences on vector-borne diseases along the Texas–Mexico border. Ecological niche models, under climate change scenarios, showed an increased distribution of Leishmaniasis vectors and reservoirs in Texas and North Mexico (

 <italic>I. scapularis</italic>. In a similar study, the potential future distribution of main Chagas disease vectors, 
 <italic>Triatoma gerstaekeri</italic> and 
 <italic>T. sanguisuga</italic>, is expected to increase in the Texas–Mexico border due to climate change (
