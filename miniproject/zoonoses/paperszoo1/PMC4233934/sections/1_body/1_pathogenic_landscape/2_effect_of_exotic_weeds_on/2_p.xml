<p>Giant reed impacts the USDA-APHIS Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program (CFTEP) along the transboundary region of Texas–Mexico border. Giant reed indirectly affects CFT because survival is highest in giant reed as compared to native riparian vegetation or buffel grass pastures (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Abiotic conditions within giant reed stands are cooler due to the heavy shade and high rates of evapotranspiration (ET), which appears to be cause of lower levels of CFT mortality. Biotic conditions in giant reed stands are also altered because the abundance of CFT arthropod predator species is reduced (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In a review of the literature records of predation on ticks, Samish &amp; Alekseev (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) documented that ground dwelling predators (e.g., ants, beetles, and spiders) are the major natural enemies of ticks. Preliminary pitfall trap surveys in the PQZ indicate that ground dwelling beetle populations, specifically the predaceous Carabidae and omnivorous Tenebrionidae species, are strongly reduced in giant reed compared to adjacent native plant communities (Goolsby, personal communication). Ants are also known to be important predators of ticks in Texas. Fleetwood et al. (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) documented reduced populations of Lone Star ticks, 
 <italic>Amblyomma americanum</italic>, in pastures with abundant red imported fire ants, 
 <italic>Solenopsis invicta</italic>. Fire ant predation is generally believed to reduce the incidence of tick-vectored pathogens of livestock. In Louisiana, fire ant predation of 
 <italic>Ixodes</italic> ticks was associated with a reduced incidence of Anaplasmosis in cattle (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Preliminary studies in the PQZ found that ant diversity and abundance is low in giant reed stands, with the red imported fire ant, 
 <italic>Solenopsis invicta</italic>, being the most common species. Comparative studies are needed to survey ant diversity throughout the PQZ to investigate their potential impact on CFT. Control of exotic giant reed and restoration of the native riparian vegetation could reduce the favorability of this habitat for CFT and lead to restoration of a more intact leaf litter insect predator community and in total a more robust biological barrier to invading CFT and other tick-borne zoonoses. Giant reed may also be creating a localized climatic refuge for CFT when conditions in the upland habitat are not favorable for survival. As giant reed declines, lower ET rates, increased ground temperatures, and lower humidity levels are expected in these riparian habitats and these conditions are known to reduce the survival of larval and adult CFT (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>–
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Giant reed also indirectly impacts the CFTEP by reducing visibility in the PQZ along the Rio Grande. Heavy infestations of giant reed make it extremely difficult for mounted inspectors to detect and capture stray livestock.
