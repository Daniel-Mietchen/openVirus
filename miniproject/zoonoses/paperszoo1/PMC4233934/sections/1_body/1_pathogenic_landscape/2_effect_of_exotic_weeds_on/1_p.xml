<p>Invasive weeds can change the ecology of, and induce a pathogenic landscape in which arthropod-borne disease transmission can increase. Mack and Smith (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) link invasive plants as catalysts for the spread of human parasites by documenting the escape and mast seed production of Asian frost-tolerant bamboos from cultivation in the Pacific Northwest to potential outbreaks of the omnivorous deer mouse 
 <italic>Peromyscus maniculatus</italic> that carries Hantavirus. Invasive weeds also interact with ticks. Japanese barberry has been shown to increase the abundance of the blacklegged tick, 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> and the infection prevalence of 
 <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> (LD) (

 <italic>Lantana camara</italic> and outbreaks of 
 <italic>Haemaphysalis spiniger</italic>, the vector for Kyasanur encephalitis-inducing virus within the 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> group (

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). This same pathogenic landscape phenomenon appears to be happening in the permanent quarantine zone (PQZ) in the Texas–Mexico border region, with the invasion of the exotic and invasive weed species, 
 <italic>Arundo donax</italic> known as the giant reed (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Aerial remote sensing pictures of the Rio Grande taken in 2002 indicate that 62% or 5981 ha of riparian habitat on Rio Grande from Big Bend to Falcon Dam was infested with giant reed, which includes most of the PQZ (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Zoonotic agents are not transmitted by CFT, but knowledge from the study of CFT ecology can be applied to understand how ecosystem shifts can influence spatial variation in disease risk or incidence for tick-borne disease systems of public health importance.
