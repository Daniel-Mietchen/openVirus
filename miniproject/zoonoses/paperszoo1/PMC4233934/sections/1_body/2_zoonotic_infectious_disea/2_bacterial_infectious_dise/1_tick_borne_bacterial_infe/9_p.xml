<p>Variation in questing behaviors may significantly impact the type of hosts ticks encounter and may lead to differential host use within a particular study area (
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>). Therefore, further studies testing different sampling procedures, including different time of the day and season, would be needed to determine the phenology of 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> in Southern US and Mexico and the questing behavior of the different developmental stages. These studies will be critical to determine how questing behavior will affect the risk for LD in humans and companion animals in the transboundary region.
