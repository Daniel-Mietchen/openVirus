<p>It is important to understand how global change may alter the pathogenic landscape of leptospirosis because this zoonosis is considered a major bacterial NTD in Texas and Mexico (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). For example, the water buffalo (
 <italic>Bubalus bubalis</italic>) is originally from Asia and was introduced in Mexico as an alternative livestock species during the 1990s (
 <xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>). Water buffaloes produce milk, meat, and are used as working animals. Although subclinical 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection has been documented in other parts of the world and is considered a health risk to humans, information is lacking on the prevalence of leptospirosis in water buffalo herd in Mexico. An epidemiological cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample size of 368 blood specimens in the Mexican state of Veracruz to fill this knowledge gap. The overall sero-prevalence for Leptospirosis was 53.5% (
 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>). The most common serovars detected were Muenchen (44.3%), Pyrogenes (11.4%), Icterohaemorragiae (11.1%), and Hardjo (8.1%). In this study, the interaction between water buffaloes and dogs was identified to be a risk factor (
 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>). This was the first study identifying seropositive buffaloes to 
 <italic>L. interrogans</italic> and risk factors associated with Leptospirosis in Mexico (
 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>).
