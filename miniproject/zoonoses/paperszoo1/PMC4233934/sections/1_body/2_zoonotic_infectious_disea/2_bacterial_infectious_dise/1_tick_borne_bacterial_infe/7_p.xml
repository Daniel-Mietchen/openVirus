<p>Ehrlichiosis was first recognized as a disease in the late 1980s, but did not become a reportable disease until 1999 in the US. The number of ehrlichiosis cases due to 
 <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> that have been reported to CDC has increased steadily since the disease became reportable, from 200 cases in 2000 to 961 cases in 2008 (
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>). The incidence increased from less than 1 to 2.5 cases per million people in 2000–2010. Both 
 <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. ewingii</italic> are causes of human illness in the US, although the majority of reported cases identify 
 <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> as the causative agent of HME. HGA is more frequently reported than HME with an annual incidence of 1.6 cases per million during 2001–2002. In Mexico, the first Ehrlichiosis case was reported in 1999 (

 <italic>Ehrlichia</italic> infection acquired by humans in close contact with domestic dogs. In this sense, our research team found that human contact with 
 <italic>Ehrlichia</italic> infected dogs have 14.9 times higher risk to become infected, and dogs infested with 
 <italic>Ehrlichia</italic> infected ticks have 8.2 higher risk of being infected (
