<p>Cervids may be involved in the epidemiology of leptospirosis. Diversified livestock production comprises activities aimed to breed in sustainable manner wild animals, including native and exotic species of deer. Ranches in northeast Mexico have been managed to be units for the conservation, management, and sustainable use of wildlife (UMA), which are dedicated to the diversification of livestock. A cross-sectional epidemiological study on leptospirosis was conducted with cervids at an UMA in Tamaulipas, Mexico (

 <italic>Cervus axis</italic>) and 19 Fallow deer (
 <italic>Cervus dama</italic>). Seropositivity for 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. in all the cervids sampled was 13.5%. Twenty-one percent of the Axis, and 5.5% of the Fallow deer were seropositive. Positive deer were reactive to serovars Bratislava and Muenchen, which confirms the presence of this pathogen in deer in Northern Mexico (
