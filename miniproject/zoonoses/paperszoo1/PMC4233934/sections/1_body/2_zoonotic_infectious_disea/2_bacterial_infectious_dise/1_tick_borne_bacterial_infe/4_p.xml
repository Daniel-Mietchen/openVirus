<p>In Mexico, a national serosurvey of human serum samples reported a 
 <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> sero-prevalence of 1.1% (
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>). The Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Nuevo León and Coahuila in the Texas–Mexico border region presented the highest sero-prevalence (6.4%) for the country (
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>). Also, 
 <italic>Ixodes</italic> ticks infected with 
 <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> sensu stricto occur in the same States (
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>), and recently the infection has been documented in white-tailed deer (
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>). Distribution models of potential tick vectors in Mexico point to a wide distribution range that overlaps not only Northeastern Mexican States along the border with the US, but also extend to central Mexico (
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>). These studies, together with confirmed clinical cases of LD acquired in parks near Mexico City (
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>), demonstrate the existence of a zoonotic cycle responsible for LD in Mexico.
