<p>The number of 
 <italic>Bartonella</italic> spp. identified infecting a wide range of mammalian species has significantly increased. Currently, a total of 13 species or subspecies can cause disease in humans, and most of them are zoonotic (

 <italic>Bartonella henselae</italic>, the causative agent of cat-scratch disease (CSD) is the most recognized in the medical community together with 
 <italic>B. quintana</italic>, the causative agent of Trench Fever, and 
 <italic>B. bacilliformes</italic>, the causative agent of bacillary angiomatosis, Oroya fever and veruga peruana (

 <italic>Bartonella</italic> species causing disease in humans and companion animals have a worldwide distribution, and are associated with poverty and overpopulation, as these bacteria thrive in crowded and unhygienic environments (
