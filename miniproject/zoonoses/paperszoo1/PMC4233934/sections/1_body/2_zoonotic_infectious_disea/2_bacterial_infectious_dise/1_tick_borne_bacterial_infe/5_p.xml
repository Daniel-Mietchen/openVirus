<p>TBRD are a group of zoonoses clinically similar, yet epidemiologically and etiologically distinct. In the US, these diseases include: (1) Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), (2) human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME), (3) human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). TBRD are common occurrences in the medical and veterinary clinical setting, and are gaining more attention from physicians and veterinarians since TBRD continue to cause severe illness and death in otherwise healthy individuals (
