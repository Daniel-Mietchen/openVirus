 <italic>Bartonella</italic> species are fastidious gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacteria that cause host restricted hemotropic infections in mammals. Normally, they infect erythrocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells. In addition, a number of 
 <italic>Bartonella</italic> spp. are transmitted by blood sucking arthropods such as sand flies, biting flies, lice, and fleas. More recently, ticks and mites have been suggested as potential vectors for zoonotic 
 <italic>Bartonella</italic> spp. (
