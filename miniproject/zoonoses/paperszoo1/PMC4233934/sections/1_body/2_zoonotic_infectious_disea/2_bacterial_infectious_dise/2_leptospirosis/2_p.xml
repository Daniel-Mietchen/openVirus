<p>In the forest region of Indiana, a study was conducted with 34 raccoons (
 <italic>Procyon lotor</italic>) to determine the presence of 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic>. In this study, cell culture techniques, microscopic agglutination test (MAT), and PCR were used. The results indicated the presence of 
 <italic>L. interrogans</italic>, 
 <italic>L. kirschneri</italic>, and 
 <italic>L. borgpetersen</italic> in raccoons from this region. For 
 <italic>L. interrogans</italic>, the serovars most frequently detected were Bratislava (38.2%) and Grippotyphosa (32.4%). This finding indicated that 
 <italic>L. interrogans</italic> is circulating in the raccoon population, which is acting as a reservoir for the pathogen. The racoon is an abundant species in the south Texas â€“ northeast Mexico region.
