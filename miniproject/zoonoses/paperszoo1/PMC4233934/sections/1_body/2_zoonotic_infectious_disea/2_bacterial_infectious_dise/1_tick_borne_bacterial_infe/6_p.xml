<p>Several ticks species are vectors of different rickettsiae causing TBRD. 
 <italic>R. rickettsii</italic>, the causative agent of RMSF, is transmitted most frequently by the American dog tick (
 <italic>Dermacentor variabilis</italic>) in the Eastern, Central, and Pacific coastal US and the Rocky Mountains, while the wood tick (
 <italic>D. andersoni</italic>) transmits this pathogen in the Western US. The brown dog tick (
 <italic>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</italic>), a vector of RMSF in Mexico (

 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>), was implicated in 2005 as vector of this disease in a confined geographic area in Arizona (
 <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>). 
 <italic>Rhipicephalus</italic> ticks from Mexicali, Mexico have been recently genetically characterized, and found to be different from those isolated in the US (
 <xref rid="B141" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>). The cayenne tick (
 <italic>Amblyomma cajennense)</italic> is a common vector for RMSF in Central and South America (

 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B142" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>), and its range extends into the US through Texas. 
 <italic>Ehrlichia chaffeensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Ehrlichia ewingii</italic> are transmitted to humans by the lone star tick (
 <italic>Amblyomma americanum</italic>). 
 <italic>E. ewingii</italic> infections in dogs or ticks have been described in Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Arkansas, Texas, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia (
 <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>). 
 <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> is transmitted by the blacklegged tick (
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic>) and is distributed in New England, North Central, and recently, Southeast United States, in addition to the Northeast of Mexico (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>). The western blacklegged tick (
 <italic>I. pacificus</italic>) is the principal vector in Northern California. In the US, the estimated average annual incidence of RMSF was 2.2 cases per million people. In Mexico, the incidence from 1975 to 1987 was 12.59 cases per 100,000 people in North and Northwest States. From 2009 to 2011, there were 2616 reported cases with an incidence of 0.8 cases per 100,000 people. In 2012, there was an increase to 2875 cases in the States of Baja California and Coahuila in Northern Mexico. Due to the consistent increase and presence of this disease, Mexico started to officially report RMSF and other Rickettsial human cases in 2014 (
