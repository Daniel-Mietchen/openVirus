<p>Cats have been classified as reservoirs for 
 <italic>B. henselae</italic>, the causative agent of CSD, which is distributed worldwide. The prevalence of infection in felines is higher in warmer countries that it is in cold countries (
 <xref rid="B178" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>). In addition, cats tend to be bacteremic for months and in some instances for over a year (
 <xref rid="B178" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>). The cat flea (
 <xref rid="B185" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>), 
 <italic>Ctenocephalides felis</italic>, is responsible for the transmission of the bacterial pathogen between cats. Studies by Finkelstein and collaborators (
 <xref rid="B180" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>) showed that 
 <italic>B. henselae</italic> can remain viable in flea feces for over 72 h. Therefore, transmission to humans can occur via inoculation of 
 <italic>B. henselae</italic> from infected flea feces into the skin via open wounds, such a scratch lesion. The CDC documents over 20,000 CSD cases annually. Human cases have been reported in Texas (
 <xref rid="B186" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>–
 <xref rid="B189" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>), Mexico, and other Latin American countries (
 <xref rid="B190" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B191" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>). Domestic dogs, together with wild canids, have been suggested as potential reservoirs for zoonotic 
 <italic>Bartonella</italic> species, such as 
 <italic>B. vinsonii</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>berkhoffii</italic>, 
 <italic>B. henselae</italic>, 
 <italic>B. clarridgeiae</italic>, 
 <italic>B. wahoensis</italic>, 
 <italic>B. rochalimae</italic>, 
 <italic>B. quintana</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. elizabethae</italic>. In some cases, domestic dogs display a broad range of clinical signs (
 <xref rid="B174" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B176" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B178" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B192" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B193" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>) similar to those observed in humans. Consequently, domestic dogs might be considered sentinels for 
 <italic>Bartonella</italic> infections (
 <xref rid="B178" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>) as they are for other vector-borne infectious diseases (
 <xref rid="B194" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>–
 <xref rid="B196" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>).
