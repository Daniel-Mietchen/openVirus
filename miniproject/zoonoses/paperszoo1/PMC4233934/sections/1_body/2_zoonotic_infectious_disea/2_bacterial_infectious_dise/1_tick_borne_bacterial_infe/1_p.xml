<p>Globally, ticks serve as vectors for a number of zoonotic bacterial pathogens, such as the spirochete 
 <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>, the causative agent of LD, as well as the intracellular pathogens 
 <italic>Rickettsia rickettsii</italic>, 
 <italic>Ehrlichia chaffeensis</italic>, 
 <italic>E. ewiingii</italic>, and 
 <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic> (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), also known as tick-borne rickettsial diseases (TBRD) (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>). These pathogens are maintained in natural cycles involving wild mammals and several species of hard ticks in the family Ixodidae. Foci of LD exist in the US, Europe, and Asia, and it is considered an emerging infection in those parts of the world (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>). In the US LD is the most prevalent arthropod-borne infection with over 30,000 cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in recent years. The increase in LD cases during the last few years has prompted its classification as an emerging infectious disease. Similar to other arthropod-borne diseases, LD is a complex system subject to shifts in ecological processes that influence vector biology and the epidemiology of 
 <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> infection in reservoir hosts and humans.
