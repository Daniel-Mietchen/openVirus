<p>The understanding of vector-borne disease ecology has improved in recent years due to advancements in molecular biology, geographic information systems (GIS), and species distribution models (SDM) (

 <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>). A recent study evaluated the presence of 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> ticks in Texas and Northern Mexico, and forecasted the distribution of this tick species considering different climate change scenarios (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). It was observed that a geographic region could provide suitable environment where the competent vector for transmission of LD and other zoonotic pathogens would survive. The model presented in this study showed East Texas to include suitable habitat where established populations can exist (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), which agrees with findings from other studies (
 <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>). This model also showed expansion towards Central and to South Texas through a corridor along the Gulf Coast and Northern Mexico, forming a geographic continuum of habitat suitable for 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> populations in the border region. Although no specific distribution model exists for 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> in Mexico, a distribution model for the genus 
 <italic>Ixodes</italic> generated with similar methodologies predicts a wide distribution covering Northeastern Mexico (
