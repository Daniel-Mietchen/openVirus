<p>Human risk of infection with 
 <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> across the continental US has been predicted using the density of 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> infected nymphs (DIN) (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>). Under this scenario, Southern US States were considered as a low risk region given the non-appearance of host-seeking 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> nymphs at sampled sites (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>). In striking contrast to the conclusion of this suggested null risk of acquiring LD in Southern States, a steady number of LD cases have been reported in these low risk areas every year (
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>). Some of the caveats of these most recent studies include the lack of accounting for both human movement (some cases can be acquired in a region different from the one where they are reported) and differences in tick phenology between geographic areas (
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>). These limitations might explain why the models utilized cannot explain the variation in distribution of the disease observed in low incidence areas. Drivers for the variation in distribution of disease cases observed in low incidence areas remain to be identified.
