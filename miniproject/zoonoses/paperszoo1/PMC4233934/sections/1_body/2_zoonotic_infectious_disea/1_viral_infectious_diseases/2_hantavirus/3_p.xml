<p>Northeastern Mexico (Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas) and Texas share a common biogeographic history, and thus a large number (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) of Cricetinae rodent species are shared among these States (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>). Because the abiotic environment and rodent assemblages of Northeastern Mexico are similar to those of areas in the adjacent US, it is likely that many viruses circulating in this region occur on both sides of the international border. However, specific information regarding the prevalence and spatial distribution of Hantaviruses within this region is scarce and incomplete. 
 <italic>Hantavirus</italic> antibody-positive rodents from seven species have been found in Chihuahua, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas. The only 
 <italic>Hantavirus</italic> identified to date within these species is the SNV. However, because most of the rodent individuals tested were only analyzed by serology tests, it is possible that other Hantaviruses occur in Northeastern Mexico (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>). In Texas, antibodies for Hantaviruses have been detected in 11 rodent species and 4 Hantaviruses (SNV; El Moro Canyon virus, ELMCV; Muleshoe virus, MULV; and BAYV) are known to occur in this state (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>). No cases of HPS are known from Mexico, but up to 2006 a total of 28 confirmed cases were recorded in Texas. Of these, 24 cases were associated to SNV and 3 to BAYV. Infection with SNV had a high mortality rate of 50% (12/24), but all of the three patients infected with BAYV survived (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>). The geographic distribution of HPS cases in Texas shows the two groups with most cases (64%) are in the West and Panhandle areas, with the rest of the cases found along the Gulf of Mexico Coast area. This disjoint case distribution is due to rodent reservoir distributions. Cases along the Gulf Coast are associated to the BAYV, which is carried by the rice rat (
 <italic>Oryzomys palustris</italic>), whereas the cases in Western Texas have been related to SNV presence in the deer mouse (
 <italic>P. maniculatus</italic>) (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>). 
 <italic>O. palustris</italic> is present in Northeastern Mexico, but no seropositive individuals have been reported. Its role as a BAYV reservoir in Mexico is likely minor as the range of this rodent is limited to the extreme Northern corner of Tamaulipas (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). However, two rodent species (
 <italic>P. maniculatus</italic>, and the white-footed mouse, 
 <italic>Peromyscus leucopus</italic>) pose a more serious risk for HPS along the transboundary States. Both species have wide ranges across Texas and Northeastern Mexico; within this region, SNV seroprevalent individuals have been recorded for both species (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>). Moreover, based on the list of Hantaviruses identified in the Southwestern US, it is suggested that four Hantaviruses likely circulate in Northern Mexico: SNV, ELMCV, MULV, and Limestone Canyon virus (LSCV). These viral strains are hosted by rodent species of the 
 <italic>Peromyscus</italic>, 
 <italic>Reithrodontomys</italic>, and 
 <italic>Sigmodon</italic> genera (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>), which are ubiquitous throughout the transboundary region. This hypothesis needs to be confirmed with further work to ascertain the public health risk for human populations on both sides of the border. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to determine the geographic distribution patterns of 
 <italic>Hantavirus</italic> sero-prevalence in rodent reservoir species and understand the mechanistic processes that determine these patterns.
