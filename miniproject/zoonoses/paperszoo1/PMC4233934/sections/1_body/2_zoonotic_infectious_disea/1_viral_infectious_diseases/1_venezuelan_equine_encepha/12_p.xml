<p>The development and persistence of high Accumulated Cyclonic Energy Index (ACE) and equatorial Pacific Ocean Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) levels imply VEE outbreak activity currently and in the near future (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Why VEE outbreak activity has remained low since 1966, when broad oceanic indicators suggest a high potential for outbreak, remains unknown, which indicates the need for further research. For example, additional research into local rainfall conditions could help understand how mosquito populations expand, which may drive VEEV activity as it has been shown in other mosquito-borne arboviral disease systems (

These changes, taken with the movement of human populations into cities and a relative decline in equine populations, will also play a role in decreasing the likelihood or severity of a VEE outbreak. There is currently widespread mosquito control in response to dengue epidemics. Any of these developments may be limiting the magnitude of current and near-term VEE epidemics (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Outbreaks in the 1930s and 1960s were weakly constrained, at best, and may offer a study in contrast to modern conditions with better knowledge and disease management infrastructure.
