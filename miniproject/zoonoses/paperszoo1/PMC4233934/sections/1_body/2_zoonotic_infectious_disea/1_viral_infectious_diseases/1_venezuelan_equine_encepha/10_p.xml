<p>The ocean indicators both show low levels of storm impact over the 1972–1992 (Gap b), and likely reflect the paucity of extreme rainfall events, which is in contrast with the high storm levels over the 1996–2013 interval (Gap c) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The latter suggests hurricane and ENSO events are now opportune to bring heavy rainfall into the VEE-affected region. This begs the question of why recent VEE levels remain relatively low and points to the need for further analysis of local rainfall and other weather events across the region.
