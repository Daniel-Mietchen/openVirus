<p>The historical time-series shows three repeating VEE outbreaks over the past century, recurring at approximately 30-year intervals, and spanning up to one decade. The gap of two decades following each outbreak period is conspicuous (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Attention to details of each major outbreak show striking differences between epidemics. The first event (Outbreak I, 1935–1946) is exclusively an equine outbreak, with a locus in Columbia and Venezuela. By 1942, it had spread to Peru in the South and by 1943 to Trinidad in the East. The actual number of equines affected in this outbreak was not documented, and there are no records of human VEE cases; the latter do not appear as recorded observations until the 1960-decade. The gaps over the 1970–1980 decades (Gap b) and over the 1996–2013 interval (Gap c) contrast, at least in terms of recent serological evidence, and in terms of important climatic conditions.
