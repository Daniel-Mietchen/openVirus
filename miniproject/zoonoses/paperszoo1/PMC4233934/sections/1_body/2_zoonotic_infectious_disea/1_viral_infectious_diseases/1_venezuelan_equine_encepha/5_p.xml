<p>Two virus isolates from the Mexican outbreaks of the 90s were examined antigenically and genetically. All were VEE subtype IE by IFA and ELISA using monoclonal antibodies (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). Sequencing and phylogenetic studies indicated that the outbreak strains belong to one of three major subtype IE VEEV lineages. This lineage circulates on the Pacific Coast of Guatemala, and was sampled there from 1968 to 1980 (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). The absence of previous Mexican isolates from this lineage suggests that the currently circulating Mexican strains originated from enzootic transmission foci on the Pacific Mexican Coast. The remaining IE lineages circulate on the Gulf and Caribbean Coasts of Central America (Nicaragua northward to the Gulf Coast of Mexico and close to the US border) and in Western Panama, and differ by up to 7% at the nucleotide sequence level.
