<p>Beyond knowing the specific situation in the Eastern transboundary region between Mexico and the US, further work needs to extend outside of this zone, as it might influence this region. Mexico has a very diverse mammalian fauna (~525 species) with rodents comprising almost half (235 spp., 44.8%) of the species (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). It is possible that many more species harbor Hantaviruses than those currently recognized (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). Specifically, the transboundary region could serve as a connection between Hantaviruses of Neartic origin with others from tropical regions. The State of Tamaulipas has a mammalian fauna that represents a mix of Neartic and Neotropical taxa (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>) and the possibility exists that these rodent species of Neotropical affinities could harbor Hantaviruses found in tropical areas such as the Catacama virus (CATV) present in 
 <italic>O. couesi</italic> from Honduras (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). Moreover, evidence of the presence of 
 <italic>Hantavirus</italic> seropositive rodents in regions of Southern Mexico and crucial human migration crossing pathways are elements to be considered in this complex equation (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). For instance, in the State of Chiapas’ coastal and central valleys, there are clear indications for the presence of 
 <italic>Hantavirus</italic> in wild life. After infection, the resultant disease can take up to 2 weeks to develop in the human host, allowing the disease to move with relatively low detection. Thus, the potential risk of these Neotropical Hantaviruses existing in the transboundary region needs to be evaluated.
