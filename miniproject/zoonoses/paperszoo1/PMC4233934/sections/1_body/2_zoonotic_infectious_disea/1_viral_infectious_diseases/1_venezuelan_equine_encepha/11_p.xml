<p>There is uncertainty and considerable concern over the possible re-emergence of an outbreak of VEE. Our time-series model and its correlation with broad climate signals (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) offers a new and evocative look at VEE at the century and cross-regional scales. It opens a window on a conceptual framework for better understanding and managing outbreaks of the virus through both the tracking of accelerated climate change (e.g., satellite imagery), and use of long-term forecasting (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Work is in progress using power spectrum analysis to quantify likely timing and magnitude of future outbreaks. This is important now that serological analyses show the widespread presence of the VEE virus in humans, equines, and populations of virus reservoirs like the rodent species mentioned above, which mosquito vectors feed on, that respond to unusually strong rainfall events.
