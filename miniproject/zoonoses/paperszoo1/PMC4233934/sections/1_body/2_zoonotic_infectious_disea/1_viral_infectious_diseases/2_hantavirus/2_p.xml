<p>A relevant feature of Hantaviruses is their close association between a specific 
 <italic>Hantavirus</italic> and its rodent host species, suggesting a strong relationship between Hantaviruses and their reservoirs (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). Globally, these viruses occur in close association with rodent and shrews of the families Cricetidae and Soricidae, with a majority of New World Hantaviruses detected in reservoir rodent species of the sub-family Neotominae (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). Throughout America, more than 30 Hantaviruses have been identified, but only a few have been associated to HPS (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). The New World geographic distribution of known hantaviral strains includes Canada, US, Mexico, Honduras, Costa Rica, Panama, Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Paraguay (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). Rodents with 
 <italic>Hantavirus</italic> antibodies have been detected in Peru, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Honduras, and Mexico, although HPS in humans has not been documented in these countries (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). The distribution of recorded cases of HPS and the distribution of 
 <italic>Hantavirus</italic> seroprevalent rodents in the Americas is not coincidental for several reasons: (1) not all Hantaviruses have been associated with HPS; (2) our knowledge of hantaviral diversity present in the continent is likely incomplete; and (3) HPS may be confused with clinically similar diseases. In North America, five Hantaviruses known to cause HPS are the Sin Nombre virus (SNV), New York virus (NYV), Choclo virus (CHOV), Black Creek Canal virus (BCCV), and Bayou virus (BAYV) (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). SNV is the major cause of HPS in the US and Canada, where 
 <italic>Peromyscus maniculatus</italic> (deer mouse) is the primary rodent reservoir (

 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>).
