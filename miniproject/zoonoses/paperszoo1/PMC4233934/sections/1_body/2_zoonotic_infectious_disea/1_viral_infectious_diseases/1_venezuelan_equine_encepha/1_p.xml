<p>Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses are members of the VEE complex and comprise the three major serogroups of New World alphaviruses (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Fourteen subtypes and varieties have been described within the VEEV complex (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). The IAB and IC viruses are designated “epidemic” or “epizootic” because they have been isolated only during equine and human outbreaks. They are distinct from enzootic strains (subtypes/varieties ID-F, II-VI) that circulate in sylvatic or swamp habitats, and occasionally cause disease in humans or domestic animals (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>–
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Importantly, VEEV isolates identified to be of the IE subtype identified during epizootics in Mexico appear to be equine neurovirulent, but are unknown to produce high titer viremia (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Transmission cycles have been described for most of the enzootic VEE subtypes/varieties [ID, IE, II, IIIA, and IIIB (Tonate)], except III C and V (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Most of them are transmitted among rodents by mosquitoes in the subgenus 
 <italic>Culex</italic> (
 <italic>Melanoconion</italic>) and few mammalophilic mosquitoes (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>).
