<p>The genus 
 <italic>Hantavirus</italic>, from the family Bunyaviridae, is composed of viruses with a three-segment negative sense RNA genome (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). In nature, these viruses are hosted by a variety of rodent and soricomorph species as persistent infections (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). Humans acquire 
 <italic>Hantavirus</italic> infection by inhaling aerosolized particles from rodent excreta and urine, or via the bite of an infected animal (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). Some rodent-borne Hantaviruses are associated with two types of human disease, differing between the New and Old Worlds. In the Americas, 
 <italic>Hantavirus</italic> pulmonary syndrome (HPS) has reached fatality rates of 60% and is characterized by elevated pyrexia, pulmonary dysfunction, and cardiac shock (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). In several regions of the Old World (Europe, Russia, China and Korea), hantaviral infections cause a hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) characterized by high fever, renal dysfunction, and hemorrhage but with mortality rates usually lower than 12% (
