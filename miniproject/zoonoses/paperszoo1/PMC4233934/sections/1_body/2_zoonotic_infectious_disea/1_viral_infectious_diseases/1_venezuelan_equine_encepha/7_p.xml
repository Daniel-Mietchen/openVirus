<p>Subtype IE enzootic viruses are the only VEEV known to continuously circulate in Mexico both currently as well as prior to 1993 outbreak. They occur from Western Panama through Tamaulipas State in Mexico (

 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). The ecology of the IE viruses has been studied in detail and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> (
 <italic>Melanoconion</italic>) 
 <italic>taeniopus</italic> is the known primary enzootic vector of subtype IE viruses in Guatemala (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>), and one of the principal vectors maintaining endemic VEEV cycles in southern Mexico, the Gulf Coast of Mexico (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>), and Panama (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). It has been demonstrated that 
 <italic>Cx. taeniopus</italic> found in estuarine areas of Chiapas is susceptible to both subtype IE VEEV isolates from the Pacific Mexican outbreaks of the 90s and to strains isolated from hamster sentinels during the 2000s in the same region (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). 
 <italic>Cx. taeniopus</italic> feeds on a wide variety of hosts, mainly small rodents from the Cricetidae family such as cotton rats and rice rats, and seems to circulate subtype IE VEEV not only in the Mexican Pacific Coast but also in the Gulf Coast of Mexico (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). The scenario in the Pacific Coast of Southern Mexico appears to involve VEEV transmission by 
 <italic>Ae. taeniorhynchus</italic> to equids and possibly humans at inland locations (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). The threat of VEEV outbreaks in the Mexican Pacific region involving enzootic and epizootic vectors exists (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Such region is linked to the East through Gulf river basins where several endemic VEEV foci are found, along the States of Tabasco, Veracruz, and Tamaulipas. The later of these States is adjacent to the US Texas border, and is a spot of subtype IE VEEV activity (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). Hotspot activity was characterized through serosurveys suggesting VEEV infections in cattle, equines, rodents, and humans, which was complemented with the isolation of IE VEEV (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). Findings of the study showed that at least one major urban region (Minatitlan in the State of Veracruz) has active enzootic VEEV transmission with 
 <italic>Cx. taeniopus</italic> identified as the main VEEV vector (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>; Estrada-Franco and Weaver, unpublished information). Several mosquito epizootic vectors of VEEV that were found infected and active during the VEEV pandemic of the 1970s are present on both sides of the border (Tamaulipas and Texas), such as 
 <italic>Ae. sollicitans</italic>, 
 <italic>Psorophora confinnis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Ae. taeniorhynchus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). The risk of 
 <italic>Ae. taeniorhynchus</italic> or other epizootic vectors adapting to endemic VEEV cycles elsewhere outside the Chiapas area, as was demonstrated with the IE VEEV strains isolated in the Pacific coast, could be of veterinary and public health significance. An epidemic strain of VEEV has the potential to arise from circulating endemic strains, which may be easily misdiagnosed for another febrile-causing disease if appropriate diagnostic assays are not routinely performed. The movement of epidemics by viremic individuals is a major concern, particularly in the Gulf Coast region of Mexico, which could threaten previously unaffected areas of Mexico and even the US. Moreover, direct human-to-human transmission of VEEV has also been suggested by the sudden appearance, rapid increase, and brief occurrence of human disease within affected communities (
