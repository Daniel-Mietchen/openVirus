<p>Most VEEV epizootics and epidemics have taken place in Northern South America and in regions of Venezuela and Colombia. However, VEE has also affected North America on several occasions. In 1966, an equine epizootic in Northeastern Mexico was reported in southern Tamaulipas and Northern Veracruz within the Panuco river basin (

The lack of VEE vaccination in Mexico at this time suggests that this outbreak was caused by a local enzootic subtype IE strain. Another major Middle American outbreak and one of the most devastating VEEV pandemics of the Continent, began near the Guatemala-El Salvador border on the Pacific coast and spread through much of Central America, Mexico, and Texas during 1969â€“1972, and involved tens-of-thousands of equines and people. In Mexico, equine deaths from VEE were first reported in 1969 in mountainous regions of the State of Chiapas close to the Guatemalan border (

In Texas, approximately 1500 horses died of VEE, and several hundred human infections were documented. The Texas outbreak was halted by a massive equine vaccination program and aerial insecticide spraying costing about 15 million dollars (
