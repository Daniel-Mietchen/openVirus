<p>Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus was known to be circulating and producing illness in horses since the 1920s (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), and in 1938 the virus was isolated from the brain of a horse that died of encephalitis in South America (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>–
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Human cases with neurological complications were recorded in 1950 during an outbreak of febrile illness in Espinal, Colombia (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). VEEV outbreaks continued at regular intervals through the 1960s in South America affecting tens-to hundreds-of-thousands of people (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Between 1973 and 1992 no VEEV was documented, which led to the assumption that the epidemic-epizootic subtypes IAB and IC VEEV had disappeared (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). However, phylogenetic studies and renewed epidemic/epizootic VEE activity in Northwestern Venezuela during 1992–1993 revealed that these viruses remain a threat (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Two equine epizootics in the States of Chiapas and Oaxaca, Mexico caused by a subtype IE virus (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), and a major outbreak in Venezuela and Colombia during 1995 affecting about 100,000 people (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>) draw attention to the continued threat of VEEV. To date, VEEV viruses affecting humans and equids have been found in at least 12 countries of the Americas causing important social and economic damage mainly in Latin America (
