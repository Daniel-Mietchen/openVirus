<p>Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease caused by 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> species of the family Kinetoplastidae, which is transmitted by sand flies of the genus 
 <italic>Lutzomyia</italic> in the Americas and 
 <italic>Phlebotomus</italic> in other regions of endemicity (
 <xref rid="B242" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B243" ref-type="bibr">243</xref>). There are 98 countries where 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> is endemic, with the majority of cases occurring in developing nations (
 <xref rid="B244" ref-type="bibr">244</xref>). The distribution of competent vector species and leishmaniasis has expanded over the last decade as areas with suitable habitat for sand flies continue to increase due in part to shifts in climate (
