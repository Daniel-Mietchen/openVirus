 <xref rid="B200" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>). Surveillance for Babesiosis started in 2011 in 18 States. That year, there were 1,124 confirmed and probable human cases across the US (

 <xref rid="B204" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>). In rural Mexico, human infection with 
 <italic>Babesia</italic> spp. was documented during the 70s (
