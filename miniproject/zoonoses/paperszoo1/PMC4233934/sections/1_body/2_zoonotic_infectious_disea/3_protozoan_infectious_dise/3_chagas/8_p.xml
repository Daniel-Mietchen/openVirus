 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> has three infective forms capable of infecting its host and currently six DTUs (discrete typing units) are recognized in the taxon. These DTUs correlate with mammalian hosts specific interactions in distinct time-space scales. We know relatively little about confirmed mammalian 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> hosts in the US. More studies are needed to produce a comprehensive list of confirmed 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> hosts as well as time-space scales for the operative interactions of hosts, vectors, and parasites. To better understand the epidemiology of Chagas disease in the Texasâ€“Mexico transboundary region, ongoing research could focus on detecting 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection status of vectors, potential role of the different reservoirs and hosts in the parasite cycles, and DTUs identification (
