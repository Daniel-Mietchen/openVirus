<p>An accepted strategy to control and prevent Chagas disease is through the management of triatomine insect infestations in domestic areas based on government and population surveillance programs (

However, a surveillance program aimed at controlling triatomine vectors and preventing Chagas disease has not been attempted in the US, perhaps due to the lack of data on human cases and vector-parasite distribution. Triatomine insects can be found in domestic and sylvatic life cycles, which could make efforts to control insect infestations difficult in domestic habitats due to the continuity of insect populations (
