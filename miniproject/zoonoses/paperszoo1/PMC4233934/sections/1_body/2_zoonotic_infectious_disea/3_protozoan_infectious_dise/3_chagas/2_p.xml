<p>Chagas is endemic in the Southern US and Latin America, where it affects more than 10 million people (
 <xref rid="B280" ref-type="bibr">280</xref>) and it is spreading rapidly to non-endemic areas (
 <xref rid="B276" ref-type="bibr">276</xref>). It is considered a NTD in Texas (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and Chagas could have been present in hunting-gatherer native Americans as far back as 1200â€‰years ago, as described in a case of megacolon found in a mummified ancient resident of what is now known as Texas (
 <xref rid="B281" ref-type="bibr">281</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B282" ref-type="bibr">282</xref>). Studies conducted in US blood donors have demonstrated that 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> seropositive donors have persistent infection with demonstrable parasitemia long after acquisition of infection (
 <xref rid="B283" ref-type="bibr">283</xref>). In Texas, for example, there are an estimated 267,000 people infected (
 <xref rid="B284" ref-type="bibr">284</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B285" ref-type="bibr">285</xref>). This is only an estimate based on small sero-prevalence studies and risk modeling. The exact risk for infection and the number of Chagas cases in Texas is unknown (
 <xref rid="B277" ref-type="bibr">277</xref>). In January 2013, Chagas became a reportable condition in Texas, which is a critical step toward documenting cases and understanding the epidemiology of this critical NTD.
