<p>Chagas is a zoonosis caused by 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, a protozoan parasite that is present in a variety of mammalian reservoirs. This disease is one of the most prevalent parasitic diseases in the world (
 <xref rid="B274" ref-type="bibr">274</xref>) and kills around 45,000 people annually (
 <xref rid="B275" ref-type="bibr">275</xref>). The parasite is transmitted by species of insect vectors, commonly known as kissing bugs, belonging to the sub-family Triatominae in the family Reduviidae (
 <xref rid="B276" ref-type="bibr">276</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B277" ref-type="bibr">277</xref>). During the blood meal, the Triatomine kissing bug defecates and sheds the parasite in the feces. The parasite then enters its host through the bite wound or through contact with mucous membranes. The parasite can also be transmitted through blood transfusion, organ transplants, ingestion of infected food, or congenital transfusion (
 <xref rid="B277" ref-type="bibr">277</xref>). However, 85–96% of 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> transmission to humans occurs via contact with infected feces from Triatomine insects (
 <xref rid="B278" ref-type="bibr">278</xref>). The acute phase of the disease is rarely recognized since cases are typically subclinical and asymptomatic. Chagas disease can then enter the chronic phase, in which 30% of cases will develop a fatal cardiomyopathy around 10–30 years post-infection (
 <xref rid="B274" ref-type="bibr">274</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B279" ref-type="bibr">279</xref>). Anti-parasitic treatment is mostly effective during the acute phase, and in infants and individuals up to 15 years old, although the currently accepted therapeutic options have limited efficacy and can have disabling side effects. Current research includes efforts to develop a vaccine for Chagas (
