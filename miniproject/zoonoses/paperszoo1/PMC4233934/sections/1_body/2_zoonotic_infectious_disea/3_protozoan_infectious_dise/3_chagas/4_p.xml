<p>Currently, 40 species of triatomine insects are known to be naturally infected with 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> in North America. Twenty-eight species are found exclusively in Mexico, and eight are shared with the US (
 <xref rid="B298" ref-type="bibr">298</xref>). Considering the vectorial transmission capacity and widespread distribution in Mexico, important species include 
 <italic>Triatoma barberi</italic>, 
 <italic>T. dimidiata</italic>, 
 <italic>T. phyllosoma</italic>, 
 <italic>T. longipennis</italic>, 
 <italic>T. mazzottii</italic>, 
 <italic>T. pallidipennis</italic>, 
 <italic>T. picturata</italic>, 
 <italic>T. mexicana</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. gerstaeckeri</italic> (
 <xref rid="B299" ref-type="bibr">299</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B300" ref-type="bibr">300</xref>). 
 <italic>T. gerstaeckeri</italic> and 
 <italic>T. sanguisuga</italic> are the most common triatomine species in the Southern US and might be involved in 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> transmission. Different reports have revealed information about the major vectors in endemic areas of Mexico (
 <xref rid="B287" ref-type="bibr">287</xref>). In the State of Veracruz, the main recognized vectors are 
 <italic>T. dimidiata</italic> and 
 <italic>R. prolixus</italic>, and three vector species, 
 <italic>P. rufotuberculatus</italic>, 
 <italic>R prolixus</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. dimidiata</italic>, have been identified in the State of Chiapas. Two important vectors in the Southern region of the State of Mexico are 
 <italic>T. pallidipennis</italic> (97.4%) and 
 <italic>T. dimidiata</italic> (2.6%), and 28.0% of the triatomines in that region were infected with 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> (
 <xref rid="B299" ref-type="bibr">299</xref>). Studies conducted in rural communities of Yucatan, Mexico found that 21.9% of 
 <italic>T. dimidiata</italic> (23.9% of adults and 13% of nymphs) were infected with 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> (
 <xref rid="B301" ref-type="bibr">301</xref>).
