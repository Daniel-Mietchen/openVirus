<p>HB is a complex zoonotic disease system whose relevance as an emerging public health concern is considered to be the result of aspects related to global change (
 <xref rid="B206" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B207" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>). Most zoonotic 
 <italic>Babesia</italic> species are maintained in wildlife reservoirs, but gaps exist in our knowledge of several epidemiological aspects of HB in various parts of the world (
 <xref rid="B208" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>–
 <xref rid="B210" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>). The vector(s) and reservoir hosts of 
 <italic>Babesia</italic> species affecting humans in Mexico and other Latin American countries remain unknown (
 <xref rid="B211" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>). Accurate diagnosis of HB in sub-tropical and tropical parts of Latin America can be complicated because of malaria-like symptoms in the case of affected patients (
 <xref rid="B212" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>), asymptomatic infection in others, and the possibility that tick bite may have resulted in co-infection with other tick-borne pathogens (
 <xref rid="B213" ref-type="bibr">213</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B214" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>) coupled with the use of serodiagnostic tools that cross-react with other 
 <italic>Babesia</italic> and 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> hemoparasites (
 <xref rid="B215" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B216" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>). Thus, it is important to understand how environmental change (
 <xref rid="B217" ref-type="bibr">217</xref>), including the knowledge of vectors and reservoir hosts, could influence the patterns of zoonotic 
 <italic>Babesia</italic> transmission at the regional level to evaluate the risk for the emergence of Babesiosis among humans in the South Texas–Northeast Mexico transboundary region.
