<p>The pathogenic landscape for leishmaniasis in the transboundary region remains to be fully understood (
 <xref rid="B271" ref-type="bibr">271</xref>). In Mexico and the US, the risk for leishmaniasis has been associated with forest habitat like pluvial rainforest and agricultural fields close to the forest where reservoir mammals share habitat with humans. However, the incidence of leishmaniasis is increasing in domestic habitats as a direct consequence of the spreading of sand fly vectors to urbanized areas, especially the outskirts of cities (

 <xref rid="B271" ref-type="bibr">271</xref>) studied the current and future niche of North and Central American sand flies and concluded that continued landscape modification and future climate change will provide an increased opportunity for the geographic expansion of sand flies and increased risk for human exposure to 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection. The One Health paradigm could also be applied to enhance our ability to recognize 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp. in humans, domestic and wildlife reservoirs, and sand fly vectors in the US-Mexico transboundary region (
