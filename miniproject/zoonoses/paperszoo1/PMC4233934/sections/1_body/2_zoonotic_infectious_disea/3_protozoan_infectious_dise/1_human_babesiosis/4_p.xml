<p>Global change is altering the distribution of ticks and tick-borne diseases globally, and the South Texas–Northeast Mexico transboundary region is not immune to this process (

 <xref rid="B232" ref-type="bibr">232</xref>). Assessing the incidence of HB accurately requires knowledge of the rates for human-tick contact and infection in the vector population. However, HB is considered to be under-reported, even in states with a surveillance program and areas where the disease is known to be endemic (

 <italic>scapularis</italic> inhabiting ecosystems spanning the US–Mexico border. However, the presence of potential vectors and reservoirs indicates that studies are required to determine if zoonotic Babesiosis is an unrecognized cause of illness among humans in that transboundary region. Tick-based surveillance has been proposed as an alternative approach to assess infection risk because it provides a more sensitive method for identifying areas where Babesiosis could be emerging, and could be used to estimate zoonotic prevalence in established areas (

The adaptation of this strategy, with an international perspective and in the context of the One Health concept is suggested, as it was done recently for LD, to establish an early warning system for the emergence of HB in the Texas–Mexico border region (
