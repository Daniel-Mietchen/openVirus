<p>Recent models of risk assessment have identified Hidalgo and Cameron counties as the areas of highest risk for human infection of Chagas disease in Texas (
 <xref rid="B277" ref-type="bibr">277</xref>). Hidalgo County has suitable climatic conditions for the vector (
 <xref rid="B304" ref-type="bibr">304</xref>). This risk factor could be compounded by a high poverty rate among the border population and substandard housing. In Hidalgo County alone, almost 130,000 people live in unincorporated residential areas known as 
 <italic>colonias</italic>. Much of this population is characterized by low incomes (&lt;$10,000 per year) and poorly constructed residences with substandard sanitation and drainage systems, which are landscape characteristics that provide suitable habitat for Triatomine insects (

 <xref rid="B277" ref-type="bibr">277</xref>). Hidalgo and Cameron County form part of the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV), one of the main points of entry for immigrants from Latin America, mainly Mexico. Since Chagas disease is endemic to tropical areas, it is possible that migrants can carry the disease into the US via the LRGV (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Because Chagas became a reportable disease in Texas in 2013, it can be argued that sufficient epidemiologic data are lacking to implement a scientifically sound disease control and prevention program yet. To be effective, a management program to control and prevent Chagas disease in south Texas will probably need to be combined with government and population-based surveillance of insect infestation. Important challenges to overcome include a lack of knowledge among the local population about Chagas disease and how to identify insect vectors.
