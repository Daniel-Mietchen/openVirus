<p>Climate change could drive enhanced transmission of 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). A potential Northern shift from current range due to climate change could occur with two of the most common triatomine 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> vectors in the Southern US (
 <italic>T. gerstaeckeri</italic> and 
 <italic>T. sanguisuga</italic>). Furthermore, an increase in temperature may have influenced the behavior of triatomine species (
 <xref rid="B305" ref-type="bibr">305</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B306" ref-type="bibr">306</xref>). When temperature exceeds 30Â°C and humidity is low, the insects increase their feeding rate to avoid dehydration. In addition, in domestic life cycles, when indoor temperatures increase, the insects may develop shorter life cycles and reach higher population densities (
 <xref rid="B305" ref-type="bibr">305</xref>). High temperatures could also speed up the development of 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> in vectors (
 <xref rid="B307" ref-type="bibr">307</xref>).
