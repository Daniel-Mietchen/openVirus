<p>Twenty-one 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> species have been identified as human pathogens. They are systematically classified in four complexes. In the New World leishmaniasis is caused by species belonging to the subgenus 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> [such as 
 <italic>Leishmania (Leishmania) mexicana</italic>, 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>(Leishmania) amazonensis</italic>] and the subgenus 
 <italic>Viannia</italic> [
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>(Viannia) braziliensis</italic>, 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>(Viannia) panamensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>(Viannia) guyanensis</italic>] (
 <xref rid="B246" ref-type="bibr">246</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B249" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>). In Mexico and US, cutaneous leishmaniasis is caused by a number of 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp. with widespread distributions and a variety of location-specific reservoir species (
 <xref rid="B242" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>). Numerous species causing cutaneous leishmaniasis have been identified in multiple mammalian species. 
 <italic>L. mexicana</italic> is found from Central America to the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico, and cases have been reported in Texas (
 <xref rid="B250" ref-type="bibr">250</xref>). In the Old World, 
 <italic>Leishmania major</italic> is a predominant cause of cutaneous Leishmaniasis.
