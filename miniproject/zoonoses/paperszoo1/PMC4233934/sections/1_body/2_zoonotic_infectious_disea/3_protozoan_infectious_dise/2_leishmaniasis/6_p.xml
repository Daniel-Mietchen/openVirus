<p>A serosurvey conducted in the US looked at over 12,000 foxhounds and other canids, as well as 185 people in 35 States, to determine geographic extent, prevalence, host range, and modes of transmission. This study showed that foxhounds infected with 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp. were present in 18 States. However, no evidence of infection was found in humans (

 <italic>Neotoma micropus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B264" ref-type="bibr">264</xref>). Given the presence of sand fly vectors throughout the Southern US, it is possible that disease rates associated with 
 <italic>L. mexicana</italic> infection will increase in the US due to climate change (

 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic>, 
 <italic>L. braziliensis</italic>, 
 <italic>L. guyanensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>L. panamensis</italic>, have sylvatic reservoirs (
 <xref rid="B242" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>). Thus, human risk factors for zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis are dependent upon exposure to vector species and the presence of reservoir species. Urbanization and wilderness encroachment have resulted in increased interactions between humans, reservoir, and vector species and the establishment of peri-urban domestic life cycles rather than sylvatic ones (
