Here, we present genetic data of H7N7 viruses produced from 72&#x00025; of the poultry farms infected during the 2003 epidemic in the Netherlands. We use phylogenetic analyses to unravel the pathways of virus transmission between farms and between infected areas. In addition, we investigated the evolutionary processes shaping viral genetic diversity, and assess how they could have affected our phylogenetic analyses. Our results show that the H7N7 virus was characterized by a high level of genetic diversity driven mainly by a high neutral substitution rate, purifying selection and limited positive selection. We also identified potential reassortment in the three genes that we have tested, but they had only a limited effect on the resolution of the inter-farm transmission network. Clonal sequencing analyses performed on six farm samples showed that at least one farm sample presented very complex virus diversity and was probably at the origin of chronological anomalies in the transmission network. However, most virus sequences could be grouped within clearly defined and chronologically sound clusters of infection and some likely transmission events between farms located 0.8&#x02013;13 Km apart were identified. In addition, three farms were found as most likely source of virus introduction in distantly located new areas. These long distance transmission events were likely facilitated by human-mediated transport, underlining the need for strict enforcement of biosafety measures during outbreaks. This study shows that in-depth genetic analysis of virus outbreaks at multiple scales can provide critical information on virus transmission dynamics and can be used to increase our capacity to efficiently control epidemics.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses have affected poultry worldwide in the last decades, resulting in vast socioeconomic damages and many human infections. It is important to determine the route of transmission between poultry farms to be able to implement efficient control measures. Here, we investigate possible use of sequence data to unravel the route of virus transmission during an HPAI H7N7 epidemic that took place in 2003 in the Netherlands. We obtained virus sequence data from most of the outbreaks during the epidemic, and found a high level of genetic diversity driven by a rapid evolutionary rate of HPAI H7N7 virus. The phylogenetic inference of the inter-farm transmission network turned out to be difficult due to the presence of potential reassortant virus strains, multiple mutations at highly variable sites and within farm virus diversity. However, most virus samples could be grouped within clearly defined and chronologically sound clusters of infection, giving us valuable insights on the diffusion of the virus during the outbreak.

Thanks to increasing availability of avian influenza virus sequence data and the development of new computational and statistical methods of analysis, phylogenetic studies have largely contributed to a better understanding of the emergence, spread and evolution of HPAI epidemics <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Cattoli1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1002094-Lemey1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. However, sampling of genetic data has never been used or dense enough to allow detailed studies of a single outbreak <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Holmes1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The rapid evolutionary dynamics of avian influenza viruses suggest that sufficient genetic diversity may be produced during an outbreak in poultry to permit the reconstruction of the inter-flock transmission network, providing important insights for the implementation of efficient control measures. Notably, such detailed genetic data could be used in combination with epidemiological data to study the dynamics of epidemic spread, as has been done for the 2001 food-and-mouth disease outbreak in the UK <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Cottam1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, much remains to be learned about the way evolutionary processes, such as natural selection or reassortment, shape avian influenza virus diversity during an epidemic and how these processes could affect the inference of virus transmission dynamics <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Holmes1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. We also expect that successful identification of inter-farm transmission pathways depend on the extent and structure of intra-flock and intra-animal viral genetic variation, but perhaps most notably on the size of the virus population bottleneck in the process of inter-farm transmission <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Holmes1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>The epidemic of HPAI H7N7 in the Netherlands in 2003 represents a unique opportunity to study the epidemiological and evolutionary processes involved in HPAI transmission dynamics in detail. This epidemic started in the most poultry-dense area of the Netherlands (Gelderse valley, Gelderland province) on February 28, 2003. Despite implementation of control measures, the outbreak spread across the entire Gelderland area as well as in a contiguous central region with a lower density of poultry farms. New outbreaks were reported in April in the Limburg province, another poultry-dense area in the South of the Netherlands, in Germany and in Belgium <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Stegeman1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. A total of 255 Dutch farms became infected in a 9 weeks period, and more than 30 million birds were culled during the course of the epidemic <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Stegeman1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The virus was transmitted to 89 people who were directly involved in handling of infected poultry <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Koopmans1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, including one veterinarian who died after developing acute respiratory distress syndrome <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Fouchier1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Detailed data gathered during the epidemic (e.g. location, date of suspicion and sampling, type of farm, culling date) have been used to estimate epidemiological parameters characterizing this epidemic, notably the spatial range over which the virus spread between farms <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Boender1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, the transmission route between farms could not be resolved, leaving critical questions about the mechanisms of virus transmission and the efficiency of control measures unanswered.</p><p>The H7N7 virus was sampled from the majority of the 255 farms infected, but, to date, only little genetic data have been published from this epidemic <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Fouchier1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002094-deWit1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In this study, we present virus sequence data from 72&#x00025; of the farms infected during the 2003 HPAI H7N7 epidemic in the Netherlands. Phylogenetic analyses were used to unravel the pathways of virus transmission between farms and between outbreak areas. In addition, we investigated the evolutionary processes (substitution rate, selection pressure, reassortment etc.) that were shaping the H7N7 genetic diversity. We also examined the within-flock viral sequence variation on selected farms using clonal sequencing to assess its impact on our phylogenetic analyses. Finally we discuss the implications of the obtained results on our knowledge of the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of avian influenza viruses and consequences for disease control.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>High levels of genetic diversity in HPAI H7N7</title><p>Virus RNA was extracted from homogenized trachea tissue samples from dead chickens (5 chickens per sample) obtained from 184 of the 255 farms infected during the H7N7 outbreak (72&#x00025; coverage of the epidemic, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002094-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

Results obtained in this study showed that the HA, NA and PB2 gene segments were characterized by a high level of genetic diversity, allowing the identification of unique virus sequences for 76&#x00025; of the farm samples analyzed. The estimates of substitution rates for the HA and NA gene averaged around 1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> substitutions per site per year, which is among the highest observed for avian influenza viruses <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. It suggests that enough viral genetic diversity can be produced within a short period of time during an HPAI epidemic to allow the use of partial genome sequences to determine virus transmission dynamics with phylogenetic analyses.</p><p>Analyses of selection pressure showed that this rapid evolutionary rate was mainly driven by a combination of neutral evolution and purifying selection pressure, with only a limited amount of site-specific positive selection pressure identified in the HA and NA genes. TMRCA estimations indicate that the H7N7 virus may have been introduced in poultry weeks before the first mortality was reported. This is in agreement with epidemiological models based on mortality data indicating that approximately two weeks can elapse after introduction of H7N7 in a flock before change in mortality is observed <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Bos1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The presence of identical virus sequences in multiple farms infected at different time periods (e.g. 6 farms in group G9 spanning a period of more than 5 weeks) also suggests that the HPAI H7N7 virus was already very stable and well adapted to poultry when the epidemic started. In addition, the phylogenetic network showed that many amino acid changes associated with increased pathogenicity in mammals appeared already at an early stage during the epidemic. These results have serious implications for disease control, as they demonstrate that early and regular monitoring of poultry farms is necessary to detect and contain avian influenza viruses before they fully adapt to domestic poultry and become a potential risk for animal and public health.</p><p>We identified several other evolutionary processes that could have affected the observed viral genetic diversity and might have led to misleading results in our phylogenetic analyses. Firstly, the presence of reassortant viruses in our dataset could provoke poor resolution or even false identification of farm-to-farm transmission events. Three virus strains (F45, F76 and F143) and one cluster of closely related viruses (Cluster IV) were identified as potential reassortants due to their discordant position in the phylogenetic trees and the network. However, the signal of reassortment in all sequences was closely associated with signal of positive selection at specific amino acid residues, so the discordances in the phylogenies may be due to convergent evolution driven by the adaptive advantages conferred by these amino acid changes. In all cases, we prefer to consider these farm samples unsuitable for the study of the H7N7 inter-farm transmission dynamics until more is known about these possible reassortment events.</p><p>Secondly, an important limitation of our genetic dataset is the characterisation of only one virus sequence per farm, whereas each farm (and each individual host within this farm) may contain a wide variety of closely related virus variants. Our genetic data could be considered a reliable tool to elucidate the transmission pathways of the HPAI H7N7 between farms if it can be assumed that the virus genotype obtained for each farm samples represents the dominant strain in the farm sample and that this dominant strain is the one most likely to be transmitted to other farms. These assumptions were partially supported by clonal sequencing performed on six farm samples, as the genotype used in our dataset corresponded to the dominant variant in the clone population in 5 out of 6 farms. This dominant variant represented &#x0003e;50&#x00025; of the clones in 4 samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002094-t004">Table 4</xref>), suggesting that more cloning effort would most probably not change this result. The identification of a second sub-dominant strain directly related to the dominant strain in two samples suggests that dominance can evolve during the course of infection within a flock. This evolution of dominance could have caused the genetic differences observed between farm samples directly connected in the network. These results have, however, to be considered with caution because of the small number of farm tested with the cloning technique and of the very small sampling relative to flock size obtained from each farm (5 chickens per farm).</p><p>Importantly, clonal sequencing of the one farm sample (F191) also showed that the virus strain originally sequenced was not the dominant variant of the farm but was a potentially inactive variant (as it contained a frame shift deletion) present at a low frequency. It suggests that our genetic dataset was not always composed of the dominant genotype in the farm samples, potentially affecting the resolution of the transmission network. The variant with highest frequency in sample F191 represented 17&#x00025; of the clones, suggesting that the absence of a highly dominant strain may have allowed the sequencing of another variant. This lack of dominance could be due to the production of a high variety of variants with stalk deletion, possibly associated with the evolution of a deletion-prone polymerase in viruses infecting the first farm in the Limburg area (F191). If it is the case, it would suggest that only the 13 samples presenting deletions in our dataset may have been wrongly positioned in the phylogenetic network due to the dominance issue.</p><p>Most mutations differentiating the multiple genetic variants from the dominant variant in the clone populations were associated with amino acid changes or deletions, suggesting that the virus population within a flock (and possibly within a single individual) is composed of strains of variable fitness, with one or few best-fit strains dominating the population. We cannot rule out the possibility that the genetic variation observed in our cloning results is an artefact of RNA manipulation. However, the error rate of the RT polymerase used (SuperScript III, Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA, USA) was estimated to be 1/15,000 by the manufacturer, so it should not have a major influence on an analysis targeting an 800 bp gene region. Also, the genetic variation we obtained is similar to what has been observed in other avian Influenza viruses using a similar approach <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Iqbal1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, or in Hepatitis C Virus using a pyrosequencing approach <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.That 97&#x00025; of the mutations identified in all clone variants examined were not found in the complete epidemic dataset suggests that inter-farm transmission of H7N7 was accompanied by a population bottleneck. It is important to note that this analysis was realized with a small number of farm samples, and that the small number of chicken sampled per farm greatly limited our capacity to assess properly the viral diversity within flocks. A larger study, probably involving a pyrosequencing approach <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Eriksson1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and experimental infections in controlled environment, would be necessary to further tackle the issues of intra- and inter- host viral genetic diversity and transmission bottlenecks in HPAI.</p><p>Results from the network and the clonal sequencing analysis of F191 showed that some mutations occurred multiple times at different time periods, leading to chronological anomalies in the farm-to-farm connections identified in the phylogenetic network. These anomalies were limited to clusters including Limburg samples, suggesting that the high viral genetic diversity produced during the outbreak in Limburg may be at their origin. Interestingly, reports from officials involved in the control of the epidemic indicate that F191 may have been infected for over a week before being reported and sampled. Also this farm housed &#x0003e;10,000 turkeys, a species shown to play a key role in the evolution of AI pathogenicity in domestic animals <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Cilloni1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Pillai1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Only few other turkey farms were infected during the epidemic, and their culling was swift according to the reports. Therefore, it is likely that the long infection period of the F191 turkey farm is at the origin of its high genetic diversity and of many anomalies in the phylogenetic network. Additional cloning work may help resolving all chronological anomalies in the network. An interesting alternative would be to combine our genetic network with temporal data (and other epidemiological data) in a mathematical framework to calculate the likelihood of potential transmission events, as it has been done for the 2001 food-and-mouth disease outbreak in the UK <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Cottam1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Overall, our results suggest that a combination of evolutionary processes, such as multiple mutations at highly variable sites, positive selection, and/or reassortment, drove the genetic diversity observed in the HPAI H7N7. The effect of these processes might have been stronger at the early stages of the epidemic, as farms may have been infected for longer time before control measures were taken (as reported for F191). The long branches and poor quality of connections at the base of the network supports this hypothesis. Despite this complex evolutionary history of the H7N7 virus, most farm samples could be grouped within clearly defined and chronologically sound clusters of infection, giving us valuable insights on the spreading of the virus during the epidemic.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Inter-farm transmission dynamics of HPAI H7N7</title><p>Boender <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1002094-Boender1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> have previously performed a spatial analysis of inter-farm transmission using epidemiological data from the HPAI H7N7 epidemic. They showed that risk of transmission decreased with inter-farm distance and they could map higher-risk areas for the spread of the virus. However, the epidemiological data did not permit the resolution of the pathways of transmission between farms. Our results show that the analysis of viral genetic data can complement epidemiological studies, allowing notably the identification of clusters of infections and of specific farm-to-farm transmission events. The geographical position of the farms associated with the transmission clusters identified from the phylogenetic analyses is indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002094-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Most of the farms of Cluster I are located geographically close to one another, suggesting that inter-farm virus transmission during the epidemic was at least partially caused by short distance air-borne movements of virus particles <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Lebarbenchon1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, farms of cluster III showed a combination of aggregated and dispersed geographical location, whereas Cluster II and Cluster III were more dispersed within the Gelderland area. It is possible that such transmission between farms separated by 5&#x02013;15 km occurred naturally, as avian influenza viruses could persist for long periods in the environment (e.g. water or feather) <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Yamamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002094-DomanskaBlicharz1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The poultry production system with its professional contacts could also have favoured virus spread during the epidemic. Notably, some operations of farms, such as egg collection, were resumed during the epidemic and may have played a role in virus transmission <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. We estimated that the H7N7 virus was present in poultry maybe weeks before the first outbreak, so it is possible that the virus spread via a network of contacts formed by normal poultry operations across the Gelderland area before the implementation of the transport ban. Also, it has been recently shown that many humans involved in the control of the epidemic were infected by H7N7 in farms they visited <xref rid="ppat.1002094-BosMarian1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Thus, H7N7 virus might have been transmitted between farms by infected people or by human-mediated mechanical transport. Analyzing the sequence of virus isolated from infected humans and the movements of people involved in control activities could help to determine whether human-mediated transport played a role in the inter-farm transmissions.</p><p>Importantly, our results also suggest that a discrete number of long distance transmission events were at the origin of the virus spread into new areas, rather than a slow wave-like movement of the virus towards the south of the country. Notably, it is interesting to note that farm UN167, a back-yard poultry farm, seems to be at the origin of the outbreak in the Limburg area. Conversely, Bavink <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1002094-Bavinck1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> showed with epidemiological models that back-yard poultry probably played a marginal role during the outbreak, suggesting that pre-emptive culling of this type of farm may not always be necessary. Our results suggest that these types of poultry farms should still be considered important in control strategies. This result and all other farm-to-farm transmission events identified should be considered with caution because 27&#x00025; of the farms infected during the epidemic could not be sequenced. However, only few missing farms could still be at the origin of the infection in Limburg and all are located in Gelderland &#x0003e;50 km away from the index farm of Limburg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002094-g001">Figure 1</xref>). It strongly suggests that a long distance transmission event is at the origin of the second important H7N7 outbreak in the Netherlands. Such long distance movements of avian influenza are most likely the results of human-mediated transport of the virus, although airborne spread cannot be totally ruled out. Possible causes of human-mediated virus movements are lack of knowledge or poor compliance of the biosafety measures implemented, such as unauthorized movements of birds or their products. Better enforcement and more widely distributed biosafety instructions and training could substantially decrease the risk of introduction of the virus to new areas. Future studies combining genetic data with available epidemiological data should provide a better resolution of the inter-farm transmission network that shaped the epidemic, and further understanding on the mechanisms involved in H7N7 spread during the epidemic. This study shows that partial viral genomic data (here 3 genes out of the 8 composing the AI genome) can provide important insights on the transmission dynamics of HPAI viruses even at the scale of temporally and spatially limited epidemic. Our study also strongly suggests that comprehensive study of the evolutionary processes involved in shaping virus diversity are needed in order to use viral genetic data in such ways.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Viral sequence data</title><p>Samples were collected as part of the diagnosis by veterinarians of the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (the Netherlands) and submitted to the Central Veterinary Institute for confirmation by virus isolation.

Nucleotide sequences are available from the GISAID database (EPI_ISL_82561-82902). Sequences were aligned to the original HA or NA sequence obtained for each farm samples using BIOEDIT <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, and nucleotide differences were recorded manually.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1002094.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Time-scaled phylogenies (dates on the horizontal axis) inferred using Bayesian MCMC analysis from (A) HA gene; (B) NA gene; (C) PB2 gene.
