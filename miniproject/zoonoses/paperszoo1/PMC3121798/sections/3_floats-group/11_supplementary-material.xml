  <p>Bootscan recombination analysis on the full dataset of concatenated H7N7 virus sequences. Sequences obtained from (A) F45, (B) F76, and (C) F143 were used as query in the analysis, with a 800 bp window size and step size of 10 bp. A schematic diagram of the concatenated HA, NA and PB2 virus segments is shown on top.</p>
