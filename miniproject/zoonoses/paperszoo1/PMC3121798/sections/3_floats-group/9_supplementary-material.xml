  <p>Time-scaled phylogenies (dates on the horizontal axis) inferred using Bayesian MCMC analysis from (A) HA gene; (B) NA gene; (C) PB2 gene. Nodes supported by &gt;0.7 posterior probability are indicated by a grey dot. Posterior probability values from the time-scaled BMCMC method, the MrBayes BMCMC method, the Maximum Likelihood method (1,000 ML bootstrap replications) are also indicated (tsBMCMC/MrBMCMC/ML). Samples sharing identical HA, NA, and/or PB2 (named as “Group1-11” in the trees, when &gt;3 isolates) are listed in
