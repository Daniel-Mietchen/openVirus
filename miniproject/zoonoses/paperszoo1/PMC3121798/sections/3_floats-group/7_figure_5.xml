  <title>Schematic diagrams summarizing within-flock genetic diversity in 6 farm samples.</title>
  <p>The sequence variants found by clonal sequencing of partial NA and HA genes in 6 different samples are represented by coloured circles sized relatively to their frequency. Total number of clones sequenced per sample (n) is indicated. The exact number of copies of each genetic variant is indicated when &gt;1. Variants in black correspond to the sequence originally isolated in each farm. Each variant is separated by nucleotide substitutions represented by filled black dots (non-synonymous changes) or open dots (synonymous changes), and by deletions represented by squares. The exact position of the deletion in the NA gene is indicated. The red node represents a variant similar to the sequence obtained for the F192 sample (see main text). The white node represents a potential missing variant.</p>
