<p>Samples were collected as part of the diagnosis by veterinarians of the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (the Netherlands) and submitted to the Central Veterinary Institute for confirmation by virus isolation. The authors of this study were not involved in sample collection. Viral RNA was directly extracted from 184 infected trachea tissue samples from dead chickens (5 chickens per sample) using a High Pure Viral RNA extraction kit (Roche Diagnostics Indianapolis IN, USA). Complementary DNA was synthesized by reverse transcription reaction using SuperScript III (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA, USA), and gene amplification by PCR was performed using the PCR Expand high fidelity kit (Roche Diagnostics Indianapolis IN, USA) and primers specific for the hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) and basic polymerase 2 (PB2) gene segments. Sequencing was performed by using the BigDye Terminator v. 1.1. sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City CA , USA) and an ABI Prism 3130 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Primers and PCR protocols are detailed in
