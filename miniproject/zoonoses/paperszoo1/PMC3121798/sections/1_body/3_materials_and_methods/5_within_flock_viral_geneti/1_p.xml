<p>PCR amplification targeting a 850 bp portion of the NA gene (bases 57–908) was performed on cDNA obtained from five samples (F26, F36, F167, F191 and F193) using the PCR Expand high fidelity kit (Roche Diagnostics). An additional PCR was used to amplify a 570 bp portion of the HA gene (bases 81–650) on the two samples from Limburg only (F191, F193). Primers and PCR protocols are described in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002094.s007">Table S4</xref>. PCR products were purified using the High Pure PCR Products Purification kit (Roche Diagnostics), and were cloned using the pGEM-T Easy Vector System (Promega, Madison WI, USA). Clones with inserts of the correct size were identified by agarose gel electrophoresis. A total of 50–56 clones with NA inserts were sequenced per farm sample using the BigDye Terminator sequencing kit, version 1.1. and an ABI Prism 3130 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Nucleotide sequences are available from the GISAID database (EPI_ISL_82561-82902). Sequences were aligned to the original HA or NA sequence obtained for each farm samples using BIOEDIT
