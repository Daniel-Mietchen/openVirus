<p>Homologous recombination within each gene segment was searched using Recombination Detection Program version 2 (RDP2) 
 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Heath1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Putative reassortant viruses were preliminarily identified by the topological incongruity between transmission clusters identified across the phylogenies of different gene segments (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">results</xref>). This was further investigated with a subset of virus sequences including samples from transmission cluster I (n = 9), cluster II (n = 19), cluster III (n = 8), and cluster IV (n = 10), from Limburg area (n = 10), and four additional samples with incongruent phylogenies (F45, F76, F143, F210). For each sample, the sequences from the 3 genes were manually concatenated, and the resulting alignment was analyzed using bootscan analyses
