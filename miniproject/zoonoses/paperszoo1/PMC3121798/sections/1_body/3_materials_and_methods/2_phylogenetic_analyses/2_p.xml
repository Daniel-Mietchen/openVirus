<p>Additional methods were used to infer the phylogenetic relationships from the HA, NA and PB2 datasets. A Bayesian MCMC inference method was performed in MRBAYES 
 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Huelsenbeck1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, with multiple runs of 10 million generations with a 20% burn-in, sampling every 100 generations, and using the default heating parameters. A Maximum Likelihood (ML) method implemented in PHYML 
 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Guindon1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> was also used with a bootstrap analysis of 1,000 full bootstrap replicates to test the robustness of tree topologies. The three gene segment alignments were manually concatenated to generate a single alignment that was used to construct a phylogenetic network using the Median Joining method 
 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Bandelt1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> implemented in the program NETWORK 
 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Network1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. This model-free method uses a parsimony approach, based on pairwise differences, to connect each sequence to its closest neighbour, and allows the creation of internal nodes (“median vectors”), which could be interpreted as unsampled or extinct ancestral genotypes to link the existing genotypes in the most parsimonious way. The parameter 
 <italic>epsilon</italic>, which controls the level of homoplasy, was set at the same value as the weight of characters used to calculate the genetic distances (weight value  = 10). The average number of nucleotide differences within and between the phylogenetic clusters identified was calculated with MEGA
