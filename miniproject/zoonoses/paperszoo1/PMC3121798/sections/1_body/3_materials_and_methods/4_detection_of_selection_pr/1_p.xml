<p>Selection pressure on the HA, NA and PB2 genes was investigated by estimating the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions (

 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>). Likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) were used to test whether model M1a of neutral evolution (sites restricted to 0&lt;
 <italic>ω</italic>&lt;1) or model M2a of positive selection (allows sites with 
 <italic>ω</italic> &gt;1) was a statistically better fit to the data
