<p>Virus RNA was extracted from homogenized trachea tissue samples from dead chickens (5 chickens per sample) obtained from 184 of the 255 farms infected during the H7N7 outbreak (72% coverage of the epidemic, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002094-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We could not process more samples due to logistical constraints, but we considered that this coverage was sufficient to reach the aims of this study. The viral sequence datasets consist of full-length sequences of the H7-hemagglutinin (HA), N7-neuraminidase (NA) and basic polymerase 2 (PB2) gene segments; preliminary analysis of five full viral genomes previously obtained from humans and chickens infected at early and late stages of the H7N7 outbreak (available in public databases) showed that these three genes contain the highest level of genetic diversity among the 8 gene segments (data not shown). Farms are labelled from F1 to F255, following the order of sample submission to the laboratory during the outbreak. Samples were selected for sequencing in order to cover the entire timeline and all areas of the epidemic (Gelderland, Limburg, central area and southwest area; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002094-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, all farms infected within 7 days before the first report of infection in the Limburg area (April 3, 2003) were analysed in an attempt to find the source of this new outbreak. Details of location and date of sample collection, and GISAID accession numbers are listed for each sample in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002094.s004">Table S1</xref>. The HA, NA and PB2 sequences of the human fatal case (A/Netherlands/219/03, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Fouchier1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>) were included in the final dataset.
