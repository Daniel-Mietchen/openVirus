<p>A total of 74 substitution sites were recovered in HA, defining 71 sequences among which 50 were unique in the dataset. NA was less polymorphic (59 substitution sites), but a strand of 52 to 74 nucleotides in the NA stalk region was also found deleted in 13 samples from the Limburg area, with a total of 7 different types of deletions, 3 of which resulted in a frame shift in the NA coding sequence (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002094.s004">Table S1</xref>). In total, the complete NA sequence dataset defined 64 different genotypes (42 singletons). The PB2 sequence data had the highest number of polymorphic sites (81), defining 64 different genotypes (38 singletons). The combination of the genetic data from the three genes permitted us to define farm specific genotypes for 141 out of the 184 farms (76%). The HA, NA and PB2 sequence datasets were found to be free of homologous recombination using Recombination Detection Program version 2 (RDP2)
