<p>To estimate the viral genetic diversity within hosts and within flocks, we performed clonal sequencing targeting an 850 bp portion of the NA gene (position 57–908) on 6 farm samples (5 chickens per sample). We chose 4 samples (F36, F167, F191 and F193;

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002094-g004">Figure 4</xref>) in order to further assess the origin of the Limburg outbreak and of the chronological anomalies detected in the network. We also performed clonal sequencing on the F26 farm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002094-g001">Figure 1</xref>), because two samples taken three days apart (March 6, and March 9, 2003) were available for this farm, allowing us to assess changes in viral genetic diversity within a flock. A total of 50–54 clones with NA inserts were sequenced per sample (
