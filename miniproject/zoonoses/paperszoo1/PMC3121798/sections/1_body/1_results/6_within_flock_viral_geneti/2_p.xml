<p>For all the 4 samples tested, the most abundant NA and HA sequence variant represented 17–76% of the obtained sequences (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002094-g005">Figure 5</xref>). With the exception of the NA variants obtained for F191, this dominant variant was identical to the sequence originally obtained and used in the general HA and NA datasets. The other identified sequence variants were usually present at low frequency (most of the time only once) and directly linked to the dominant variant, differing from it by 1–4 nucleotide substitutions (

The clonal diversity of NA in F26 (March 9, 2003) and F193, and of HA in F191 were characterised by the presence of another sequence variant at relatively high frequency and at the origin of low-frequency variants. The diversity of NA sequence variants was extremely high in F191, with all variants but one containing a stalk deletion (18 different types of deletion were identified;
