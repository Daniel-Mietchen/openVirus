<p>Rates of nucleotide substitution and time of most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of the HPAI H7N7 viruses were estimated separately for the three gene datasets using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) method 
 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Drummond1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> as implemented in BEAST 
 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Drummond2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, using sampling dates to calibrate the molecular clock (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002094.s004">Table S1</xref>). Bayes Factors (BF) 
 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Suchard1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> were used to select among strict and relaxed clock models of evolution 
 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Drummond3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and among demographic models of population growth. The relaxed uncorrelated exponential clock model associated with an exponential growth model fitted better the data (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002094.s005">Table S2</xref>). The analyses showed that the mean substitution rate was very high for both HA and NA datasets (1.18×10
 <sup>−2</sup> and 1.02×10
 <sup>−2</sup> substitutions per site per year (substitutions/site/year), respectively; 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002094-t001">Table 1</xref>), whereas the estimated rate for the PB2 dataset was twice lower (0.54×10
 <sup>−2</sup> substitutions/site/year). These estimates were associated with large 95% highest posterior density intervals (HPD; 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002094-t001">Table 1</xref>). TMRCA estimations showed that the origin of the HPAI H7N7 virus dated back to mid-January 2003 according to the HA dataset, and as far back as late December and late October 2002 for the NA and PB2 datasets, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002094-t001">Table 1</xref>). Again, estimations from the NA and PB2 datasets were affected by large HPD intervals. Similar estimations of substitution rates and TMRCA were obtained with other sub-optimal clock and demographic models (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002094.s005">Table S2</xref>), showing that these results are robust and not artefacts of the priors used in the Bayesian analyses.
