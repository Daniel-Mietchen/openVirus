<p>We found discrepancies in the phylogenetic relationship between the four identified transmission clusters in the HA, NA and PB2 phylogenies. Cluster III was closely related to Cluster IV in the HA phylogeny, but Cluster III was closely related to Cluster I in the NA and PB2 phylogenies, and Cluster IV closely related to Cluster II in the PB2 phylogeny (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002094-g002">Figure 2A–C</xref>). These discordances suggest that one or more of the transmission clusters originated from reassortment events. We further investigated the putative reassortant viruses using bootscan analyses 
 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Salimen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> on a selected dataset (n = 50) of manually concatenated HA-NA-PB2 sequences (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002094.s003">Figure S3A–D</xref>; see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">methods</xref>). Results of the bootscan plot showed that Cluster IV was highly similar to Cluster III in the HA segment, but clustered with Cluster II in the NA and PB2 segments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002094-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The graph did not produce a clear-cut breakpoint between the HA and the NA-PB2 segments, probably because of the poor level of genetic diversity in some gene regions. We noticed that sequences grouped in the Cluster III and IV were all characterized by the presence of the A143T amino acid change in their HA gene (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002094.s004">Table S1</xref>). Removing the codon position 143 from the HA dataset resulted in the loss of support for the clustering of these two groups of sequences in the phylogenetic trees and the bootscan analysis, thus for the signal of reassortment (
