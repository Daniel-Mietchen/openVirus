<p>To assess the inter-farm transmission network, we manually concatenated the HA, NA and PB2 sequences for all virus samples, and used this single alignment to construct a Median Joining phylogenetic network 
 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Bandelt1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> with the program NETWORK 
 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Network1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002094-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The network obtained included all the most parsimonious trees, thus represented all the plausible evolutionary pathways linking the farm samples. The network showed that most virus sequences were grouped in multiple clusters of infection, including the 4 transmission clusters identified with the gene-specific phylogenetic analyses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002094-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Sequences within these 4 clusters were separated in average by 3–4 nucleotide differences, whereas 11–20 differences were observed between clusters. All clusters were connected at the base of the network by complex reticulations that rendered the relationships between the clusters hard to determine. In most cases, one virus sequence identified in multiple farms was at the origin of an infection cluster. All Limburg samples (apart from F222) were grouped with Gelderland samples in 2 clusters that were separated by one single mutation step. These 2 clusters presented some chronological anomalies (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002094.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Notably, the network showed that a virus strain from a farm (F18) that had been culled a month before the first infection in Limburg was the closest ancestor to a group of 3 Limburg samples (F192, F204 and F206;

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002094.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Also, according to the network, 4 virus strains that emerged in Gelderland during the first 3 weeks of the epidemic (F40, F57, F103 and F107) would have originated from a virus strain that infected farms in Limburg after the 5
 <sup>th</sup> week of the epidemic.
