<p>We identified 15 pairs of farm samples that uniquely shared identical sequence genotypes, representing likely transmission events (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002094-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, we could identify 13 pairs of samples that were unambiguously connected in the phylogenetic network. Of these 28 likely inter-farm transmission events, 25 involved farms located in the same infected area, with a distance of 0.8–13.6 Km separating them (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002094-t002">Table 2</xref>). The three remaining transmission events linked farms separated by much larger distances (31.3–84.4 Km). The two longest transmission events corresponded to a transmission from a farm in Gelderland to the index farm of Limburg (F167–F191, distance: 84.4 Km), and from a farm in the central area to a farm located is the southwest of the Netherlands (F236–F238, distance: 65.9 Km;
