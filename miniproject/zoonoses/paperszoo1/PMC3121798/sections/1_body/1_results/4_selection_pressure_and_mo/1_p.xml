<p>We assessed the selection pressures acting on the three genes by estimating the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions (

 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. When averaged over all sites, all three genes were predominantly affected by neutral or purifying selection (
 <italic>ω</italic> &lt;1), with PB2 under the strongest negative natural selection (
 <italic>ω</italic> = 0.313; 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002094-t003">Table 3</xref>). Additionally, likelihood ratio tests revealed that a model allowing site-specific positive selection pressure (M2a in CODEML) fitted significantly better than a model of nearly neutral selection (M1a) for the HA gene (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002094-t003">Table 3</xref>). A Bayes Empirical Bayes analysis 
 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Yang2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> identified 7 amino acid sites in HA that were under positive selection (residues 127, 129, 143, 183, 188, 284, 340), although none of these sites were supported by a significant posterior probability value (
 <italic>Pr</italic>&lt;0.95). We further tried to identify sites under positive selection in the three genes using the single-likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC), the random effect likelihood (REL), and the fixed effect likelihood (FEL) methods 
 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-KosakovskyPond1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The SLAC and FEL methods failed to detect positive selection in any of the three genes. The REL method identified the same 7 amino acid sites in HA already detected with CODEML as under positive selection with high posterior probability values (
 <italic>Pr</italic>&gt;0.95). In addition, it detected 7 amino acid sites under positive selection in the NA dataset (residues 54, 64, 66, 200, 247, 442, 458).
