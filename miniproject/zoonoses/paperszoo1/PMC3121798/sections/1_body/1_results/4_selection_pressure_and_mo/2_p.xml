<p>The biological functions of most of these positively selected residues in the HA and NA molecules are not known. Only the A143T substitution, which introduces a new potential N-linked glycosylation site in HA, has previously been identified as being associated with enhanced virulence in avian hosts 
 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Perdue1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Also, three positively selected amino acid changes, A143T in HA, and T442A and P458S in NA, have been also detected in the human fatal case 
 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Fouchier1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and have been shown to contribute in enhanced replication efficiency of the HPAI H7N7 virus in mammalian hosts 
 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-deWit1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The A143T substitution was found in virus samples from 27 different farms (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002094-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The T442A and P458S amino acid changes in NA were present in the majority of the farm samples (113 farms). Three other amino acid changes identified in the human fatal case and linked to enhanced replication in mammalian hosts (E627K in PB2; N308S and A346V in NA 
 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-deWit1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>) were not found to be positively selected. The N308S and A346V in NA were identified in 12 and 36 farm samples, respectively, as well as in the fatal human case (
