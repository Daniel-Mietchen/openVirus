<p>The H7N7 virus was sampled from the majority of the 255 farms infected, but, to date, only little genetic data have been published from this epidemic

 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-deWit1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In this study, we present virus sequence data from 72% of the farms infected during the 2003 HPAI H7N7 epidemic in the Netherlands. Phylogenetic analyses were used to unravel the pathways of virus transmission between farms and between outbreak areas. In addition, we investigated the evolutionary processes (substitution rate, selection pressure, reassortment etc.) that were shaping the H7N7 genetic diversity. We also examined the within-flock viral sequence variation on selected farms using clonal sequencing to assess its impact on our phylogenetic analyses. Finally we discuss the implications of the obtained results on our knowledge of the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of avian influenza viruses and consequences for disease control.
