<p>Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses represent a major concern for public health and global economy, as outbreaks in the last decades resulted in vast socioeconomic damages and numerous human infections. Thanks to increasing availability of avian influenza virus sequence data and the development of new computational and statistical methods of analysis, phylogenetic studies have largely contributed to a better understanding of the emergence, spread and evolution of HPAI epidemics

 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Holmes1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The rapid evolutionary dynamics of avian influenza viruses suggest that sufficient genetic diversity may be produced during an outbreak in poultry to permit the reconstruction of the inter-flock transmission network, providing important insights for the implementation of efficient control measures. Notably, such detailed genetic data could be used in combination with epidemiological data to study the dynamics of epidemic spread, as has been done for the 2001 food-and-mouth disease outbreak in the UK 
 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Cottam1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, much remains to be learned about the way evolutionary processes, such as natural selection or reassortment, shape avian influenza virus diversity during an epidemic and how these processes could affect the inference of virus transmission dynamics 
 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Holmes1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. We also expect that successful identification of inter-farm transmission pathways depend on the extent and structure of intra-flock and intra-animal viral genetic variation, but perhaps most notably on the size of the virus population bottleneck in the process of inter-farm transmission
