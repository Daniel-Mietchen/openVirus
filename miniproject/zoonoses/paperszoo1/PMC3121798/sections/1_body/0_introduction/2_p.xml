<p>The epidemic of HPAI H7N7 in the Netherlands in 2003 represents a unique opportunity to study the epidemiological and evolutionary processes involved in HPAI transmission dynamics in detail. This epidemic started in the most poultry-dense area of the Netherlands (Gelderse valley, Gelderland province) on February 28, 2003. Despite implementation of control measures, the outbreak spread across the entire Gelderland area as well as in a contiguous central region with a lower density of poultry farms. New outbreaks were reported in April in the Limburg province, another poultry-dense area in the South of the Netherlands, in Germany and in Belgium

Detailed data gathered during the epidemic (e.g. location, date of suspicion and sampling, type of farm, culling date) have been used to estimate epidemiological parameters characterizing this epidemic, notably the spatial range over which the virus spread between farms
