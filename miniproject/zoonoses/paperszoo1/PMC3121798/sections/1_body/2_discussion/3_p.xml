<p>We identified several other evolutionary processes that could have affected the observed viral genetic diversity and might have led to misleading results in our phylogenetic analyses. Firstly, the presence of reassortant viruses in our dataset could provoke poor resolution or even false identification of farm-to-farm transmission events. Three virus strains (F45, F76 and F143) and one cluster of closely related viruses (Cluster IV) were identified as potential reassortants due to their discordant position in the phylogenetic trees and the network. However, the signal of reassortment in all sequences was closely associated with signal of positive selection at specific amino acid residues, so the discordances in the phylogenies may be due to convergent evolution driven by the adaptive advantages conferred by these amino acid changes. In all cases, we prefer to consider these farm samples unsuitable for the study of the H7N7 inter-farm transmission dynamics until more is known about these possible reassortment events.</p>
