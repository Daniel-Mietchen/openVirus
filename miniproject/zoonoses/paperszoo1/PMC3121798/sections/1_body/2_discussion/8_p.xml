<p>Overall, our results suggest that a combination of evolutionary processes, such as multiple mutations at highly variable sites, positive selection, and/or reassortment, drove the genetic diversity observed in the HPAI H7N7. The effect of these processes might have been stronger at the early stages of the epidemic, as farms may have been infected for longer time before control measures were taken (as reported for F191). The long branches and poor quality of connections at the base of the network supports this hypothesis. Despite this complex evolutionary history of the H7N7 virus, most farm samples could be grouped within clearly defined and chronologically sound clusters of infection, giving us valuable insights on the spreading of the virus during the epidemic.</p>
