<p>Analyses of selection pressure showed that this rapid evolutionary rate was mainly driven by a combination of neutral evolution and purifying selection pressure, with only a limited amount of site-specific positive selection pressure identified in the HA and NA genes. TMRCA estimations indicate that the H7N7 virus may have been introduced in poultry weeks before the first mortality was reported. This is in agreement with epidemiological models based on mortality data indicating that approximately two weeks can elapse after introduction of H7N7 in a flock before change in mortality is observed 
 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Bos1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The presence of identical virus sequences in multiple farms infected at different time periods (e.g. 6 farms in group G9 spanning a period of more than 5 weeks) also suggests that the HPAI H7N7 virus was already very stable and well adapted to poultry when the epidemic started. In addition, the phylogenetic network showed that many amino acid changes associated with increased pathogenicity in mammals appeared already at an early stage during the epidemic. These results have serious implications for disease control, as they demonstrate that early and regular monitoring of poultry farms is necessary to detect and contain avian influenza viruses before they fully adapt to domestic poultry and become a potential risk for animal and public health.
