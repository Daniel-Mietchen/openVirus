<p>Secondly, an important limitation of our genetic dataset is the characterisation of only one virus sequence per farm, whereas each farm (and each individual host within this farm) may contain a wide variety of closely related virus variants. Our genetic data could be considered a reliable tool to elucidate the transmission pathways of the HPAI H7N7 between farms if it can be assumed that the virus genotype obtained for each farm samples represents the dominant strain in the farm sample and that this dominant strain is the one most likely to be transmitted to other farms. These assumptions were partially supported by clonal sequencing performed on six farm samples, as the genotype used in our dataset corresponded to the dominant variant in the clone population in 5 out of 6 farms. This dominant variant represented &gt;50% of the clones in 4 samples (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002094-t004">Table 4</xref>), suggesting that more cloning effort would most probably not change this result. The identification of a second sub-dominant strain directly related to the dominant strain in two samples suggests that dominance can evolve during the course of infection within a flock. This evolution of dominance could have caused the genetic differences observed between farm samples directly connected in the network. These results have, however, to be considered with caution because of the small number of farm tested with the cloning technique and of the very small sampling relative to flock size obtained from each farm (5 chickens per farm).
