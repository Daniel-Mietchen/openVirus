<p>Importantly, clonal sequencing of the one farm sample (F191) also showed that the virus strain originally sequenced was not the dominant variant of the farm but was a potentially inactive variant (as it contained a frame shift deletion) present at a low frequency. It suggests that our genetic dataset was not always composed of the dominant genotype in the farm samples, potentially affecting the resolution of the transmission network. The variant with highest frequency in sample F191 represented 17% of the clones, suggesting that the absence of a highly dominant strain may have allowed the sequencing of another variant. This lack of dominance could be due to the production of a high variety of variants with stalk deletion, possibly associated with the evolution of a deletion-prone polymerase in viruses infecting the first farm in the Limburg area (F191). If it is the case, it would suggest that only the 13 samples presenting deletions in our dataset may have been wrongly positioned in the phylogenetic network due to the dominance issue.</p>
