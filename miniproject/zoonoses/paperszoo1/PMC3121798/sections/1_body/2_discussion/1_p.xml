<p>This study presents one of the most complete viral genetic data ever obtained on a highly pathogenic avian influenza epidemic, with coverage of 72% of the poultry farms that were infected during the 2003 HPAI H7N7 epidemic in the Netherlands. Results obtained in this study showed that the HA, NA and PB2 gene segments were characterized by a high level of genetic diversity, allowing the identification of unique virus sequences for 76% of the farm samples analyzed. The estimates of substitution rates for the HA and NA gene averaged around 1×10
 <sup>−2</sup> substitutions per site per year, which is among the highest observed for avian influenza viruses 
 <xref rid="ppat.1002094-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. It suggests that enough viral genetic diversity can be produced within a short period of time during an HPAI epidemic to allow the use of partial genome sequences to determine virus transmission dynamics with phylogenetic analyses.
