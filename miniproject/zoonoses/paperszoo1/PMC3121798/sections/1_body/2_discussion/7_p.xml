<p>Results from the network and the clonal sequencing analysis of F191 showed that some mutations occurred multiple times at different time periods, leading to chronological anomalies in the farm-to-farm connections identified in the phylogenetic network. These anomalies were limited to clusters including Limburg samples, suggesting that the high viral genetic diversity produced during the outbreak in Limburg may be at their origin. Interestingly, reports from officials involved in the control of the epidemic indicate that F191 may have been infected for over a week before being reported and sampled. Also this farm housed &gt;10,000 turkeys, a species shown to play a key role in the evolution of AI pathogenicity in domestic animals

Therefore, it is likely that the long infection period of the F191 turkey farm is at the origin of its high genetic diversity and of many anomalies in the phylogenetic network. Additional cloning work may help resolving all chronological anomalies in the network. An interesting alternative would be to combine our genetic network with temporal data (and other epidemiological data) in a mathematical framework to calculate the likelihood of potential transmission events, as it has been done for the 2001 food-and-mouth disease outbreak in the UK
