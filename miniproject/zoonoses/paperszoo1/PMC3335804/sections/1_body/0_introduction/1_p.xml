<p>The surveillance and control of avian influenza (AI) have historically focused on the detection and eradication of infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses in poultry populations. However, since low pathogenicity AI (LPAI) viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes can mutate into HPAI viruses, as occurred for example in 1999 in Italy

 <xref rid="pone.0035956-Suarez1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, the detection and control of LPAI has become compulsory in the European Union (EU)

Moreover, in 2008, the rapid mutation of an LPAI H7N7 virus strain (2â€“3 weeks after its introduction) that resulted in the HPAI outbreak in the United Kingdom and evidence of multiple incursions of different AI viruses in EU in recent years have highlighted the need for early detection
