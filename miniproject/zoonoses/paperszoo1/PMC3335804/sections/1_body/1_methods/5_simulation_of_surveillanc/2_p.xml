<p>In the reference surveillance strategy, we assumed a combination of both active and passive surveillance applied to a single-flock farm of 10,000 male turkeys. Sampling for active surveillance was assumed to start at day 60 of the production cycle (based on the results of Comin 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="pone.0035956-Comin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>) and to be performed on a monthly basis (as in Mulatti 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="pone.0035956-Mulatti1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>). At each sampling, we assumed that 10 birds were tested by means of both serological and virological assays (assuming perfect accuracy for both tests, which was relaxed in sensitivity analyses, see below). If the sample included at least one positive bird, the farm was considered to be infected and the corresponding sampling day was defined as the detection day. However, if the prevalence of infectious birds had exceeded the threshold D before positive samples were found, we assumed that the infection had been found by passive surveillance and the first day on which the prevalence exceeded the threshold was considered as the detection day.
