<p>Once an infected farm was detected, the expected number of farms infected secondarily prior to detection was calculated by multiplying the bird-to-farm transmission rate (β
 <sub>h</sub>, the average number of farms infected by one infected bird per unit of time) by the cumulative number of infectious birds (area under the curve, AUC) up to the detection day. If an outbreak was still not detected on the last sampling day, the AUC at the time of slaughter was used (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035956-g001">Figure 1.b</xref>). By repeating this for many simulated outbreaks, the mean of β
 <sub>h</sub>*AUC was computed, which is interpreted as the between-farm reproduction number R
 <sub>h</sub> (i.e., the mean number of farms infected by a single infected farm).
