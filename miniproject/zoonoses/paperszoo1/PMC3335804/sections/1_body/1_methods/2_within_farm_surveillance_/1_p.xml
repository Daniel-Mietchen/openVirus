<p>Within-farm outbreaks were simulated by means of the stochastic susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model (baseline model) of Comin

 <xref rid="pone.0035956-Comin2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The parameters are given in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0035956-t001">Table 1</xref>. Farms were assumed to consist of a single flock. Outbreaks started at a uniform random flock age with one latently infected bird. We assumed that the latent and infectious periods had a gamma distribution, with average durations of 2.9 and 8.1 days, respectively 
 <xref rid="pone.0035956-Comin2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. During their infectious period, birds transmitted the virus to susceptible birds within the farm at rate Î², which was chosen such that the mean number of secondary cases generated by one infectious bird (i.e., R
 <sub>0</sub>) is equal to 5.5
