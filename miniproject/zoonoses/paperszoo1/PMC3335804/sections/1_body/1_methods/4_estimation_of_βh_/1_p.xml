<p>The bird-to-farm transmission rate β
 <sub>h</sub> represents the number of newly infected farms generated by a single infectious bird housed in an infected farm per unit of time. For estimation of β
 <sub>h</sub>, the relation R
 <sub>h</sub> = β
 <sub>h</sub>*AUC can be reversed for a known value R
 <sub>h</sub>' during an epidemic, and a mean AUC' of actual flocks during that same epidemic: β
 <sub>h</sub> = R
 <sub>h</sub>'/AUC'. For this calculation, we used a published value of R
 <sub>h</sub>' of 2.15, which was the farm reproduction number at the beginning of the Italian 2000–2001 LPAI epidemic, when no control measures were in place yet 
 <xref rid="pone.0035956-Mulatti1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The value of AUC' was estimated as the average AUC of 1000 simulated outbreaks in 1000 single-flock farms with different flock sizes and gender of birds (randomly selected from a list of single-flock turkey farms available at the Regional poultry farm registry), assuming the absence of any control measure. For each outbreak, we simulated the day of virus introduction (from day 0 to 100 or 130 of the production cycle, depending on the gender of the turkeys) and the infection dynamics, using the above-described SEIR model and parameters. We assumed that the infection process in a farm continued until it reached its end or the production cycle was stopped (i.e., because control measures were not in place) (
