<p>The detection rate of the reference surveillance strategy under different scenarios (sensitivity analysis) is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035956-g002">Figure 2.b</xref>. The use of imperfect diagnostic tests (90% and 85% sensitivity for serological and virological testing, respectively) did not result in a significant decrease in the percentage of detected outbreaks. Furthermore, surveillance was more sensitive in smaller farms. The reference scenario refers to the LPAI virus that was introduced in Italian farms at the beginning of the LPAI epidemic in 2000; if a strain with a higher R
 <sub>0</sub> was introduced, the role of passive surveillance would seemingly be enhanced.
