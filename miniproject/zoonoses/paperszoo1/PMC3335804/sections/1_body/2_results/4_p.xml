<p>To better understand the effectiveness of the surveillance strategies under different scenarios, we determined the maximum number of days after detection day at which R
 <sub>h</sub> was still below 1, which indicates the time available to prevent an epidemic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035956-g003">Figure 3</xref>). When considering the reference (or â€œbaseline") scenario, to prevent an epidemic, between-farm transmission would need to be stopped by control measures within 2 days of the positive sampling. The use of imperfect diagnostic tests (i.e., lower test sensitivity) did not result in a significant worsening of the effectiveness of the surveillance strategies. When increasing the sampling frequency (once every 15 days), the maximum number of days allowed for preventing an epidemic increased to 5 (i.e., providing 3 more days to stop between-farm transmission). Increasing the sample size (30 birds) also increased the maximum number of days for preventing an epidemic (i.e., 4 days). By contrast, performing only passive surveillance made it impossible to detect infection in time to sufficiently reduce transmission to other farms (i.e., R
 <sub>h</sub>&gt;1), except in the case of small farms or late virus introduction. Similarly, the use of only serological testing did not allow for extra time to set up control measures except in case of lower R
 <sub>0</sub> or late virus introduction.
