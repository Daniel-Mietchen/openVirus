<p>Although we chose to focus our evaluation on LPAI in turkeys, we can speculate on how the surveillance strategies would perform in chickens. Chickens are known to be less susceptible to LPAI infection than turkeys

 <xref rid="pone.0035956-Spackman1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and laboratory experiments have shown that bird-to-bird transmission of LPAI viruses in chickens can be low to moderate, depending on the virus strain

 <xref rid="pone.0035956-Gonzales2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Furthermore, in densely populated poultry areas with both turkey and chicken farms, LPAI outbreaks have often occurred only on turkey farms, for example in Virginia in 2002 
 <xref rid="pone.0035956-Akey1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, in Italy in 2004 and 2005 
 <xref rid="pone.0035956-Capua1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, and in Germany in 2008 
 <xref rid="pone.0035956-DEFRA1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. We can thus assume that both within- and between-farm transmission of LPAI infections are less efficient in chickens than in turkeys, as supported by the fact that, to date, no massive LPAI epidemics have been reported in chickens 
 <xref rid="pone.0035956-Alexander1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0035956-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, a distinction should be made between broilers and layers, which have different rearing systems and lengths of production life. Although for layers passive surveillance based on decreases in egg production and feed intake has in some cases contributed to the prompt recognition of LPAI 
 <xref rid="pone.0035956-Elbers1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, the early detection of LPAI can be difficult to achieve in broilers unless many samples are tested very frequently.
