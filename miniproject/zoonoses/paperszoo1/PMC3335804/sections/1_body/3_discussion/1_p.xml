<p>In this study, we evaluated diverse surveillance strategies for the purpose of early warning of LPAI epidemics, considering the actual epidemiological conditions during the Italian LPAI surveillance programme in 2000. Surveillance was only successful in preventing an epidemic if actions were taken within two days of sampling, which is rather unfeasible, given the waiting time to have the results from the laboratory. The sensitivity analysis showed that the surveillance strategies are not effective for larger farms or if the LPAI virus is introduced in the farm earlier or has a shorter generation time or a higher R
 <sub>0</sub>. In the last three scenarios, a high infectivity level is reached before detection (i.e., high AUC at detection), which results in an R
 <sub>h</sub>&gt;1; on the other hand, under these circumstances the detection rate is higher (i.e., ∼80–90%, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035956-g002">Figure 2.b</xref>) mostly due to the increase of the detection by passive surveillance. Furthermore, the surveillance strategies do not seem to be affected by the quality of the diagnostic test within the range examined (range based on van der Goot 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="pone.0035956-vanderGoot1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>), although performing both serological and virological assays is important for increasing the sensitivity of active surveillance strategies. Given that preventive action must be taken as soon as possible, imperfect diagnostic tests which provide results quickly may be preferable to a higher-quality assay that takes longer.
