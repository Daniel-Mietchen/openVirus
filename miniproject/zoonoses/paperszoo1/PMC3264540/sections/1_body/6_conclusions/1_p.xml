<p>The importation of animals infected with RVF from the Sudan and failure of the locally applied RVF vaccination program were the main causes of the reoccurrence of RVF epizootics in Egypt. Continued outbreaks of RVF among domestic ruminants, in 1977, 1978 and 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, and 2003 indicate that the virus has become enzootic in Egypt. To control the disease in Egypt, some investigators suggest the following measures: - prevention of introduction of ruminants infected with RVF, especially camels, from northern Sudan into southern Egypt (Aswan Province) - avoiding importation of ruminants from countries where RVF is enzootic - annual vaccination of all ruminants (camels, cattle, buffaloes, sheep and goats) with an effective RVF vaccine - trials for control of insect vectors - the intensive broadcast of educational television programs to inform farmers and owners about the importance of vaccination programs [
