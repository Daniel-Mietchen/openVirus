<p>According to the facts that most arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are RNA viruses, which are maintained in nature by replication cycles that alternate between arthropod and vertebrate hosts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. RVFV ability to persist in nature depends upon certain factors which are present in Egypt [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These factors are: 1- the presence of unvaccinated susceptible livestock, camels and wild animals in large number over large areas, would play the major role in the ability of RVFV to establish the endemic cycle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], 2- the presence of suitable environmental conditions for the insect vector propagation in the absence of effective vector control programs. 3- The vaccination with RVF live attenuated vaccines (Smithburn's strains) plays important role in the persistence of this endemicity in Egypt because it contaminate the environment and transmitted by insect vector [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. 4- The vaccination programs were alternating between the killed and the live vaccines, the latter was used before, during or after the outbreaks in unidentified manner. 5- The vaccination by the inactivated vaccines is not covering all the susceptible animals. 6- The human losses in the first RVFV in 1977 were massive as a result of the lack or absence of public health education beside the delay in announcing the problem and delay of control programs. However, these social and medical situations are not changed till the present time. 7- The geographical continuity with Africa and the Sudan, and the Nile River facilitate the continuous introduction of infected livestock, camel or wild animals. 8- The importation of livestock from the horn of Africa and the Sudan which are enzootic countries. The government of Egypt instructions for importing live animals was to slaughter them upon arrival. Contrarily, these importing animals are usually mixed with the native breeds and moving freely in different localities of the country. 8- The field trials performed by different scientific institutions in Egypt are not under control, and participate in the environmental contaminations with the live vaccinal strains.
