<p>As a matter of fact, during periods in which human epidemics arise they are preceded by epizootics in livestock. These livestock epizootics serve as an amplification step in the spread of the virus. This outbreak indicated that man can serve as RVFV amplified subject. This can be achieved by the circulation of the virus between insect vector and other vertebrates in the human dwellings. Additionally, there are some controversies in recording for this important outbreak. Some reports stated that RVFV probably introduced in Egypt by importing infected sheep and camels [

Other investigations mentioned that during the epidemic of RVF that occurred in Egypt and other areas of North Africa in 1977, the virus was isolated from various species of domestic animals and rats (Rattus rattus frugivorus) as well as man. Also, the highest numbers of RVFV isolates were obtained from sheep; only one isolate was recovered from each of the other species tested, viz. cow, camel, goat, horse, and rat.
