<p>The source of RVFV in this outbreak was probably due to natural infection or vaccinal strains. It was recorded that the Egyptian RVFV isolates group contains strains isolated in 1977 and 1993 epidemics, was appeared in the phylogeny as sister groups. This finding was suggesting that either the virus remained endemic between the two outbreaks or have been reintroduced in 1993 from the same source (probably Sudan) as in 1977 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, some studies were suggested that the virus was reintroduced through an incompletely inactivated RVF veterinary vaccine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, this outbreak probably was due to post-vaccinal reactions with reversion to virulence of the vaccinal strain. During 1993, the AHRI mission was reporting RVF in governmental farms, located in North of Egypt (Damitta Governorate). These farms were vaccinated by RVF attenuated vaccine 20 days prior to the onset of the disease [the author was a member of this mission]. The pregnant cows, adults, and calves were suffering severe illness, mortalities and a storm of abortion following vaccination with the live attenuated RVF vaccine (Smithburn strain). This live vaccine was imported by the Egyptian General Organization for Veterinary Services (GOVS) from the South Africa (Veterinary Research Institute, Onderstepoort, 01100 South Africa, Batch No.G119 in terms of Act 36 of 1947). The exact reason for importing this vaccine is unknown either the real date or place of first vaccination or field trials in Egypt.
