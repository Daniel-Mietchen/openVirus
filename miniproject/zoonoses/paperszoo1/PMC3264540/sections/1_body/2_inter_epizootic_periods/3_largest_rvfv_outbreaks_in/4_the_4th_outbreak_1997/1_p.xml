<p>At the beginning of the summer of 1997, a high incidence of abortion was observed among pregnant sheep and cattle with high mortalities in young lambs and calves during the summer of 1997 in Upper Egypt. The disease was more severe in sheep than in cattle and in young animals than in adults. The abortion rate in pregnant ewes was approximately 60%-70% and in pregnant cows approximately 30%-40%. A mortality rate of approximately 50%-60% was recorded in young lambs, 25%-35% in adult sheep, 25%-30% in calves and 10%-20% in adult cattle. This study reveals massive infections and indicated the absence of an effective traceability system in Egypt [
