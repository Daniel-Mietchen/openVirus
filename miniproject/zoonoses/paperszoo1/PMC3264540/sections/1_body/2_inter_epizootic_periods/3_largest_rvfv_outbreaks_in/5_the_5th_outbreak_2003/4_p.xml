<p>The RVFV was isolated by AHRI from a veterinary samples collected from Damitta Governorate during year 2003 (AHRI, personal communication). Recently the scientific data regarding this outbreak was referred to the spread of RVF all over the country. In June, 2003, Egypt's hospital-based electronic disease surveillance system began to record increased cases of acute febrile illness from governorates in the Nile Delta. In response to a request for assistance from the Egyptian Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 (NAMRU-3) provided assistance in identifying the cause and extent of this outbreak. Testing of human clinical samples (n = 375) from nine governorates in Egypt identified 29 cases of RVF viraemia that spanned the period of June to October, and a particular focus of disease in Kafr el Sheikh governorate (7.7% RVF infection rate). Veterinary samples (n = 101) collected during this time in Kafr el Sheikh Governorate (Egypt) and screened by immunoassay for RVFV-specific IgM identified probable recent infections in cattle (10.4%) and sheep (5%). Entomologic investigations identified three isolates of RVF virus (RVFV) from 297 tested pools of female mosquitoes and all three RVFV isolates came from Cx. antennatus (Becker). This is the first time that Cx. antennatus has been found naturally infected with RVFV in Egypt [
