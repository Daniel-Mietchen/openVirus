The infectivity for each species ranged from 5.78, 9.58, 12.28 and 13.59 for goat, sheep, cattle, and buffalo respectively. The infectivity percentage in some animals indicates that the virus still circulating in the presence of the insect vector.

Some animals were escaped vaccination and others showed immune-suppressive diseases [
