<p>In the light of this description we can realize how much this vaccine is unsafe. It is for use in sheep and goats only. As a fact, the mosquito's breeding season in Egypt is 12 month per year because of the warm winter and the other ecological and environmental factors. However, the safety requirements of using it in the absence of mosquito, as mosquitos present anywhere and anytime of the year make it impractical for general use. The vaccinated animals shouldn't be slaughtered within 21 days after vaccination, because of viraemia. In experimental study performed by VSVRI and NARU-3, a number of 318 cows and 115 buffaloes were vaccinated with the locally prepared RVF Smithburn vaccine, of which, 100 cows and 20 buffaloes were pregnant. Twenty eight pregnant cows were aborted within 72 days post-vaccination. Buffaloes didn't abort. RVFV was isolated from one aborted fetus. Moreover, the antibody response to vaccination with local Smithburn strain had occured in some, but not all the cows and buffaloes. Virus isolation from the fetus suggests in utero transmission of the used vaccinal strain, which resulted in high abortions in cows [
