<p>RVFV is a dose dependant pathogen. Whenever, the dose of RVFV was decreased, the onset of the disease and the time of death were delayed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. RVFV has only one serotype [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], but strains exist of variable virulence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This genetic stability is assumed to result from a fitness trade-off imposed by host alternation, which constrains arbovirus genome evolution. Otherwise, no genetic changes were found in viruses that were passaged alternately between arthropod and vertebrate cells. Furthermore, alternating passaged viruses presenting complete NSs gene remained virulent after 30 passages. Therefore, alternating replication is necessary to maintain the virulence factor carried by the NSs phosphoprotein [
