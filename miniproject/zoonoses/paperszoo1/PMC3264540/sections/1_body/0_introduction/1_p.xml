<p>Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV, genus 
 <italic>Phlebovirus </italic>and family 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>), was isolated from infected sheep in 1930 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. RVFV is an arbovirus that can be transmitted directly (between vertebrates during the manipulation of infected tissues, and between mosquitoes by vertical transmission) and indirectly (from one vertebrate to another by mosquito-borne transmission) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It is enveloped, segmented into three parts, single stranded RNA virus. The three segments are; small (S), medium (M) and large (L). The S segment is of ambisense polarity and encodes for two proteins; nucleocapsid protein (N) that coats the viral genome and a nonstructural protein (NSs). The NSs is a filamentous nuclear protein, expressed by a virus that replicates and assembles in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The NSs protein has been identified as a major virulence factor. The phosphoprotein NSs is not essential to viral replication in tissue culture thus allowing clones carrying deletions in NSs to predominate as they replicate more rapidly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The M segment encodes for two proteins (NSm) of 14 kDa and 78 kDa and envelope glycoproteins (G1 and G2) which play an important role in RVFV infection and pathogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The L segment encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [
