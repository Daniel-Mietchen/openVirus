<p>Serologic evidence of RVF in camels is frequently reported. Widespread abortion waves in camels were observed during RVF outbreaks in Kenya and Egypt. Camels are suspected of playing a major role in the spread of RVF from northern Sudan to southern Egypt in 1977. Also, RVF virus was previously isolated from blood samples from healthy, naturally infected camels in Egypt and Sudan. Although, RVFV susceptibility varied from species to another, some virulent strains could change the classic picture of the epizootics. This was observed during September-October 2010, when an unprecedented outbreak of Rift Valley fever was reported in the northern Sahelian region of Mauritania after exceptionally heavy rainfall. Camels probably played a central role in the local amplification of the virus. During this outbreak, two clinical forms were observed in camels: Peracute form, with sudden death in less than 24 h; and acute form with fever, various systemic lesions and abortions. When hemorrhagic signs developed, death usually occurred within a few days in manner resembles infections in the most susceptible species (sheep) [
