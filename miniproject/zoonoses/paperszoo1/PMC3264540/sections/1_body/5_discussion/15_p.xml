<p>New strains of live attenuated RVFV are created by using reverse genetics that is missing one or more viral virulence factors, which facilitating the studies of viral pathogenesis and the development of specifically attenuated vaccine strains. This system has been used to generate viruses that are missing the NSs protein, the NSm protein, or both. In addition, unlike the currently available attenuated strains, the ΔNSm/ΔNSs vaccine meets the DIVA requirement by virtue of the missing NSs protein [
