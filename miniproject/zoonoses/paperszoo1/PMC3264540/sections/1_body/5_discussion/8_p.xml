<p>They added, WHO/FAO meeting (1983) warranted the use of such attenuated vaccine as there are major practical and theoretical reasons for not using a live vaccine in non-endemic RVF zones and in some endemic zones. Lambs immunized at less than 6 weeks of age have a low incidence of encephalitis and ewes immunized shortly before giving birth may produce lambs with encephalitis. In addition, MLVV induces abortion in a small percentage of pregnant ewes and may cause fetal abnormalities. Also, the FAO meeting added that there is a theoretical objection to use of a live attenuated vaccine, since such vaccine might revert to virulence for cattle, sheep or man. Moreover, the live vaccine has the capacity to cause viraemia in vaccinated sheep, and therefore, arthropods feeding on these animals may become infected and transmit the disease to domestic animals or man. They conclude that despite the disadvantages of the Smithburn RVFV attenuated vaccine, their study explores another disadvantage as the RVFV appeared in bull's semen 1 week after their vaccination with the attenuated RVF vaccine with an average titre of 1 ELISA unit. Also, RVFV was detected till the third week post-vaccination, and the semen quality was severely affected. Thus, vaccination of bulls with this attenuated RVF vaccine leads to dissemination of RVFV via semen as if they were infected, and the use of these bulls for insemination might be of danger, somehow to these bulls as well as the inseminated cows [
