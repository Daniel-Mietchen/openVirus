<p>The mutations responsible for attenuation of RVFV have been examined by analysis of reassortant viruses generated between the vaccine strain and a wild RVFV strain isolated in Senegal. Their findings indicate that genetic reassortment with wild-type viruses during a vaccination program in endemic areas would also be expected to yield attenuated variants [
