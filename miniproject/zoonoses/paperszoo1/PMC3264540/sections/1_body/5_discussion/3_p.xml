<p>In the present time, Egypt is importing Camels, cattle, and small ruminants from the horn of African &amp; the Sudan which are not vaccinated against RVFV. However, in case of importation from countries which vaccinate against RVFV, the imported animals were with no date of vaccination and the unvaccinated control contacts were unavailable for further veterinary investigations. The regulatory plan for livestock importation was to slaughter these animals upon their arrival for human consumption. Some of these animals usually escaped slaughtering for breeding which led to the spread of new strains of FMD and introduction of RVFV from enzootic areas. However, the vaccination programs by killed vaccines only which applied by Ministry of Agriculture have been limiting to great extent the possibilities of RVFV outbreaks in Egypt.</p>
