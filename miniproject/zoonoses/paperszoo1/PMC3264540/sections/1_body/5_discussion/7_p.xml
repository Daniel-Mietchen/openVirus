<p>As has been noted in a research studies performed in VSVRI, the RVF live vaccine adverse effects were illustrated [

The inactivated vaccine was still used until the appearance of the outbreak in Egypt in 1993. The general authority uses the imported RVF attenuated vaccine (smithburn strain) to overcome this problem. Yet, a locally attenuated RVF vaccine was produced from Smithburn strain in 1994 (modified live virus vaccine MLVV). This attenuated vaccine was used together with the inactivated one for vaccination of farm animals, but the live virus vaccine may cause abortion, and its potential for reversion to virulence has not been adequately investigated [
