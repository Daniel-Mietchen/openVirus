<p>MP12 was invented by serial mutagenesis which was undertaken with the Egyptian ZH501 and ZH548 strains of RVF virus. Strain ZH501, which was received as a first-passage virus grown in foetal rhesus monkey lung (FRL) cells, originally came from the serum of a fatal haemorrhagic case of human RVF that occurred in the Sharqiya Governorate during the Egyptian outbreak of RVF in 1977. Strain ZH548, which was received after two passages in suckling mice and one in FRL cells, was recovered originally from the serum of an uncomplicated human febrile case of RVF that occurred in the same area of Egypt. A total of 18 serial mutageneses were undertaken with ZH501, and 16 with ZH548. Mutagenesis consisted of growth of virus in the presence of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) [
