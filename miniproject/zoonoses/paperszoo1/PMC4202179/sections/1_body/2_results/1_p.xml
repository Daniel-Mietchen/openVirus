<p>The first phase of epidemiological analysis involving semiregular tessellation of GIS data resulted in generation of 3055 entities representing flocks of 22 high risk waterfowl species tabulated in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Several calibration runs were conducted to tune epidemiological parameters to reflect realistic inter and intra-flock infection spread. Each epidemiological analysis cycle required about 4.62 hours to complete on a 3.9 GHz 8 core processor using 24 concurrent threads. The location of dominant infection transmissions between flocks are plotted in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4(a)</xref>. The infection locations in the figure are color coded to reflect the number of intermediate hosts to the source infection in Guangdong, China (at 23°21'36.53"N, 113°36'25.89"E), corresponding to the root (A/goose/Guangdong/1996) of the revised H5N1 nomenclature phylogram [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The locations of various infection transmissions indicate potential areas for secondary outbreaks and increased density of outbreaks in turn increase the probability of human outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The high risk areas as reported by WHO [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] are highlighted in bright orange in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4(a)</xref>. The figure highlights the overlap between dense outbreaks identified by epidemiological analysis and the regions with observed human cases reported by WHO [
