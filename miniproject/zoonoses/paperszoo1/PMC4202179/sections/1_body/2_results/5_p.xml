<p>The 72 geocoded clades were used for phylogeographic annotation of the infection graph generated from epidemiological analysis of the infection spread. The infection graph corresponding to summering and wintering zones generated by annotating edges (infection pathways) using phylogeographic annotations is shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>. Note that these are the regions were the flocks predominantly roost and are primary locations for cross species infections. Out of the 72 geocoded clades only 28 were influential in annotation in wintering zone (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7(a)</xref>) and 12 were influential in summering zone (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7(b)</xref>). Furthermore, the 13 influential clades (denoted by red stars in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) overlapped with the 23 influential clades from the summering zone. Moreover, the largest and most diverse clade #112 did not dominate annotation in either zones and thereby minimizing concerns of skews due to sampling bias in the phylogeographic data. Interestingly, the 23 influential clades yielded annotations for just 27.8% of the edges in the wintering zone in contrast to 12 influential clades managing to annotate 59.73% of the edges in summering zone.
