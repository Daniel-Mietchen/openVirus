<p>The infection patterns radiate from the primary infection source through S. E. Asia, Eastern Europe, Western Europe and into North America (as summarized in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) confirm that the infections into North America are significantly distant from S. E. Asia. Furthermore, temporal characteristics of the infections indicate that initial infections into North America has a lag of ~15 months (see video referenced in supplementary material) with infections seeding occurring via both transatlantic and transpacific migratory corridors. The primary entry locations were observed to be near the Gulf of Alaska, a known high risk area [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], which consistently shows sufficiently strong infections. Observations of ~15 month lag between S. E. Asia and primary entry pathways into North America are also corroborated by surveillance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], statistical, and bioinformatics analyses reported by other researchers [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In the epidemic analysis logically spanning 3 years, infection spread from North America was constrained to northern South America, with potential for larger infection spread into South America.
