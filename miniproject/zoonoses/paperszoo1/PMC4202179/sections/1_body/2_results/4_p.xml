<p>The leaves in the phylogram shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> were geocoded using the read names to obtain region and countries. Out of the 2,417 H5N1-HA strains 2,226 (92%) reads were successfully geocoded while the remainder could not be geocoded either due to lack of information or ambiguity in the reads. Given the high yield, manual geocoding of the remaining 191 strains was not pursued. The geographic distribution of the strains in the influential clades are summarized by the chart in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> (details on all the 130 clades is included in supplementary materials). Out of the 130 clades 43 clades were singletons while 15 clades had only two leaves in them and these clades were excluded from further analysis. The remaining clades had an average size of 32.4 Â± 43.15 leaves with a median size of 18.5 with majority of the clades spanning multiple countries. Clade #122 (corresponding to clade 2.2 of WHO/OIE/FAO taxonomy) was the largest and most diverse clade consistent with the revised H5N1 taxonomy phylogram with almost 50% of the reads from Egypt, consistent with increased surveillance efforts between 2006 to 2008.
