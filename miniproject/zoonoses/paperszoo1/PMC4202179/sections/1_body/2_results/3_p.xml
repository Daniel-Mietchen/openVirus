<p>The multiple sequence alignment of 2,417 H5N1-HA sequences (average length: 1710.28 ± 34.37 
 <italic>nt</italic>, minimum length: 1602 
 <italic>nt</italic>, maximum length: 1809 
 <italic>nt</italic>), with minimum length of 1600 
 <italic>nt </italic>(&gt;90% open frame read length), spanning a three year period corresponding to the epidemiological analysis interval, and obtained from GISAID EpiFlu database [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] resulted in an alignment spanning 1841 nucleotides in 5 refinement iterations out of the maximum configured 16 iterations. The phylogram generated from the alignment using neighbor joining and the GTR+I+Γ model in PAUP* was categorized into 130 clades using the criteria proposed by WHO/OIE/FAO [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] which requires that percentage pairwise nucleotide distances between and within clades are &gt; 1.5% and &lt; 1.5% respectively. An overview of the resulting phylogram is shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. The resulting phylogram was manually cross-verified to be consistent with the WHO/OIE/FAO reference taxonomy phylogenetic tree [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].
