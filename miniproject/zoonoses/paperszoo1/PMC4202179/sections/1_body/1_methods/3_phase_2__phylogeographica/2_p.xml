<p>The clades identified from the phylogram are marked with unique numbers and the isolate names are used to geocode each leaf. Geocoding was conducted using the GeoNames dataset [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] stored in a local MySQL database with suitable geospatial indexes to accelerate various SQL queries. The geocoding process was conducted in three passes to obtain both region and country encoding to provide higher geospatial resolution for each sequence. For example, the isolate name A/chicken/Tabanan/BBVD-142/2007 was geocoded to Indonesia, Taban (rather than just Indonesia). Similarly, A/Canada goose/AK/44075-058/2006 was geocoded to United States, Alaska. In order to obtain regional-level geocoding, the first pass attempted to perform exact matches on various GeoNames tables using each term in the isolate name. However, if the first pass did not yield an exact match a second pass is performed using a set of manually supplied overrides that were necessary to disambiguate entries. For example, A/ruddy turnstone/DE/509531/2007 must be geocoded to United States, Delaware rather than Germany (country code DE). If the second pass is unsuccessful then a third pass with approximate matching is pursued. Manual disambiguation is solicited in the third pass if the approximate queries result in multiple matches. The geocoding information for each read along with its clade numbers are persisted for use in the next phase of processing.
