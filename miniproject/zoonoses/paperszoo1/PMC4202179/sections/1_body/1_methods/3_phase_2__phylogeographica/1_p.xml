<p>The phylogram generation procedure adopted by WHO/OIE/FAO H5N1 Evolution Working Group [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] has been utilized to generate a phylogenetic tree using 2,417 H5N1-Hemmagglutinin (HA) segments. The viral strains were obtained from GISAID EpiFlu database [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] by restricting the search to reads longer than 1600 nucleotides (
 <italic>nt</italic>), which corresponds to 90% of the open frame read length [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, the EpiFlu search query was restricted to a 3 year time period from 2006 to 2009 (inclusive) corresponding to the 3 year period used for epidemiological analysis in Phase 1. A multiple sequence alignment of the 2,417 H5N1-HA sequences was generated using MUSCLE [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] (version 3.7) using 16 iterations. A large unrooted neighbor-joining tree of the 2,417 H5N1 HA strains was constructed using a GTR+I+Î“ model in PAUP* v4.0b10 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The newick form of the phylogram generated by PAUP* was used to categorize leaves into clades such that percentage pairwise nucleotide distances between and within clades are &gt; 1.5% and &lt; 1.5% respectively, concordant with WHO/OIE/FAO clade definition criteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].
