<p>Pairs of reverse geocoded vertexes are matched with clades containing same pairs of geocoded regions in the phylogeographic data. Identification of corresponding clades, called 
 <italic>influential clades </italic>(see Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) is performed by first matching on both region and country (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, higher resolution data match) and then just on the country to ensure strong correspondence. For example, the infection pathway between 〈30°52'12"N, 28°22'14.5194"〉 - 〈36°41'4.9194"N, 36°41'4.9194"〉
