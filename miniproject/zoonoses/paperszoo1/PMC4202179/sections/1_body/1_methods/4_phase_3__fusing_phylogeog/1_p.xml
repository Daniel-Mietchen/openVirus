<p>The last phase of the proposed methodology utilizes the phylogeographic data extracted in Phase 2 to identify and annotate strong infection pathways in the infection graph generated in the Phase 1. In this phase, the latitude and longitude values for each pair of verities constituting an edge in the infection graph are reverse geocoded to identify correspondence with phylogeographic data. Geocoding is performed using the same GeoNames database in multiple passes using increasing radius (1/50, 1/25, and 1 mile) of matching to identify higher resolution regional-level geocodes. Vertexes that are on ocean surfaces cannot be reverse geocoded and are excluded from further analysis in this phase.</p>
