<p>The epidemic model used in this study consisted of all 22 high risk waterfowl species shown in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> that have been collated from earlier publications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The GIS data for the 22 species were obtained from GROMS database [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] while migratory characteristics were obtained from BirdLife International Database (BID) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The epidemic model represented as an Eco-description was generated from the GIS datasets using SEARUM's model generation module. The position of various flocks in the wintering zones and after migration to summering zones are shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3(a)</xref> and Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3(b)</xref>. Additional model images are included in supplementary material with further information available at
