<p>The epidemiological analysis was conducted by seeding an infection in one Anas platyrhynchos flock in Guangdong, China (at 23°21'36.53"N, 113°36'25.89"E), corresponding to the root (A/goose/Guangdong/1996) of the revised WHO H5N1 nomenclature phylogram [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The model was configured to have a basic reproductive number for the infection (R
 <sub>0</sub>) to be greater than 1 to reflect the enzootic nature of the infection. Furthermore, the disease transmission parameters were configured to reflect a Susceptible→Infected (SI) type compartmental epidemiological model. The model was simulated for a period of three years while logging the locations of various infections occurring in the model. The stochastic nature of the simulations require the use of a Monte Carlo approach in which infections consistently occurring in multiple simulations are identified as the dominant set of infections. Temporogeospatial attributes of flocks involved in each pair of infection transmission are collated to yield an infection graph for further processing in phase 3. An infection graph (see Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in which location of flocks are nodes with edges connecting pairs of flocks involved in infection transmission.
