<p>The focus of this study is to utilize phylogeographic analysis of H5N1 viral strains to validate and enhance information about epidemic transmission pathways identified using temporo-geospatial epidemiological analysis of high risk migratory waterfowl. The validated and enhanced knowledge is then used to draw further conclusions in addition to serving as a framework for various ecological, phylodynamic, and prophylactic analyses. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> presents an overview of the various steps involved in the proposed methodology that are broadly classified into three phases. The first phase involves identification of candidate infection pathways via epidemiological analysis of migratory patterns of high risk waterfowl species. The second phase involves phylogeospatial analysis of viral strains to geocode strains in clades. The third phase combines the results from the first two phases to validate and enhance infection pathways and conduct various analyses. These three phases are discussed in the following subsections.
