<p>The data in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> shows a significant variation in the number of edges annotated by influential clades between summering and wintering seasons. The number of influential clades increases in wintering zone because the birds migrate down south and spread out across many countries. This time frame also coincides with increase in influenza epidemics in the temperate and subtropical regions thereby increasing the potential for reassortment between human and avian influenza viruses leading to emergent of novel and possibly highly virulent strains that cause mortality in humans. These inferences are consistent with prior investigations reported by various researchers and multinational surveillance organizations [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, the significant evidence correlating migratory patterns of high risk waterfowl species to the "breeding grounds" of novel H5N1 strains using phylogeographic-epidemiological analysis is an original and unique inference from this research. in addition to providing a complementary perspective on the ecological aspects of avian influenza, the inferences increase confidence in the proposed methodology.
