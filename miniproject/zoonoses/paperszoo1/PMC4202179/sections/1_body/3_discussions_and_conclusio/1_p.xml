<p>The aggregate data obtained from the result of fusing phylogeographic and epidemiological data are shown in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. The dominant country from the various clades is China, spanning 13 of the 23 influential clades followed by Vietnam in 4 clades. The data indicates that these countries have large diversity in the enzootic strains. Furthermore, the corresponding set of edges in the infection graphs shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7(a)</xref> are predominantly located in S. E. Asia with bidirectional edges indicating cyclical infection patterns. Fusing phylogeographic data and the infection pathways from epidemiological analysis provides novel evidence indicating the increased potential for reassortments to occur in this region.
