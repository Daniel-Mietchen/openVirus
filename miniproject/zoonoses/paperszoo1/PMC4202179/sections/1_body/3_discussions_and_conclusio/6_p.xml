<p>The GISAID EpiFlu database does not contain sufficient number of viral strains from the southern hemisphere in the analysis timeframe spanning 2006 to 2009. The database contains (completely ignoring date ranges) just two strains from the whole of South America, 34 strains from Africa (excluding countries already included in this study), one from Oceania (includes: Australia, New Zealand and several smaller island nations), and zero from Antarctica. Consequently, a large fraction of the infection pathways to countries in the southern hemisphere could not be phylogeographically annotated. The lack of phylogenetic data from the southern hemisphere is more pronounced during wintering seasons as highlighted in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> because birds migrate towards the equator. The lack of strains motivates increase surveillance when viewed in the context of the aforementioned analyses that provide strong evidence for the proposed methodology in the northern hemisphere. Moreover, the nodes in the infection graph with large degrees of unannotated edges serve as landmarks for guiding surveillance efforts.
