<p>Inferences drawn from this research provide strong validation for the proposed methodology and the underlying epidemiological model. The study indicates that the fusion of phylogeography with epidemiology can provide novel, yet intuitive results and is a distinctive approach for ecological and epidemiological analysis. For instance, nodes with high degrees serve as epicenters for enacting various prophylactic and containment strategies. Moreover, having identified novel strains in S.E. Asia, nodes along the transmission pathways in the infection graph can be actively monitored to strategically assess propagation characteristics thereby enabling proactive design of vaccines and prophylactic measures to contain epidemics in humans and livestock. The proposed methodology involving an unique combination of temporo-geospatial epidemiology and phylogeography provides support for pioneering new in
