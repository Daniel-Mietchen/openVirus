<p>The locations of infections that occur during migration, which correspond to migratory stopover sites, are highlighted in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4(a)</xref> show strong correspondence with the high risk regions reported by WHO [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Many of the infection pathways that arise due to intercontinental waterfowl migration show strong relationship between Asia and Europe. Successful phylogeographic annotation of these pathways substantiate their validity because isolation of many closely related (less than 1.5% 
 <italic>nt, i.e.</italic>, fewer than 28 bases out of 1841 
 <italic>nt</italic>) H5N1 strains and the exploratory data analysis provide statistically significant evidence to clearly reject the null hypothesis that the infection pathways are a mere coincidence.
