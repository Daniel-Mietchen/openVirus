<p>The phylogeographic dataset used in this study did not contain viral isolates to support the transatlantic infection pathways shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>. Analysis of the long read (at least 1600 
 <italic>nt</italic>) H5N1-HA strains isolated from United States since 2006 in the GISAID EpiFlu database indicates that they are closely related to the strains in clade #6 shown in the first row of Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. However, the number of samples in the database from West European and Scandinavian countries is very few and that impacts the extent of annotation of transatlantic pathways. However, given the foregoing analysis that provides strong support for the underlying epidemiological model, these infection pathways cannot be dismissed and consequently emphasize the need for concentrated surveillance efforts in these regions.
