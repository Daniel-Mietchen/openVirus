<p>The phylogeographically annotated epidemiological data related to entry of infections into Americas is also consistent with surveillance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], statistical, and bioinformatics analyses reported by other researchers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Specifically, the infection graph correctly elicits Alaska as a primary gateway point into Americas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and the temporal characteristics show reported minimum of ~15 month lag between S. E. Asia and Americas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The bidirectional infection patterns between North and South Americas suggest continuous circulation of viruses providing support for the isolated clade #6. These aforementioned observations add further credence in the proposed methodology and validity of the underlying epidemiological model.
