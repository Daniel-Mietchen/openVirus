<p>Despite the advancements in technologies and improvements in economies of scale, data from surveillance is relatively coarse and sparse. Furthermore, field observations and satellite telemetry only provide a snapshot of various natural processes that influence global ecology of the disease. Furthermore, comprehensive epidemiological analysis using effective computational models play a pivotal role in design and implementation of national and multinational prophylactic strategies and policies. Consequently, the surveillance data needs to be combined with computational analysis methods to generate comprehensive, multifaceted information and draw actionable inferences. However, a versatile and comprehensive software system is required to enable and the aforementioned computational analyses.</p>
