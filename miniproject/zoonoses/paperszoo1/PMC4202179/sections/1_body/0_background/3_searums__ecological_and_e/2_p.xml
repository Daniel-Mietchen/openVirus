<p>Accordingly, a ecological and epidemiological analysis environment called SEARUMS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.searums.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.searums.org/</ext-link>) has been developed and is used in this investigation. The biomathematical models for temporo-geospatial epidemiological analysis supplied to SEARUMS are called Eco-descriptions. The software pipeline includes modules for generating Eco-descriptions from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) datasets that has been used in this study (refer to Methods section for details). SEARUMS uses an agent-based descriptive behavioral computational-modeling approach [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] to elicit epidemiological characteristics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The agents in SEARUMS implement the classical bio-mathematical compartmental models that are widely used in epidemiology [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In a compartmentalized model the population being analyzed is partitioned into non-intersecting subsets called compartments. Compartments are defined such that the sub-population within a compartment exhibits a vital disease characteristic, such as: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I), and Recovered (R). The epidemiological characteristics of the classical SEIR model is modeled using the following system of differential equations:
