<p>The constants 
 <italic>µ, λ, β</italic>, and v represent the birth/death rate, the force of infection, latency period, and recover rates respectively. These constants are determined based on the characteristics of the disease being modeled and are supplied via the Ecodescription. In SEARUMS spread of infection to various agents occurs when agents overlap with each other. The system is modeled as discrete time Markov processes driven by an underlying multi-threaded Discrete Event Simulation (DES) kernel. Various phenomena that occur during simulation are logged for further analysis. A more detailed description of SEARUMS is available in the literature [
