<p>The global ecology of avian influenza, is summarized in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> along with various polymorphic strains. It has been established that migratory waterfowl, especially anseriformes and charadrillformes, play a central role in the global ecology [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Moreover, migratory waterfowl have been implicated as natural reservoirs, mixing vessels, and intercontinental vectors for various serotypes of avian viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Unfortunately, knowledge on global spread of H5N1 is rather limited [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] with ongoing debates regarding its transmission pathways [
