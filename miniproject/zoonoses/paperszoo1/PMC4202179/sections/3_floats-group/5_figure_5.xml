   <bold>Overview of 130 clades in phylogenetic tree of 2,417 H5N1-HA sequences from GISAID EpiFlu database</bold>. The phylogram was created via neighbor-joining and GTR+I+Î“ model using PAUP*. The clades are color coded and annotated to highlight influential clades that contributed to phylogeocoding of infection pathways. A zoomable image of the complete phylogenetic tree is available in supplementary materials. Additional information about the clades are also available in Figure
