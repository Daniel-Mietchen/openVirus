<p>The idea that slaughterhouse workers should be considered as a group particularly at risk has been presented in the recent report of an outbreak of peripheral neuropathy observed in pig abattoirs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Between November 2006 and May 2008, two swine abattoirs from Minnesota and Indiana were affected by a subacute neurological syndrome. The two workers had an occupational exposure to aerosolised porcine brain. The neurological disorder described seems to have an autoimmune origin in response to multiple aerosolised porcine brain tissue antigens; the pattern of nerve involvement suggests a vulnerability of nerve roots and terminals where the blood-nerve barrier is most permeable.
