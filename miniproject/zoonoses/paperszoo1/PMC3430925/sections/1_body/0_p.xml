<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/topics/zoonoses/en/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.who.int/topics/zoonoses/en/</ext-link>), a zoonoses can be defined as "any disease or infection caused by all types of agents (bacteria, parasites, fungi, viruses and unconventional agents) transmissible from vertebrate animals to humans and 
 <italic>vice-versa</italic>". During recent decades, the public health risk represented by zoonoses was suggested by the onset of outbreaks and epidemics of previously unknown human infectious diseases that emerged from animal reservoirs such as Ebola virus, West Nile virus, Nipah virus, Hanta virus, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. More recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Therefore, these agents can potentially cause epidemics at any time. In this light, we can affirm that the risk of zoonoses, particularly in occupational settings, has been probably underestimated in past years. This has been highlighted by epidemics that originated from the animal breeding sector, and, in some cases, from specific and identified animal breeding and feeding modalities.
