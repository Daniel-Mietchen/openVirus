<p>In some countries, the re-emergence of bacterial zoonoses may be due to a lack of surveillance or a lack of appropriate control measures by public services [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This can involve an occupational issue. It can be easily assumed that when agricultural workers are not involved in health surveillance protocols, or existing health surveillance protocols do not take into account biological agents, the risk of zoonoses is higher. Occupational risk also increases when governments lack resources to enforce hygiene or security standards in slaughterhouses or shelters, leading to an increase in cases of brucellosis, Q-fever or anthrax among workers during certain periods or in specific countries.
