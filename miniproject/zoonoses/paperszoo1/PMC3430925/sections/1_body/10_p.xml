<p>An ecological factor having a significant impact on biological risk is represented by the fast degradation of the natural environment and, in particular, deforestation affecting developing countries. In fact, deforestation forces wildlife species to move to new areas, sometimes into suburban zones, increasing the possibilities of contact with humans, cash animals and pets [

A similar impact on public health is due to human behavior, and in particular to animal population or repopulation strategies based on the introduction of selected animal species in specific areas for promoting fauna diversity or for hunting purposes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In line with the health problems related to species migration or introduction in new areas, there is species translocation among continents, often accompanied by the movement of infectious agents, which may lead to unexpected exchanges of genetic material. For example, it seems that in the 1980s, a commensal
