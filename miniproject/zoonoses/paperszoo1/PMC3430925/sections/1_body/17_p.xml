<p>Another interesting finding of our center comes from the evaluation of the immune system function in cow and pig breeders. The study showed a statistically significant increase in serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-10 and total serum proteins compared to non-breeders, suggesting a condition of immune activation in animal breeders, which might be indicative of contact with different biological agents [personal unpublished data].</p>
