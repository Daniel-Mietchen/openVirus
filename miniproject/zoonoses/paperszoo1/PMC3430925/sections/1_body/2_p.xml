<p>Prevention is based on knowledge, but very often the processes by which zoonoses emerge and re-emerge are complex and poorly understood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], mainly because a single event, or a chain of events, that promote the emergence of a disease and/or its evolution into an endemic disease, often vary on a case by case basis, and are affected by several factors such as genetic evolution, environmental conditions, climate changes affecting the vector's distribution, demographic changes, movement of animals, etc. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Predicting which zoonotic diseases may emerge, or become endemic, is extremely difficult due to the multifactorial and constantly evolving nature of the risk factors involved (
