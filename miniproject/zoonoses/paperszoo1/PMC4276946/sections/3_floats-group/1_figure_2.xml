  <p>Phylogenetic analysis of a fragment of the morbillivirus P gene. Sequences were trimmed to include all sequence data available. Each sequence is denoted by its accession number (where available) and strain/isolate details (cetacean species, and year and geographic area of stranding). The evolutionary history of the isolates assessed was inferred using the neighbour-joining method with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Kimura 2-parameter method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site detailed with bootstrap values of &gt;50 being shown against key nodes. The phylogeny includes 41 nucleotide sequences with a total of 253 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5 [
