<p>Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) is a recently described member of the genus 
 <italic>Morbillivirus</italic>, subfamily 
 <italic>Paramyxovirinae,</italic> family 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>, Order Mononegavirales, that includes three well characterized strains: the porpoise morbillivirus (PMV), first isolated from harbor porpoises (
 <italic>Phocoena phocoena</italic>) from Northern Ireland [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], the dolphin morbillivirus (DMV), first isolated from Mediterranean striped dolphins (
 <italic>Stenella coeruleoalba</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and the pilot whale morbillivirus (PWMV), recovered from a long-finned pilot whale (
 <italic>Globicephala melas</italic>) stranded in New Jersey, USA [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-05145-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Recently, three new strains were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), one in a Longman's beaked whale (
 <italic>Indopacetus pacificus</italic>) from Hawaii, one in a Guiana dolphin (
 <italic>Sotalia guianensis</italic>) from Brazil and one in two Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (
 <italic>Tursiops aduncus</italic>) from Western Australia [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-05145-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Over the past three decades, cetacean morbilliviruses have caused several outbreaks of lethal disease in odontocetes (toothed whales) and mysticetes (baleen whales) around the world.
