<p>CeMV infection was detected by serology, IHC and RT-PCR in a stranded 
 <italic>L. obliquidens</italic> from Japan, in a pygmy sperm whale (
 <italic>Kogia breviceps</italic>) beached in Taiwan and in a captive 
 <italic>T. aduncus</italic> from Taiwan [
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="B106-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. The 
 <italic>L. obliquens</italic> was diagnosed with a chronic persistent morbillivirus encephalitis while the 
 <italic>K. breviceps</italic> had a systemic, acute infection [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="B106-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Partial sequence of the P gene of the 
 <italic>K. breviceps</italic> virus had 97.6% similarity with DMV. The 
 <italic>T. aduncus</italic> had very high titers against DMV likely acquired after an infection developed while still in the wild [
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Though these data indicate that CeMV is present in odontocetes from the Northwest Pacific, mass mortalities were not reported in this ocean basin. Further investigations are necessary to determine the distribution of virus, the identity of strains and susceptibility of hosts in this region.
