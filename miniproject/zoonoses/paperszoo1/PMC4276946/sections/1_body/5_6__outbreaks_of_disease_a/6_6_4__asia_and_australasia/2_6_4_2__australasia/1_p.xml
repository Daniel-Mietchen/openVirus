<p>Serological data indicate that CeMV infects several cetacean species from the waters of northeastern Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand and that it is possibly endemic in 
 <italic>G. melas</italic> and 
 <italic>P. electra</italic>, with evidence of circulation in this region as long ago as 1985 [
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B90-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. On Australiaâ€™s Indian Ocean coast, CeMV infection was diagnosed in two 
 <italic>T. aduncus</italic> from the Swan River, Western Australia that died during an unusual mortality event involving a small resident community of ~25 individuals in June 2009 [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These deaths were soon followed by morbillivirus associated mortalities in two immature offshore 
 <italic>T. truncatus</italic> in Queensland, Eastern Australia [
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="B90-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. One was found dead on North Stradbroke Island in 2009, the other beached on Fraser Island in 2010 [
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="B90-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The Queensland 
 <italic>T. truncatus</italic> were infected by a virus closely related to the DMV strain isolated in Europe and the USA and exhibited classical acute infection [
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="B90-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. However, the Western Australia 
 <italic>T. aduncus</italic> had an unusual form of CeMV characterized by severe lymphoid depletion and massive opportunistic infections and were infected by a strain of CeMV-2 ([
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], this paper). Another morbillivirus outbreak was subsequently reported in 
 <italic>T. aduncus</italic> and 
 <italic>T. truncatus</italic> from South Australia in March-September 2013 [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B131-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. Preliminary sequencing data suggest that the Western Australia and South Australia morbilliviruses are more similar to each other than either are to the Queensland strain (J. Wang, pers. observations). Together these data suggest that CeMV-1 and CeMV-2 are widespread in the waters of Australasia and could cause more mortalities in inshore and estuarine dolphins, in addition to offshore dolphins.
