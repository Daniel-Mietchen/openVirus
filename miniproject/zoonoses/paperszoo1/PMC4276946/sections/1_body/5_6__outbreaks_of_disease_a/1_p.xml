<p>Morbilliviruses are extremely infectious and are likely to infect most of the immunologically naive individuals in a population. Herd formation and migration increase the probability of transmission [

 <xref rid="B113-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Morbilliviruses require large populations of susceptible individuals (e.g., 300,000 for measles virus in humans) to persist endemically, as there is no carrier state and infection confers lifelong immunity [
 <xref rid="B113-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. However, the persistence of morbilliviruses in relatively small (possibly multispecies) host metapopulations remains an important unsolved problem in disease ecology [
 <xref rid="B122-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Newborn individuals typically have maternal immunity if their mothers had previously been infected. After some months, this immunity is lost and the young individuals are fully susceptible to infection [
