<p>Morbillivirus infection was detected by RT-PCR in a juvenile male 
 <italic>I. pacificus</italic> stranded at Hana, Maui in March 2010, following traumatic maxillary and mandibular bone fractures [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The whale had chronic encephalitis and was also concurrently infected by an alphaherpesvirus [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Though morbillivirus RNA was detected by RT-PCR in samples of the lungs, spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes the juvenile did not have any typical morbillivirus lesions in these organs [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This may reflect prolonged persistence of morbilliviral RNA following acute infection, as described for MV [
 <xref rid="B93-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] but further analyses are necessary to confirm this hypothesis. The virus represents a new strain of CeMV-1, tentatively named beaked whale morbillivirus. BWMV was also detected by RT-PCR in the tracheobronchial lymph node and spleen of a neonate 
 <italic>P. macrocephalus</italic> beached on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, in May 2011. However, typical morbillivirus lesions were not detected in this individual [
