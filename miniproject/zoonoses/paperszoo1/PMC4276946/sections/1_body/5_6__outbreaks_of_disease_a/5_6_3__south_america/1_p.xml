<p>Although CeMV infection had already been detected by serology in gregarious odontocetes from Peru, Argentina and Brazil in the late 1990s ([

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="viruses-06-05145-t001">Table 1</xref>), morbillivirus mortalities were not observed until recently [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A new lineage of CeMV was detected in an emaciated 
 <italic>S. guianensis</italic> calf washed ashore dead at Guriri, Espírito Santo State, Brazil, in November 2010 with marked lymphoid depletion, interstitial pneumonia, and meningoencephalitis [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The 
 <italic>S. guianensis</italic> community off Guriri may be related to the Abrolhos Bank population that concentrates around the estuaries of Caravelas (estimated at 57–124 individuals) and Doce rivers [

 <xref rid="B153-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. Though 
 <italic>S. guianensis</italic> have not been observed mixing with other cetacean species in this region, it is sympatric with the rough-toothed dolphin (
 <italic>Steno bredanensis</italic>), 
 <italic>T. truncatus</italic>, the humpback whale (
 <italic>Megaptera novaeangliae</italic>) and the southern right whale (
 <italic>Eubalaena australis</italic>) [

 <xref rid="B155-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. Interactions between these species may have resulted in the infection of the 
 <italic>S. guianensis</italic> calf. Preliminary IHC studies suggested that morbilliviruses have infected other cetacean species along the Brazilian coast [
