<p>Recently, morbilliviral RNA was detected by RT-PCR in brain and lung samples from 22 of 52 
 <italic>S. coeruleoalba</italic>, one of three 
 <italic>T. truncatus</italic> and one 
 <italic>B. physalus</italic> stranded along the Italian Tyrrhenian Sea coast during an unusual mortality event in early 2013 ([
 <xref rid="B146-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>], Di Guardo and Mazzariol, pers. observations). However, as none of the positive individuals had characteristic morbillivirus lesions and, as other infectious agents were concurrently detected in a high percentage of these individuals, the proximate cause of the event is still under investigation (Di Guardo and Mazzariol, pers. observations.).
