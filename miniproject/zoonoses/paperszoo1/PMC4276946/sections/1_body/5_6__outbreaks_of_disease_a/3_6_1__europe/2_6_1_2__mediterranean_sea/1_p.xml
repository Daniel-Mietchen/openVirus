<p>In the Mediterranean Sea, DMV caused two well-documented outbreaks of mass mortality in 
 <italic>S. coeruleoalba</italic> in 1990–1992 and in 2006–2008. The first outbreak started in Valencia, Spain, in July 1990 and extended to France, Italy, Greece and Morocco, ending in the spring of 1992. All age classes were affected but most dead dolphins were adults. Although precise mortality rates could not be determined, thousands of animals are thought to have died [

 <xref rid="B137-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. As an indirect measure of the impact, the mean school size in the areas most affected by the 1990–1992 outbreak significantly decreased to less than 30% of the pre-outbreak numbers [
 <xref rid="B127-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>,
 <xref rid="B137-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. Serological surveys carried out during and after the epidemic indicated that in 1997–1999 only adult dolphins had DMV antibodies and that the prevalence of seropositivity in mature dolphins had decreased from 100% (
 <italic>N</italic> = 8) in 1990–1992 to 50% (
 <italic>N</italic> = 6) in 1997–1999, but sample sizes were small [
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. This suggested that DMV had not persisted in 
 <italic>S. coeruleoalba</italic> after the epidemic ended, presumably because their abundance (117,880 CI = 68,379–148,000) in the western Mediterranean Sea [
 <xref rid="B137-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>] was too low to support endemic infection [
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B67-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Histological and IHC surveillance further supported this hypothesis. Indeed, systemic CeMV was not detected in 50 
 <italic>S. coeruleoalba</italic> stranded along the Catalonian coast in the inter-epidemic period [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Between October 2006 and April 2007, at least 27 morbillivirus-infected 
 <italic>G. melas</italic> stranded along the southern Spanish Mediterranean coast and the Balearic Islands. The outbreak was first recorded in the Strait of Gibraltar area in late October 2006 and then spread to Valencia [

 <xref rid="B88-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. In early July 2007 DMV-infected 
 <italic>S. coeruleoalba</italic> were observed in the Gulf of Valencia [
 <xref rid="B67-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The number of animals washed ashore from July through August 2007 was similar to that recorded in 1990 during the same months. The stranding rate was also similar during each episode, with an initial low rate at the beginning of July and then a sharp increase in mid-August [
 <xref rid="B67-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The outbreak extended to France and Italy during the following months, also affecting 
 <italic>T. truncatus</italic> [

 <xref rid="B138-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Mostly juveniles were affected during this mortality event, likely because adults were still protected by immunity acquired during the 1990–1992 epidemic [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B67-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The virus strains amplified by RT-PCR from tissues of 
 <italic>S. coeruleoabalba</italic>, 
 <italic>G. melas</italic> and 
 <italic>T. truncatus</italic> were similar to those isolated during the 1990–1992 epidemic but not identical ([

 <xref rid="B88-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], this paper). An estimated 200 striped dolphins died in the western Mediterranean but the total number of deaths remains unknown [
 <xref rid="B67-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. As well as the deaths caused by the acute infection, there were also several cases, ultimately lethal, of a chronic CNS form of infection in 1991–1994 and 2008–2011 in the western Mediterranean and in 2009–2011 in the Eastern Mediterranean [

 <xref rid="B66-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. In the Western Mediterranean chronic morbillivirus encephalitis represented the most common single cause of stranding and death in mature 
 <italic>S. coeruleoalba</italic> in the years following a DMV epizootic [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. These data suggest that the second DMV outbreak may also have had a negative impact on the Mediterranean 
 <italic>S. coeruleoalba</italic> population, though to a lesser extent than the previous one. Little is known about the impacts of the outbreak on populations of the other cetacean species affected. However, Wierucka 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="B139-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>] found that the 2006–2008 DMV epidemic lowered the survival rate of some clusters (groups of individuals that associate with each other more often than with others) of 
 <italic>G. melas</italic> (from 0.919 (95% CI: 0.854−0.956) to 0.547 (95% CI: 0.185−0.866)) in the Alboran Sea and Gulf of Vera.
