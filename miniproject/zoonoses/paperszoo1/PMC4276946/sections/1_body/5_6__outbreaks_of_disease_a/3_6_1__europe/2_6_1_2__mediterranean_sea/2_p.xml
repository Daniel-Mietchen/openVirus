<p>The 
 <italic>S. coeruleoalba</italic> population density in the Gulf of Valencia (0.49 dolphin/km
 <sup>2</sup>) was again close to the maximum reported for this species in the Western Mediterranean in 2001–2003 [

 <xref rid="B140-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. This high population density, with a large proportion of susceptible individuals, likely favored viral transmission and permitted the start of a new epidemic when DMV was reintroduced into the population [
 <xref rid="B67-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. As both the 1990–1992 and 2006–2007 DMV epidemics started close to, or in, the Gibraltar Strait, it was suggested that DMV endemically infected cetaceans, possibly 
 <italic>G. melas</italic> transmitted the infection to 
 <italic>S. coeruleoalba</italic> with which they occasionally form mixed groups (Raga 
 <italic>et al</italic>. pers. observations). The recent detection of DMV strains in 
 <italic>S. coeruleoalba</italic> from the CE Atlantic Ocean that are almost identical to the Mediterranean strains [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] indicates that this population could also transmit the virus to the Mediterranean 
 <italic>S. coeruleoalba</italic> through occasional contacts in the Strait of Gibraltar. The finding of systemic morbillivirus infection in two adult 
 <italic>S. coeruleoalba</italic> stranded on the southwestern (Atlantic) coast of Spain, close to Gibraltar in 2011 and 2012 [
 <xref rid="B141-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>] further indicates that this Strait plays an important role in the epidemiology of CeMV. Environmental factors (higher sea-surface temperatures and limited prey availability), as well as fisheries interactions, inbreeding, migration, and high contaminant loads may synergistically interact to increase the severity of the disease and favor transmission between species [
 <xref rid="B127-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>,
 <xref rid="B142-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>,

 <xref rid="B145-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. When CeMV herd immunity significantly decreases in Mediterranean 
 <italic>S. coeuruleoalba,</italic> the population will again be at risk for an epidemic. Serological surveys are needed to determine the current immune status of these dolphins and facilitate development of predictive epidemiological models.
