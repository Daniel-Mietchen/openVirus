<p>Recently, CeMV infection was detected in Delphinidae from the CE Atlantic Ocean. A virus closely related to the PWMV strain was detected by RT-PCR in the brain of a 
 <italic>G. macrorhynchus</italic> stranded in Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain, in 1996 [

 <italic>S. coeruleoalba</italic> and 
 <italic>D. delphis</italic> washed ashore in the Canary Islands in the period 2002-2011 [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Finally, a systemic DMV infection was observed in a 
 <italic>T. truncatus</italic> stranded in Lanzarote, Canary Islands, in 2005 [
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Thus, at least two strains of CeMV are circulating in cetaceans from this ocean province.
