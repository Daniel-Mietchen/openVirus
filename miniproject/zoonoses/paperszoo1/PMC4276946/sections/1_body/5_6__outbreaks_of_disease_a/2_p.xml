<p>CeMV infection has been detected using various techniques in several species of odontocetes and mysticetes worldwide (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="viruses-06-05145-t001">Table 1</xref>). DMV is the strain most commonly observed in cetaceans from the Northern Hemisphere, followed by PMV and PWMV (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="viruses-06-05145-t001">Table 1</xref>). Serological studies strongly suggest that CeMV is endemic in gregarious odontocete species in the North Atlantic and, possibly in the Southwestern Atlantic and in the South Pacific [
