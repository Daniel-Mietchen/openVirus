<p>Very little is known about the three new CeMV related strains recently detected in odontocetes from Hawaii, Brazil, and Australia [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, recent sequencing data of the P gene of the isolates recovered from two 
 <italic>T. aduncus</italic> from the west coast of Australia (Indian Ocean) and from a 
 <italic>S. guianensis</italic> from Brazil suggest that they differ significantly from the DMV, PMV and PWMV strains [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and may represent another CeMV lineage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-05145-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The beaked whale morbillivirus (BWMV) clusters with the ‘old’ CeMV lineage and should be considered as a new strain of this lineage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-05145-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Sequences from a fragment of the P gene revealed that it has 86% similarity to DMV and 84% similarity to PWMV [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We propose to use the terminology CeMV-1 for the ‘old’ lineage that includes DMV, PMV, PWMV and BWMV and CeMV-2 for the ‘new’ lineage that includes the 
 <italic>T. aduncus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. guianensis</italic> morbilliviruses until the taxonomy of these viruses is further explored.
