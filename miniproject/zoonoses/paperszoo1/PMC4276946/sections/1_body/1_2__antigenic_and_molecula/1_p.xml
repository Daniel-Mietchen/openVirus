<p>Morbilliviruses are unsegmented, linear negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. The DMV genome is 15,702 nucleotides long and consists of six transcription units that encode six structural proteins, the nucleocapsid protein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion glycoprotein (F), haemagglutinin glycoprotein (H) and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L), as well as two virulence factor proteins (C and V) [

 <xref rid="B20-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. PMV and DMV are antigenically closely related, showing a similar reaction pattern with monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) raised against CDV, phocine distemper virus (PDV), peste des petits ruminants (PPRV) and rinderpest (RPV) proteins [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Serological surveys performed in cetaceans from the US and Europe showed that mean antibody titers were consistently similar to both DMV and PMV [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,

 <xref rid="B26-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. PMV and DMV are antigenically more closely related to the ruminant morbilliviruses and measles virus (MV) than to the distemper viruses [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Sequencing of the P, N, F and M genes further demonstrated and confirmed that PMV and DMV are closely related and that they form a separate group within the 
 <italic>Morbillivirus</italic> genus, closer to the ruminant viruses and MV than to the CDV/PDV group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-05145-f002">Figure 2</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. There is a higher (18.3%) divergence between PMV and DMV at the level of the C-terminal end of the N gene, a hypervariable domain, than between different MV isolates [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, in other F and N gene regions there are fewer differences between these strains than between strains of CDV [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus, the present consensus is that PMV and DMV represent two strains of CeMV [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Analyses of partial P and N gene sequences of a morbillivirus (PWMV) recovered in a long-finned pilot whale (
 <italic>Globicephala melas</italic>) from New Jersey, USA, suggested that it belongs to the CeMV lineage but is distinct from PMV and DMV, and that it should be considered as a third strain of CeMV [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Sequence analysis of the N, P, F and H genes of another isolate from a short-finned pilot whale (
 <italic>Globicephala macrorhynchus</italic>) stranded on the Canary Islands in the Central Eastern (CE) Atlantic showed 97% homology with the 
 <italic>G. melas</italic> PWMV and further confirmed a distinct strain circulating among pilot whale species [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, pilot whales are also susceptible to infection by DMV [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. 
 <italic>G. melas</italic> and 
 <italic>S. coeruleoalba</italic> that died along the coasts of Spain during the 2006–2008 Mediterranean epidemic were both infected by DMV strains that showed 100% identity across the H gene [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and 99.9% identity over 9050 bp [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Similarly, P gene fragments of isolates recovered from 
 <italic>T. truncatus</italic> and 
 <italic>G. melas</italic> stranded along the Mediterranean coast of France in 2007–2008 were 100% identical to the Spanish 
 <italic>G. melas</italic> isolate [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Altogether these results indicated that the same DMV strain circulated in the Mediterranean Sea and infected different cetacean species during the 2006–2008 outbreak. Furthermore, sequences of DMV strains recovered from Mediterranean cetaceans during the 2006–2008 epidemic and from 
 <italic>S. coeruleoalba</italic> washed ashore in the Canary Islands in 2002–2011 were highly conserved across the short genome region characterized (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-05145-f002">Figure 2</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, there was only 99.4% and 99.3% identity between the isolates form the 1990–92 epidemic and those from the 2006–2008 events based on the nearly complete genomes (9050 bp) [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thus, these data suggest that the 1990–1992 strain was not maintained in the Mediterranean Sea between the epidemics, and that the strain circulating in the CE Atlantic Ocean was introduced in the Mediterranean Sea in 2006. The DMV Mediterranean strains are less closely related to the isolates recovered from 
 <italic>L. albirostris</italic> stranded in Germany and the Netherlands in 2007–2011 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-05145-f002">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting that this North Sea strain did not play a role in the epidemics [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, further research is needed to better understand the circulation of CeMV in European waters.
