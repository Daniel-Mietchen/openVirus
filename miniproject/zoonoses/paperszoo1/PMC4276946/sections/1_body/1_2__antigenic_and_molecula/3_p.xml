<p>The close genetic relationship between cetacean and ruminant morbilliviruses has led to the suggestion that they may have a common ancestor [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Closely related to the hippopotamus (
 <italic>Hippopotamus amphibius</italic>), cetaceans belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla [

 <xref rid="B37-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As several species of this clade are susceptible to RPV and PPRV [

 <xref rid="B39-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], it is possible that a host jump occurred between a cetacean and another member of the Cetartiodactyla, and that ecological isolation led to distinct virus species. The presence of similar host proteins and cell receptors in cetaceans and artiodactyls may favour cross-species transmission [

 <xref rid="B40-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.
