<p>The H glycoprotein is responsible for virus attachment to the host cell membrane and for cellular entry. The F glycoprotein causes fusion with the host cell membrane and, together with the M protein, invokes cell-to-cell fusion [

The signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM or CD150) and the poliovirus like receptor 4 (PVLR4 or nectin 4) have both been recently identified as the major receptors for wild-type morbilliviruses in immune and polarized epithelial cells, respectively [

Besides, CD147, a transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the immunoglobulin family and is present on a variety of cells including neuronal and endothelial cells, and the membrane bound form of heparin binding epithelial growth factor have been suggested to function as entry receptors for MeV and PDV, respectively [
