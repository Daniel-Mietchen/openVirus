<p>Significant progress in our understanding of the epidemiology, molecular biology and pathogenesis of CeMV have been made since PMV and DMV were first detected in small odontocetes in European waters in 1988â€“1992. Large herds of gregarious species were found to be the likely reservoirs and sources of CeMV infection to susceptible species in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans [

 <xref rid="B157-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. The development of Next Generation Sequencing technologies has greatly enhanced the detection and genetic characterization across all forms of life [
 <xref rid="B158-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. To date, such technologies have not yet been applied to morbillivirus infections of aquatic mammals although they recently enabled an assessment of the evolution of ruminant morbilliviruses [
 <xref rid="B159-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>] and their application to cetacean morbilliviruses may allow a greater understanding of their evolution. Such studies may, where sampling permits, enable the use of genetic data to trace transmission routes between cetacean species and indicate key interactions between species that could lead to significant outbreak events. Standard sampling and preservation protocols should be used during suspected morbillivirus outbreaks and complete genomes of CeMV strains and lineages should be sequenced [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The recent discoveries of several new morbilli-related viruses in bats [
 <xref rid="B160-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>], as well a potentially novel feline morbillivirus representing a basal divergence in the genus [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], are likely to lead to a revision of the phylogeny and understanding of the evolution of morbilliviruses. Identification of the SLAM cell receptor in several cetacean species [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] represents a major step in our understanding of the pathogenesis of CeMV infection, especially with regard to susceptibility and transmission to non-classical hosts, such as pinnipeds [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,

 <xref rid="B162-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. Further studies should confirm whether the SLAM cell receptor is indeed the primary immune receptor for CeMV, as is the case for other studied morbilliviruses, and should look for the nectin4 epithelial cell receptor and other cell receptors in cetaceans. Further studies are also warranted to delineate the host responses to CeMV strains and lineages, and the factors that determine the outcome of infection in cetaceans. Mathematical models should be developed to examine the long-term dynamic consequences of the epidemics on odontocete populations and to predict the risk of epidemics, as has been done for PDV in harbor seals (

 <xref rid="B157-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>,
 <xref rid="B163-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. The concurrent use of the different diagnostic techniques in the context of an integrative approach that includes epidemiological parameters, life history of the affected species and environmental parameters should provide a better and more complete picture of the ecology and evolution of CeMV.
