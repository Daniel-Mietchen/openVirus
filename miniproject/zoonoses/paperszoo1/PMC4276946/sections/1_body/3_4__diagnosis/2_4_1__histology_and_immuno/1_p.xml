<p>Classical histological techniques have been used to investigate CeMV disease and pathogenesis since the first 
 <italic>P. phocoena</italic> and Mediterranean 
 <italic>S. coeruleoalba</italic> were suspected of dying of morbillivirus infection [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has greatly enhanced the sensitivity and specificity of histopathological diagnosis by enabling the detection of morbillivirus antigen in cases where tissue preservation is poor or where classical lesions have been obscured by opportunistic pathogens. IHC studies have been conducted by using a commercially available MoAb for CDV N protein [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,
 <xref rid="B67-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], a MoAb for PDV hemagglutinin [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], or a rabbit polyclonal antiserum to rinderpest virus [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Together with RT-PCR, these techniques recently permitted the identification of morbillivirus outbreaks in 
 <italic>T. truncatus</italic> and 
 <italic>T. aduncus</italic> from South Australia in 2013 [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and in 
 <italic>T. truncatus</italic> from the NW Atlantic, ongoing since 2013 [
 <xref rid="B71-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. At the time of writing specific MoAb for DMV or PMV proteins are not commercially available although they would be useful for accurate diagnosis and research in the future. Histology and IHC techniques should always be used to confirm the molecular diagnosis of systemic morbillivirus infection during an outbreak of mortality.
