<p>The VN test is highly sensitive and very specific and is considered the most reliable assay for the detection of CeMV antibodies [
 <xref rid="B74-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Antibody titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of sera that completely neutralizes cytopathic effects. Titers of 1:16 or higher are considered to be indicative of exposure to CeMV, although higher thresholds can be used to reduce the likelihood of false positives. A more conservative interpretation is recommended when either new host species or new geographic areas are under investigation. A PR assay was developed to allow detection of antibodies in hemolyzed sera [

 <xref rid="B79-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. In this test, titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that gave 80% reduction in the number of plaques compared to the negative control [
 <xref rid="B79-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Although Vero cells are most commonly utilized in these tests, use of Vero. DogSLAMtag cells, which allows for improved virus replication and permits reduction of incubation time from nine days to four days ([
 <xref rid="B72-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]; Saliki, unpublished observations) may be a more robust and cost-effective alternative.
