 <xref rid="B75-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Using a similar approach, Krafft 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="B80-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] designed a protocol that allows amplification of degraded RNA in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded samples and in unfixed autolyzed tissues. This technique was useful to confirm CeMV infection in fixed tissues from 
 <italic>D. delphis</italic> stranded along the coast of California in 1995–1997 and in cases of chronic encephalitis in Mediterranean

 <xref rid="B75-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Since then, other primers including sets of “universal” morbillivirus primers based on the conserved N terminus of the morbillivirus N gene, were also successfully used to detect CeMV [
 <xref rid="B67-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. A real-time RT-PCR (rtRT-PCR) that targets the hypervariable C terminal domain of the N gene was developed by Grant 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] for a rapid and differential detection of dolphin and porpoise morbilliviruses. This test is rapid, very sensitive and specific for either DMV or PMV and does not cross-react with CDV, PDV, RPV, PPRV and MV [
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. A rtRT-PCR assay that targeted the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene, as a house-keeping gene, was developed to determine whether total RNA extracted from stranded cetacean tissues is amplifiable [
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This test allowed for the detection of GAPDH gene sequences from 14 marine mammal species and is essential for interpreting negative results with the morbillivirus RT-PCRs. Another rtRT-PCR was later designed to amplify a highly conserved region within the F gene and to differentiate between DMV, PMV, and PWMV [
 <xref rid="B81-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,
 <xref rid="B82-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. More recently, a pan-marine mammal morbillivirus semi-nested RT-PCR using a degenerate set of primers targeting conserved sequences of the P gene was described [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] for the detection of both pinniped and cetacean morbilliviruses. Such an assay is useful for detecting morbilliviruses in multiple marine mammal species. The L primers, described by Woo 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], may also be helpful for detecting CeMV in odontocetes and mysticetes. Clearly, with all the advances in molecular biology, diagnosing CeMV infection has become much faster, easier and more reliable. RT-PCR assays should be used together with the other techniques to distinguish among acute infection, prolonged persistence of morbillivirus RNA following CeMV acute disease, and chronic infection. When CeMV infection is detected in a novel host species, samples should be sequenced for species confirmation and identification and also sent to morbillivirus reference centers for genetic confirmation of the species involved.
