<p>The pathogenesis and clinical course of morbillivirus infections in cetaceans are poorly understood as there are no comparable laboratory studies to those on CDV in dogs and MV in primates [

 <xref rid="B108-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Acute and subacute systemic presentations and chronic CNS infection causing death have been documented, as described in preceding sections. However, the existence and nature of subclinical infection remains speculative. Between 1995â€“1997, a series of DMV seropositive (&gt; 1:50)

 <xref rid="B75-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. One of the six dolphins survived and developed very high titers (1:720) against DMV while in rehabilitation. The other five were euthanized and, at necropsy, none had classical morbillivirus lesions. However, one had a mild lymphocytic meningoencephalitis and its brain was positive for morbillivirus RNA by RT-PCR, as described in Mediterranean 
 <italic>S. coeruleoalba</italic>. Morbilliviral RNA was also detected in the spleen and heart of two other dolphins without histological lesions [
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Whether this actually represents subclinical infection in 
 <italic>D. delphis</italic> or an atypical viral strain/host presentation in the eastern Pacific is unknown.
