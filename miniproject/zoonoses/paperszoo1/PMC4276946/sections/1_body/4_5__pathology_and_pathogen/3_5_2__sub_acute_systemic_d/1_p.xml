<p>Animals that survive the acute stage of infection may succumb to opportunistic infections (
 <italic>Toxoplama gondii</italic>, herpesviruses, bacteria such as 
 <italic>Photobacterium damselae</italic>, and fungi) as a consequence of the profound immunosuppression. This typical pattern has been commonly seen in odontocetes that died during outbreaks of CeMV in Europe, South America, the USA and Australia [

 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp.) is also common [
