<p>This chronic form of infection was a feature of the 1987â€“1988 
 <italic>T. truncatus</italic> epizootic off the US Atlantic coast, where confirmation of morbillivirus infection was only possible using IHC (53% of 79 cases) [
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and RT-PCR (86% of 29 IHC negative cases) [
 <xref rid="B92-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]). More recently, chronic CeMV infection was detected in two 
 <italic>T. aduncus</italic> from Western Australia [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It was characterized by pronounced lymphoid depletion and severe secondary infections and the almost complete absence of typical morbillivirus lesions in the lungs and brain. Morbillivirus antigen was detected in lymphoid tissues, as well as in the hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells, biliary epithelium, and tunica media myocytes of blood vessels within the liver and mesenteric lymph nodes but not in the lungs or brain [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. RT-PCR amplified morbilliviral RNA in the same tissues. These results suggested that the dolphins had survived the acute phase of the infection but died following profound immunosuppression and secondary infections [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. If the pathogenesis of CeMV is similar to that of MV [
 <xref rid="B93-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], cetaceans that survived acute and sub-acute infection could show prolonged RNA persistence in the blood and lymphoid organs and could be RT-PCR positive in the absence of typical morbillivirus lesions. The concurrent use of histology, IHC and molecular techniques is recommended to further explore the pathogenesis of chronic systemic infections.
