<p>Acutely fatal CeMV infection is generally associated with severe multifocal to diffuse interstitial broncho-pneumonia characterized by necrosis of type I pneumocytes and bronchiolar epithelial cells, interstitial oedema, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, and formation of large syncytia in the alveolar and bronchiolar lumina. Intracytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusion bodies can be noted and are sometimes numerous in respiratory epithelia, bronchiolar gland epithelia and the syncytial cells. Generalized lymphoid depletion with germinal center necrosis is usually present and syncytial cells (Warthin-Finkeldey type) are often prominent in lymphoid tissues (
