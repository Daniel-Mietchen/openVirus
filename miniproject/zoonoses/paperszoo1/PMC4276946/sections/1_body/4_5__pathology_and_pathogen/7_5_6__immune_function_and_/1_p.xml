<p>Morbillivirus infections have long been known to result in host immune suppression [

 <xref rid="B112-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Recent studies suggest similar effects in naturally infected, wild 
 <italic>T. truncatus</italic> sampled as part of capture-release studies for health assessment. Bossart 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] reported a significant decrease in mitogen-induced T cell proliferation along with an increase in lysozyme concentrations and a marginally significant increase in monocyte phagocytosis, along with a marginally significant decrease in the numbers of CD4+ T lymphocytes in 
 <italic>T. truncatus</italic> that had antibody titers â‰¥ 1:8 against morbillivirus, suggestive of previous exposure to the virus, compared to animals with lower or no titers. They found no effects on neutrophil phagocytosis. While the timing of the morbillivirus infection (active infection, chronic infection, resolved past infection) cannot be determined from titers alone, it is clear that there is an association between modulation of immune functions and previous exposure to morbillivirus infection in 
 <italic>T. truncatus</italic>, as observed in other species. Further studies are needed.
