<p>Morbillivirus transmission is thought to occur mostly after the inhalation of aerosolized virus shed by infected individuals [
 <xref rid="B113-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. This horizontal transmission is likely to occur among cetaceans too and to be favored by a gregarious behavior and a high density of cetaceans [

 <xref rid="B114-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Transmission by inhalation of expired blowhole droplets possibly occurs during breathing in a synchronized fashion when large numbers of tightly grouped cetaceans are travelling and feeding together or are engaged in social activities [
