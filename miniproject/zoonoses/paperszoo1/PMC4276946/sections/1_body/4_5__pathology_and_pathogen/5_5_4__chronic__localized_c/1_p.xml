<p>Cetaceans that have cleared and resolved DMV systemic infection may develop a CNS form that is characterized by the presence of lesions and virus only in the brain [

 <xref rid="B56-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,

 <xref rid="B94-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. This CNS form was consistently observed in 
 <italic>S. coeruleoalba</italic> after the two epidemics in the Mediterranean Sea [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. By contrast with the sub-acute cerebral CeMV infection, cytoplasmic or nuclear eosinophilic inclusions were only occasionally detected and syncytial cells were not observed in the CNS form. Many neuronal processes showed immunostaining for CeMV, and some areas had massive accumulation of CeMV-antigen, while contiguous zones of the brain had almost no staining. This suggests that the presence of CeMV was more the result of cell-to-cell spreading of infection rather than of a multifocal infection indicative of blood-borne infection. The CNS form appears to share histological characteristics with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and old dog encephalitis (ODE), chronic latent localized infections that affect humans and dogs, respectively, and are caused by defective forms of MV and CDV, respectively [

 <xref rid="B96-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>,
 <xref rid="B97-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. As in SSPE and ODE, the CNS lesions were localized predominantly in the cerebral cortex, subcortical white matter, and the thalamus, while the cerebellum was mostly spared. In the three conditions perivascular cuffing, diffuse gliosis, and glial nodules with neurophagia were the most prominent changes [
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Focal malacia was not detected [
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>,
 <xref rid="B96-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>,

 <xref rid="B100-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Demyelination was less prominent in dolphins with the exclusively CNS presentation and in dogs with ODE than is seen in the meningoencephalitis of CeMV or CDV, respectively [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,

 <xref rid="B102-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. As in the human and canine presentations, antigen and viral RNA could be detected in dolphin brains but the virus proved difficult to isolate [
 <xref rid="B101-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. The mechanism for this is unknown but delayed clearance of antigen and RNA from the CNS may be related to reduced immune surveillance in an immuno-privileged site [

 <xref rid="B100-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. RT-PCR studies on the brain of 
 <italic>S. coeruleoalba</italic> chronically affected by CeMV suggest that the sequence of the P gene is different in these cases [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], but further research is needed. The role of CD147 and other cell receptors in the pathogenesis of this form of the disease should be further examined [
