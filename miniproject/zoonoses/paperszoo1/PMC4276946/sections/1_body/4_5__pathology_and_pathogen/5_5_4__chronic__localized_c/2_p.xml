<p>The prevalence of the DMV-CNS form in 
 <italic>S. coeruleoalba</italic> seems to be higher in dolphins than prevalence of SSPE in humans. Indeed, in a hypothetical scenario where the whole central Mediterranean 
 <italic>S. coeruleoalba</italic> population (15,778 individuals; 95% CI = 10,940 to 22,756 [
 <xref rid="B104-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]) was exposed to DMV during the 2006–2008 epidemic, the proportional morbidity rate of CNS-localized infection would be between 141 and 293 per 100,000 cases [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In a recent study in Germany, the risk of developing SSPE after acute measles infection in children below five years of age was estimated to range from 1:1700 to 1:3300 (30.3 to 58.8 per 100,000 cases) in 2003–2009 [
 <xref rid="B105-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Further research should explore true age-weighted prevalence of this syndrome in dolphins. There are no comparable data for ODE though it is assumed to be a very rare complication of CDV infection. The significance of this related to epidemiology remains to be determined. However, the diversity of cetacean morbilliviruses seems greater than that seen within other morbillivirus species. This is unexpected for a virus that induces lifelong immunity and high cross-protection between congeneric viruses in long-lived hosts. It is possible that CNS persistence plays a role in the maintenance of strains in an ocean basin, although, as a dead end infection, it is unlikely to contribute to virus transmission to other cetaceans.
