<p>Although the CNS form has been mostly described in Mediterranean 
 <italic>S. coeruleoalba</italic>, a similar presentation was described in a few other sporadic cases, namely a mature 
 <italic>L. obliquidens</italic> stranded on the coast of Miyasaki, Japan, in March 1998 [
 <xref rid="B106-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>], in a juvenile white-beaked dolphin (
 <italic>Lagenorhynchus albirostris</italic>) that beached on the island of Ameland, the Netherlands, in June 2011 and died in a rehabilitation center six months later [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], in four 
 <italic>S. coeruleoalba</italic> stranded along the coasts of the Canary Islands in 2002â€“2011 [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and in several 
 <italic>T. truncatus</italic> from North America (Colegrove, pers. observation). The CNS form was not detected in 
 <italic>P. phocoena</italic> from the North Sea and Northeastern (NE) Atlantic, although the brains from relatively few animals were examined [
 <xref rid="B107-viruses-06-05145" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Current data would suggest that of the three known strains of CeMV, the DMV variant is the only one associated with the chronic CNS presentation. However, it is also the most prevalent variant detected in nature, and much more research would be required before conclusions could be drawn.
