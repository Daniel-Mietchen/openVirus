<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0084638-t008">Table 8</xref>, the PB2, PA, and NP proteins had the largest average numbers of avian-human chronological genomic signatures. These findings were consistent with the results from genomic signature analyses during 1902–2013, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0084638-t003">Table 3</xref>. When examining the numbers of signatures across all periods, we observed that the numbers of chronological signatures in the PB2, PA, and NP proteins were relatively stable, except during 1902–1918. A stable number of signatures over time suggested that the PB2, PA, and NP share similar evolutionary pathways, and a large number of characteristic sites indicated that they undergo rigorous multigenic adaptation to a new host. These findings supported the hypothesis that the coevolution of RNP proteins is a crucial factor that restrains the genomic segments from forming interspecies reassortants, and limits the evolutionary divergence between host-specific lineages

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0084638-t008">Table 8</xref>, we observed that the average swine-human chronological genomic signatures in the RNP proteins were among the largest, excluding NS1. Unlike the avian-human chronological signatures, the numbers markedly reduced during 1978–2009 and 2010–2013. These findings suggested that the sequence-level genetic differences in the RNP proteins between swine and human viruses might have reduced in recent years. We further observed that the number of PB1 chronological signatures reduced from 20 to 3 during 1969–1977 and 1978–2009, but increased to 14 during 2010–2013. These observations indicated the association of the viral polymerase complex with the swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) that caused the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, and showed the genetic diversity and adaptation variability in the components of the RNP complex in different hosts.
