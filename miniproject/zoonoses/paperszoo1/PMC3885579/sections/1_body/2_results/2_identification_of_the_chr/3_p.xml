<p>Aside from the RNP complex, the NS1 protein displayed maximum variance in the numbers of chronological avian-human signatures. The high variance in the number of the NS1 signatures resulted from selected signatures in one period becoming nonsignatures in a different period, or vice versa (see details of the avian-human NS1 signatures in each of the 6 periods in Table S2 in

Several signatures displayed an increase in ARI (ΔARI &gt;0.2) from 1958–1968 to 1969–1977, and 5 signatures showed a peak ARI value during 1969–1977: NS1–23, 56, 98, 112, and 119 (

 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Forbes1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Our findings of peak ARI values for NS-23 and 98 during 1969–1977, immediately after 1968, corresponded well with those results. Our analyses of the ARI values of chronological genomic signatures could potentially elucidate the relationships between the chronological properties of signatures and the viral fitness of influenza viruses.
