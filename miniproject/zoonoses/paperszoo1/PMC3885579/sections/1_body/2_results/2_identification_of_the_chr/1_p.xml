<p>Genomic signatures can change over time because of point mutations or interspecies reassortments. According to the years in which previous human pandemics occurred, we divided the time between 1902 and 2013 into 6 periods: 1902–1918, 1919–1957, 1958–1968, 1969–1977, 1978–2009, and 2010–2013. We assigned each IAV to one of the 6 chronological groups according to its year of discovery. From each chronological group, we identified the chronological genomic signatures that were characteristic of the hosts and specific to that period. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0084638-t008">Table 8</xref> shows the number of signatures in each period for the internal proteins.
