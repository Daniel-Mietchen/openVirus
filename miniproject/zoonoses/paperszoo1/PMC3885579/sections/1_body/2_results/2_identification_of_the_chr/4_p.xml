<p>Our study’s analyses further showed that the number of M1 avian-human signatures remained relatively constant: between 4 and 6 throughout all periods. Although the numbers of signatures remained relatively stable during each period, the signatures identified in each period varied in their positions and amino acid residues (see details of the avian-human chronological genomic signatures of M1 in Table S3 in

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084638.s002">Figure S2</xref>). When comparing the M1 signatures identified during 1902–1918 (M1–101, 121, 144, and 234) with those identified during 1958–1968 (M1–115, 121, 137, and 218), we observed that 4 signatures were identified during both periods, but their sites differed, with the exception of M1–121. We observed a marked reduction in the ARI values of M1–101, 144, and 234 from 1902–1918 to 1958–1968 (

These results showed that the host-associated genomic signatures can change over time, and that the degree of change can vary in distinct sites in different proteins, as reflected in the various changes in the ARI values.
