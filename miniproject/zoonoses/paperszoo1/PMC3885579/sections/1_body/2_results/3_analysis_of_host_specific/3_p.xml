<p>Most of the characteristic sites served as genomic signatures (i.e., valid sites) within specific periods. For example, M2–18 became a signature after 1958, and NS1–74 became a signature after 2010. Very few characteristic sites remained valid throughout all periods. The dominant amino acid residues on a characteristic site can vary across different periods or remain the same. For example, the dominant amino acids of NS1–67 in the avian and human IAV varied throughout different periods, whereas the dominant amino acids of M2–18 remained the same in the human virus and varied in the avian virus. In the PB2 protein, we identified one characteristic site, PB2–271, as a valid signature specific to avian and human IAV across all periods. Its amino acid transitions were a mutation from A to T in avian IAV and from T to A in human IAV during 1902–1918, as shown in Table S4 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084638.s003">Materials S1</xref>. In the signature analyses comparing swine and human IAV, the dominant amino acids of the PB2–271 in the swine virus switched from T to A during 1978–2009, and 2010–2013, as shown in Table S5 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084638.s003">Materials S1</xref>. A study by Kendra et al. showed that the mutation T271A in PB2 increases polymerase activity and virus growth in human cells. Results from in vitro reporter gene and sequence analyses indicated that the PB2-271A in S-OIV was likely to have contributed to its efficient transmission among humans during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Bussey1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Our findings on the PB2-T271A in the swine virus further supported this hypothesis. Although a previous study using phylogenetic modeling 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Tamuri1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> excluded the PB2–271 as a characteristic site, our analysis of the chronological genomic signature transitions successfully identified its relevance in host adaptation. In addition to the 271A mutation, the authors identified another PB2 mutation A588I that increased polymerase activity in mammalian cells 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Bussey1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Our results support the occurrence of an adaptive mutation of the conserved residues from A to I at site 588 in the human virus (Table S4 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084638.s003">Materials S1</xref>). Although PB2–588 had a conserved amino acid A in the avian virus throughout all periods, it showed a transition from A to T in the swine virus during 1978–2009 and 2010–2013. However, in the human virus, the PB2–588 showed an early transition from A to I, which later changed to T, as in the swine virus (Tables S4, S5 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084638.s003">Materials S1</xref>). Further investigation is required to establish if the change from I to T in the human virus reduced polymerase activity in human cells and contributed to the end of 2009 H1N1 pandemic. In addition to the PB2–271, the NP-100, 136, and 313 remained genomic signatures throughout all periods (Table S4 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084638.s003">Materials S1</xref>). Like PB2–271, their dominant amino acids showed chronological changes, but only in the human virus. Our identity analyses showed that only NP-33, 357, and M2–14 remained signatures throughout all periods and also maintained the same dominant amino acids (Table S4 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084638.s003">Materials S1</xref>). The stabilities of these sites indicate a crucial association with host range phenotypes and pathogenic mechanisms, which requires further verification.
