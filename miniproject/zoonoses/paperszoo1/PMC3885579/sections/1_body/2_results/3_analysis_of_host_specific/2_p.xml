<p>We identified a distinct amino acid transition pattern in PB2–590 and 591. Both signatures became valid after 2009, following a G590S and a Q591R mutation, respectively (Table S4 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084638.s003">Materials S1</xref>). The amino acid transitions in PB2–627 showed a contrasting pattern: PB2–627 maintained a valid signature from 1902 to early 2009, but after 2009 the dominant amino acid of PB2–627 in the human strain changed from K to E, as in the avian strain. Previous studies have conducted biochemical and modeling experiments to investigate the adaptive strategies of influenza viruses to evade restriction in hosts

 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Hudjetz1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Our results on signature transitions supported the findings by Mehle et al. on the SR polymorphism that enables glutamic acid at position 627 to evade restriction in human cells

These observations suggested that signature transition analysis can be applied as a preprocess to identify prospective functional sites in influenza viral proteins prior to further biochemical investigations. We also observed that the PB2–54, 65, 147, 184, 225, 315, 340, 559, and 645 showed similar transition patterns to those of the PB2–590 and 591 (Table S4 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084638.s003">Materials S1</xref>). Most of these sites are located in the NP binding domains (Table S1 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084638.s003">Materials S1</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084638-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In addition to the PB2–627, which switched from a signature to a nonsignature during 2010–2013, the PB2–199, 475, and 567 showed a similar signature-to-nonsignature tendency. These sites are involved in NP binding, nuclear localization signaling, and RNA cap binding. Further investigation is required to elucidate their roles in polymerase activity.
