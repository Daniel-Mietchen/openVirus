<p>To further investigate the chronological genomic signatures, we analyzed the transitions of the amino acid residues of the signatures in each internal protein across different periods. In the validity analyses, we examined the changing roles of the characteristic sites (signature or nonsignature) during different periods. These results provided information on the relationships between amino acid substitutions and host range phenotypes, and could increase our understanding of the effects of genetic diversity on the adaptation of the IAV. In the identity analyses, we examined the characteristic sites that remained valid throughout all periods for changes in their amino acid residues over time. The details of the transitions of the amino acid residues on the characteristic sites in each internal protein during the 6 periods are given in Tables S4 and S5 (in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084638.s003">Materials S1</xref>). The various amino acid transitions in the characteristic sites might indicate the differences in the pathogenic and adaptive mechanisms of the IAV during different periods.
