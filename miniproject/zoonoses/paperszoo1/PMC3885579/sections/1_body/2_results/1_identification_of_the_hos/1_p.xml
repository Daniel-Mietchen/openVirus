<p>In this study, we aligned the human IAV protein sequences in the NCBI between 1902 and 2013 with the avian and swine IAV protein sequences using the MUSCLE software 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Edgar1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. After balancing the size differences between the different host groups using random sampling (see “Materials and Methods”), we calculated the average ARI for each site in the alignments.
