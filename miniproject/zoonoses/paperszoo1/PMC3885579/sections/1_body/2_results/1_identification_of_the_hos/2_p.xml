<p>In our analyses of genomic signatures, based on the ARI, we considered the top 20 sites, and selected only the higher-ranked sites that differed in their dominant amino acids as genomic signatures. We identified 129 avian-human and 77 swine-human genomic signatures in the internal proteins PB1, PB2, PA, NP, M1, M2, NS1, NS2, and PB1-F2, an alternative protein product of PB1.

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0084638-t007">7</xref>. Several previously reported characteristic sites were unable to distinguish the protein sequences of different species in the more recent data used in our study. However, we discovered some novel genomic signatures. For example, in the NP protein, we eliminated positions 375 and 423 as avian-human signatures, but identified novel signatures at positions 351 and 353. In the swine group, we identified NP-16, 283, and 313 as novel swine-human signatures. These sites have been identified to be associated with a barrier against the zoonotic introduction of IAV into the human population. Previous experimental results indicated that adaptive mutations at these sites in the NP of the 1918 and 2009 pandemic strains could have contributed to increased resistance in murine Mx1 and human MxA
