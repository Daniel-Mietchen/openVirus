<p>The number of characteristic sites mapping to a reported domain was smaller in the PA protein than in the PB2 or PB1. Previous studies have identified some of these sites as located in proximity to the epitopic regions

 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Deng1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, or in the proteolysis domain 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-SanzEzquerro1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and nuclear localization signal area 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Nieto1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084638-g004">Figure 4</xref>. In the NP protein shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084638-g005">Figure 5</xref>, most of the characteristic sites were involved in the PB2 interactions. A study by Mänz et al. verified that the mutations at 305, 351, 353, and 357 affect Mx1 resistance 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Mnz1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Our findings were in accordance with previous functional analyses implicating PB2 as a putative target of Mx1 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Stranden1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Based on their positions in the sequence, the genomic signatures of M1 could be divided into 2 groups. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084638-g006">Figure 6</xref>, the group in proximity to position 126 was within the membrane-binding region 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Thaa1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, and the other was located in the RNP-binding region 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Baudin1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The M2 protein contains 3 clusters of signatures and a single outlier M2–28 in the transmembrane region 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Lamb1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084638-g007">Figure 7</xref>. The cluster of signatures to the left of the M2–28 is within the M2 extracellular region (M2e) 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Lamb1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Hull1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, the cluster of signatures to the right of the M2–28 represents part of an amphipathic helix 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Tian1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, and the final cluster of signatures is located in the M2 protein tail, which reportedly interacts with the M1 protein 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Chen3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Most of the signatures of NS1 were located in the RNA binding domain 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Hale1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Qian1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, the eIF4GI subunit-binding domain 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Aragon1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Kochs1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, or the epitopic regions 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Gianfrani1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Babon1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084638-g008">Figure 8</xref>. Some of the signatures could be mapped to multiple domains, such as the NS1–215 and 227. By comparing the signatures identified in NS2 with the reported domains, we identified that all of the signatures constituted part of the M1 binding domain or the epitope (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084638-g009">Figure 9</xref>). The genomic signatures of PB1-F2 could be divided into two parts by the position 42, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084638-g010">Figure 10</xref>. The group of signatures to the right of PB1-F2-42 were mapped to the mitochondria targeting domain 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Yamada1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Among them we also identified PB1-F2-62, 66 and 70, which were part of the H-2 D
 <sup>b</sup> binding peptide 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Chen4" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The other group of signatures were mostly clustered at positions 23–31. Further investigation is required to elucidate their their roles in polymerase activity. Table S1 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084638.s003">Materials S1</xref> shows the reported domains in each internal protein.
