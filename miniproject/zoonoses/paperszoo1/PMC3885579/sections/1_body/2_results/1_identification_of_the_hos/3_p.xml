These figures also show the functional, structural, or antigenic domains mapped by the signatures. Similar to the findings by Miotto et al. in avian sequences 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Miotto1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, we identified that the NP (20 sites), PB2 (20 sites), and PA (15 sites) were among the proteins that had the highest numbers of signatures. These proteins, together with the PB1 polymerase, form the RNP complex that encloses the genomic segments in the virion. Our analyses showed consistent results that most of the avian-human PB2 characteristic sites were located in the PB1 and NP binding areas. We observed similar results in the swine-human PB2 signatures (

Previous studies of human pandemics showed a cross-species amino acid substitution at this site, and suggested an important role of PB1–375 in adaptation to mammals
