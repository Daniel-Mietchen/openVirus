<p>In this study, we proposed an alternative measure, based on the ARI, for the evaluation of the abilities of the genomic signatures of the IAV to distinguish the host. Using the data in the NCBI (in February, 2013), we identified 129 avian-human and 77 swine-human genomic signatures, including novel signatures that previous methods failed to recognize. Several of these novel signatures could be mapped to known domains to show the biological significance of the novel signatures, and indicate the value of the ARI in the evaluations. These novel signatures could potentially increase our understanding of genetic determinants and their potential combinations involved in host restriction. To chronologically analyze the genomic signatures, we divided the virus data into chronological groups, and then identified the genomic signatures from these groups. A comprehensive analysis of the chronological signatures throughout different periods indicated adaptation trends that were consistent with previously published results. Our chronological approach considers the underlying phylogenetic relationships of genomic signatures, and can identify adaptation trends more accurately than existing approaches that do not consider the evolutionary correlations among viral proteins.</p>
