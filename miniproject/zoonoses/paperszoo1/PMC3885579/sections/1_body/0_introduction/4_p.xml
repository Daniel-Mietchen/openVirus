<p>In this study, we proposed an alternative measure for the evaluation of the host-specific characteristic sites in the IAV based on the adjusted Rand index (ARI) 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Hubert1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and produced a novel catalogue of host-specific genomic signatures from the viral sequence data as of February 2013 in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). In comparison with the sites identified from the same sequence data using measures such as entropy and mutual information (MI), the sites we identified have higher species specificity for the determination of the host range. Genomic signatures can change because of point mutations or interspecies reassortments; therefore, we also performed a chronological analysis of the genomic signatures. We divided the IAV data into chronological groups according to the time of their discovery, and identified the genomic signatures in each of the groups. These signatures were host-specific and time-specific. We analyzed the transitions of these signatures across various periods to evaluate the adaptation trends, and successfully identified several adaptation trends that correlated with the results by related studies. We also identified additional adaptation patterns that warrant further investigation.
