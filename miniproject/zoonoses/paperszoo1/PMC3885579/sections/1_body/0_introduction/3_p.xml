<p>The successful establishment of an influenza virus in a new host is rare because it is a multistep process that requires the efficient and effective transmission, replication, and adaptation of the virus. However, pandemics caused by widely circulating viruses with the potential to transmit to humans remain a threat 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Naffakh1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The emergence and spread of novel IAV remain of major global concern; therefore, increased understanding of the host range is essential to maintain the efficacy of antiviral drugs and influenza vaccines. In addition to the analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying host specificity, using in vitro systems and reverse genetics of influenza viruses, the analysis of a considerable amount of available viral sequence data provides a cost-effective approach for the identification of host-associated genomic signatures as host-range determinants.
