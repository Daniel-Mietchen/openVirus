<p>The accumulation of point mutations during genome replication, and the reassortment of viral gene segments during mixed infections, promotes the evolution of influenza viruses 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Naffakh1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Because the number of viral sequences is continuously increasing, investigators have developed computational methods to recognize and verify interspecies transmission candidate determinants at the sequence level, despite the absence of specific knowledge on the antigenic properties of the viruses being investigated. For example, a number of large-scale phylogenetic and sequence alignment analyses have suggested that the IAV ribonucleoprotein (RNP) genes have evolved into divergent host-associated lineages, and that selected amino acids at specific positions of each internal protein are characteristic of the species origin for the sequences
