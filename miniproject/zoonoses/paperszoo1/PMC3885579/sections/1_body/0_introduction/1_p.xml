<p>Influenza A viruses (IAV) are members of the Orthomyxoviridae family, and are enveloped negative-stranded RNA viruses with a segmented genome 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Palese1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The envelope of an IAV consists of 2 surface glycoproteins, HA and NA, and a small domain of the M2 protein, underlain by the matrix protein M1. The IAV have the capacity to evade host immune systems because of a wide variety of potential combinations of the 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes. Because of their vast genetic diversity and unique host range, IAV have caused recurrent annual epidemics and several major worldwide pandemics in human history.
