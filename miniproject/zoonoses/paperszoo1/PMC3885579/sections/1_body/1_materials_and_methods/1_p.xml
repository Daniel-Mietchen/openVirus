<p>We show the process flow of this studyâ€™s approach for host-specific genomic signature identification and chronological analysis in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084638-g001">Figure 1</xref>. All available IAV sequences in the NCBI in February, 2013 were downloaded. The data were postprocessed by removing the redundant sequences and sequences missing quality annotations. The HA and NA proteins were excluded because of their genetic diversity, which impedes the production of satisfactory alignments. The influenza proteins were classified into 3 groups according to the type of host: avian, human, and swine (

 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Edgar1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> were applied to the IAV protein sequences, and the alignments were then analyzed to identify the characteristic sites as potential signatures to distinguish different host-restricted IAV proteins.
