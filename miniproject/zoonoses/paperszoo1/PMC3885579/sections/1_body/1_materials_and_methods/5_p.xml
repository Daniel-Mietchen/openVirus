<p>To investigate the adaptation trends, the IAV sequences were partitioned into chronological groups according to the time of their discovery: 1902–1918, 1919–1957, 1958–1968, 1969–1977, 1978–2009, and 2010–2013. The IAV sequences identified during the different periods were aligned separately and balanced between different hosts using the described random sampling techniques. For each column (i.e., a site) in an alignment, the average ARI was calculated to measure its association with the host, and the characteristic sites were identified. The characteristic sites identified from different chronological groups were then compared to further investigate 2 types of adaptation trend: validity and identity.</p>
