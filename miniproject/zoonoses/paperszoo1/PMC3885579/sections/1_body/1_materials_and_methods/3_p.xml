<p>Previous large-scale studies have used several computational methods to evaluate the significance of host-specific genomic signatures. A study on the IAV sequences as of May 2009 in the NCBI used an entropy measure to identify 47 avian-human signatures in the proteins PB1, PB2, PA, NP, M1, M2, NS1, and NS2
