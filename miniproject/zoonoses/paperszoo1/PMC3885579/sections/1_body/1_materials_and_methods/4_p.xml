<p>A higher ARI value indicates greater agreement between the 2 partitions. If 
 <italic>P</italic> is compared to the partition of the IAV protein sequences according to the host (e.g., avian vs. human), and 
 <italic>Q</italic> is compared to the partition based on the amino acids in a particular column of the protein sequence alignment, a column with a high ARI value is a characteristic site of the host-specific protein sequences. Using 11 sequences for illustration, an alignment was partitioned into 2 subsets according to the host (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0084638-t002">Table 2</xref>). This partition was termed 
 <italic>P</italic> = {(s
 <sub>1</sub>, s
 <sub>2</sub>, s
 <sub>3</sub>, s
 <sub>4</sub>, s
 <sub>5</sub>, s
 <sub>6</sub>), (s
 <sub>7</sub>, s
 <sub>8</sub>, s
 <sub>9</sub>, s
 <sub>10</sub>, s
 <sub>11</sub>)}. Based on the amino acids in Site 1, the sequences were partitioned into 4 subsets, denoted by 
 <italic>Q1</italic> = {(s
 <sub>1</sub>), (s
 <sub>2</sub>, s
 <sub>3</sub>, s
 <sub>4</sub>, s
 <sub>5</sub>, s
 <sub>6</sub>), (s
 <sub>7</sub>, s
 <sub>8</sub>, s
 <sub>9</sub>), (s
 <sub>10</sub>, s
 <sub>11</sub>)}. Similarly, based on the amino acids in Site 2, the sequences were partitioned into 2 subsets, denoted by 
 <italic>Q2</italic> = {(s
 <sub>1</sub>, s
 <sub>7</sub>, s
 <sub>8</sub>, s
 <sub>9</sub>), (s
 <sub>2</sub>, s
 <sub>3</sub>, s
 <sub>4</sub>, s
 <sub>5</sub>, s
 <sub>6</sub>, s
 <sub>10</sub>, s
 <sub>11</sub>)}. The first 2 subsets of 
 <italic>Q1</italic> are exclusively avian, and the other 2 subsets are exclusively human, whereas the subsets of 
 <italic>Q2</italic> are both mixed avain and human. Therefore partition 
 <italic>Q1</italic> is more specific to the hosts than 
 <italic>Q2</italic>. The ARI between 
 <italic>P</italic> and 
 <italic>Q1</italic> was 0.58, and the ARI between 
 <italic>P</italic> and 
 <italic>Q2</italic> was 0.13, which reflects the fact that Site 1 is preferable to Site 2. A study by Milligan and Cooper evaluated several different indices for the measurement of the agreement between 2 partitions, and recommended the ARI 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Milligan1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Therefore, in this study, the ARI was adopted for the evaluation of the host-specific characteristic sites in the IAV.
