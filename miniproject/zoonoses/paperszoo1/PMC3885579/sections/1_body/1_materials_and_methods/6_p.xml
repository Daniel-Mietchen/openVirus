<p>Validity refers to a genomic signature identified in one period becoming a nonsignature in subsequent periods, or vice versa. A site is considered “valid” within a period if it is a host-specific signature within that period. When a valid site is no longer a signature within another period, it becomes an “invalid” site. An invalid site in one period can become valid within a different period if it is a host-specific site during that period. The purpose of the validity analysis was to examine the sites for changes in validity, caused by amino acid substitutions, over time.</p>
