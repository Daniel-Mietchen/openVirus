<p>Imbalance in the number of sequences can affect the identification of genomic signatures. To alleviate bias, two random sampling strategies were adopted to balance the data size in an alignment: undersampling and oversampling. For example, the number of avian PA records is 4052, which is substantially larger than 2698, the number of human PA records. In an alignment of all sequences, avian PA clearly dominates human PA, which could bias the calculation of the significance of the characteristic sites toward the avian PA. Using undersampling, 2698 avian PA sequences were randomly sampled without replacement, and combined with the 2698 human PA sequences to form a balanced alignment with an identical number of avian PA and human PA. Using oversampling, 4052 human PA sequences were randomly sampled with replacement, and combined with the 4052 avian PA sequences to form a second balanced alignment. Each column (i.e., each site) in the balanced alignments produced by undersampling and oversampling was evaluated for its significance. Multiple undersampling and oversampling runs were performed to reduce variance in the calculations of significance, and the genomic signatures were identified according to the average significance of each site.</p>
