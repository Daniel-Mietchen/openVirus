<p>For comparison, we calculated the entropy and the MI for each site. Low entropy in a site indicates that its amino acid residues are well-conserved, and thus the site is likely to represent a candidate genomic signature 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, an approach that identifies signatures based on low entropy can overlook potential characteristic sites. For example, in the sequences in the NCBI from 1902 to 2013, the amino acid residues at position PB2–588 are dominated by A (95%) in avian viral sequences. However, in human viral sequences, the identical position is relatively equally dominated by I (57%) and T (42%). Although Chen and Shih considered PB2–588 in the sequences as of May 28, 2009 in the NCBI to be a genomic signature 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, the entropy-based method could mistakenly eliminate PB2–588 as a characteristic site from more recent sequence data because of the high entropy of PB2–588 in the human strain. We could have included PB2–588 as a signature by ignoring the entropy constraint, but this would have incurred an increase in the false-positive rate. In contrast, PB2–588 could be considered a signature because of its high MI and AR values. Because MI and ARI are different measures, instead of comparing their values to determine which measure is more effective in signature evaluation, we compared the rankings of the sites, and their conserved amino acid residues, according to MI and ARI. Table S6 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084638.s003">Materials S1</xref> shows the top 20 MI- and ARI-ranked sites in avian and human PB2 proteins. PB2–645 and 591, the 19th- and 20th-ranked sites according to MI, have the same dominant amino acid in avian and human proteins. Though PB2–81, the 12th-ranked site, has different dominant residues between avian and human (T vs. M), the conservation levels of T and M in human are almost the same (M = 42.98% vs. T = 42.77%). Therefore, none of these sites is an appropriate genomic signature. In contrast, all the top 20 ARI-ranked sites showed differences in the dominant amino acid residues. We observed similar trends in other internal proteins. Overall, these findings suggested that the ARI provides a more appropriate measure for the ranking of characteristic sites when compared with MI.
