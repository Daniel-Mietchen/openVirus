<p>The changes in the conserved amino acid residues of chronological genomic signatures throughout different periods indicate a chronological relationship between signature transitions and adaptation trends. Based on the chronological transitions of a signature, we can evaluate its stability according to validity and identity. Our results showed a unique transition pattern in the dominant amino acid residues of PB2–590 and 591, which was consistent with previous biochemical modeling results on the SR polymorphism 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Mehle2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. We also identified other chronological signatures with similar amino acid transitions, such as the PB2–54, 65, and 147. According to the domains to which the chronological signatures are mapped, we were able to identify the variations in the domains during different periods. The chronological associations between the signatures and the mapped domains could provide alternative insight into previous findings on influenza virus evolution. Our analytical approach could serve as a preprocess to identify prospective characteristic sites that warrant further investigation.
