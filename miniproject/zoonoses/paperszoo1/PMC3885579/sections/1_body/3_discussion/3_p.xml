<p>Our experimental results showed that the ARI provides a more effective measure for detecting host-associated characteristic sites than entropy or MI. Using the IAV data in the NCBI, we identified novel signatures in 9 internal viral proteins that previous approaches failed to recognize. Several of the signatures could be mapped to known structural, functional, or antigenic domains of the proteins, which suggested their molecular functions and indicated the value of our approach.</p>
