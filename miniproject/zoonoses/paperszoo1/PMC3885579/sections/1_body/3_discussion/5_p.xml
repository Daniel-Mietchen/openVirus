<p>Chronological genomic signatures provide the basis for novel types of investigation into the multiple genetic determinants of a host range. The numbers of chronological signatures during different periods and their variance can correlate with the level of rigorousness of multigenic adaptation of influenza viruses to a new host. A larger number of signatures indicates greater difficulty in the transmission and adaptation of a viral protein to a new species, whereas larger variance in the number of signatures across different periods suggests a wide variety of amino acid residues switching from signature to a nonsignature roles or vice versa. For example, the larger number of chronological genomic signatures in the PB2, PB1, PA, and NP proteins (

The fluctuations in the ARI value for a signature across different periods indicate its genetic variability, through mutations or reassortment events, with time. Signatures with similar patterns in their ARI values are likely to be involved in related molecular functions and activities. Our analyses suggested correspondence between the ARI patterns (NS1â€“23 and 98) and increased viral growth
