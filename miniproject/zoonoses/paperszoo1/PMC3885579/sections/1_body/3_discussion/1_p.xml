<p>The availability of a considerable amount of data on the IAV has enabled computational approaches to identify amino acid residues as host-specific genomic signatures. Previous studies have performed large-scale complete-proteome analyses of the IAV sequences

 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Miotto1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Our study used more recent sequence data from the NCBI database (in February, 2013) than those studies. Unlike earlier computational methods that relied on a threshold to discriminate signatures from nonsignatures, such as the MI threshold of 0.4 in a study Miotto et al. 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Miotto1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and the entropy threshold of 0.33 in a study by Chen and Shih 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, we used the ARI to evaluate and compare the ability of each site in the IAV sequences for the distinguishing of a host. Tamuri et al. speculated that the verification of characteristic sites in different viral proteins based on one single threshold is questionable because different viral proteins evolve according to different selective constraints 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Tamuri1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The appropriate threshold might differ in different viral proteins because of their distinct characteristics and changes they might undergo during various circumstances. In addition, a threshold requires adjustment after novel data becomes available. For example, Chen and Shih changed their entropy threshold from 0.4 to 0.33 after an increase in the number of the identified IAV protein sequences
