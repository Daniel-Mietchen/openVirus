<p>Point mutations or interspecies reassortments can change the genomic signatures in viral sequences. Some previous studies analyzed adaptation trends in the previously identified genomic signatures without considering their phylogenetic relationships

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0084638-t004">Tables 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0084638-t005">5</xref>), our study analyzed the genomic signatures in their chronological order. We initially grouped the protein data chronologically, identified the signatures from each separate group, and then analyzed their variations. Therefore, unlike previous studies’ methods, our approach included the identification and analysis of sequence signatures and their chronological relationships. For example, from the chronological analysis of avian-human signatures, we detected a difference in the transition pattern in PB1 when compared with the other internal proteins: a comparatively larger number of characteristic sites had the same (or similar) dominant amino acid residues in the avian and the human viruses during 1919–1957 and 1958–1968, and the dominant residues varied after 1968 mostly in the human virus, but rarely in avian (Table S4 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084638.s003">Materials S1</xref>). These observations supported the reassortment hypothesis that PB1 gene was introduced from avian to human prior to the 1957 pandemic, and was maintained in human until 1968

 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Garten1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. In addition, the chronological analysis of swine-human signature transitions during 1978–2009 further showed that there were relatively more characteristic sites with the same dominant residues in PB1 than in the other internal proteins (Table S5 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084638.s003">Materials S1</xref>), and the number of signatures dropped from 20 to 3, the minimum across all periods (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0084638-t008">Table 8</xref>). These observations indicated that the genetic variability in PB1 between swine and human was minimal during 1978–2009. Several studies into the lineages and evolutionary genomics of the 2009 S-OIV suggested that the PB1 of S-OIV emerged from a triple-reassortment virus circulating in North American swine, and the PB1 gene in the source triple-reassortant was derived from human at the time of the triple reassortment events in 1998 
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Garten1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0084638-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Our findings of the chronological signature transition patterns in PB1 were in accordance with the reassortment history of the S-OIV. Further investigation is required to identify other chronological transition patterns of the other internal proteins, and to verify their relations to the historical reassortment events.
