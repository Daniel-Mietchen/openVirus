  <p>SIV strains and cross-species transmission to great apes and humans. Old World monkeys are naturally infected with over 40 different strains of SIV. These strains are species-specific and hence are denoted with a suffix to indicate their species of origin. Known cross-species transmission events to great apes and humans are highlighted in red.</p>
