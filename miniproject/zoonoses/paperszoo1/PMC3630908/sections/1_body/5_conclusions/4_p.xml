<p>How can the effects of emerging diseases be mitigated? A number of criteria need to be addressed (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). First, surveillance is key, and for this to be effective there needs to be an effective integration of medical and veterinary public health surveillance systems, as vividly illustrated by the incursion of West Nile virus into North America in 1999. Second, effective training in the early diagnosis of disease requires an emphasis on clinicians being skilled in recognizing that the early signs of infection may represent something unique and potentially serious. Third, it is for those that govern communities to recognize and take into account the likely impact of environmental developments on ecosystems and disease emergence, taking environmental impact studies beyond conservation of natural habitats and species. Finally, much more needs to be done to understand how viruses overcome the innate immune response when crossing the species barrier.
