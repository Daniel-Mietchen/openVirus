<p>Emergence of new infectious diseases is not a new phenomenon. However, it is arguably the rate at which new infections are being discovered that has accelerated in the past half Century. It is some comfort that emerging viruses linked to disease are invariably newly identified member species within well-characterized virus families, but this may change as we discover vast numbers of hitherto uncharacterized viruses in what is now commonly referred to as the virosphere. Indeed, it is reckoned by some that viruses represent the largest proportion of biomass on the planet if one takes into account an almost infinite number of viruses in the oceans. If this is the case, the human immune system does well to protect the species against a constant challenge from viruses constantly mutating and adapting to the environment and ecosystems around us.</p>
