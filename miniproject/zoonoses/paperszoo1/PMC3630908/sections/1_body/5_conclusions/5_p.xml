<p>Considerable international effort is now being made to collect and record samples of viruses and microorganisms from wild animal populations and potential arthropod vectors in order to expand the current molecular databases. By making available extensive catalogues of genome sequences, it is expected that newly emerging agents would in future be more readily identified and thus control measures put in place much more rapidly.</p>
