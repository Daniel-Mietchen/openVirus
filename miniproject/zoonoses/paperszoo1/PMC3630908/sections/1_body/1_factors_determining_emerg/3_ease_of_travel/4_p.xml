<p>The incursion of WNV into North America is an excellent example of a virus expanding into an ecological niche where transmission-competent vectors are already present. Once established in and around the New York area, the availability of vertebrate hosts, most notably corvids, together with optimal climatic conditions for vector populations enabled the rapid spread of WNV across the United States. Epizootic outbreaks have occurred frequently, with an escalating number of neurological cases among the immunocompromised and the elderly.
