<p>Air travel represents a major risk factor for the global spread of a new infectious agent. It is estimated that over 100 million passenger journeys by air are made every year. It is feasible to visit as many as three continents in a few hours. This is in marked contrast to just 50 years ago when many people rarely if ever traveled any distance from their place of residence. Frequent air travel is now regarded as a major contributing factor to the spread of emerging diseases. This is vividly illustrated by examining the rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus in 2003, when the infection was disseminated from China to at least 17 countries in less than a week. Based on the events of 2003, Hufnagel

The utility of having a model means that once preliminary data are available a prediction can be made as to those regions most at risk. Moreover, the work shows how difficulty if would be to contain an outbreak by vaccination alone, were one available. Once the statistical information is available, such a model can be used to predict those regions most at risk in the event of any future SARS epidemic. Were a vaccine available, the initial spread of virus might be contained if only a third of the population were immunized in the regions where the outbreak is focused. This assumes an index case made a single air journey. However, this increases substantially to 75% in the event of an index case making two journeys, with the whole population requiring vaccination if the same passenger made three trips. Analysis of air traffic from Mexico at the start of the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic suggests the risk of spread is particularly great when the volume of air traffic is high, but resources to report and trace diseased individuals is restricted.
