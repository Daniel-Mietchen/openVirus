<p>The advent of agriculture around 10â€‰000 years ago was pivotal in giving rise to many of the infections we know today. Agricultural-based societies led to humans living in close proximity both to each other and to livestock. In turn, human settlements provided fertile ground for interspecies transmission between farm animals, rodents, dogs, cats and insects. Once established in humans, the diseases could be maintained indefinitely, if the numbers of susceptible individuals remained above a certain threshold and in frequent contact with diseased persons. It is widely thought that measles emerged at this time, probably from rinderpest in cattle and diverged into an exclusively human pathogen as human centers of population grew to a level where an animal reservoir was no longer necessary. Similarly, smallpox may have evolved about 4000 years ago from camelpox, its closest phylogenetic relative.
