<p>The keeping of small rodents and mammals has been linked to zoonotic disease for many decades, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus transmitted as a result of handling persistently infected hamsters being a prime example. The keeping of prairie dogs is common in the United States, and indirectly led in 2003 to an outbreak of monkey pox in the State of Wisconsin.

 </sup> This totally unexpected occurrence was the result of housing prairie dogs intended for sale in close proximity to small rodents imported from the African continent, most notable rope squirrels (
 <italic>Funisciurus spp</italic>) and Gambian giant rats (
 <italic>Cricetomys spp</italic>). Although there were not fatalities among the 81 reported cases, it presented an opportunity for the spread of monkey pox into the feral mammal population of North America. It remains to be seen if wild animals become a source of monkey pox outbreaks in years to come.
