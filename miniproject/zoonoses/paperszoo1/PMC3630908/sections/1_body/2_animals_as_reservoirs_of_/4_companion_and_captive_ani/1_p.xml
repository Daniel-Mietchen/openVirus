<p>Frequent contact with companion animals, such as dogs, cats and horses, provide additional opportunities for the transmission of animal diseases to humans. Although companion animals have been kept within households over the centuries, the number of known emerging infections from such sources is remarkably few. Dogs in particular have been domesticated for over 8000 years and occupy a prominent position in the daily life of many societies. Search for the cause of respiratory disease in dogs is thus a particular focus for veterinary virologists and the application of modern molecular screening techniques has uncovered a number of canine homologues of human viruses. The discovery of a canine flavivirus distantly related human hepatitis C virus (HCV) raises some intriguing questions as to the origin of HCV in human populations.

 </sup> Although evidence was found of virus in the canine liver, there is as yet no evidence of this canine hepatitis C-like virus causing liver disease in dogs. Whether or not HCV first emerged from dogs remains speculative, but the finding of virus in the respiratory secretions of infected dogs certainly indicates a ready route of transmission to humans.
