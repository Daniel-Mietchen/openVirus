<p>The finding of novel flavivirus in dogs has promoted a search for related viruses in other companion animal species. By first generating a serological assay using expressed NS3 protein from the canine flavivirus, Burbelo

 </sup> have recently found a related virus in eight of 36 seropositive horses belonging to owners in the State of New York. There was no supporting evidence of clinical disease among all the animals tested: this does not preclude a pathogenic potential for humans, of course. As with the canine flavivirus described above, any persistence of the newly described virus appears to be much lower than the average 50% seen in humans infected with HCV. Whether or not HCV originates in evolutionary terms from either dogs or humans, studies indicate that HCV most likely originated from animal species, a conclusion that has hitherto been difficult to accept, as HCV does not cause disease in non-human primates, as is the case with hepatitis B and other causes of viral hepatitis.
