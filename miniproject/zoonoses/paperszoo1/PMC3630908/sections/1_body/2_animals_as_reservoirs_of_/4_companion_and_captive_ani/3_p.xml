<p>Wild animals held or bred in captivity have long fascinated human societies. There is an increasing trend, particularly in more affluent economic countries, to keep wild animals as pets. It is estimated that approximately 350â€‰000 wild caught animals are traded around the world each year, adding to the risk of potentially zoonotic infections crossing the species barrier into humans. The finding of a new arenavirus in boa constrictors (

 </sup> has raised interesting questions as to how common such viruses might be among captive wild animals. Intriguingly, sequence data from this arenavirus showed diversity compatible with a pre-existing relationship between host and virus over time. Moreover, sequences were found homologous to those present in arenaviruses causing severe hemorrhagic fever, e.g. Lassa virus, but surprisingly the snake arenavirus also shared glycoprotein sequences with filoviruses. This would suggest there has been segment recombination at some point in time with a filovirus that subsequently evolved to be the Ebola and Marburg viruses of today.
