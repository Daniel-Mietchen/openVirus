<p>Among all species of mammals, members of the family 
 <italic>Muridae</italic> have been the most successful and are found in almost all habitats. This family has species that are the natural hosts of almost all arenaviruses and hantaviruses. As noted above, rodents are highly susceptible to climate and ecological change, resulting in variable population numbers. Among the fastest reproducing mammals, field voles can have over 15 broods per year, each with an average of six pups. This in turn considerably increases the risk of human exposure to any pathogens they may carry as well as stimulating such pathogens to undergo mutational adaptations to the changing ecosystems. Rodents thrive on contaminated food and water, and are excellent swimmers. That rodents constitute an important part of the Earth's biomass is manifested by estimates of rodents consuming at least a fifth of the world's output of grain.
