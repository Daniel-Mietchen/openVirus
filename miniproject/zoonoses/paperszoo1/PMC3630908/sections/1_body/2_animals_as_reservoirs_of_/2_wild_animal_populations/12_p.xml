<p>Several species (
 <italic>Hypsignathus monstrosus</italic>, 
 <italic>Epomops fraqueti</italic>, 
 <italic>Myonycteris torquata</italic>) have been successfully infected with Ebola virus, sustaining the presence of virus in organs and blood for as long as 3 weeks. Asymptomatic Ebola virus infection has been reported in insectivorous bats trapped in Central Africa and recent exposure to fruit bats has been a feature of at least one outbreak.

 <italic>Rousettus aegyptiacus</italic> is one species in which antibodies to both Marburg and Ebola viruses have been found. 
 <italic>Rousettus</italic> species are the exception: despite being fruit-eaters, these bats form roosts deep within caves. Marburg virus sequences have also been found in wild-caught 
 <italic>Rhinolophus eloquens</italic> and 
 <italic>Miniopterus inflatus</italic>.

 </sup> Intriguingly, filovirus elements have been found in some mammalian species, leading to the suggestion that filoviruses have co-evolved with their mammalian hosts over many millennia.
