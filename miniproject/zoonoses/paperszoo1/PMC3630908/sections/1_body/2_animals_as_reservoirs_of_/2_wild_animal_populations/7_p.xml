<p>Switching to a new rodent host can have a profound effect on virus evolution. Adaptation of hantaviruses to new hosts can stimulate the development of new virus phenotypes and hence expansion into new ecological niches. Examples of this include the divergence of Saaremaa virus from Dobrava virus: Nemirov 
 <italic>et al.</italic>

 </sup> have suggested this has been the consequence of Dobrava virus switching from yellow-striped field mouse (
 <italic>Apodemusflavicollis</italic>) to 
 <italic>A. agrarius</italic>, the striped field mouse. The result is a virus with presumed reduced pathogenicity for humans. Other examples of host switching include transmission of Monongahela virus from 
 <italic>Peromyscus maniculatis</italic> to 
 <italic>P. leucopus</italic>, eventually giving rise to New York virus

 <italic>Clethrionomys</italic> species to 
 <italic>Lemmus</italic> species and onto 
 <italic>Microtus</italic> species, giving rise to the Topografov and Khabarovsk virus lineages.
