<p>The preeminent property of the arenaviruses is the establishment of a long-term, chronic infection in their principle murine reservoir. Although rodents are divided into over 30 families worldwide, arenaviruses are found mainly within two rodent families, the 
 <italic>Muridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Cricetidae</italic> (e.g. field voles, lemmings, gerbils). Each arenavirus is not necessarily found distributed throughout the populations of any particular host reservoir, however.
