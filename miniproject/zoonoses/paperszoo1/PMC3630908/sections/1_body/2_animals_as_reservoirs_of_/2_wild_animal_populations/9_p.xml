<p>Bats have long since been known as the principal hosts of lyssaviruses, with distinct phylogenetic differences, for example, between rabies virus strains circulating in bats and terrestrial mammals, such as foxes, raccoons and dogs. The link between genetic variability and spatial epidemiology among the lyssaviruses gives a particularly good insight as to how viruses of wildlife can adapt and emerge into different animal populations. Rabies virus in Europe has switched host many times over the past century, adapting rapidly to new hosts as the virus expands into new species with time. Rabid bats exhibit abnormal behavior, losing their natural fear of humans and thus present a greater risk of transmission to humans. Despite the availability of vaccines and post-exposure prophylaxis, rabies remains a major zoonotic threat.
