<p>The natural reservoirs of the Old World arenaviruses are members of the genera 
 <italic>Mastomys</italic> and 
 <italic>Praomys</italic>. These rodents, included within the family 
 <italic>Muridae</italic>, frequent human dwellings and food stores, and as a result humans become infected through exposure to the rodents' urine. Nearly all arenaviruses found in the Americas are associated with cricetid rodents of open grasslands and forest.
