<p>The Four Corners outbreak instigated intensive research into how fluctuations of rodent populations precipitate outbreaks of human disease. Abnormal weather patterns and increased rainfall results in a dramatic increase in the vegetation providing food for rodents. Thus the environment is able to suddenly sustain a rapidly expanding number of animals. As population sizes explode, the chances of rodents encroaching into peridomestic areas and households also increases, especially when the over abundance of food comes to an end. As a consequence there is a rise in the incidence of human illness as individuals have a much greater chance of coming into contact with excreta from persistently infected animals. The chance of virus switching into other rodent species also becomes a greater possibility as rodent territories expand and overlap.</p>
