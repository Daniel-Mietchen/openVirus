<p>Given the increasing evidence of bats as reservoirs of emerging infections,
 <sup>

 </sup> it is worth considering the evolution and diversity of these mammals. Nearly 1000 species are distributed throughout the world, with the majority in areas close to the equator where food sources are most abundant. Belonging to the mammalian order 
 <italic>Chiroptera</italic>, bats are broadly divisible into the Old World fruit-eating bats (180 species, suborder 
 <italic>Megachiroptera</italic>) and the microbatsâ€”some 800 species grouped into 17 families within the suborder 
 <italic>Microchiroptera</italic>. Insectivorous bats are all microbats. Bats evolved around 50 million years ago, with the fruit bats evolving along a very different path to the insect-eating species. Bats are found in most terrestrial habitats, with species distribution varying widely, some being restricted to a single island, others being found across continents. Among the latter is
