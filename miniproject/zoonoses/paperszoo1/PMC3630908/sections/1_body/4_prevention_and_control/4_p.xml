<p>Difficulties can arise in correctly identifying the cause of a human disease as being zoonotic. For many years, chronic fatigue syndrome was regarded as being viral in origin; a view apparently confirmed when Lombardi

 </sup> reported Xenotropic Murine Leukaemia Virus-related Virus (XMRV) as a possible etiological agent. This virus was found during a study of human prostate tumor cells that contained integrated DNA sequences homologous to retroviruses. These workers went on to claim the presence of XMRV in around 100 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, with subsequent estimates of 3.3% prevalence among blood donors. However, these results were not reproducible

 </sup> and a lack of sequence diversity in presumptive isolates characteristic of retroviruses undergoing transmission from person to person strongly suggested the presence of a contaminant.

 </sup> This link with XMRV has been retracted but serves to illustrate the inherent difficulties in associating disease with a specific etiological agent. Objective interpretation of the data was also hindered by public pressure groups, frustrated by the scientific community's apparent lack of progress in defining the cause of chronic fatigue syndrome.
