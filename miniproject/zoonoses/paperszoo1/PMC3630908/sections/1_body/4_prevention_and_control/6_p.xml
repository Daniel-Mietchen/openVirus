<p>Time is of the essence in the control of emerging disease outbreaks, with delays leading inevitably to an escalation in numbers of cases that can threaten to overwhelm both locally available manpower and capacity.

 </sup> The immediate closure of hospitals was pivotal in limiting the spread of Ebola virus in the original outbreaks in Sudan and Zaire in 1996. The importance of early recognition and the availability of local expertise has been confirmed recently as this year in Uganda, where the discovery of the Bundibugyo strain of Ebola virus in 2000 led to the strengthening of capacity at the Virus Research Institute at Entebbe by the US Centers for Disease Control. Several outbreaks have occurred in Uganda over the past decade. Recent cases of Ebola virus in July and August 2012 have been rapidly diagnosed as a result of this regional investment in infrastructure, thus preventing its spread to Kampala, the Ugandan capital. However, outbreaks may spread even in countries fully equipped to deal with infectious disease outbreaks unless there is the foresight to critically review clinical and epidemiological data quickly and instigate the appropriate control measures: the slow reaction led in 2003 to the spread of SARS virus from Hong Kong.
