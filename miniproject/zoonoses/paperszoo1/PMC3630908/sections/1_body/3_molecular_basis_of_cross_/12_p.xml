<p>Proinflammatory responses also play a pivotal role in determining disease outcome, with viruses manipulating host innate immune responses in order to promote entry and dissemination, and host cells have also evolved countermeasures that give rise to “genetic arms races” with both virus and host competing against the other. Following initial infection of a host cell, many host restriction factors recognize viruses and directly inhibit replication. HIV and SIV are recognized by several host restriction factors in their respective primate hosts. Tripartite motif-containing protein 5α (TRIM5α) is a species-specific host restriction factor that restricts the replication of HIV-1 in Old World monkeys such as rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys. Rhesus TRIM5α restricts HIV-1 infection by interacting with the HIV-1 capsid at an early stage of infection, and is believed to be involved in the innate immune response to retroviral infection. Recent studies investigating experimental cross transmission of SIV from sooty mangabeys have revealed that TRIM5α exerts selective pressure during the initial stages of cross species transmission to rhesus macaques, due to attenuation of infection rather than an outright block to infection.

 </sup> However, rhesus TRIM5α does not restrict SIV isolated from macaques, and human TRIM5α does not restrict HIV-1 infection,

 </sup> Different primate orthologues of TRIM5α have recognition specificities for different retroviral capsids, and infection is only blocked when recognition occurs.

 </sup> Similarly, apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing, enzyme-catalytic, polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) and tetherin are two host proteins that restrict the replication of retroviruses including HIV and SIV, by inducing degradation of the viral proteins and by inhibiting viral release. The retroviral proteins viral infectivity factor and viral protein U counteract APOBEC3G and tetherin, respectively.

 </sup> Recently, a study of four African Green Monkey subspecies, which can be infected with divergent strains of SIV, highlighted that even in nonpathogenic infection there is ongoing evolution of simian APOBEC3G in the absence of ongoing disease. In response to these changes, both natural isolates from long-term infected individuals and viruses from experimentally infected individuals adapt to retarget the host restriction factor.

 </sup> These studies highlight the ongoing conflict between virus and host, and may contribute to the species specificity of closely related retroviruses. Recent studies have shed light on factors that determine the pathogenicity of SIV and HIV-1 in different host species. HIV-1 and SIV infection of humans and rhesus macaques, respectively, are associated with chronic immune activation and production of tumor necrosis factor-α from macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation.

 </sup> In contrast, in chronically infected sooty mangabeys the macrophage response to lipopolysaccharide is inhibited (
