<p>Influenza viruses can emerge in new hosts through adaptation of the surface haemagglutinin structures to receptors on the new host plasma membrane. Influenza A viruses originate in aquatic birds, preferentially binding to sialic acid residues on the surface of avian or human cells. However, avian influenza viruses have a higher affinity for sialic acid linked to the galactose unit via an α2–3 bond, whereas human influenza viruses have a higher affinity for sialic acid linked via an α2–6 configuration.

 </sup> This reflects the pathology of the disease in birds where the main target organ is the gastrointestinal tract whereas sialic acid on the human respiratory tract contains predominantly α2–6 linkages. Influenza virus preferentially replicates in non-ciliated cells of the upper respiratory tract during the early stages of the human illness, whereas avian viruses have a preference for α2–3 sialic acid-coated ciliated cells found only in the lower respiratory tract. Receptor specificity therefore does not necessarily mean that cross-species transmission will give rise to the same pathology as seen in the donor species.
