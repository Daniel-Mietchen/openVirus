<p>There is evidence that Ebola and Marburg viruses have co-evolved with one or more mammalian reservoirs. Taylor and colleagues

 </sup> have suggested that filoviral gene sequences are present in the genome of small mammals as diverse as shrews and South American marsupials. This latter observation indicates that other filoviruses are yet to be discovered in the New World or that South American species harbored ancestral filoviruses that gave rise to present day Ebola and Marburg viruses.
