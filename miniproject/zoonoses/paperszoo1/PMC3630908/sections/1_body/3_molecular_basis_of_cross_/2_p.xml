<p>In 2002, an outbreak of SARS coronavirus occurred in Hong Kong, and spread to individuals in 37 countries.

 </sup> There is wide acceptance that SARS-CoV crossed into the human population of southern China in 2002 from Himalayan civets (
 <italic>Panguma larvata</italic>), as well as from racoon dogs (
 <italic>Nyctereutesprocyonoides</italic>) and Chinese ferret badgers (
 <italic>Melogalemoschata</italic>). However, there is evidence that at least some of these animal infections were the result of cross-transmission in the wet markets of Guangzhou and that wild examples of these species caught in the wild did not show evidence of SARS-CoV infection. More exhaustive studies of wild animal populations found SARS-CoV in Chinese horseshoe bats.

 </sup> However, virus from bats could not be isolated directly in human cells: adaptation through palm civets or other species seems to be required before adaptation to humans can occur.
