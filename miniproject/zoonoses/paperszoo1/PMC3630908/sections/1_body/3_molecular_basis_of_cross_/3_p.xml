<p>In order to infect humans, SARS coronavirus binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, but no bat coronavirus has been shown to use bat or human ACE2 as a viral receptor, raising questions on the mechanism used by coronaviruses to make the species jump from bats to humans.

 </sup> Mutations in the ACE2 receptor-binding domain of the S (spike) protein, particularly substitutions of lysine to asparagine at residue 479 (K479N) and serine to threonine at amino acid 487 (S487T) are both required for adaptation to human cells.

 </sup> Recent evolutionary studies have revealed that bats have coevolved with an as yet unknown factor that drove rapid evolution of the residue of bat ACE2 that interacts with SARS coronavirus, and that ACE2 utilization preceded the emergence of SARS coronavirus capable of infecting humans. This virus could have pre-existed in bats or could have been a newly created virus resulting from recombination between two bat coronavirus.

 </sup> This phenomenon may be widespread in animalâ€“pathogen interactions. For example, studies on the evolution of transferrin receptors in canine species demonstrate that canine parvovirus is a re-emerged, and not a novel pathogen in dogs.

 </sup> These evolutionary studies of cellular receptors provide valuable insight into the factors that govern the evolution of receptor use in cross-species transmission.
