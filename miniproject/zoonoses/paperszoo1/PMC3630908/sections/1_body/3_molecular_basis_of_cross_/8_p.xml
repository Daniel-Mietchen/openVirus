<p>High rates of nucleotide substitution rates exhibited by RNA viral genomes ensure that RNA viruses can adapt rapidly to changes in the levels of host immunity, the availability of suitable vectors and the ecology of any animal reservoir. Infected mammalian cells are deficient in the necessary repair mechanisms to correct errors in template transcription: these errors are preserved if they do not prevent the formation of new infectious virus particles. For example, there have been multiple independent cross-species transmissions of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) from chimpanzees to humans, which have given rise to pandemic (group M) and non-pandemic (groups N and O) clades of HIV-1. A single amino acid change in the 
 <italic>gag</italic>-encoded matrix protein (M30R) is present in these cross-species transmissions. Furthermore, when HIV-1 encoding the 
 <italic>gag</italic> mutation was passaged in chimpanzees, this mutation reverted. This provides evidence for host-specific adaptation during the emergence of HIV-1 and identifies the viral matrix protein as a modulator of viral fitness following transmission to the new human host.
