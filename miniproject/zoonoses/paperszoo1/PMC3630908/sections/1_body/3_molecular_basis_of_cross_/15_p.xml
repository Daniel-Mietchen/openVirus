<p>Measles virus initially infects macrophages and dendritic cells in the airway before crossing the airway epithelium and infecting lymphatic organs. Measles virus uses SLAM/CD150 as a viral receptor, but this is not expressed on all target cells, which led to the notion that another receptor was also used for measles virus infection. Using well-differentiated primary airway epithelial cell sheets, several groups elegantly demonstrated that, following measles replication within lymphoid tissue, virus uses the junction protein nectin-4 to bind to the basolateral (lung) side of polarized epithelia where it replicates and disseminates to na√Øve hosts.
