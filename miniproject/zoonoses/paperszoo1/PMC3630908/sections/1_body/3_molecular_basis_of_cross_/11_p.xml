<p>Genetic recombination is known to pay an important role in generating new coronaviruses, and such events may increase the likelihood of cross-species transmission, as well as determine the severity of disease outcome.

 </sup> This may explain the greater genetic diversity of SARS-CoV isolated from bats compared to humans and civets. There is a marked difference between human SARS-CoV and bat SARS-like coronavirus in the S gene bearing the cellular receptor domain, with only 76%â€“78% amino-acid identity in the major spike (S) protein.
