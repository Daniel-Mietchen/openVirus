<p>Ebola viruses can effectively inhibit host interferon type I responses, mainly due to the inhibitory properties of VP35. Macrophage infection induces proinflammatory cytokines, promotes endothelial leakage and stimulates bystander apoptosis of lymphocytes, although the latter does not abrogate the development of a specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T-cell response. Expression of tissue factor on the surface of macrophages triggers a coagulation cascade, thus promoting hemorrhage.
