<p>Surfactant protein D (SP-D) inhibition 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> was performed as previously described (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Briefly, the minimum concentration of SP-D required to fully inhibit the hemagglutinating activity of the viral suspension was determined as previously described (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).
