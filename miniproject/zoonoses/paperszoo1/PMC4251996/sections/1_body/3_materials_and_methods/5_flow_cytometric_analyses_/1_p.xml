<p>After euthanasia at 6 days p.i., the lungs were flushed of peripheral circulating cells by pushing 5 ml of PBS through the right ventricle of the heart. Lungs were then removed and placed in RPMI medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) on ice. Lung tissues were minced with scalpels into 1- to 2-mm pieces and incubated with 1 U/ml collagenase D (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) in RPMI for 30 min at 37°C. Minced pieces were pushed through 100-µm nylon mesh to create a single-cell suspension. Residual red blood cells were lysed with ACK lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 15 min in the dark. Approximately 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells were stained the following day with anti-CD16 (FcR block), CD4-phycoerythrin (PE), Ly6G-PE, I-A
 <sup>d</sup>–fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), CD11c-FITC, SiglecF-Alexa Fluor 647, CD3-allophycocyanin (APC), CD45-peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP)-Cy5.5, CD11c-PE-Cy7, CD19-PE-Cy7, CD11b-V450, NKp46-V450, CD19-APC-Cy7, and CD8-APC-Cy7 (BD Biosciences, eBio, BioLegend, San Diego, CA) for 20 min at 4°C. Cells were analyzed using a BD FACSCanto II instrument (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR).
