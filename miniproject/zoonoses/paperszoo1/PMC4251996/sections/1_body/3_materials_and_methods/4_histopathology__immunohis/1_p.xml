<p>NBF-fixed mouse lungs were processed for histopathology and immunohistochemistry as previously described (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stains were examined from two mice per virus group at 5 days p.i. Immunohistochemistry for influenza A virus antigen distribution used a goat polyclonal primary anti-influenza A virus (ab20841; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and was completed on the same sets of tissues. All slides were scanned on an Aperio ScanScope XT system (Aperio, Vista, CA), enabling whole-slide analysis. Two pathologists reviewed these slides independently in a blinded fashion and then together in order to confirm consistent adherence to the scoring criteria. In order to compare degrees of lung pathology across the viruses, a lung pathology score of 0 to 3 (where 0 represented no pathology, and 3 represented severe pathology and the greatest degree of tissue involvement; see below) was given to each mouse by each pathologist, resulting in 4 pathology scores per virus. These scores were then averaged to obtain a single pathology score per virus. These scores are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">TableÂ 1</xref>. Lung sections were classified as mild influenza pneumonia (pathology score &lt; 1.5), moderate influenza pneumonia (pathology score of 1.5 to 2.25), or severe influenza pneumonia (pathology score &gt; 2.25).
