<p>Histologic descriptions for these 3 categories follow. Mild influenza pneumonia is defined as a pneumonic pattern characterized by a multifocal mild, predominantly lymphohistiocytic alveolitis and bronchiolitis, with low numbers of perivascular lymphocytes; and occasionally, a few bronchi had intraluminal inflammatory cells and/or necrotic debris. The extent of respiratory parenchyma involvement was up to 15%. Moderate influenza pneumonia is a pneumonic pattern characterized by a multifocal typically lymphohistiocytic and occasionally additionally neutrophilic, mild to moderate, occasionally severe alveolitis and bronchiolitis. Additionally, many mice had bronchitis, sometimes necrotizing. Perivascular lymphocytes were more prominent, and occasionally there was perivascular edema. The extent of respiratory parenchyma involvement was up to 25%. Severe influenza pneumonia is a pneumonic pattern characterized by a multifocal lymphohistiocytic or mixed (lymphohistiocytic and neutrophilic) moderate to severe alveolitis and bronchiolitis with occasional multifocal, marked fibrinous exudates. There was multifocal to nearly diffuse moderate to severe, frequently necrotizing, bronchitis. Perivascular lymphocytes and occasionally marked edema were also present. Up to 50% of respiratory parenchyma was involved.</p>
