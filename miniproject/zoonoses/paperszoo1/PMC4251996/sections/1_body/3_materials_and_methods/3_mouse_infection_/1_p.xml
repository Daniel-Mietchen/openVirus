<p>Groups of 6- to 8-week-old female BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were lightly anesthetized in a chamber with isoflurane supplemented with O
 <sub>2</sub> (1.5 liters/min) prior to intranasal (i.n.) inoculation with virus in a total volume of 50 µl. Viruses were diluted in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) where appropriate. Survival and body weight were monitored for up to 14 days, and mice that lost more than 25% starting body weight met euthanasia criteria and were humanely killed. Mouse 50% lethal doses (MLD
 <sub>50</sub>) were determined by inoculating groups of five mice with serial 10-fold dilutions of virus. MLD
 <sub>50</sub> were calculated by the method of Reed and Muench (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>) and were expressed as the log
 <sub>10</sub> plaque-forming units (PFU) required to give 1 MLD
 <sub>50</sub>. For the experimental animal study comparing the pathogenicity between viruses, groups of 5 mice were inoculated i.n. with 1,000 PFU of each virus. On 3 and 5 days postinoculation (p.i.), lungs from 3 animals were collected for viral titration, and on 5 days p.i., lungs from 2 additional animals were collected for pathology from each virus group. Total lung RNA was isolated from animals on 1, 3, and 6 days p.i. (see below). Viral titers in lung were determined by plaque assay in 10% (wt/vol) lung suspensions prepared by homogenization in sterile 1× L15 medium. Lungs collected for histopathology were inflated with 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) at the time of harvest in order to prevent atelectasis. All experimental animal work was performed in accordance with United States Public Health Service (PHS) Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals in an enhanced animal BSL-3 (ABSL-3) laboratory at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) following approval of animal safety protocols by the NIAID Animal Care and Use Committee.
