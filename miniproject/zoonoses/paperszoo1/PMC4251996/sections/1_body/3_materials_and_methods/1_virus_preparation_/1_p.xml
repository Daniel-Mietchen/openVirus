<p>A set of isogenic chimeric rescued “7:1” viruses was prepared using standard reverse genetics as previously described (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). All rescued viruses constructed for this study contained the same seven gene segments (PB1, PB2, PA, NP, NA, M and NS) from an LPAI virus (influenza A/Green Wing Teal/Ohio/175/1986 [H2N1]) (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). This parental AI virus was chosen because the “internal” genes of this virus were each very similar to AI virus consensus sequences (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In each case (except where indicated), the PB2 gene contained the E627K mutation to facilitate replication in mouse lungs (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The isogenic viruses expressing H1 to H3, H5 to H7, H9 to H11, and H13 to H16 HA subtype genes were successfully rescued. Chimeric viruses possessing H4, H8, and H12 were not able to be rescued. A summary of the HA donor strains is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table S1</xref> in the supplemental material. Full-length HA gene segments (except for H14 and H15) from the LPAI viruses were produced by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and cloned into pHH21 vectors as described elsewhere (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). HA genes of the H14 and H15 subtypes were synthesized (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) prior to cloning into pHH21 vectors. The HA genes from two recent human H7N9 isolates were also produced by RT-PCR from the A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) strain, and this clone was subsequently mutagenized to match the A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) HA sequence (nine coding changes). The chimeric viruses were grown in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells for 1 to 2 passages. The genomic sequence of each rescued virus was then confirmed by sequence analysis of the inoculum. All viruses and infectious samples were handled under enhanced biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory conditions, in accordance with the biosafety guidelines of the NIH Division of Health and Safety following approvals by the NIH Institutional Biosafety Committee. Work with these viruses was evaluated by the NIH/NIAID Division of Intramural Research and the Institutional Biosafety Committee and determined not to constitute dual-use research.
