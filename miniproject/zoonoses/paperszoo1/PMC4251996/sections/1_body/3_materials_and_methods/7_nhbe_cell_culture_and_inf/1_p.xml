<p>Normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cell cultures were differentiated and cultured in 24-well plates as described previously (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). For 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> viral infections, all viruses were grown in NHBE cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, and 12 wells of the NHBE cells were infected for each virus at each time point for viral titers and pathology. Prior to infection the cells were washed two times with 300 µl PBS. Virus (1 MOI) in 100 µl PBS was added to each well, incubated for 1 h at 37°C, and then washed twice with 300 µl PBS, and then 100 µl PBS was added to each well and cells were incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Cells and supernatants were harvested at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after infection.
