<p>Tissues were collected at 1, 3, and 6 days p.i., and total RNA was isolated from whole mouse lungs of three individual mice in each group by homogenization in 10% (wt/vol) Trizol (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), followed by chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation. RNA quality was assessed using a BioAnalyzer instrument (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara CA). For expression microarray analysis, equal masses of RNA isolated from lungs of individual infected animals were compared to a pool of RNA isolated from lungs of mock-infected mice.</p>
