<p>Gene expression profiling experiments were performed using Agilent mouse whole-genome 44K microarrays (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara CA). Fluorescent probes were prepared using the Agilent QuickAmp labeling kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each RNA sample (three biological replicates per virus per time point) was labeled and hybridized to individual arrays. Spot quantitation was performed using Agilent’s Feature Extractor software program, and all data were then entered into a custom-designed database, SlimArray, and then uploaded into the program GeneData Analyst 8.1 (GeneData, San Francisco, CA). Data normalization was performed in GeneData Analyst using central tendency followed by relative normalization using pooled RNA from mock-infected mouse lung as a reference. Expression analysis and statistical analysis, including
