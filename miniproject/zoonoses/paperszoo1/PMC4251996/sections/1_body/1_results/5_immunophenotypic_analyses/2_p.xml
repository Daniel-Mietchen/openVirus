<p>The total population of CD45
 <sup>+</sup> cells was then further phenotyped to assess the distribution of different immune cells present in the lungs at 6 days p.i. Overall, the mock-infected mice had higher proportions of resident macrophages (CD11c
 <sup>+</sup> SiglecF
 <sup>+</sup>) and B cells (CD11c
 <sup>−</sup> CD3
 <sup>−</sup> CD19
 <sup>+</sup>) than the four groups of infected mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>, first row). Remarkably, the H3 and H5 infections did not appear to drastically alter the proportions of immune cells seen during homeostasis, since CD4 T cells (CD11c
 <sup>−</sup> NKp46
 <sup>−</sup> CD3
 <sup>+</sup> CD8
 <sup>−</sup> CD4
 <sup>+</sup>) and CD8 T cells (CD11c
 <sup>−</sup> NKp46
 <sup>−</sup> CD3
 <sup>+</sup> CD4
 <sup>−</sup> CD8
 <sup>+</sup>) were present in H3- and H5-infected mice in the same proportion as in mock-infected mice; NK cells (CD11c
 <sup>−</sup> CD3
 <sup>−</sup> NKp46
 <sup>+</sup>) were more abundant than the other groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>, second and third rows). Mature dendritic cells (DCs) (CD11c
 <sup>+</sup> SiglecF
 <sup>−</sup> I-A
 <sup>d+</sup>) were more abundant following infection with all four viruses; however, DCs were present in significantly higher proportions following H1 and H7 infection than following infection with H3 or H5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>, third row). Infection with the more pathogenic H1 and H7 viruses resulted in a large proportion of neutrophils (CD11c
 <sup>−</sup> SiglecF
 <sup>−</sup> CD11b
 <sup>+</sup> Ly6G/C
 <sup>hi</sup>) and inflammatory macrophages (CD11c
 <sup>−</sup> SiglecF
 <sup>−</sup> CD11b
 <sup>+</sup> Ly6G/C
 <sup>mid</sup>) (
