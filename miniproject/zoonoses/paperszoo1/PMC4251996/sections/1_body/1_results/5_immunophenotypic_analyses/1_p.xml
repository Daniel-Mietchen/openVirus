<p>Because the isogenic viruses expressing the H1, H6, H7, H10, and H15 subtypes induced severe influenza pneumonias with prominent inflammatory infiltrates, while the isogenic viruses expressing the other HA subtypes did not, mice infected by representative pathogenic viruses (H1 and H7) and less pathogenic viruses (H3 and H5) were characterized by flow cytometry to determine the distribution of immune cells present in the lung. Mice were infected with 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU of these representative viruses or 50 µl of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) as a mock control. At 6 days p.i., mice were euthanized and peripheral blood was flushed from the lungs (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5 per group). Single-cell lung suspensions were analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown, lung immune cells (CD45
 <sup>+</sup>) increased following infection compared to homeostatic levels seen in mock-infected lungs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>). All of the viral infections evaluated resulted in an increase in CD45
 <sup>+</sup> cells at 6 days p.i. compared to results for mock-infected animals, although the H5 virus did not reach significance compared to mock infection, as determined by Tukey’s multiple comparisons. Moreover, the number of CD45
 <sup>+</sup> cells in H1-infected mice was significantly higher than those in H3- and H5-infected mice (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0005 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0025, respectively). H7-infected mice also exhibited a higher level of CD45
 <sup>+</sup> lung cells than H5-infected mice (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0007). These results showed that the more pathogenic H1 and H7 viruses led to increased immune cell recruitment and/or proliferation than the less pathogenic H3 or H5 viruses despite similar titers of virus in lung (
