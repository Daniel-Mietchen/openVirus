<p>In addition to analyzing proportions of CD45
 <sup>+</sup> cell populations, the total number of neutrophils and inflammatory macrophages present were analyzed. H1- and H7-infected mice had significantly more inflammatory macrophages than mock-, H3-, and H5-infected animals, and H1-infected animals had significantly more neutrophils than mock-, H3- and H5-infected animals (
