<p>To evaluate whether the observed pathogenicity of avian HA-expressing influenza viruses was restricted to mice, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> infections of representative pathogenic and less pathogenic viruses were performed in differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cell cultures, in triplicate. Differentiated NHBE cells grown at the air-fluid interface 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> demonstrated a pseudostratified epithelium with visible ciliated cells, goblet cells, and basal cells. NHBE cultures were infected with H1, H3, H5, and H7 viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. The H1, H3, and H7 viruses replicated to 5-6 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/ml (
