<p>The PB2 E627K mutation has long been associated with mammalian adaptation (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and pathogenicity of some highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and the reconstructed 1918 pandemic virus in mice (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). As shown, the H1
 <sup>PB2-E627</sup> avian consensus virus was apathogenic in mice, while the isogenic virus containing PB2 K627 was quite pathogenic and replicated to titers 1 to 2 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/g higher (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). To test whether the HA-associated pathogenicity observed with viruses expressing not only H1 but also H6, H7, H7-Shanghai, H7-Anhui, H10, and H15 HAs would also be seen with a set of isogenic viruses encoding PB2 E627, viruses were constructed, and mice were inoculated with 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU intranasally, 5 per group. In all cases, mice lost ≤10% of initial body weight and no lethal infections were observed (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2A</xref> in the supplemental material). Similarly, the parental wild-type LPAI H1N9, H5N1, H6N1, H7N3, and H10N8 viruses (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table S1</xref>) were not pathogenic in mice. Mice lost ≤8% of initial body weight, and no lethal infections were observed (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2B</xref>).
