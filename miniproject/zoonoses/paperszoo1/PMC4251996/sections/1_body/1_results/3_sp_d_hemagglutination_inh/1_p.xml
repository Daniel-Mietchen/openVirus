<p>The mannose-containing influenza A virus surface glycoproteins HA and NA can be recognized by components of innate immunity in the respiratory system, including collectin family lectins like surfactant protein D (SP-D), expressed by alveolar type II epithelial cells and Clara cells. SP-D was previously shown to bind carbohydrate residues on some influenza A viruses, likely leading to aggregation and clearance (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In a previous study, we demonstrated that isogenic influenza viruses expressing the HAs of the 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009 pandemics showed low binding activity for SP-D and this was correlated with viral replication in alveolar epithelial cells (

Since viral replication in the lower respiratory tract was correlated with enhanced pathogenicity in that study, we sought to determine if SP-D inhibition could be correlated with the pathogenicity of the isogenic avian HA-expressing chimeric viruses evaluated here. SP-D hemagglutination inhibition assays were performed with the pathogenic H1, H6, H7, H7-Shanghai, H10, and H15 viruses along with the less pathogenic H3 and H5 viruses. For the avian viruses evaluated (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>), SP-D could not inhibit hemagglutination at the highest SP-D concentrations tested (4 to 8 µg), in marked contrast to a control seasonal H1N1 virus, which was inhibited with 0.0625 µg (
