<p>Histopathologic changes to the respiratory system induced following mouse infection with the isogenic H1 to H16 viruses were evaluated using a lung pathology scoring system of 0 to 3 (where 0 represented no pathology, and 3 represented severe pathology and the greatest degree of tissue involvement; the average score was derived from two replicate mice per group evaluated independently by two pathologists), 2 per time point for each virus. A score of &lt;1.5 reflected mild influenza pneumonia, a pathology score of 1.5 to 2.25 reflected moderate influenza pneumonia, and pathology scores of &gt;2.25 reflected severe influenza pneumonia. The parental LPAI virus H1N1 virus (H1
 <sup>PB2-627E</sup>) induced no pathological changes (pathology score of 0). In contrast to the case with titers in lung, there was a good correlation of high pathology score and low MLD
 <sub>50</sub> with the pathogenic viruses, since infections with the H1, H6, H7, H10, and H15 viruses each resulted in severe pneumonias (pathology scores of 2.5 to 3). The remaining viruses had pathology scores ranging from 0.5 to 2, reflecting mild influenza pneumonia (H11, H14, and H16) or moderate influenza pneumonia (H2, H3, H5, H9, and H13) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>: H1, H7, H7-Anhui, H7-Shanghai, H6, and H10 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A to F</xref>, respectively). In these animals, pathological changes involved up to 50% of the lung parenchyma with multifocal, moderate to severe, necrotizing bronchitis and bronchiolitis along with moderate to severe alveolitis with multifocal pulmonary edema and fibrinous exudates. The alveolar inflammatory infiltrates were of mixed cellularity, and airspace neutrophils and macrophages were commonly observed (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2G</xref>). Pathological changes in these animals involved &lt;25% of the lung parenchyma and demonstrated multifocal, predominantly lymphohistiocytic, mild to moderate alveolitis and bronchiolitis and bronchitis. The parental H1N1 LPAI virus (H1
 <sup>PB2-E627</sup>) induced no pathological changes (
