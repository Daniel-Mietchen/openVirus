<p>To characterize the host response to infection, we performed expression microarray analyses with a subset of viruses, including the parental LPAI virus H1
 <sup>PB2-627E</sup>, the pathogenic viruses H1, H6, H7, and H10, and the mildly pathogenic H3 and H5 viruses. Groups of mice, 5 at each time point, were infected with 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU of each virus, and lungs were collected at 1, 3, and 6 days p.i. Total RNA was isolated from 3 mice per group, and mRNA expression microarray analysis was performed. All viral infections resulted in activation of type I interferon (IFN) responses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>) with similar expression levels of many type I IFN-related genes, such as those encoding the type I IFN receptor (
 <italic>Ifnar1</italic> and 
 <italic>Ifnar2</italic>), the associated kinase Jak1, and the transcription factor Irf3 and several interferon-induced genes (ISGs), including 
 <italic>Ifi30</italic>, 
 <italic>Ifitm2</italic>, and 
 <italic>Ifitm3</italic> (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig. S3</xref> in the supplemental material). The pathogenic H1, H6, H7, and H10 viral infections resulted in higher expression levels for many other double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and type I IFN response genes, such as 
 <italic>Ifih1</italic>, 
 <italic>Ddx58</italic>, 
 <italic>Irf7</italic>, and 
 <italic>Mx1</italic> (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig. S3</xref>). All viral infections resulted in the increased expression of cytokine and chemokine genes compared to results with lungs of mock-infected animals. The H1, H6, H7, and H10 viral infections were also associated with significantly more robust induction of genes related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) responses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Examination of genes associated with activation of specific immune cells showed that infection with H1, H6, H7 or H10 viruses resulted in a more potent activation of macrophages and neutrophils compared to that in H1
 <sup>PB2-627E</sup>, H3, or H5 viral infections (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig. S4</xref>), consistent with flow cytometric analyses.
