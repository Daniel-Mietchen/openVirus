<p>While infection with all viruses tested resulted in the activation of antiviral and immune responses, the H1, H6, H7, and H10 viral infections also all caused higher expression of many host response genes. To identify the population of genes that showed significantly higher expression in these more virulent infections, analysis of normal variance (ANOVA) was performed. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>, the H1, H6, H7, and H10 viruses resulted in significantly higher expression of many inflammatory response genes, including 
 <italic>Il1b</italic> and 
 <italic>Il12b</italic>, than the H1
 <sup>PB2-627E</sup>, H3, and H5 viruses. Moreover, many of the most highly expressed genes in the H1, H6, H7, and H10 viral infections were associated with activation of monocytes and neutrophils, such as 
 <italic>Cxcl9</italic>, 
 <italic>Cxcl10</italic>, 
 <italic>Cxcl11</italic>, 
 <italic>Ccl2</italic>, 
 <italic>Ccl3</italic>, 
 <italic>Ccl4</italic>, and 
 <italic>Ccl7</italic> (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig. S4</xref> in the supplemental material), again consistent with the flow cytometric analysis showing increased levels of these activated immune cells associated with the pathogenic viruses. ANOVA also revealed that the H1, H6, H7, and H10 viral infections induced more significant cell death-related gene expression responses, including 
 <italic>Casp1</italic>, 
 <italic>Daxx</italic>, 
 <italic>Ripk3</italic>, and 
 <italic>Tnf</italic>, than the H1
 <sup>PB2-627E</sup>, H3, and H5 infections (
