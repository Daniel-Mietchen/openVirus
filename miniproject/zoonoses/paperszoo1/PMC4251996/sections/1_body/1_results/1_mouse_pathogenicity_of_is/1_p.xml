<p>In a previous study, an H1N1 LPAI virus (termed here H1
 <sup>PB2-E627</sup>) was evaluated in a comparative pathogenicity study along with the 1918 influenza virus and chimeric 7:1 1918:AI viruses in mice in which each of the eight chimeric viruses contained seven 1918 gene segments and one of the LPAI virus gene segments. Infection with the H1
 <sup>PB2-E627</sup> virus did not cause weight loss or induce pathological changes (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In the current study, the PB2 gene of this H1N1 LPAI virus was altered with an E627K mutation to facilitate replication in mammalian cells, and this virus, here termed H1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>), was evaluated for pathogenicity in mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The H1 virus was then compared with a set of chimeric viruses differing only in the HA gene (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table S1</xref> in the supplemental material for sources of HA genes). Thus, chimeric AI viruses expressing representative HAs of different HA subtypes were constructed on a viral genetic background identical to that of the H1 virus (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref>). In addition, chimeric AI viruses expressing the H7 HA from two recent human-origin H7N9 virus isolates were also constructed. With the exception of these human H7N9 isolates, none of the avian-origin IAV viruses contained HA receptor binding domain mutations associated with mammalian adaptation. Isogenic viruses expressing the H4, H8, and H12 HA subtypes could not be recovered (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table S1</xref>). The rescued chimeric “HxN1” viruses (expressing HA subtypes H1 to H3, H5 to H7, H9 to H11, and H13 to H16), each with an identical N1 subtype NA gene and identical viral genetic background in the other seven genomic segments, all grew comparably in MDCK cells (average peak titer of 7 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). Throughout this report, these otherwise isogenic viruses will be referred to by the HA subtype they express (
