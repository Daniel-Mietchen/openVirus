<p>Titers of virus in lung were determined at 3 and 5 days postinfection (p.i.) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>) (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 for each time point in each group). All the viruses replicated in mouse lung, with titers ranging from 3.0 to 7.5 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/g lung tissue. Chimeric viruses expressing the HA subtypes (H1, H6, H7, H10, and H15) resulting in pathogenic infections generally replicated to higher titers in lung than the viruses expressing the remaining HA subtypes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>), but there was no clear relationship between lung titers at 3 and 5 days p.i. and disease severity. For example, at 3 days p.i., the H3 and H5 viruses replicated to titers very similar to those for the pathogenic H1, H6, H7, and H10 viruses, while viral titers for the pathogenic H15 virus were approximately 2 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/g lower, comparable to titers observed with the nonpathogenic H11, H13, and H16 viruses (
