<p>Viral lung titers and mouse pathogenicity of the H1 virus construct were compared to those of the parental H1N1
 <sup>PB2-E627</sup> LPAI virus. As expected (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), using an intranasal dose of 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU in 50 µl, the H1
 <sup>PB2-E627</sup> virus induced no pathological changes (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU of the H1 virus with the PB2 E627K change was markedly pathogenic in mice, causing rapid weight loss and 100% mortality by day 8 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5 per group) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). This H1 virus was subsequently determined to have a mouse 50% lethal dose (MLD
 <sub>50</sub>) of 1.8 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>) (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5 per dose), comparable to the MLD
 <sub>50</sub> of the fully reconstructed 1918 virus (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In order to exclude that this pathogenic phenotype reflected a strain-specific phenomenon with the HA gene of the H1 virus, a second chimeric H1 virus, expressing the HA from another randomly selected LPAI virus H1 strain (H1b) (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table S1</xref> in the supplemental material), was rescued. The two H1 HA proteins contained 12 coding differences (4; also data not shown). The second H1 virus (H1b) was equally pathogenic in mice, with an MLD
 <sub>50</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>) comparable to those of the H1 and 1918 viruses (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).
