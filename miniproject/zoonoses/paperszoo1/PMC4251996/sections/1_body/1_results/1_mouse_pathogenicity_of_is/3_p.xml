<p>To examine mouse pathogenicity in isogenic viruses expressing LPAI viral HA subtypes other than H1, animals were intranasally inoculated with 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU in 50 µl of otherwise isogenic viruses containing seven gene segments from the above H1 virus and HA genes derived from the different LPAI donor viruses (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref> in the supplemental material; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 5 per group). A subset of these isogenic viruses induced rapid weight loss and fatal infections: both of the H1 viruses (H1 and H1b), along with the H6, H7, and H10 viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Viruses expressing the other HA subtypes (H2, H3, H5, H9, H11, H13, H14, H15, and H16) caused mild weight loss (&lt;10% maximum weight loss) and no fatalities at a dose of 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU. A comparative MLD
 <sub>50</sub> study was next performed, which showed that the H6, H7, and H10 viruses had MLD
 <sub>50</sub> of 2.5, 2.5, and 1.6 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>) (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5 per dose for each virus). Infection with the H15 virus also led to fatal infections (MLD
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.6 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU). The remaining viruses (H2, H3, H5, H9, H11, H13, H14, and H16) had an undetermined MLD
 <sub>50</sub> (&gt;4 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU, the highest dose tested).
