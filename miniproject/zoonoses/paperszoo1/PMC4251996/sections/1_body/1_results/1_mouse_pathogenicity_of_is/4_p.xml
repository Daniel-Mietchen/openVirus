<p>Because the H7 virus (expressing a North American H7 LPAI viral HA) was pathogenic in mice, we evaluated two additional isogenic chimeric viruses expressing H7 genes derived from two 2013 Chinese H7N9 human isolates, A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) and A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9), on the same genetic background as the other viruses (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table S1</xref> in the supplemental material). Both of these chimeric H7 viruses were pathogenic in mice (MLD

 <sub>10</sub> PFU, respectively) (
