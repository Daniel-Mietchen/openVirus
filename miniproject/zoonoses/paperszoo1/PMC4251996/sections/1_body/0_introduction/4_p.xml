<p>In a recent study, a set of eight chimeric “7:1” 1918 viruses was constructed by replacing one gene segment at a time from a contemporary “prototypic” LPAI H1N1 virus (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The LPAI virus induced neither weight loss nor pathogenic changes, while the fully reconstructed 1918 virus induced a lethal infection. However, the 1918 chimeric virus encoding avian PB2 was attenuated in mice, and this attenuation was corrected by a single coding mutation, E627K (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). This mutation previously was shown to be associated with host restriction (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and with enhanced replication in mice (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In light of the fact that the 1918 virus H1 is known to be a major virulence factor, the most unexpected observation was that the chimeric 1918 virus encoding the avian H1 HA was not attenuated compared to the fully reconstructed 1918 virus in mice but rather induced a severe respiratory pathology indistinguishable from that of the parental 1918 virus (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).
