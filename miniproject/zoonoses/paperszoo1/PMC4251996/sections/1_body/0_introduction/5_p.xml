<p>These observations led to the hypothesis that the mammalian virulence associated with the 1918 H1 HA was not unique to the pandemic HA but was apparently shared with a contemporary LPAI virus H1 HA. Using the LPAI H1N1 PB2
 <sup>E627K</sup> virus, containing a mutation which facilitates viral replication in mammalian cells (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), we compared pathogenicity and virulence properties of this virus in mice to those of a set of chimeric viruses expressing 13 different contemporary LPAI viral HA subtypes (H1 to -3, H5 to -7, H9 to -11, and H13 to -16) and included H7 genes from two recent human H7N9 zoonotic infection isolates (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The chimeric AI viruses were isogenic for seven of their eight gene segments, differing only in the HA gene. These studies showed that chimeric AI viruses containing the H1, H6, H7, H10, and H15 HA subtypes were pathogenic in mice and cytopathic in human cells, providing evidence that zoonotic infections with avian influenza viruses expressing one of these five HA subtypes have the potential to cause more severe disease in mammals and possibly humans.
