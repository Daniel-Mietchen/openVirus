<p>Influenza A viruses continue to pose major challenges to public health, causing annual (seasonal) influenza epidemics in humans, emerging epizootics in domestic animals, zoonotic outbreaks at the human-animal interfaces, and the occasional and unpredictable emergence of human pandemic viruses with antigenically novel hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Although such viruses are able to infect many warm-blooded avian and mammalian species, the major reservoir is thought to be wild, free-ranging waterfowl and shorebirds (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Eighteen distinct HA subtypes distinguished by high genetic and antigenic variability have been identified, 16 of which (subtypes H1 to H16) are consistently found in multiple avian host species (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), but only 4 of these 16 have been incorporated within stably mammal-adapted influenza virus lineagesâ€”H1, H2, and H3 in humans, H1 and H3 in swine, H7 and H3 in equines, and H3 in canines (
