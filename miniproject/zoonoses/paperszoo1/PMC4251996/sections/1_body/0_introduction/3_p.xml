<p>The 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic resulted in approximately 50 million deaths worldwide (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and while its origin is not fully elucidated, the virus is avian-like in both its coding sequences (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and genome content (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The reconstructed 1918 virus has been used in a number of studies of host adaptation and pathogenicity (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), and chimeric viruses expressing 1918 HA on contemporary human seasonal influenza virus genomic backgrounds have shown conclusively that the 1918 HA genomic segment encodes a key virulence factor for mammals (

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), the fully reconstructed 1918 virus causes extensive viral pneumonia in mice, ferrets, and macaques, including a characteristic alveolitis with a prominent airspace neutrophil and macrophage infiltrate (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Chimeric viruses expressing 1918 HA on a background of seven other gene segments derived from a contemporary human seasonal H1N1 virus also induced a similar respiratory tract pathology, with prominent alveolar neutrophils and macrophages (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), indicating that the pathogenicity of the 1918 virus is substantially derived from its H1 HA.
