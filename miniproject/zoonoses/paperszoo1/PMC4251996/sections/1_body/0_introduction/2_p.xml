<p>The genetic pool of avian-origin influenza A (AI) viruses, containing 16 HA and 9 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes, is thus a major genomic source for novel viruses that can potentially adapt to domestic mammals and humans during stable host switch events (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Novel host-switched viruses can adapt 
 <italic>in toto</italic> or by genomic segment reassortment with other human- or mammal-adapted influenza A viruses (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Since the appearance of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses causing infections in humans and more recently infections with low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) H7N9 and H10N8 viruses in humans, there has been heightened concern that AI viruses capable of causing human infections may lead to epidemics or pandemics (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). HPAI virus subtypes H5N1, H7N3, and H7N7 and LPAI viruses, including H9N2, H7N9, H6N1, H10N8, H7N2, and H7N3, have all caused human infections with variable morbidity and mortality (

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The mechanisms by which these avian viruses can stably adapt to mammals and to humans in particular remain poorly understood, as are the underlying determinants of severe pathogenicity in humans (
