<p>Influenza A virus HA subtypes did not evolve from a common ancestor in a single radiation and also demonstrate higher-order clustering into two larger, deeply divergent clades (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Interestingly, the avian HA subtypes associated with increased pathogenicity are found in both higher-order clades 1 and 2 but are clustered in two smaller subclades, a clade 1 subclade containing H1 and H6 and a clade 2 subclade containing the H7, H10, and H15 HAs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.Â 6</xref>). The observed clustering of these HA subtypes suggests the possibility that these five HA subtypes might share some sequence and/or structural feature(s) contributing to the observed mammalian virulence. In the future, it would be interesting to examine the role of HA/NA interactions in the context of pathogenicity with other avian influenza NA subtypes, since all the chimeric viruses evaluated here expressed the identical N1 subtype NA.
