<p>The 16 HA subtypes found in wild aquatic birds are not uniformly distributed. HA subtypes H1, H6, H7, H10, and H15 collectively account for ~40% of LPAI viruses in large ecological surveys (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), with H6 being most commonly observed, H1, H7, and H10 subtypes being less common, and H15 being rare. It is therefore likely that a sizeable fraction of human exposure to LPAI viruses involves strains expressing one of these five HA subtypes. In the murine infections evaluated here, the isogenic chimeric LPAI viruses (with the single PB2 E627K mutation to facilitate replication) that expressed one of these five HA subtypes resulted in a pathological phenotype very similar to or indistinguishable from that of the 1918 pandemic virus, supporting and expanding the hypothesis that 1918-like LPAI viruses circulate in wild birds (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). However, despite countless exposures at the human-animal interface, pandemic influenza viruses emerge very infrequently.
