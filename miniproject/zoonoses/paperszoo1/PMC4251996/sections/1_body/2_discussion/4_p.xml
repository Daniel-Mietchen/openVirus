<p>Intriguingly, we also observed marked differences in the cytopathicity of these chimeric avian viruses in differentiated primary NHBE cells, demonstrating that expression of different HAs can directly affect cell death and/or autophagy responses in primary human lung epithelial cells. This suggests that increased activation of cell death gene expression responses observed in H1-, H6-, H7-, and H10-infected mouse lungs likely results from both directly cytopathic viral infection and immune cell killing via macrophages and neutrophils. Additional studies are under way to determine the mechanisms underlying these observations. The HA subtypes associated with enhanced pathogenicity are genetically divergent and include both group 1 and group 2 subtypes, but it is possible that there are shared structural or physiological features that might underlie the enhanced pathogenesis observed. Some possibilities include differential glycosylation patterns, differences in pH optima of fusion, or differential cell entry. Moreover, the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> results indicate that the enhanced pathogenicity of H1, H6, H7, and H10 viruses is not limited to experimental mouse infections, and these HA subtypes could contribute to enhanced pathogenicity observed in humans in some avian influenza virus zoonotic infections. Taken together, these findings suggest that several independent factors are critical for development of a pathogenic phenotype when an LPAI virus adapts to a mammalian hostâ€”polymerase adaptations, inhibition of antiviral responses to enhance viral replication, and an HA from one of the above subtypes to exert an independent virulence property that triggers cell death and robust inflammatory responses.
