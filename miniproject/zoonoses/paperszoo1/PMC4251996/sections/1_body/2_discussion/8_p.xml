<p>This suggests that the pathway for an avian influenza A virus to become a pandemic strain is an extremely complex, multifactorial process not easily achieved. Ecological and biological constraints still poorly understood likely limit emergence of pandemic influenza viruses, including adaptations to intermediate hosts as well as the acquisition of human adaptations that facilitate replication and ultimately transmissibility. Despite this complexity, severe influenza pandemics like that of 1918 have occurred in the past and consequently may occur in the future. The data presented here support the hypothesis that zoonotic AI virus infections caused by AI viruses expressing the H1, H6, H7, H10, or H15 subtype might be associated with enhanced morbidity in humans. Enhanced surveillance is important to characterize novel viruses at the animal-human interface, but ultimately, a broadly reactive “universal” influenza vaccine may offer the best protection against future pandemics (
