<p>Influenza pandemics have emerged at least 15 times in the last 500Â years (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), and increasing surveillance in recent years has facilitated identification of a number of influenza A virus zoonotic outbreaks of avian origin (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) or swine origin (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The mechanisms of influenza A virus stable host switch are not well elucidated (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), but for a sustained outbreak to occur, zoonotically derived viruses must be able to infect host cells in the new species, replicate, and be transmitted between humans (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). It is likely that viral properties including replication, pathogenicity, and transmissibility are polygenic traits driven by mutational pressures that are independent and possibly competing (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). These factors may have contributed to the variable morbidity and mortality impact of past influenza pandemics and current zoonoses. Understanding the molecular basis of host switch events is an important public health goal to prevent or mitigate an outbreak prior to the emergence of a full-blown pandemic. However, the basis for variable pathogenicity of pandemic and zoonotically derived influenza A virus strains is not well understood.
