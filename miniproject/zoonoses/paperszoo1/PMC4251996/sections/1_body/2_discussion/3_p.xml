<p>The otherwise isogenic LPAI virus chimeras expressing the H1, H6, H7, H10, and H15 HA subtypes share common pathogenic properties with the reconstructed 1918 human pandemic influenza virus in mice. In addition to low MLD
 <sub>50</sub> values (&lt;10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU), they induced severe viral pneumonia with a marked inflammatory infiltrate, including increased numbers of macrophages and neutrophils, as seen previously with 1918 influenza virus infections (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), and confirmed in this study by flow cytometric analysis, and changes in whole lung gene expression patterns associated with enhanced inflammatory, ROS, and cell death responses. The analysis of the host gene expression response to infection showed several key features associated with the more pathogenic H1, H6, H7, and H10 infections. In general, gene expression responses to all viruses evaluated showed activation of dsRNA and type I IFN and immune responses; however, these antiviral responses had little impact on reducing viral replication. Previous studies have shown that the 1918 influenza virus, which expresses an NS1 protein very close to the avian influenza virus consensus sequence (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), is a potent inhibitor of dsRNA and type I IFN responses in infected human cells or nonhuman primates (

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Similar to findings in studies with the 1918 virus, the more pathogenic H1, H6, H7, and H10 viral infections were associated with significantly higher expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokine mRNAs (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3 figS4">Fig. S3 and S4</xref> in the supplemental material). Also consistent with the inflammatory response to the 1918 virus, higher gene expression associated with recruitment and activation of macrophages and neutrophils was also observed with the avian H1, H6, H7, and H10 viruses. Neutrophils and macrophages were also demonstrated to be present at statistically higher levels in these infections by flow cytometry and corroborated by histopathology. Previous studies have shown that activation of these immune cell types, particularly neutrophils, is an important feature of 1918 influenza viral infections in animal models (

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Similarly, neutrophilic alveolitis was also commonly observed in 1918 human autopsy samples (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Thus, a key driving force of primary severe lung pathology resulting from certain influenza virus infections, such as infection with the 1918 virus, are likely related to activation of macrophages and neutrophils with concomitant activation of ROS and cell death responses. Supportive of this view, we reported that mice infected with a lethal dose of the 1918 influenza virus and treated with the catalytic catalase/superoxide dismutase mimetic organometallic drug EUK-207 had greatly increased survival and reduced severity of lung pathology, particularly ROS damage of alveolar epithelial cells (
