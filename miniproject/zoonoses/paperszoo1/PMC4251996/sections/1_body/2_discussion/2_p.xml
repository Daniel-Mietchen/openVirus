<p>The 1918 “Spanish” H1N1 influenza pandemic was the worst pandemic in recorded history, with a global mortality of approximately 50 million people (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) associated with unusual case fatality in young adults (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The fully reconstructed 1918 pandemic virus is pathogenic without adaptation in mice, ferrets, and macaques and is associated with markedly increased proinflammatory, cell death, and ROS responses in the lungs of these experimental animals and suppression of type I IFN responses in bronchial epithelial cells (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). While the 1918 HA has been identified as a key virulence factor in mammalian models (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), an H1 subtype HA from an LPAI virus did not attenuate a 7:1 1918 chimeric virus (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In the current study, an LPAI H1N1 virus with a single coding change in the polymerase PB2 (E627K) to facilitate viral replication in mouse lung was shown to be equally as pathogenic as the fully reconstructed 1918 virus in mice. Further, inherent mammalian virulence associated with the avian influenza virus H1 was also observed in isogenic chimeric viruses expressing H6, H7, H10, and H15 HAs. These data support the hypothesis that a key virulence feature of the 1918 virus is not unique to the HA in the pandemic virus but is shared with circulating LPAI virus H1 HAs and LPAI virus HAs of H6, H7, H10, and H15 subtypes as well. The variable pathogenicity observed with these chimeric avian viruses did not correlate with SP-D hemagglutination inhibition, suggesting other mechanisms for the observed pathogenicity. The chimeric viruses evaluated in this study would be unlikely to infect wild mice, since they express Mx1 (
