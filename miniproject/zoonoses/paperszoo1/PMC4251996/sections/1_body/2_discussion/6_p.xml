<p>Recent zoonotic outbreaks associated with LPAI viral infections of H7N9, H10N8, and H6N1 have been associated in many cases with substantial morbidity and mortality. In the last year, 2013-2014, H7N9 infections have been documented in 375 people as of 8 April 2014 (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), with 115 deaths (30.6% case fatality rate). The H7N9 viruses are LPAI viruses without an HA polybasic cleavage site, but significantly, the majority of human isolates have contained the PB2 E627K mutation (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) (35/48; 73% of sequences in GenBank), and several cases without E627K have the mammal-associated PB2 mutation D701N (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). During the 2003 H7N7 outbreak in the Netherlands, sequence analysis of the virus isolated from the single human fatality also contained a PB2 E627K mutation (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). A fatal infection with an H10N8 LPAI virus was also recently reported (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), and the isolate was also shown to encode a PB2 E627K mutation (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Prior human or mammalian infections with H10 LPAI viruses have been rare, but a large and highly fatal H10N4 outbreak occurred in mink farms in Sweden in 1984 (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Recently, viral sequences from that outbreak were shown to contain a PB2 D701N mutation (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). A documented H6N1 human infection was also recently reported (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), raising concern about zoonotic potential of H6 LPAI viruses (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Interestingly, LPAI H6 strains have been associated with mouse and ferret pathogenicity (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), as have LPAI H1N1 strains (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Given the rapid accumulation of the PB2 E627K mutation during mouse infections with the 1918
 <sup>AI-PB2</sup> virus (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) or H5N1 viruses (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), it would be of interest to examine sequences of the viral polymerase genes during the course of infection from lung-derived isolates in the above mouse LPAI H1 and H6 studies.
