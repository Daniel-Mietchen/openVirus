  <p>Evaluation of mouse pathogenicity by weight loss. (A) Evaluation of mouse pathogenicity by weight loss for a subset of chimeric avian viruses with an E627 in PB2. Viruses were constructed on the H1 background (as in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref>) but with a PB2 E627, and different hemagglutinin subtypes, including the H1, H6, H7, H10, H15, H7-Shanghai, and H7-Anhui hemagglutinins. (B) Evaluation of mouse pathogenicity by weight loss for a subset of wild-type avian viruses that were the parental donor strains of the H1, H5, H6, H7, and H10 virus hemagglutinins (see
