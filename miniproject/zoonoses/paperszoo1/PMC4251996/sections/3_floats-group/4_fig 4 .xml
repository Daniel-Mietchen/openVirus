  <p>Analysis of gene expression responses in mouse lung tissue. Expression microarray analysis was performed with total RNA isolated from lungs of three mice per group collected at days 1, 3, and 6 postinfection with H1, H1
   <sup>PB2-627E</sup>, H3, H5, H6, H7, and H10 viruses compared to a pool of RNA isolated from uninfected mouse lung tissue. (A) Immune response genes, including type I IFN, cytokines, chemokines, and cognate receptors, and ROS and NO responses. (B) Inflammatory response-related genes identified by ANOVA (using adjusted Bonferroni error correction with 
   <italic>P</italic> = 0.01) as having statistically significant differential expression in the H1, H6, H7, and H10 compared to H3 and H5 viral infections at days 3 and 6 postinfection. (C) Cell death response-related genes identified by ANOVA (using adjusted Bonferroni error correction with 
   <italic>P</italic> = 0.01) as having statistically significant differential expression in the H1, H6, H7, and H10 compared to H3 and H5 viral infections at day 6 postinfection. Genes shown in red were upregulated, genes shown in blue downregulated, and genes in black indicate no change in expression in infected relative to uninfected animals.
