  <p>Infection of differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) primary cell cultures. (A) Replication kinetics of chimeric avian influenza H1, H3, H5, H6, and H7 viruses in NHBE cell culture. Lung titers (PFU/ml) determined on days 1 to 4 postinfection (DPI), following infection with an MOI of 1 at time zero. (B) Histopathology of NHBE cell cultures at 72 h after infection with H1, H3, H5, or H7 viruses at an MOI of 1; original magnification, ×400. The cultures infected with the H1 and H7 viruses show only remnant basal cells, while the H3 and H5 infections show maintenance of a pseudostratified epithelium but with fewer ciliated cells, pyknotic nuclei, increased cytoplasmic vacuolization, and apparent separation of overlying cells from the basal cell layer.</p>
