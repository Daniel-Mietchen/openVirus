  <p>Representative histopathologic changes observed in mouse lung following infection with representative chimeric avian influenza A viruses investigated in this study. Photomicrographs of hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained sections of mouse lung at 5 days p.i. following intranasal inoculation with 10
   <sup>3</sup> PFU of chimeric viruses; bars = 200 µm. (A) Marked influenza virus pneumonia following infection with the H1 virus, showing alveolitis with prominent airspace neutrophils and macrophages (inset). (B to F) Histopathologic changes similar to those seen following H1 infection with H7, H7-Shanghai, H7-Anhui, H6, and H10 viruses, respectively. (G) Moderate influenza virus pneumonia pattern following infection with the H5 virus. (H) Lung section showing no pathological changes following infection with the H1
   <sup>PB2-E627</sup> virus; inset shows normal alveoli without inflammatory infiltrates.
