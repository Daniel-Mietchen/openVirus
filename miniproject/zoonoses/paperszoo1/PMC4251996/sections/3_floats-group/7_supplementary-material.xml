  <p>Diagrammatic representation of the construction of the chimeric avian influenza viruses produced for this study. An avian H1N1 virus, chosen as a “prototypic” avian influenza A virus because each of its genes encodes proteins close to the avian consensus sequence (
   <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), termed here H1
   <sup>PB2-E627</sup>, had an E627K mutation placed in the PB2 gene (white box in the first gene segment) to create the H1 virus. Subsequent chimeric viruses were created by substituting the H1 hemagglutinin gene segment for other subtypes (H1–H16). Note the other 7 gene segments are identical to the H1 virus. Download
