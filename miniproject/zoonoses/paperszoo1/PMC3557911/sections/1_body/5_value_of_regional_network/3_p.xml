 <italic>2. Harnessing network power</italic>. The regional networks described here and throughout this issue of 
 <italic>Emerging Health Threats</italic> have gained interest among some scholars for their contributions to global health security, particularly for their role in implementing the International Health Regulations (2005) (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0032">32</xref>). However, other scholars have critiqued the health security motive as driven by trade interests and fears of bio-terrorism. Critics argue that vertical disease surveillance networks sometimes unfairly challenge low-income countries to upgrade their surveillance capacity for the benefit of more developed countries; and that efforts to harmonize definitions, detection and reporting benefit nations with more advanced surveillance systems and developed economies more than they benefit less advantaged nations (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">34</xref>). If many low and middle-income countries lack access to the tools and knowledge to participate effectively, the networks are rendered less significant to the global response and less relevant to their own needs. Indeed, in coining the term “network power,” Grewal (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0035">35</xref>) suggested that globalization implicitly benefits powerful nations and groups through the establishment of dominant “standards” adopted through networks.
