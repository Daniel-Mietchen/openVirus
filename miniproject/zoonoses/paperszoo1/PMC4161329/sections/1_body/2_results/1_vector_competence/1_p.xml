<p>Eight experimental studies were identified that fit the inclusion criteria for this analysis 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003163-Turell1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003163-Turell2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0003163-Turell7" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Data for 26 mosquito species were adjusted utilizing the viremic dose-dependent relationship of dissemination and transmission rates based on 17 species of mosquitoes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003163.s001">Figure S1</xref>, A and B). Standardized dissemination and transmission values were multiplied together to calculate vector competence (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003163-t001">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003163.s002">S1</xref>). The most competent transmission vectors of RVFV when exposed to 10
 <sup>7.5</sup> PFU/ml of viremia are estimated to be 
 <italic>Coquillettidia perturbans</italic> (Walker) (0.38), 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus japonicus</italic> (Theobald) (0.37), 
 <italic>Cx. tarsalis</italic> (0.33), and 
 <italic>Ae. excrucians</italic> (0.28). Some mosquito species were estimated to be incompetent for RVFV, such as 
 <italic>An. crucians</italic> (&lt;0.01), 
 <italic>Ae. infirmatus</italic> (&lt;0.01), and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> (Say) (&lt;0.01) (
