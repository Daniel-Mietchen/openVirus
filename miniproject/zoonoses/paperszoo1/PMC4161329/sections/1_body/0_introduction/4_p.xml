<p>To assess the role of mosquitoes and hosts in the transmission of a virus, it is important to quantify the ability for a mosquito species to transmit a pathogen (vector competence), the infectiousness of vertebrate host species (host competence), and contact rates between mosquitoes and vertebrate hosts. In the WNV system, Kilpatrick et al. 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003163-Kilpatrick1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> combined data on vector competence, abundance, and mosquito feeding patterns to identify the species of mosquitoes responsible for bridge transmission of WNV to humans. Several studies have then implicated important avian hosts disproportionately responsible for WNV amplification based on mosquito host feeding patterns, mosquito vector competence data, and vertebrate host competence data

 <xref rid="pntd.0003163-Hamer2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. By applying models utilized in the WNV system, we can implicate potentially important vectors and vertebrate hosts in RVFV transmission should the virus arrive. A number of reviews discuss potential vertebrate hosts, disease vectors, and environments that may support RVFV transmission in the U.S., through environmental receptivity models 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003163-Barker1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and spatial overlap of important host populations 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003163-Kakani1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. However, to our knowledge, no study has quantitatively evaluated the theoretical importance of different mosquito species and vertebrate hosts to RVFV transmission and amplification in the U.S.
