<p>Hypotheses implicating rodents as important hosts for RVFV amplification started when high death rates of 
 <italic>Arvicanthis abyssinicus</italic> and 
 <italic>Rattus rattus</italic> coincided with sheep deaths caused by RVFV in 1932 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003163-Olive1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. Experimental studies demonstrate rodents can be competent amplification hosts for RVFV (
