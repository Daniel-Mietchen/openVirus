<p>World-wide zoonotic disease emergence is an increasing phenomenon due to environmental changes, ecological disturbances, and globalization 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003163-Patz1" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>. The U.S. has already been affected by the emergence of WNV, recently identified a new zoonotic disease (Heartland virus)

 <xref rid="pntd.0003163-CDC4" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. During the initial epidemics of WNV in the U.S. in 2002 and 2003, many mosquito control programs did not have a strong focus on 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. mosquitoes. As knowledge of the WNV transmission system increased, vector control has improved by targeting 
 <italic>Culex</italic> species to reduce human exposure events. The delay of 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. vector control might have allowed more human WNV disease and may have contributed to the rapid spread of the virus across the U.S. highlighting the importance of 
 <italic>a priori</italic> response strategies for potential viral threats.
