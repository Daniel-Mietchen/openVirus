<p>It is apparent that RVFV viremia profiles vary between vertebrate hosts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003163-g001">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003163-g002">Figure 2</xref>). These variations emphasize the importance of characterizing RVFV viremia profiles of domestic and wild animals present in the U.S., especially since their immune systems may be more susceptible to a foreign virus. Experimental infection studies evaluating vertebrate species from the U.S. with larger sample sizes will manifest in more accurate competence values and provide a finer set of data to better implicate important vertebrate hosts for RVFV amplification should the pathogen emerge in the U.S.
