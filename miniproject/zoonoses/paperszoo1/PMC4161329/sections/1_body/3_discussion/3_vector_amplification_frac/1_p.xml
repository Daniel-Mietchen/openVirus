<p>Previous experimental transmission studies conclude that 
 <italic>Cx. tarsalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. j. japonicus</italic> are the most competent vectors with the highest risk to transmit RVFV should it arrive in the U.S.; however, vector competence does not directly imply a significant role in disease transmission

The vector amplification fraction provides a means to quantitatively compare theoretical risk of various mosquito species based on their potential to contribute to RVFV transmission in the U.S. Vector-host contact rates, as dictated by mosquito feeding patterns, is a key component to consider when evaluating the risk of a mosquito vector, as illustrated by the 
 <italic>Cx. tarsalis</italic> mosquioto. 
 <italic>Cx. tarsalis</italic> is one of the most competent vectors of RVFV in the U.S. (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003163-t001">Table 1</xref>), which feeds mainly on avian hosts (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003163.s003">Table S2</xref>), and therefore, is predicted to have a low amplification fraction in comparison to other vectors as seen in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003163-t002">Table 2</xref> (0.2% of total risk). Recent transmission experiments by Turell et al. 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003163-Turell3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> suggest that 
 <italic>Ae. j. japonicus</italic> mosquitoes are the most competent vector of RVFV in the U.S. (previously 
 <italic>Cx. tarsalis</italic>). The vector amplification fraction calculated in this study further implicates 
 <italic>Ae. j. japonicus</italic> as a high risk vector with the potential to contribute to RVFV transmission in the U.S. (11.4%, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003163-t002">Table 2</xref>). This invasive mosquito has a high vector competence (0.37, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003163-t001">Table 1</xref>), feeds heavily on competent hosts (Artiodactyla 80% and Primates 16%, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003163.s002">Table S1</xref>), and is found in all U.S. states east of the Mississippi river except for Florida and Louisiana 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003163-Kaufman1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. Should RVFV spread to the U.S., 
 <italic>Ae. j. japonicus</italic> populations should be carefully monitored for infection and potentially targeted for mosquito control
