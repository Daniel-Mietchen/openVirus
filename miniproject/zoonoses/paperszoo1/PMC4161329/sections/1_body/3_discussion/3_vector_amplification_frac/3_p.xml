<p>Among the top 10 mosquito species theoretically contributing to RVFV transmission in the U.S., only five species (
 <italic>Ae. j. japonicus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. sollicitans, Ae. canadensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Cq. perturbans</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>) have data comprehensive enough for this analysis. This underscores the lack in data necessary to estimate the theoretical role of different mosquito vectors in RVFV transmission in the U.S. Of those ranking as high-risk for contributing to RVFV enzootic transmission, some are limited in geographic range within the U.S. (e.g. 
 <italic>Wy. mitchellii</italic>) underscoring the importance for including spatial and temporal mosquito abundance data while evaluating local regions for RVFV transmission potential. These results indicate a gap in experimental transmission data and requisite further vector competence evaluations to properly evaluate the potential risk of mosquitoes contributing to RVFV transmission in the U.S. Future studies should pay particular emphasis on assessing and re-evaluating the regional transmission competence and population dynamics of 
 <italic>Ae. j. japonicus</italic>, 
 <italic>Cs. inornata, Ae. sollicitans, Ae. sticticus</italic> (only 13 individuals have been evaluated 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003163-Kaufman1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>), 
 <italic>Ae. nigromaculis</italic> (all data from one study in 1988 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003163-Gargan1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>), and 
 <italic>Ae. trivittatus</italic> because of their estimated risk and abundance in the Eastern U.S.
