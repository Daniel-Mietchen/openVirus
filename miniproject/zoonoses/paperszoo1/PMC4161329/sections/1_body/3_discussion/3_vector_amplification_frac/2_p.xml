 <italic>Ae. sticticus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cs. inornata</italic> both demonstrate varying degrees of transmission competency, but vector competence for these two species remains undetermined. In the study by Iranpour 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003163-Iranpour1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, RVFV was detected in the saliva of 
 <italic>Ae. sticticus</italic> after experimental infection and 
 <italic>Cs. inornata</italic> demonstrated both a high infection rate (100%; N = 5) and high dissemination rate after exposure to RVFV viremia between 10
 <sup>7.9</sup> to 10
 <sup>9.4</sup> PFU/ml (60%; N = 3). Considering both these species feed heavily on the order Artiodactyla (
 <italic>Ae. sticticus</italic> 94% and 
 <italic>Cs. inornata</italic> 80%, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003163.s003">Table S2</xref>) their role in RVFV transmission in the U.S. is uncertain and should be evaluated. 
 <italic>Ae. trivittatus</italic> is another mammal-biting mosquito estimated to have a moderate role in transmission that occurs in large populations in the Eastern U.S. and is lacking experimental data.
