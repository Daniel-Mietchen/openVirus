<p>When mosquitoes feed on an infected vertebrate a fraction of those mosquitoes will become infectious depending on the intensity of the vertebrate host's viremia and the mosquito's susceptibility to the virus 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003163-Kilpatrick2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Experimental infection studies that exposed vertebrate species to RVFV and monitored post-infection viremias were used to create a host competence index (C

 </italic>). The vertebrate reservoir competence index represents the relative number of infectious mosquitoes that may result from feeding on infected vertebrate hosts and is calculated as the product of susceptibility to infection, mean daily infectiousness to each species of mosquito, and duration of infectiousness 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003163-Komar1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Published studies were located using Web of Science, NCBI's Pubmed, and the Armed Forces Pest Management Board Literature Retrieval Systems. Studies utilizing PFU/ml and Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50% (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) techniques to quantify viral titers after experimental infection with virulent strains of RVFV (ZH501,T1,T46, AN1830, Kabete, 80612A, AnD100286, AnD100287, Z8548, FRhL2) were the only inclusion criteria for host competence data as no universal conversion between Lethal Dose 50% (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) and Mouse Lethal Dose 50% (MLD
 <sub>50</sub>) was found. Conversion from TCID
 <sub>50</sub> to PFU/ml was obtained by the equation: PFU/ml = TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml×0.69
