<p>To explore the theoretical contribution of vertebrates to RVFV amplification and transmission in the U.S., 
 <italic>F
  <sub>vi</sub>
 </italic> values unique to each vector-vertebrate pair described above were summed across each vertebrate host instead of by mosquito vector. The resulting index expresses the relative number of infectious mosquitoes generated by each vertebrate host. Since species-specific competence data was lacking for all vector-vertebrate host contacts, the role of vertebrate hosts was explored at the taxonomic resolution of class, order, and family. By summing 
 <italic>F
  <sub>vi</sub>
 </italic> values with respect to vertebrate host at different taxonomic levels we were able to quantify the theoretical amplification fraction displayed by each vertebrate host taxonomic group. This index was expressed as a weighted average by dividing the summed 
 <italic>F
  <sub>vi</sub>
 </italic> values for a vertebrate group by the total 
 <italic>F
  <sub>vi</sub>
 </italic> value calculated for the mammalian order (
