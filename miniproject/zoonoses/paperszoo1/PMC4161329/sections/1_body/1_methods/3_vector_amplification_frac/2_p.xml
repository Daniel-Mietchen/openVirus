 <xref rid="pntd.0003163-Woolhouse1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. In an attempt to control any effect of the exposure dose of RVFV on the outcome of mosquito transmission competency, the

  <sub>vi</sub>
 </italic> calculation only utilized mosquito competence values standardized to an exposure dose of 10
 <sup>7.5</sup> PFU/ml as described above. To calculate a mosquito species' vector amplification fraction resulting from feeding on all vertebrate hosts, all

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003163.s004">Table S3</xref>). This overall risk for a mosquito species to contribute to RVFV transmission in the U.S. was calculated based on a weighted percentage relative to the total
