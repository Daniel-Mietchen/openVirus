<p>Analyzing viral dissemination and transmission data drawn from multiple studies is problematic because these data are dependent on the viremic titer of exposure 
 <xref rid="pntd.0003163-Turell5" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and the compiled transmission data for this analysis reflects mosquitoes exposed to viremia that ranged from 10
 <sup>4.3</sup> to 10
 <sup>10.2</sup> plaque-forming units/ml (PFU/ml). To address this issue, a regression analysis of log viremia versus experimental transmission data from 17 mosquito species (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003163.s001">Figure S1</xref>, A and B) was utilized to estimate the dependence of dissemination and transmission rates on viremic dose. Slopes from these regressions were combined with experimental data from each mosquito species to interpolate what the dissemination and transmission rates would be at the exposure viremia of 10
 <sup>7.5</sup> PFU/ml (equations shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003163.s002">Table S1</xref>). Mosquito species that demonstrated low overall vector competence in experimental transmission studies due to midgut escape barriers or salivary gland barriers (i.e.

 <italic>Cx. nigripalpus</italic> (Theobald) and 
 <italic>Ae. infirmatus</italic> (Dyar &amp; Knob)) or had a limited sample size (N&lt;2 mosquitoes) were not used in the regression analyses
