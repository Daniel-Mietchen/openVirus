  <title>Rift Valley fever virus host competence index values for 20 vertebrate hosts based on experimental infection studies characterizing viremia profiles in PFU/ml or TCID
   <sup>50</sup>.
  </title>
  <p>The vertebrate host competence index value depends on the viral titer circulating in the blood and the duration of the infectious viremia 
   <xref rid="pntd.0003163-Komar1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Each value represents the sum of daily probabilities that an infected vertebrate host will transmit RVFV to a biting mosquito. This value was obtained by inserting the recorded daily viremia of experimentally infected hosts into the viremia-vector competence equation [% infectious = 0.062 (Log
   <sub>10</sub> viremia)−0.276 (R
   <sup>2</sup> = 0.27; p&lt;0.001; N = 27)] (
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003163.s001">Figure S1</xref>, C). When a vertebrate host's viremia was calculated to be negative the daily infectiousness was set to zero. Conversion from TCID
   <sup>50</sup> to PFU/ml was obtained by the equation: PFU/ml = TCID
   <sup>50</sup>/ml×0.69
