 <caption>
  <p>To standardize Rift Valley fever virus experimental transmission data two equations referenced in row 60 that estimate the viremia dose dependence of dissemination rate and transmission rate (see 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003163.s001">Figure S1</xref>-A and 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003163.s001">Figure S1</xref>-B) were utilized to interpolate what the dissemination and transmission rates would be at the exposure viremia of 10
   <sup>7.5</sup> PFU/ml. A species average was calculated (Columns H and K) and multiplied together to calculate the vector competence at the same exposure viremia (Column L).
