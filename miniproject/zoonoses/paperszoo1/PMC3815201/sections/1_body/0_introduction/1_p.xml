<p>Trees have long been used as a metaphor for making sense of a diverse living world. The modern phylogenetic tree is a model of the evolutionary relatedness of populations or individuals, which is increasingly based on the similarity of their genetic makeup. Phylogenies have become an indispensable tool for the study of biological variation by providing a framework for modelling evolutionary processes along lineages of descent from common ancestors. In particular, phylogenies are used extensively in the study of viruses. Viruses, especially those with RNA genomes, exhibit some of the fastest rates of molecular evolution in the natural world, driven by high rates of mutation

Many viral lineages can proliferate on time scales measured in days, as opposed to the millions of years it would require for many branches on the macroscopic ‘Tree of Life’ to grow to the same extent. The substantial variation in the shapes of RNA virus phylogenies (

These processes may in turn be shaped by the ongoing evolution of the virus. The study of this multi-level interaction is known as ‘phylodynamics’
