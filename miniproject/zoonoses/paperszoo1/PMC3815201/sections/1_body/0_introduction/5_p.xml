<p>To provide an intuition to this use of the kernel trick, imagine a person who has encountered three texts written in English – specifically, the texts contained in Agapow and Purvis 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Agapow1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, Huelsenbeck 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Huelsenbeck1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and Robinson and Foulds 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Moreover, suppose this person has absolutely no knowledge of the English language, let alone phylogenetics. Realizing that there are discrete shapes (words) and that many of them appear repeatedly, he or she carries out the lengthy task of cataloguing the number of times that each shape appears in each text. (For the sake of example, we ignore such complications as punctuation and typography.) While there are many shapes that are unique to a given text, there is a much smaller subset of shapes that appear in two or more texts. Therefore, in order to compare two of these lists, it is convenient to multiply the counts of shapes that appear in both lists (knowing that unique shapes would multiply to zero) and sum these products to generate a similarity score. Multiplying the counts has the useful effect of emphasizing shapes that appear in both texts at roughly equal frequencies. For example, ‘tree’ appears 37 times in both 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Agapow1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, which contributes a score of 1369. In contrast, if all but one of the 74 occurrences of ‘tree’ appeared in one of the two texts, then the score would have increased by only 73. This exercise yields three numbers corresponding to the pairwise comparisons: 264630 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Agapow1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Huelsenbeck1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, 141470 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Agapow1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and 277008 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Huelsenbeck1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Huelsenbeck1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> is a much lengthier text that the other two, which has inflated the scores for pairwise comparisons that included this text. It is necessary to normalize each score for the size of the corresponding texts 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Collins1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>; upon doing so, our imagined person is able to conclude that 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Agapow1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> are the most similar (0.84) without knowing that these papers are, in fact, both on the subject of phylogenetic tree shape, whereas 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Huelsenbeck1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> (with normalized scores of 0.82 and 0.78, respectively) concerns the problem of inferring the root of a phylogeny.
