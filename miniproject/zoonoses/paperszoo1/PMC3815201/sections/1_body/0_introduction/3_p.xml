<p>Until recently, our understanding of phylodynamics through the comparative study of virus phylogenies has been generally limited to conspicuous differences in tree shape, such as that between HIV and IAV phylogenies, because tree shapes are inherently difficult to quantify. A phylogenetic tree is an acyclic graph in which the nodes represent either observed entities (leaf nodes) or their common ancestors (internal nodes) which must be reconstructed from the variation observed at the leaf nodes. These nodes are linked by branches whose lengths represent either the passage of time or the amount of evolutionary change that has occurred between nodes. As a result, the shape of a phylogenetic tree is a complex object that incorporates both the lengths and distribution of branches among nodes. There is an abundance of descriptive statistics of tree shape that focus on the concept of ‘tree balance’, which refers to the skewed distribution of internal nodes in a tree due to variation in rates of branching

 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Sackin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> counts the number of internal nodes along the path from each leaf node to the root of the tree. When branching events occur preferentially along specific lineages, the corresponding phylogeny should tend to have a higher Sackin index. However, tree balance statistics are notoriously sensitive to sample size
