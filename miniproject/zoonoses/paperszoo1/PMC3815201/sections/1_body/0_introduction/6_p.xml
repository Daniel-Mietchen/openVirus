<p>To construct a kernel function on phylogenetic tree shapes, we adapted a natural language processing kernel function 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Moschitti1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> that was originally designed to classify text on the basis of its syntactic structure (a generative tree in which words descend from linguistic precursors 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Collins1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>). Our modified kernel function 
 <inline-formula>
  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0078122.e018.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula> extracts all the subset trees that are the common features of two phylogenetic trees 
 <inline-formula>
  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0078122.e019.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula> and 
 <inline-formula>
  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0078122.e020.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078122-g002">Figure 2</xref>). A subset tree is a contiguous collection of descendants of a specific node, but unlike a subtree, it does not necessarily include all of the descendants. Thus, our approach is similar to the Robinson-Foulds metric 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> which compares alternative trees for a given set of taxa by counting the number of subtrees in common. Unlike the Robinson-Foulds metric, however, our kernel function not only allows us to compare trees relating different numbers and kinds of taxa, but it also accounts for differences in the branch lengths between matching subset trees. We assess the performance of our kernel function against nine measures of tree shape at classifying simulated phylogenies with varying rates of speciation, and then apply our function to a large collection of human and zoonotic RNA virus phylogenies.
