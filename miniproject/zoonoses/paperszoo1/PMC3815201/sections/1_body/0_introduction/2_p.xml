<p>Identifying the reproducible shape characteristics among virus phylogenies and the epidemiological and evolutionary determinants of these shapes are key research questions of phylodynamics 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Holmes1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. For instance, the stark contrast between phylogenies generated respectively from influenza A virus (IAV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 sequences is a prototypical example of how virus phylogenies can be shaped by phylodynamic processes

 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Sharp1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. A phylogeny reconstructed from sequences of IAV hemagglutinin, a receptor-binding glycoprotein which is a primary target of the host immune system, has a distinctively pectinate (‘comb-like’) shape (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078122-g001">Figure 1</xref>) that is hypothesized to be driven by the short infectious period and antigenic drift of IAV, in which very few lineages persist between successive epidemics 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In contrast, the life-long nature of HIV infection and ongoing transmission among hosts has enabled rapidly diverging lineages to proliferate and persist over time, leading to ‘star-like’ phylogenies with short branches near the root and long branches at the tips (
