<p>We simulated two sets of 100 replicate phylogenies under different mutation rates (200 trees total) that influenced the branching rates in the phylogeny in an autocorrelated fashion 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-FitzJohn1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In other words, the branching rate was allowed to evolve as each phylogeny grew from a common ancestor to 100 descendants. These simulations provide a reasonable approximation of the kind of evolutionary scenarios between which tree balance statistics were meant to differentiate 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Agapow1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, since preferential branching along fewer lineages will tend to produce an imbalanced tree. For all simulated phylogenies, we computed nine different balance statistics (the eight statistics assessed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Agapow1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and Sackinâ€™s index). In addition, we computed the kernel matrix for all simulated phylogenies using our phylogenetic tree shape kernel. Note that the kernel method does not function as a summary statistic; it cannot assign a value to a given tree in the absence of any other information. Consequently, we compared the kernel method to balance statistics by evaluating their performance at correctly classifying trees that had been generated under different models of speciation, which is analogous to the transmission of an infectious disease between hosts.
