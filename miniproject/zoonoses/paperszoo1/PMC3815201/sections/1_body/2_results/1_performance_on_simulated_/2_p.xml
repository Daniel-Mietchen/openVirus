 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078122-g003">Figure 3</xref>. Using our kernel method, we obtained a median sensitivity of 97.7% (interquartile range, IQR = 95.6%, 98.0%) and specificity of 90.8% (IQR = 89.1%, 92.8%) when averaged over 100 replicate training sets. These results were unambiguously superior to all nine balance statistics that were evaluated over the same simulated data. For instance, the sum of Fusco and Cronk’s imbalance statistic was the most effective among the balance statistics, but none could exceed a sensitivity of
