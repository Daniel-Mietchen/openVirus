<p>A scatterplot of the largest 2 principal components from the preceding analysis described a single arc in which HIV and HCV phylogenies comprised a distinct cluster from the other RNA viruses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078122.s002">Figure S2</xref>). However, the majority of the other viruses were agglomerated at the base of the arc, making it difficult to discern patterns from this visualization. This is a known issue in PCA in which the largest components are assumed to represent the important structure in the data whereas smaller components represent noise. To provide a clearer visualization, we generated another scatterplot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078122-g005">Figure 5</xref>) using a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding algorithm (t-SNE) which attempts to preserve both global and local structure in a low-dimensional visualization of high-dimensional data 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-vanderMaaten1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Again, HIV and HCV comprised a distinct cluster in this visualization. Phylogenies derived from these viruses tend to feature long terminal branches and relatively short internal branches (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078122-g001">Figure 1</xref>), which has been attributed to the exponential spread of these viruses and their propensity to establish persistent infections. This outcome was robust to partitioning sequences by clade; for example, a phylogeny comprised of all three HIV subtypes in our study mapped adjacent to the HIV subtype-specific phylogenies in both types of projections (data not shown).
