<p>Here, we develop and apply a new approach to comparing RNA virus tree shapes by using a method from machine learning known as the ‘kernel trick’ 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Aizerman1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Rather than attempting to reduce a complex tree shape down to one or more summary statistics, like the tree balance indices examined above, we defined a kernel function (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078122-g002">Figure 2</xref>) that efficiently computes inner products between phylogenies with respect to their tree shapes. By this approach, a tree’s shape is quantified only by its comparison to other trees. We have shown above that this method can be highly effective at discriminating between the shapes of phylogenies that were simulated under different evolutionary scenarios. We applied this phylogenetic tree kernel to our collection of RNA virus phylogenies to generate a kernel matrix that is akin to a pairwise similarity matrix. Entries in the kernel matrix were averaged across replicate phylogenies from the same alignments, and renormalized to yield a smaller kernel matrix with rows or columns corresponding to different viruses or virus clades and sampling schemes (completely at random or uniformly with respect to collection year). According to the eigenvalues of this projection, about 90% of the variance was explained by the first 2 principal components alone, with about 70% of the variance explained by the first component; these percentages varied slightly with different parameter settings of the kernel function (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078122.s002">Figure S2</xref>). In all cases, the first component distinctly separated the phylogenies derived from HIV and HCV sequences from the rest of the RNA viruses. However, none of the remaining principal components were as readily interpretable. Furthermore, neither Sackin’s nor Colless’ indices were significantly correlated with any of the principal components based on a simple Pearson correlation test after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Additionally, we trained a support vector regression model using the kernel matrix and Colless’ indices for a random subset of the data. The mean concordance correlation coefficient 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Lawrence1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> between the observed Colless’ indices and those predicted by this model for the remaining phylogenies was only 0.12 (interquartile range 0.07, 0.18), which is considered poor. These results, which were robust to varying
