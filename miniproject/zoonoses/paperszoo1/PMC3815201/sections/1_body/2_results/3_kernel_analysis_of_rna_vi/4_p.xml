<p>The influenza viruses predominantly responsible for the seasonal epidemics around the world (IAV-H1, IAV-H3, and IBV) were located close together in both projections of the kernel matrix. In contrast, the Sackin’s and Colless’ indices for IBV were substantially lower than those of IAV-H1 and IAV-H3. This suggests that the kernel was more successful in identifying commonalities in the shapes of the phylogenies of these influenza viruses. On the other hand, these influenza viruses were located in the midst of many other RNA viruses in both projections, despite the strikingly pectinate shape of IAV-H3 (

Phylogenies from the other influenza viruses in this study (IAV-H2, IAV-H5, and influenza C virus) mapped further away from the seasonal epidemic influenza viruses. These other phylogenies tended to have longer internal branches (relative to terminal branches) than the phylogenies of IAV-H1, IAV-H3, and IBV. Specifically, the ratio of the median branch lengths of internal and terminal branches, respectively, was significantly greater for the other influenza viruses than the seasonal epidemic influenza viruses (Wilcoxon rank sum test

 </inline-formula>). A possible explanation for this pattern is that the H2 and H5 subtypes are infrequently re-introduced into the human population from under-sampled avian host populations; consequently, the evolving diversity of these viruses would be represented by only a small number of lineages in phylogenies.
