<p>Finally, we observed that phylogenies from certain viruses shared a distinctive rapid proliferation of short terminal branches within one or more specific clades which may be a signature of sporadic outbreaks, as illustrated by the coxsackievirus A24 variant phylogeny (CA24v) depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078122-g001">Figure 1</xref>. For example, the majority of CA24v sequences within the highly unresolved clade of its phylogenies were sampled during outbreaks of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis in Brazil and China. The proximity of the zoonotic viruses Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV) to CA24v in projections of the kernel matrices (
