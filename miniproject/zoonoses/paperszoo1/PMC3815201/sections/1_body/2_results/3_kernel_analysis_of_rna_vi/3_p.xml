<p>GB virus C (GBVC), which is not known to be associated with any human disease, was consistently located within the cluster of HIV and HCV phylogenies in the kernel PCA projections. (Due to the stochastic nature of the

 </inline-formula>-SNE algorithm, GBVC was not always embedded in the vicinity of HIV and HCV.) A close relative of HCV, GBVC can establish persistent infections in its human hosts and may inhibit HIV replication when an individual has become co-infected by both viruses 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Thus, the ability to establish persistent infections appears to be a common characteristic of viruses whose phylogenies map to this region of tree shape space. To test this hypothesis, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to differentiate between viruses having the ability to establish persistent chronic infections (HIV, HCV, and GBVC) and those without. We randomly selected half of the members from each category and used the corresponding rows and columns in the kernel matrix as training data. Validating the classifier on the remaining half of the kernel matrix, we consistently obtained a sensitivity and specificity of 1.0 irrespective of varying the kernel parameters
