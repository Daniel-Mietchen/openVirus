<p>To assess the potential bias of uneven sampling over time, we incorporated replicate phylogenies into the kernel matrix that were generated from samples of virus sequences drawn at random with respect to collection year. We found that the mean distances between phylogenies sampled completely at random and phylogenies sampled uniformly by collection year from the same virus or virus clade were significantly shorter (larger kernel scores) than the mean distances between phylogenies from different viruses or virus clades (Wilcoxon rank sum test,

 </inline-formula>). Specifically, the mean normalized kernel score between phylogenies of the same virus obtained by different sampling schemes was 0.98, whereas the mean among phylogenies from different viruses was 0.84, where a normalized score of 1.0 indicates an exact match with respect to tree shape. On visually examining a PCA projection of this kernel matrix, we found that sampling uniformly by collection year tended to shift phylogenies along the same trajectory in the space of tree shapes (
