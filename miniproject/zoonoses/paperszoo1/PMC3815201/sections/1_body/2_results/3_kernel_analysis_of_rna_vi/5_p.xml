<p>Our survey of animal RNA viruses included several examples of zoonotic viruses. One might anticipate that these viruses could map to one or more distinct regions in projections of the kernel matrix. We observed that mosquito-transmitted zoonotic viruses such as the highly divergent dengue serotypes (DEN-1 to -4), the arboviral encephalitides (Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus), and yellow fever virus tended to map to a similar region in projections of the kernel matrix, although this region was not exclusive of other viruses for which humans are the only known natural hosts, such as rubella virus and poliovirus (

Another interesting feature of this projection was that phylogenies representing clades of the zoonotic rabies virus (RabV-1 to -3) mapped to a similar region as the mosquito-transmitted zoonotic viruses. The majority of the rabies virus sequences were isolated from non-human hosts predominated by canine (numbered here as clades 1 and 3) and bat species (clade 2), with about 2%â€“9% sequences isolated from human hosts (
