<p>This raises a concern of whether tree balance is an artefact of biased sampling of virus isolates over time, such that the overrepresentation of isolates from a narrow range of years might tend to yield balanced trees. To address this, we calculated the mean Colless’ indices for phylogenies generated from samples that were uniform with respect to sample collection years for alignments in which an adequate number of sequences were annotated with collection dates (
