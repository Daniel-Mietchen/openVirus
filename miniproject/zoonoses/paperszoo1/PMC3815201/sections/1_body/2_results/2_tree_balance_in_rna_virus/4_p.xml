<p>In sum, the distribution of mean Colless’ indices was highly peaked in the interval between 0.15 to 0.2, such that this summary statistic did not discriminate substantially among the phylogenies of most RNA viruses in our study (

  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0078122.e092.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula>) derived from IAV serotype H1 phylogenies was similar to the index of a hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 2a phylogeny (

  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0078122.e093.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula>), which would not seem to be consistent with the observation that phylogenies from HCV and IAV have conspicuously different shapes 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Grenfell1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Specifically, we found that 6 out of 100 replicate samples of IAV-H1 sequences led to Colless’ indices that were less than the value observed for HCV-2a. Similarly, the relatively low Colless’ indices of phylogenies of influenza B virus (IBV,

 </inline-formula>), which together with IAV serotypes H1 and H3 is responsible for the majority of seasonal influenza outbreaks, implies that the imbalance of IBV-derived trees is no different from the bulk of animal RNA viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078122-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, the mean Colless’ index did not differentiate the phylogenies of HIV and HCV from other RNA viruses. We obtained the same qualitative results from an evaluation of mean Sackin’s indices (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078122.s003">Figure S3</xref>), which were highly correlated with the respective mean Colless’ indices (Pearson’s

  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0078122.e096.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula>). There is much more to the conspicuously star-like shape of HIV and HCV phylogenies that remains unquantifiable by balance statistics. Consequently, relying too heavily on tree balance statistics potentially limits our ability to measure the diversity of human and zoonotic RNA virus phylogenies, and to link recurring shapes to epidemiological or evolutionary processes.
