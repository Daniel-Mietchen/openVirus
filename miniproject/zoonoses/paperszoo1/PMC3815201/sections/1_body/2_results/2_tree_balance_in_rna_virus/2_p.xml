<p>For each alignment, we calculated the means across replicates of two tree balance statistics (Colless’ index and Sackin’s index), which quantify the asymmetry in rates of branching among ancestral lineages in each tree. Specifically, Sackin’s index 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Sackin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> counts the number of ancestral nodes separating each tip to the root, while Colless’ index 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Colless1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> evaluates the difference in the number of tips that descend from the left and right branches of each bifurcating ancestral node. The distribution of mean Colless’ indices is displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078122-g004">Figure 4</xref>. As expected, influenza A virus (IAV) serotype H3 assumed one of the highest mean Colless’ indices (0.544) indicating that the replicate trees were severely imbalanced; only Murray valley encephalitis virus (MVEV) presented a higher index (0.548). Only 39 published MVEV envelope sequences were available after culling 7 identical sequences; however, Colless’ index is expected to be biased downwards with decreasing sample size, suggesting that the mean index for 100-sequence MVEV trees could have been even greater still. MVEV is endemic to Australia and Papua New Guinea and comprised almost entirely of mosquito isolates sampled over six decades (1956–2008). The IAV H3 sequences were strictly human isolates from around the globe but also sampled over a period of several decades (1968–2012).
