<p>We used maximum likelihood-based heuristics to reconstruct phylogenies from 62 sequence alignments representing 38 different human and zoonotic RNA viruses from 12 different taxonomic families (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078122.s005">Table S1</xref>). Genetic sequences from viruses with highly divergent clades, such as the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtypes or influenza A virus serotypes, were grouped accordingly into separate multiple sequence alignments to allow for clade-specific epidemiological or evolutionary dynamics. Replicate phylogenies were generated from random samples of 100 sequences (given adequate sample size) to control for the well-documented confounding effect of variation in sample size on conventional tree shape statistics
