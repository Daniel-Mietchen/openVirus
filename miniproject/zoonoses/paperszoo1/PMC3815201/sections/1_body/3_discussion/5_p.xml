<p>It is possible that a similar procedure could be used, for example, to determine the natural animal reservoir of an incompletely characterized zoonotic virus. This may not only require further development of kernel methods such as those presented here, but also greater coverage and more detailed annotation of published sequence data for RNA viruses that are under-represented in public databases. Additionally, the tree shape kernel may provide an effective distance measure for fitting complex phylodynamic models by approximate Bayesian computation 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Ratmann1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, a rapidly emerging class of highly versatile and efficient computational methods in which a distance measure (such as the difference in summary statistics) is used to assess the congruence between model simulations and observed data.
