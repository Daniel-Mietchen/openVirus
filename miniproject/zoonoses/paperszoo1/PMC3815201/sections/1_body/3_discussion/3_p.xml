<p>A common concern directed at studies of phylogenetic tree shapes is that variation in tree shapes may be an artefact of differences in sampling. For example, influenza A virus sequences in our data were sampled over a wide range of years from 1925 to 2012, with 72% of sequences sampled after 2001. It is possible that differences among viruses in the distributions of sample dates may introduce a bias to tree balance statistics or the kernel method. However, when we constrained samples across viruses to be sampled uniformly with respect to collection years, we found no significant effect on the distributions of RNA viruses for either tree balance or kernel-based methods. Analyses of tree shapes can be robust to temporal sampling biases because the internal structures of the phylogenies are often comprised of ancestors that are substantially further back in time. For example, there was very little clustering of HIV-1 subtype B sequences in the phylogeny with respect to collection year, implying that a phylogeny reconstructed a tree from sequences collected in a specific year will retain most of its deeper structure.</p>
