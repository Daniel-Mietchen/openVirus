<p>In this study, we have proposed a new framework for comparing phylogenetic tree shapes by extending a parse tree kernel from computational linguistics 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Moschitti1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Our kernel function compares all subset trees shared by two phylogenies and weights this comparison by the concordance of branch lengths that comprise the respective subset trees (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078122-g002">Figure 2</xref>). It therefore bears some similarity to the weighted Robinson-Foulds metric that is based on comparing the lengths of branches that descend from each ancestral node 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, the Robinson-Foulds metric is restricted to comparing alternative trees relating the same taxa; in other words, the terminal branches must have the same labels. This requirement makes it impossible to use the Robinson-Foulds metric to compare phylogenies from different viruses. In contrast, our kernel is designed to compare trees from completely different sets of taxa because it discriminates among subset trees primarily by the number of terminal branches that descend from each ancestral node, regardless of what taxa occupy the tips of those branches. Moreover, if two phylogenies had a subset tree in common, that subset tree would have to occur in the same location of the trees to be counted towards the Robinson-Foulds metric. In contrast, since the tree shape kernel iterates over all internal nodes in both phylogenies, subset trees in different locations can contribute towards the kernel score. This is an important distinction because we are primarily interested in recurring motifs in tree shape, irrespective of where they appear in either tree, because this commonality may represent the imprint of a common epidemiological or evolutionary process acting on both viruses.
