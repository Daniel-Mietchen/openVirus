<p>The tree shape kernel presented here potentially represents an important new exploratory tool for studying RNA virus phylogenies. By extracting recurring local motifs in the internal structures of different phylogenies, it can complement the established tree balance statistics to provide a more complete description of the diversity of tree shapes among RNA viruses 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Holmes1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Our kernel is not a parametric model in itself; unlike recent advances in viral phylodynamics 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Frost1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, it does not attempt to directly estimate epidemiological model parameters from tree shapes. Unlike a tree balance statistic, the kernel function cannot assign a numerical value to a single phylogeny in the absence of any other data. Without summary statistics to compare to reported values in the literature, it is necessary to have at hand all the phylogenies that one wishes to compare in order to compute the entire kernel matrix. On the other hand, the use of a kernel method presents opportunities to utilize other techniques from machine learning such as support vector machines (SVMs) to extract and analyze patterns in phylogenetic tree shapes. For example, we simulated phylogenies under two different evolutionary scenarios that influenced the asymmetry in branching rates among lineages, and we found that an SVM assisted by our kernel function clearly outperformed nine different tree balance statistics at predicting which phylogeny was generated under which scenario (

Furthermore, we trained another SVM classifier on a random subset of phylogenies labelled by whether the respective RNA viruses could establish persistent chronic infections. The trained model consistently predicted these labels for the remaining phylogenies with very high sensitivity and specificity (see Results section).
