<p>Using conventional tree balance statistics, we found limited variation among phylogenies from different RNA viruses, with most viruses falling into a narrow range of Colless’ or Sackin’s indices after controlling for sample size variation. In contrast, our kernel function was able to separate the distinctively star-like phylogenies of HIV and hepatitis C virus. However, it was unable to distinguish the conspicuously pectinate shapes of IAV-H1 and -H3 phylogenies to the same extent as the tree balance statistics. This is most likely due to our use of a decay factor

 </inline-formula>, large phylogenies would result in enormous values along the diagonal of the kernel matrix because a phylogeny will always match itself exactly, washing out any patterns from comparisons between different phylogenies. In other words, our use of a decay factor places greater emphasis on local than global similarities between the shapes of two phylogenies. Using a decay factor evidently prevents the full extent of the imbalance in the IAV-H1 or -H3 phylogenies from being expressed in the kernel matrix, since the longer subset trees that would represent this large-scale pattern are penalized more heavily.
