<p>We used the R package 
 <italic>diversitree</italic>
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-FitzJohn1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> to simulate the growth of phylogenies under different evolutionary scenarios of branching or ‘speciation’ rates. Trees were generated under a Quantitative State Speciation and Extinction (QuaSSE) model 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-FitzJohn2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> whereby speciation rates were determined by a continuous trait whose evolution was simulated by a Brownian motion (with zero drift and variance per unit time

 </inline-formula>) under two different mutation rates (

 </inline-formula> = 0.1 and 0.01). This continuous trait was mapped to a speciation rate by a sigmoidal function with a zero midpoint, exponential decay rate of 0.25, and minimum and maximum values of 0.05 and 0.25, respectively. We performed two sets of 100 replicate simulations under the different mutation rate scenarios. The simulated data were converted into Newick tree strings using a Python script derived from the Biopython Phylo module 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Talevich1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. These strings are publicly available at

We calculated nine different tree balance statistics – Colless’ index, Sackin’s index, mean path length, variation in path length, Shao and Sokal’s

 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Schlkopf1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> using the R package 
 <italic>kernlab</italic> on a random subset of half of the phylogenies, and then measured the sensitivity and specificity of classification by mutation rate on the remaining half. Likewise, the sensitivity and specificity of classifying trees by tree balance statistics was evaluated at varying cutoffs using the R package
