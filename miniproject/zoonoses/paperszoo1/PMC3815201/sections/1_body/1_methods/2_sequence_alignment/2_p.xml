<p>Initial phylogenies were generated using FastTree (version 2.1.4) 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Price1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> under the general time-reversible model of nucleotide substitution. These phylogenies were used to identify clusters of sequences that could represent multiple isolates from the same individual, which we determined by evaluating the publications linked with sequences within putative clusters. Furthermore, the initial phylogenies were used to partition or filter alignments by genotype or subtype, because the Genbank sequence records were not consistently annotated with this information. The data sets that were partitioned or filtered using the initial phylogenies were: astrovirus, dengue virus type 1, hepatitis delta virus, hepatitis E virus, influenza A virus H1, Japanese encephalitis virus, Norwalk virus genotype II, poliovirus (wild and vaccine variants), rabies virus, rotavirus A, rubella virus, sapovirus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and West Nile virus.
