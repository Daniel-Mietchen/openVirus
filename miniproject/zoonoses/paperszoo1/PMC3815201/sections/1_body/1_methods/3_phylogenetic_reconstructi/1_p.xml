<p>Although it is possible to apply our kernel method (described below) to an unrooted tree by counting subtrees from the deepest node outwards, phylodynamic studies of tree shapes have conventionally been carried out on rooted trees which can be more informative about evolutionary processes. The root of a phylogeny is a hypothesis on the location of most recent common ancestor (the earliest point in time) on the tree. We used an outgroup criterion 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Huelsenbeck1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> to infer rooted phylogenies from the alignments. This method relies on selecting an outgroup sequence that is sufficiently closely related to the true ancestor. For each alignment, we selected an outgroup sequence based on previous phylogenetic studies on the respective viruses in the literature, either a representative sequence from a closely-related virus genotype or subtype (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, HIV-1 subtype D), or the earliest/prototype virus isolate (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, West Nile virus isolate B956 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Smithburn1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>). A list of outgroup sequence accession numbers and literature citations is provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078122.s005">Table S1</xref>. We assessed the suitability of the respective outgroup sequences by generating preliminary rooted trees using FastTree2. While results based on tree balance statistics were sensitive to outgroup rooting, our results based on the kernel analysis were robust to choice of outgroup (data not shown).
