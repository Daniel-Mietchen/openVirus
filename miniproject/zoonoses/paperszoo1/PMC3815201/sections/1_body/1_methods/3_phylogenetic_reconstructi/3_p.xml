<p>Phylogenetic reconstruction for every sample was carried out using a multithreaded implementation of RAxML (version 7.3.0) 
 <xref rid="pone.0078122-Stamatakis1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> under a general time-reversible model of nucleotide substitution with 25 rate categories across sites, followed by optimization under a discretized gamma distribution of rate categories (GTRCAT). All phylogenies contained a number of ‘soft’ polytomies, in which the phylogenetic reconstruction was unable to assign a non-zero branch length at an internal node due to inadequate genetic divergence. Because RAxML is limited to strictly bifurcating representations of phylogenetic trees (with the exception of the deepest node from which all branches are interpreted as descendants), soft polytomies were automatically resolved by the software into an arbitrary binary tree with branch lengths set to a small non-zero value. By randomizing the resolution of soft polytomies into binary trees, we found that our results were robust to this source of uncertainty in phylogenetic reconstruction (data not shown).
