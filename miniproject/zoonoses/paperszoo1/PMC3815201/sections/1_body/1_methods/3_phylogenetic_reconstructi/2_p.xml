<p>For alignments with 200 or more sequences, we generated 100 replicate subsets of 100 sequences sampled at random without replacement from each data set for phylogenetic reconstructions. This resampling controlled for the effect of excessive variation in tree size (number of sequences) on comparisons of tree shape. Otherwise, a single phylogeny was generated for each alignment with fewer than 200 sequences (Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus; Chikungunya virus; encephalomyocarditis virus; HIV-1 subtype A; Hantaan virus; human rotavirus C; influenza A virus H2; influenza C virus; Murray valley encephalitis virus; mumps virus; Oropouche virus; human parainfluenza virus; Rift valley fever virus; rhinovirus A; rotavirus A genotypes 3, 4, and 12; rubella virus clade 2; sapovirus; tick-borne encephalitis virus, European and Far-Eastern strains; yellow fever virus). For data sets in which 200 or more sequences were annotated with collection dates, we generated 10 additional samples of 100 sequences drawn uniformly at random with respect to the year of collection. Phylogenies reconstructed from these latter samples provided a means to assess the sensitivity of our analyses to biased sample collection with respect to time.</p>
