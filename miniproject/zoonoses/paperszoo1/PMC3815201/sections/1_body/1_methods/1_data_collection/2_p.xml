<p>Gene sequences from all other viruses were obtained from the GenBank sequence database by primary organism taxonomy identifier (‘txid’). Queries yielding fewer than 100 records irrespective of gene were omitted at this stage. In all cases, sequence data were downloaded as FASTA formatted files; these published data were already anonymized and did not include any information about patients’ medical records. Sequences annotated as multiple clonal isolates from the same patient, sequences from patents or laboratory strains were excluded from these data. For all viruses other than HCV, HIV and IAV, we retrieved collection dates and host organism data, when available, for each sequence by its Genbank accession number using an automated query algorithm implemented in Python. By convention, Genbank records are annotated with this information in a ‘source’ field; however, this field is not always included in data submissions. For HCV, HIV and IAV sequences, which were already screened for human hosts, collection dates were parsed from sequence headers that were generated by the respective database engines.</p>
