   <bold>Distribution of mean normalized Sackin’s indices.</bold> Each label represents the mean index of a virus or virus clade. The vertical axis is used to elucidate the clustering of points by forcing overlapping labels (phylogenies with similar indices) to ‘pile up’ like a histogram. A higher Sackin index corresponds to a less ‘balanced’ tree in which branching events tend to occur along the same lineage. Label annotations are identical to
