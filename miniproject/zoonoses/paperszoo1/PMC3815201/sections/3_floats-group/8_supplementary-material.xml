   <bold>Visualizing the effect of resampling virus sequences uniformly at random with respect to year of collection.</bold> The kernel matrix calculated from the original sample phylogenies (black) and the additional phylogenies from uniform sampling by year (red) is projected onto the first two principal components. Arrows are drawn between phylogenies generated by different sampling schemes from the same set of virus sequences. Note that this PCA projection is slightly different from projection generated under the same settings (
