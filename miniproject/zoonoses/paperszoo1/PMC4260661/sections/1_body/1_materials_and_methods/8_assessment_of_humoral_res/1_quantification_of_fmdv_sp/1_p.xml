<p>The presence of FMDV-specific sIgA in saliva and nasal washes and IgA in sera of immunized cattle was detected by capture ELISA, with some modifications.

 <xref rid="b39-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with rabbit anti-FMDV antibody and stored at 4째C overnight. After washing, inactivated FMDV antigen (100 mL/well) was added and incubated for 1 hour at 37째C. Wells were washed and incubated for 1 hour at 37째C with twofold serial dilutions of samples of serum, saliva, or nasal secretions, starting with a 1:4 dilution. Secondary antibody HRP-conjugated sheep anti-bovine IgA was diluted 1:1,000 and added into wells, and incubated at 37째C for 1 hour. Plates were washed and incubated with substrate (10 mg o-phenylenediamine + 20 mL 0.015% hydrogen peroxide in phosphate/citrate buffer) for 10 minutes at room temperature. Color development was stopped with 0.5 M of H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> after 15 minutes. Optical density of the ELISA plates was read at 492 nm.
