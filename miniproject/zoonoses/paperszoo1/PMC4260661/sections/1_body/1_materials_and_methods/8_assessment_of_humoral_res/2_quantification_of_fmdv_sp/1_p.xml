<p>FMDV-specific IgG antibodies were detected by LB-ELISA kits (provided by Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute Chinese Academy of Agriculture) according to the supplier’s instructions. Cattle serum samples collected from unvaccinated and vaccinated animals were tested in parallel using inactivated virus antigen. A twofold dilution of test sera was generated from 1:8 to 1:1,024, and 75 μL diluted test serum was mixed with 75 μL antigen in deep-well plates and incubated overnight at 4°C. Then, 100 μL of mixture was transferred in duplicate to microplates precoated with rabbit anti-FMDV capture serum. The plates were washed and incubated with guinea pig anti-FMDV serum and incubated at 37°C for one hour. After washing, HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-guinea pig IgG was added at 1:2,000 and incubated at 37°C for one hour. The plates were washed and incubated with substrate (10 mg o-phenylenediamine + 20 mL 0.015% hydrogen peroxide in phosphate/citrate buffer) for 10 minutes at room temperature. Color development was stopped with 0.5 M of H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> after 15 minutes. Optical density of the ELISA plates was read at 492 nm.
