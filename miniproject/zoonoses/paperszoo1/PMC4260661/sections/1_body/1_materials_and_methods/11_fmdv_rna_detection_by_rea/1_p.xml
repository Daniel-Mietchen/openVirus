<p>Quantification of FMDV RNA copies in saliva, nasal washes, and oropharyngeal fluids used a dilution series of an RNA standard (RNA transcribed in vitro from a plasmid clone containing a fragment of the FMDV 3D region run in parallel with each plate of RT-PCR assays) as previously described.

 <xref rid="b42-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> An automated nucleic acid robotic work station (BioRobot
 <sup>®</sup> MDx; Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands) was used to generate nucleic acid templates from samples for real-time RT-PCR. Nucleic acid extraction was by a customized automated protocol using reagents from a QIAamp
 <sup>®</sup> All Nucleic Acid MDx kit (Qiagen). Total nucleic acids were eluted to a final volume of 50 μL. Real-time RT-PCR reactions were prepared manually by adding 4 μL template to 21 μL real-time RT-PCR reaction mix containing 12.5 μL of 2× one step RT-PCR buffer, 0.5 μL of Prime Script RT Enzyme Mix, 0.5 μL TakaRa Ex Taq enzyme HS (5 u/μL), 0.5 μL each of forward and reverse primer (10 μM), 0.3 μL dual-labeled TaqMan probe, and 6.2 μL nuclease-free dH
 <sub>2</sub>O, to a final volume of 25 μL. Samples and standards were run in triplicate in an Mx3005P Multiplex Quantitative PCR System, at 42°C for 50 minutes and 95°C for 10 seconds, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 seconds and 60°C for 30 seconds. Samples with cycle threshold values &lt;33 were considered positive. Primers and probe for the FMDV 3D region and standard plasmid were kindly provided by Dr Huifang Bao.
