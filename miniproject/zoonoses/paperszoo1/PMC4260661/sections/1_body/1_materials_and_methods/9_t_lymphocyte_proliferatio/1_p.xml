<p>T lymphocyte proliferation activity was evaluated by carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE), originally developed by Lyons and Parish.
 <xref rid="b40-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from heparinized blood using Ficoll-Hypaque density gradients (Axis-Shield Diagnostics Ltd, Dundee, UK) for 20 minutes at room temperature. PBMCs were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in RPMI-1640 culture medium without fetal bovine serum. CFSE was dissolved to 5 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored in aliquots at −20°C. PBMCs (1.0–2.0×10
 <sup>7</sup> cells/mL in RPMI-1640) were stained with 5 μM CFSE in the same buffer (15 minutes, 37°C, in darkness) with occasional stirring. Staining was stopped by adding culture medium and washing three times with a 10× volume of PBS containing 3% fetal bovine serum. Centrifugation was carried out at 250 
 <italic>g</italic>/min for ten minutes. After discarding the supernatant, sediment was resuspended in culture medium (2×10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/mL). CFSE-labeled cells were cultured in duplicate under sterile conditions and stimulated with inactivated FMDV, at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> environment for 60 hours, with 10 μg/mL concanavalin A (ConA) as the polyclonal stimulator for the positive control. Negative control cultures were treated with 200 μL RPMI-1640. At the end of incubations, cells were washed twice with PBS and analyzed by FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).
