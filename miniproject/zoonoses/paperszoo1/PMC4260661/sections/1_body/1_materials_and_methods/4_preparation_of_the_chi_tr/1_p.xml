<p>Whole inactivated FMDV, strain AF/72, was from Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agriculture. FMDV was concentrated and purified following a standard sucrose density gradient centrifugation method
 <xref rid="b36-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and resuspended in NET buffer (0.1 M NaCl, 0.004 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA], 0.05 M tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane [Tris]; pH 8.0). One mL antigen suspension (5 mg/mL) was stirred and placed in vials for freeze-drying using a Kinetics Flexi-Dry™ system. Vials were frozen at −20°C and placed on the manifold at −55°C, with chamber pressure 5×10
 <sup>−3</sup> mm Hg, for 48 hours. Trehalose was freeze-dried using the lyophilized FMDV antigen method, for 48 hours.
