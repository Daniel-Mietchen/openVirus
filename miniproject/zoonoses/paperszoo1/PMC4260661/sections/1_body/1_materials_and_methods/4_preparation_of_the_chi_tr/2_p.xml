<p>Powder was made by mixing inactivated FMDV with trehalose at 1:100 ratio antigen to trehalose, then lyophilized and milled, using a microball mill (Pulverisette 7), in a dry box at &lt;15% relative humidity to reduce particle size for small quantities of powder.
 <xref rid="b37-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Vibrational milling was for 15 minutes with milling speeds of 450 rpm, repeated three times at intervals of 3 minutes per grinding cycle. Milled powders were sieved with 300, 125, and 45 μm sieves. Powders were sieved for 2 hours in tap mode, and particles in the 45 to 125 μm range were collected. Chitosan was milled using a cryomilling technique at 1,600 rpm for 20 minutes. The resulting powder was sieved as described above. The final formulation contained 500 μg FMDV-inactivated antigen blended in 50 mg trehalose and 1.4 mg chitosan. To minimize humidity effects, the powder blend was placed in vials for freeze-drying and vibrated by milling for 30 minutes to achieve uniformity.
