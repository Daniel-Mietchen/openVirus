<p>Serum and nasal swabs were collected at 3, 5, 7, and 10 dpv for antibody detection. Additionally, after challenge, saliva, nasal, and oropharyngeal fluid samples were collected for virus detection. Oropharyngeal fluid samples were collected at 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 days postchallenge (dpc) for analysis of viral RNA copies by real-time reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR. Immediately after collection, 0.2 mL oropharyngeal fluid was mixed with 0.3 mL lysis buffer (F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd) and stored at −70°C.</p>
