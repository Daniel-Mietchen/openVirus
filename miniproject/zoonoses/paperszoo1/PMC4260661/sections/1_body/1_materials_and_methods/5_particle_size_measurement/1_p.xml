<p>Double-sided adhesive tape was placed on an aluminum specimen holder, and a small amount of powder was added. Particles were sprinkled with approximately 10â€“20 nm gold powder, sputtered using a sputter coater device K650X (Emitech, Hailsham, UK), and analyzed with a JEOL scanning electron microscope (JSM-5600LV; Jeol, Tokyo, Japan). Measurement of mean size diameter of nanoparticles was based on a dynamic light scattering technique.</p>
