<p>Two pairs of specific primers were used to amplify P12A and 3C genes from pGEM-P12A and pGEM-3C plasmids maintained in our laboratory (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijn-9-5603">Table 1</xref>). P12A was digested using BamH I and EcoR I, and 3C was digested with EcoR I and Xbal I, and fragments were subcloned into the corresponding sites of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen
 <sup>Â®</sup>; Life Technologies) using T4 DNA ligase to generate recombinant plasmids pcDNA3.1/P12A3C. The sequence accuracy of recombinant plasmids was authenticated by specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), double digestion, and DNA sequencing.
