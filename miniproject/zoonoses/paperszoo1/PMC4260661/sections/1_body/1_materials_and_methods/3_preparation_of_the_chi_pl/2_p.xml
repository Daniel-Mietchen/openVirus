<p>To confirm the expression of structural proteins, purified pcDNA3.1/P12A3C was transfected into BHK-21 cells using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen
 <sup>®</sup>; Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 48-hour transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed for expression of FMDV P12A3C by indirect immunofluorescence test. Cell monolayers were cultured on cover slips and fixed in cold acetone (−20°C for 30 minutes). Samples were incubated with rabbit anti-FMDV serum (1:1,000 at 37°C for 30 minutes) in a humidified chamber and stained with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) for 1 hour at 37°C and then, observed microscopically. FMDV capsids were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in BHK-21 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 or P12A3C.
