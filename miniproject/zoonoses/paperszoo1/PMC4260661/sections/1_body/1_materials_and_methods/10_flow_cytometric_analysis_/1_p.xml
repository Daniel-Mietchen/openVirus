<p>A total of 100 μL heparinized blood was collected from immunized cattle at 10 dpv and incubated with anti-CD4-FITC and anti-CD8-PE or with the corresponding isotype controls (anti-CD8-PE and anti-IgG2a-PE, or anti-CD4-FITC and anti-IgG2a-FITC) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Added to the cells was 2 mL 1× FACS red blood cell lysis buffer (BD Biosciences), and then, cells were incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Centrifugation was carried out at 300 g/min for 5 minutes. After discarding the supernatant, pellets were washed three times with 2 mL PBS, to thoroughly resuspend cells. Centrifugation was carried out at 300 g/min for 5 minutes, discarding the supernatant. Cells were resuspended in 0.3 mL PBS, and fluorescence profiles analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) by System II software (Beckman Coulter Inc, Brea, CA, USA).</p>
