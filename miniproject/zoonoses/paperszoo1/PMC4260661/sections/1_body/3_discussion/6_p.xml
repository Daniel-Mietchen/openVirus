<p>In conclusion, we showed that although intranasal vaccination with FMDV antigen mediated by nanoparticles did not provide complete clinical or virological protection, it reduced virus excretion significantly, decreased disease severity, and delayed clinical symptoms. Moreover, IgA response after vaccination possibly protected against infection. The results of this study further showed that Chi-PLGA-DNA nanoparticles containing chitosan-coated PLGA-loaded FMDV DNA have potential as a nasal delivery system for vaccines.</p>
