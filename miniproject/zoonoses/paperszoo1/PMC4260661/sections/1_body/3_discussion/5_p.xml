<p>We also showed that vaccination with nanoparticles of Chi-Tre-Inactivated through an intranasal route induced systemic, mucosal sIgA responses and partial protection in cattle. To our knowledge, this is the first time that sIgA responses following nasal vaccination with FMDV nanoparticles of whole inactivated virus have been reported, although induction of systemic and mucosal immune responses by nasal vaccination with whole inactivated influenza virus has been reported in rats.

 <xref rid="b57-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> Our results indicated that animals in Gr-2 immunized three times by intranasal route with Chi-Tre-Inactivated nanoparticles on days 1, 4, and 7 had IgA responses that were slightly higher than the group immunized once with two intranasal doses of Chi-Tre-Inactivated nanoparticles (Gr-3) on 7 dpv and 10 dpv. Induction of IgA responses after vaccination and possible protection against challenge with FMDV requires further research.
