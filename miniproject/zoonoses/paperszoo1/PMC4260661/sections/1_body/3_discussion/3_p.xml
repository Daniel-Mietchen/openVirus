<p>To design the challenge regime, we used a 48-hour, direct-contact challenge to simulate an encounter with FMDV. For this, extrapolations were made to estimate challenges in natural conditions. In this study, cohabitation for more than 48 hours was adopted following our preliminary experiments on direct-contact challenge in cattle. Eight control cattle were housed with two infected donor cattle inoculated intradermally in the tongue at 48 hours before challenge with 0.2 mL cattle-passaged FMDV AF/72. After 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours of direct-contact challenge, donors were separated and killed. Of eight control cattle, only two groups (group 18 hours and group 24 hours) were clinically affected within 3–5 days after contact challenge, a delay of 2–3 days compared with the two donors, which showed clinical disease within 24–48 hours after inoculation (unpublished data). Thus, cohabitation for more than 24 hours was suitable for direct-contact challenge of cattle. In our severe challenge model, intranasal delivery with FMDV antigen mediated by nanoparticles did not fully protect cattle against clinical disease; however, it reduced disease severity and virus excretion, and delayed clinical symptoms compared with negative-control animals. Thus, this mucosal vaccine would be likely to reduce the amount of released virus shortly after vaccination and in a field situation, reduce the risk of viral transmission to other herds or vaccinated animals. Even better protection might be observed after less severe FMDV challenge, eg, following indirect exposure to virus in the field when animal movement restrictions are in place.
