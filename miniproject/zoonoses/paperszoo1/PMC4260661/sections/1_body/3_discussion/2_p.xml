<p>Early evidence that the respiratory tract

 <xref rid="b45-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> as the sites of primary replication of FMDV in cattle. Detailed description of previremic stages after experimental aerosol infection in cattle indicated that the nasopharynx is the most important site of primary infection, that infection initiates in the nasopharynx and is promptly followed by pulmonary infection, and that the onset of viremia is coincident with increased viral load in the lungs and decreased virus in the nasopharynx.

 <xref rid="b47-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Blocking the primary site of FMDV infection is critical to substantial decreased shedding, transmission, and severity of clinical signs in early FMD epidemics. Induction of FMDV-specific sIgA prevents attachment of viruses to the mucosa, preventing entry, and making blocking the primary site of FMDV infection suitable for mucosal defense. We determined the onset of the local anti-FMDV antibody response in nasal swabs, saliva, and in serum samples collected at days 1, 4, 7, and 10. Specific sIgA antibodies were initially detected at 4 dpv in nasal washes of cattle immunized through an intranasal route but not detected in cattle immunized through an intramuscular route with FMD inactivated vaccine. This result suggested that an intranasal route was superior to an intramuscular route for eliciting mucosal antibodies. All animals vaccinated through an intranasal route had low but detectable FMDV-specific neutralizing antibody responses on the day of challenge and a boost in titer after challenge (data not shown). Titers were significantly lower than neutralizing antibody titers (

However, after direct-contact challenge (10 dpv), three of four vaccinated animals in Gr-4 directly exposed to actively infected animals for a 2-day challenge period did not develop fever, were completely protected from clinical disease, and had enhanced nasal mucosal immune responses. The two cattle that were completely protected against contact challenge had the highest induced IgA responses after vaccination. Vaccination with cationic Chi-PLGA-DNA through the intranasal route resulted in better clinical protection of the inoculated cattle, and fewer contacted cattle became infected. In cattle, protection against challenge at 3 weeks after vaccination is correlated with induced virus-neutralizing antibodies caused by vaccination.
 <xref rid="b48-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> However, Golde et al
 <xref rid="b49-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> demonstrated that a commercially available, standard-dose vaccine formulation fully protected cattle against direct challenge with virus in as few as 7 days, with partial protection in 4 days. Further, animals challenged on day 4 had delayed and less severe disease and reduced virus in plasma and nasopharyngeal secretions. Our results demonstrated that intranasal delivery to cattle of FMDV antigen mediated by nanoparticles protected against clinical disease after vaccination against FMD as soon as 10 dpv. The reason for the difference in the start and duration of isotype-specific IgA and IgG responses and protection between our result and other studies might be attributed to the more severe challenge regime in our experiments.
