<p>Mucosal immunization with polymer-based vaccines by a nasal route is a substitute for conventional immunization that results in a major immunological defense: induction of sIgA that prevents the attachment of bacteria and viruses to the mucosa, preventing entry.
 <xref rid="b11-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Efforts are currently underway to produce FMDV vaccines that generate considerable sIgA and maintain high serum IgG titers through mucosal immunization. Our previous study
 <xref rid="b32-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> demonstrated that substantial cellular and humoral immune responses are elicited by a vaccine of cationic PLGA nanoparticles loaded with FMDV DNA. An intranasal route immunization strategy with this formulation could be developed as an FMDV mucosal vaccine for use in animals following additional testing in protection-challenge experiments and using an animal model that can test the efficacy in this type of challenge.
 <xref rid="b32-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> However, how immunization with cationic PLGA nanoparticles loaded with FMDV DNA induces protective immunity after challenge in cattle is not known. Since cattle are the most economically important livestock susceptible to FMD,
 <xref rid="b43-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> demonstrating the feasibility of intranasal delivery of an antigen mediated by nanoparticles in this species is necessary. Our unpublished data showed that cattle immunized with a dry powder nasal vaccine formulation of inactivated FMDV and a mucoadhesive compound developed an FMDV-specific sIgA response in nasal fluid and substantial lymphocyte proliferation. This study investigated these two delivery systems for reinforcing the mucosal immune response, systemic and cell immunity, and protection of cattle against direct-contact challenge at the primary portal for virus entry. We aimed to determine a suitable possible antigen carrier system for nasal administration.
