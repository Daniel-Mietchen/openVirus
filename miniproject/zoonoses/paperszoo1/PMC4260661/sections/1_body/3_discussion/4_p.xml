<p>Empty viral capsids contain the entire repertoire of immunogenic sites of intact virus, are antigenically similar to infectious virus, and are as immunogenic as virions in animals.

However, the construct lacked the coding regions for most other nonstructural proteins.

 <xref rid="b55-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> TEM showed that cells transfected with plasmid pcDNA3.1/P12A3C had detectable empty capsid structures that contained all or most epitopes and induced both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. We detected isotype-specific sIgA in nasal mucosa samples, and IgA and IgG responses in serum after vaccination of cattle at different time points. The isotype-specific sIgA responses in nasal secretion were initially detected at 4 dpv by an intranasal route, with cationic PLGA nanoparticles loaded with pcDNA3.1/P12A3C vaccine. Responses increased at 7 dpv and 10 dpv. Grubman et al
 <xref rid="b56-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> reported that the most rapid and long-lasting protection against FMDV challenge in swine was achieved by vaccination with antiviral interferon (IFN)a. Grubman et al found that swine inoculated with the type 1 IFN antiviral agent induced immediate protection, within 1 day, and lasted for 3â€“5 days. Consequently, to induce an earlier onset of protection and longer immunity duration, the combination of nanoparticle-based nasal vaccines and type 1 IFN could contribute to protection against FMDV infection. This strategy would reduce viral replication and shedding, decreasing the spread of disease and reducing the number of animals that have to be destroyed during an outbreak. Therefore, the induction of mucosal immunity by intranasal immunization requires further research.
