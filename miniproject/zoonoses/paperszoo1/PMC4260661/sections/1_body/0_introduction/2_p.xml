<p>Evidence suggests that mucosal immunity indicates good mucosal protection, efficiently preventing disease spread by destroying the causative agent directly at the respiratory or gastrointestinal mucosa, the sites that represent the main entrance for many pathogens.

This feature makes sIgA uniquely suitable for mucosal defense.
