<p>Plasmid DNA can be easily prepared in large scale, repeatedly administered, and is highly stable compared with proteins and other biological polymers.
 <xref rid="b26-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Plasmid DNA vaccines have become an attractive and potentially effective strategy for generating antigen-specific immune responses. Since DNA plasmid used to stimulate mucosal immunity can be easily degraded by DNases present at mucosal surfaces, DNA plasmids were adsorbed onto chitosan-coated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) particles and were shown to be protected against enzymatic degradation.
 <xref rid="b27-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Investigation of the immunogenicity of antigens encapsulated in PLGA nanoparticles showed that serum IgG and mucosal sIgA levels in samples from saliva and nasal fluids were significantly higher than levels elicited by naked plasmid, in mice administered chitosan-coated PLGA nanoparticles.

 <xref rid="b31-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> We reported previously substantial significant cellular and humoral immune responses elicited by cationic PLGA nanoparticles loaded with FMDV DNA vaccine. We demonstrated that intranasal delivery of nanoparticles loaded with FMDV DNA vaccine formulations encoding interleukin 6 (IL-6) as a molecular adjuvant enhanced protective immunity against FMDV.
