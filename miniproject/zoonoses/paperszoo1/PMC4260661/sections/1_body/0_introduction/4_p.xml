<p>Among possible delivery systems, nanocarriers prepared with biodegradable and mucoadhesive substances are promising because of their capacity to protect encapsulated bioactive macromolecules, such as peptides, proteins, or nucleic acid-based antigens.
 <xref rid="b19-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This encapsulation increases antigen residence time and controls the release of antigen over a prolonged time.
 <xref rid="b20-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This increased time raises the chance of uptake by the epithelium,
 <xref rid="b21-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and so nanocarriers have been widely investigated for their biological potential.
 <xref rid="b22-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="b23-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Based on these points, designing optimized vaccine nanocarriers is a promising strategy for nasal mucosal vaccination.
