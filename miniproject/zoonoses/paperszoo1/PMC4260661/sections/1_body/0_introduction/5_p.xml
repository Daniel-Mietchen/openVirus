<p>Previous study has shown that FMDV 3C proteinase processes the viral structural protein precursor, P1-2A, into the capsid proteins, VP0, VP3, and VP1, and the nonstructural peptide, 2A. These proteins then self-assemble to form empty icosahedral capsid particles that contain 60 copies of each protein.
 <xref rid="b24-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Immunological study has identified linear and conformational sites that are present on both empty capsids and virions, and antiserum raised against either form has the same serological specificity.
 <xref rid="b25-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Thus, the structural protein precursor, P1-2A, and the 3C protease of FMDV are desirable immune antigens for new vaccine development.
