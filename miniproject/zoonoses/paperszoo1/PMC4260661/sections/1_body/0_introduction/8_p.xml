<p>Knowledge about the protective efficacy of vaccines in a suitable large animal model is limited. Here, we studied the cattle vaccine potency of two kinds of nanoparticle delivery system: chitosan-coated PLGA nanoparticles loaded with plasmid DNA (Chi-PLGA-DNA); and chitosan-trehalose nanoparticles loaded with inactivated FMDV (Chi-Tre-Inactivated). We investigated the two intranasal delivery systems in reinforcing the mucosal immune response and in protecting cattle against direct-contact challenge at the primary portal for virus entry. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of these two intranasal delivery systems to induce early onset protection, and specific mucosal, systemic, and cell-mediated immunity; and to determine possible suitable antigen carrier systems for nasal administration.</p>
