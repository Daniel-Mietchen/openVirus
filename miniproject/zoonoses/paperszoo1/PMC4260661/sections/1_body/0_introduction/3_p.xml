<p>Intranasal vaccination is superior to vaccination at other sites for eliciting protection against respiratory pathogens. Immune responses generated in nasal-associated lymphoid tissue provide long-term protection.

 <xref rid="b13-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The nasal cavity is one of the most promising administration sites because of its reduced enzymatic activity compared with the oral route. The nasal cavity has a high availability of immunoreactive sites because the nasal epithelium layer consists of specialized antigen-sampling microfold cells that overlay the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue, resulting in antigen uptake and subsequent mucosal and systemic immune induction.

The residence time of antigens in the nasal cavity is limited because of mucociliary clearance, which results in a very small dose reaching antigen-presenting cells in the subepithelial region. Moreover, the uptake of antigens through the nasal epithelium is restricted because of the large size of antigens and the tolerogenic nature of the mucosal epithelium, which can complicate a robust immune response through multiple mechanisms.
