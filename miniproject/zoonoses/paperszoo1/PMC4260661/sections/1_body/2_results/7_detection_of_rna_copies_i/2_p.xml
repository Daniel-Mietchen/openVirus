<p>Although a higher copy number of RNA was detected in the nasal swabs of control animals than of the vaccinated, infected cattle, no significant differences (
 <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05) in RNA copy number were found at 1 and 3 dpc (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijn-9-5603">Figure 7</xref>). However, in nasal swab or oropharyngeal fluid samples collected from vaccinated, clinically infectious animals, viral RNA was detected up to 9 dpc, irrespective of vaccination status, whereas viral RNA was detected for longer. Viral RNA copy number increased in all infected cattle from 3 to 9 dpc, except for in a vaccinated animal with mild clinical signs (number 95) for which RNA copy number was decreased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijn-9-5603">Figure 7</xref>). The viral RNA copy number was detected by real-time PCR in infected cattle and was lower in saliva samples than in nasal and oropharyngeal fluid (data not shown).
