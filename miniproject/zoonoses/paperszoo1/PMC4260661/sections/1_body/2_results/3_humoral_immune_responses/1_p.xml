<p>Substantial antibody responses corresponding to sIgA production in nasal washes and IgA in serum were observed in groups immunized through an intranasal route (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-5603">Figure 4A and B</xref>), except for in the animals of Gr-5. FMDV-specific sIgA antibodies in nasal washes were initially detected at 4 dpv by an intranasal route with the two kinds of nanoparticles. The highest levels of sIgA expression were observed in nasal washes at 10 dpv, from animals of Gr-4, followed by animals of Gr-3 and animals of Gr-2 (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). No anti-FMDV sIgA antibodies were detected in nasal washes from the animals of of Gr-5 or Gr-1. The dynamic patterns of the IgA responses in serum samples were similar to responses from nasal wash samples, but the IgA responses in serum from animals of Gr-1 were higher than the animals of Gr-5 (
