<p>To examine systemic immune responses elicited using nanoparticles through an intranasal route, specific IgG antibodies were analyzed by LB-ELISA for serum samples collected at 7 and 10 dpv. Serum IgG (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-5603">Figure 4C</xref>) showed that nasal administration of nanoparticles elicited a low but detectable FMDV-specific systemic IgG antibody response at 10 dpv compared with administration of FMD inactivated vaccine through an intramuscular route. A significant IgG response was observed in animals (Gr-1) immunized through an intramuscular route with FMD inactivated vaccine (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). In addition, we observed low levels of IgG titers following nasal delivery of nanoparticle-encapsulated FMDV inactivated vaccine until 14 dpv (unpublished results). These results suggested that the intramuscular route might be superior to the nasal route for inducing systemic immune responses.
