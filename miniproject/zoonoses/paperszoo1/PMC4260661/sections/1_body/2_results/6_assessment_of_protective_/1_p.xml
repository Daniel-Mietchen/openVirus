<p>At 10 dpv, all animals were challenged for 48 hours with direct contact with two infected donor cattle per pen that had been inoculated intradermally at 48 hours prechallenge with 0.2 mL of cattle-passaged FMDV AF/72. Six needle-challenged donor cattle in three groups developed fever and severe clinical disease, with lesions on all four feet, within 1–2 days postinfection. The control animals (Gr-5) started exhibiting fever and the first vesicles appeared between 3–5 dpc. They showed lameness and developed severe vesicular lesions on the buccal mucosa and on all four feet by 7 dpc. In contrast, none of the animals vaccinated by the intramuscular route with inactivated vaccine (Gr-1) showed clinical signs of FMD during the course of the experiment and were fully protected up to 15 dpc. For animals vaccinated by intranasal route with nanoparticles of Chi-PLGA-DNA (Gr-4), only one (number 95) was clinically affected with mild signs (a lesion on the dental pad) at 9 dpc; this was a delay of 2–3 days compared with the clinically affected control group (Gr-5). We observed that three of four vaccinated animals in Gr-4 did not develop fever and were completely protected from clinical disease. Among animals vaccinated by the intranasal route three times with Chi-Tre-Inactivated nanoparticles (Gr-2), two of three vaccinated animals did not show clinical signs of FMD and were completely protected from direct challenge; only one animal (number 39) in this group showed a single lesion and increased rectal temperature. These symptoms were first apparent at 7 dpv, and this animal was considered protected since the disease did not spread systemically, as shown by the absence of viremia and lesions on the feet. Animals 52, 59, and 92 died from illnesses unrelated to FMDV. In contrast, four of five cattle vaccinated by the intranasal route with a single injection of Chi-Tre-Inactivated nanoparticles (Gr-3) were clinically infected; however, the degree of severity of disease was lower than in the control cattle (
