  <p>Proliferation of cattle PBMCs stimulated with FMDV.</p>
  <p>
   <bold>Notes:</bold> PBMCs isolated from five cattle 3 days after the third immunization were labeled with CFSE and stimulated in vitro with inactivated FMDV, ConA (positive control), or RPMI-1640, and plated in three replicate cultures for 60 hours. Data were acquired with FCM and analyzed with CellQuest™ software. For determination of proliferation of CFSE-stained cells, 10,000 events were captured. Data are expressed as mean percentages of proliferated cells ± SD (n=5).
