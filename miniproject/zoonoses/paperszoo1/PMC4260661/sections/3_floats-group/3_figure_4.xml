  <p>Humoral response induced in cattle, to FMDV antigen mediated by nanoparticles.</p>
  <p>
   <bold>Notes:</bold> FMDV-specific IgA and IgG of immunized cattle were detected by capture ELISA and liquid-phase blocking ELISA at 1, 4, 7, and 10 dpv. (
   <bold>A</bold>) sIgA antibody in nasal washes detected by capture ELISA at 1, 4, 7, and 10 dpv. (
   <bold>B</bold>) IgA antibody in sera detected at 1, 4, 7, and 10 dpv. Data are expressed as mean of optical density (OD) ± SD (n=5). (
   <bold>C</bold>) IgG antibody detection in sera detected by liquid-phase blocking ELISA at 7 and 10 dpv. Antibody titers are expressed as log10 of the reciprocal of the serum dilution giving 50% inhibition of the median absorbance recorded in the antigen control wells. The error bars represent standard deviations of the mean (n=5).
