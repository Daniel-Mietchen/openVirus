  <p>Flow cytometry for percentages of lymphocyte subpopulations between experimental and control groups.</p>
  <p>
   <bold>Notes:</bold> Heparinized blood from immunized cattle on 10 dpv were double-stained with anti-CD4-FITC and anti-CD8-PE, or incubated with the corresponding isotype controls (anti-CD8-PE and anti-IgG2a-PE, or anti-CD4-FITC and anti-IgG2a-FITC) for 30 minutes at room temperature. CD4
   <sup>+</sup> and CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells were analyzed as fluorescence profiles. Data are expressed as mean Â± SD (n=5).
  </p>
  <p>
   <bold>Abbreviations:</bold> dpv, days postvaccination; Ig, immunoglobulin; FITC, Fluorescein isothiocyanate; Gr, group; PE, phycoerythrin; SD, standard deviations.
