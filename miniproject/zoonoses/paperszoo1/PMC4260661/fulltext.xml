In this study, two kinds of nanoparticle-based nasal vaccines against type A FMD were designed: (1) chitosan-coated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) loaded with plasmid DNA (Chi-PLGA-DNA) and (2) chitosan-trehalose and inactivated foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) (Chi-Tre-Inactivated). Cattle were immunized by an intranasal route with nanoparticles and then challenged for 48 hours by direct contact with two infected donor cattle per pen. Donors were inoculated intradermally in the tongue 48 hours before challenge, with 0.2 mL cattle-passaged FMDV. Serological and mucosal antibody responses were evaluated, and virus excretion and the number of contact infections were quantified. FMDV-specific secretory immunoglobulin (Ig)A (sIgA) antibodies in nasal washes were initially detected at 4 days postvaccination (dpv) with two kinds of nanoparticles. The highest levels of sIgA expression were observed in nasal washes, at 10 dpv, from animals with Chi-PLGA-DNA nanoparticles, followed by animals immunized once by intranasal route with a double dose of Chi-Tre-Inactivated nanoparticles and animals immunized by intranasal route three times with Chi-Tre-Inactivated nanoparticles (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). FMDV-specific IgA antibodies in serum showed a similar pattern. All animals immunized by intranasal route developed low levels of detectable IgG in serum at 10 dpv. Following stimulation with FMDV, the highest levels of proliferation were observed in splenocytes harvested from Chi-PLGA-DNA-immunized animals, followed by proliferation of cells harvested from Chi-Tre-Inactivated nanoparticle-immunized animals (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Higher protection rates were associated with the highest sIgA antibody responses induced in the Chi-PLGA-DNA nanoparticle-immunized group. Only one animal was clinically affected with mild signs after 7 days of contact challenge, after a delay of 2&#x02013;3 days compared with the clinically affected negative-control group. Of the five animals directly challenged that were vaccinated by intranasal route with a double dose of Chi-Tre-Inactivated, four were clinically infected; however, the degree of severity of disease in this group was lower than in control cattle. The number of viral RNA copies in nasal swabs from the vaccinated, severely infected group was significantly higher than in swabs from the vaccinated, clinically protected group. These data suggested that intranasal delivery of Chi-PLGA-DNA nanoparticles resulted in higher levels of mucosal, systemic, and cell-mediated immunity than did of Chi-Tre-Inactivated nanoparticles. In conclusion, although intranasal delivery with FMDV antigen mediated by nanoparticles did not provide complete clinical protection, it reduced disease severity and virus excretion and delayed clinical symptoms. Chi-PLGA-DNA nanoparticle vaccines have potential as a nasal delivery system for vaccines.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>FMDV</kwd><kwd>nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>chitosan</kwd><kwd>trehalose</kwd><kwd>poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)</kwd><kwd>PLGA</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is one of the world&#x02019;s most important infectious diseases of livestock.<xref rid="b1-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Currently available FMD vaccines are mainly based on inactivated viral antigens formulated with various proprietary adjuvants.<xref rid="b2-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Despite tremendous progress in FMD vaccine production in recent years, the use of conventional and chemically inactivated FMD virus (FMDV) vaccines is associated with a number of concerns and deficiencies:<xref rid="b3-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> (1) large doses are required and induce only a short duration of immunity and a limited spectrum of antiviral immune responses; (2) unless highly purified, the vaccines do not allow differentiation between infected and vaccinated animals; (3) animals vaccinated with the current vaccines are generally protected against disease and induce serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies but have low stimulation of secretory IgA (sIgA) at respiratory mucosal sites and show sporadic CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes; and (4) the current vaccines requires 7&#x02013;14 days to induce protection.<xref rid="b6-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The time for protection to develop leaves an immunity gap, a window of susceptibility prior to induction of the adaptive immune response in which vaccinated animals are still susceptible to disease; (5) protection is short-lived, often requiring frequent revaccination, and manipulation of large amounts of virulent virus could result in viral dissemination; (6) vaccination does not prevent colonization of the upper respiratory tract and development of the carrier state.<xref rid="b7-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> To address these issues and to induce an earlier onset of protection and longer duration of immunity, different vaccine administration routes, vaccine delivery systems, and alternative approaches to conventional vaccines are urgently needed.</p><p>Evidence suggests that mucosal immunity indicates good mucosal protection, efficiently preventing disease spread by destroying the causative agent directly at the respiratory or gastrointestinal mucosa, the sites that represent the main entrance for many pathogens.<xref rid="b9-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In contrast to other antibody isotypes, sIgA in the oronasal cavities, esophageal-pharyngeal fluids, and mucosal epithelium is relatively resistant to enzymatic degradation and prevents the attachment of bacteria and virus to the mucosa, preventing entry. This feature makes sIgA uniquely suitable for mucosal defense.<xref rid="b11-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Intranasal vaccination is superior to vaccination at other sites for eliciting protection against respiratory pathogens. Immune responses generated in nasal-associated lymphoid tissue provide long-term protection.<xref rid="b12-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The nasal cavity is one of the most promising administration sites because of its reduced enzymatic activity compared with the oral route. The nasal cavity has a high availability of immunoreactive sites because the nasal epithelium layer consists of specialized antigen-sampling microfold cells that overlay the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue, resulting in antigen uptake and subsequent mucosal and systemic immune induction.<xref rid="b14-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In addition to these advantages, the nasal route offers simpler and more cost-effective protocols for vaccination, with improved patient compliance.<xref rid="b16-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> However, despite these encouraging characteristics, free antigens do not usually elicit protective responses following intranasal administration. The residence time of antigens in the nasal cavity is limited because of mucociliary clearance, which results in a very small dose reaching antigen-presenting cells in the subepithelial region. Moreover, the uptake of antigens through the nasal epithelium is restricted because of the large size of antigens and the tolerogenic nature of the mucosal epithelium, which can complicate a robust immune response through multiple mechanisms.<xref rid="b17-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> For this reason, mucosal vaccine adjuvants and new delivery systems are necessary to improve the performance of existing and future antigens.</p><p>Among possible delivery systems, nanocarriers prepared with biodegradable and mucoadhesive substances are promising because of their capacity to protect encapsulated bioactive macromolecules, such as peptides, proteins, or nucleic acid-based antigens.<xref rid="b19-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This encapsulation increases antigen residence time and controls the release of antigen over a prolonged time.<xref rid="b20-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This increased time raises the chance of uptake by the epithelium,<xref rid="b21-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and so nanocarriers have been widely investigated for their biological potential.<xref rid="b22-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Based on these points, designing optimized vaccine nanocarriers is a promising strategy for nasal mucosal vaccination.</p><p>Previous study has shown that FMDV 3C proteinase processes the viral structural protein precursor, P1-2A, into the capsid proteins, VP0, VP3, and VP1, and the nonstructural peptide, 2A. These proteins then self-assemble to form empty icosahedral capsid particles that contain 60 copies of each protein.<xref rid="b24-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Immunological study has identified linear and conformational sites that are present on both empty capsids and virions, and antiserum raised against either form has the same serological specificity.<xref rid="b25-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Thus, the structural protein precursor, P1-2A, and the 3C protease of FMDV are desirable immune antigens for new vaccine development.</p><p>Plasmid DNA can be easily prepared in large scale, repeatedly administered, and is highly stable compared with proteins and other biological polymers.<xref rid="b26-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Plasmid DNA vaccines have become an attractive and potentially effective strategy for generating antigen-specific immune responses. Since DNA plasmid used to stimulate mucosal immunity can be easily degraded by DNases present at mucosal surfaces, DNA plasmids were adsorbed onto chitosan-coated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) particles and were shown to be protected against enzymatic degradation.<xref rid="b27-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Investigation of the immunogenicity of antigens encapsulated in PLGA nanoparticles showed that serum IgG and mucosal sIgA levels in samples from saliva and nasal fluids were significantly higher than levels elicited by naked plasmid, in mice administered chitosan-coated PLGA nanoparticles.<xref rid="b28-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b31-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> We reported previously substantial significant cellular and humoral immune responses elicited by cationic PLGA nanoparticles loaded with FMDV DNA vaccine. We demonstrated that intranasal delivery of nanoparticles loaded with FMDV DNA vaccine formulations encoding interleukin 6 (IL-6) as a molecular adjuvant enhanced protective immunity against FMDV.<xref rid="b32-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>Other reports obtained potent nasal mucosal and systemic immune responses using intranasal delivery of whole, inactivated influenza vaccine powder formulations. Powder-formulated vaccine elicited a significant serum antibody response in rats that was at least as strong as the response from liquid vaccine administered by intranasal route or by intramuscular injection.<xref rid="b33-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b34-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> In these reports, a mouse model was used to assess vaccine efficacy mediated by nanoparticle delivery by intranasal delivery, against influenza virus, parainfluenza, hepatitis B, and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> pathogens.</p><p>Knowledge about the protective efficacy of vaccines in a suitable large animal model is limited. Here, we studied the cattle vaccine potency of two kinds of nanoparticle delivery system: chitosan-coated PLGA nanoparticles loaded with plasmid DNA (Chi-PLGA-DNA); and chitosan-trehalose nanoparticles loaded with inactivated FMDV (Chi-Tre-Inactivated). We investigated the two intranasal delivery systems in reinforcing the mucosal immune response and in protecting cattle against direct-contact challenge at the primary portal for virus entry. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of these two intranasal delivery systems to induce early onset protection, and specific mucosal, systemic, and cell-mediated immunity; and to determine possible suitable antigen carrier systems for nasal administration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>D-(+)-trehalose and chitosan were from Sigma-Aldrich Corp (St Louis, MO, USA).

These symptoms were first apparent at 7 dpv, and this animal was considered protected since the disease did not spread systemically, as shown by the absence of viremia and lesions on the feet.

Our previous study<xref rid="b32-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> demonstrated that substantial cellular and humoral immune responses are elicited by a vaccine of cationic PLGA nanoparticles loaded with FMDV DNA. An intranasal route immunization strategy with this formulation could be developed as an FMDV mucosal vaccine for use in animals following additional testing in protection-challenge experiments and using an animal model that can test the efficacy in this type of challenge.<xref rid="b32-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> However, how immunization with cationic PLGA nanoparticles loaded with FMDV DNA induces protective immunity after challenge in cattle is not known. Since cattle are the most economically important livestock susceptible to FMD,<xref rid="b43-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> demonstrating the feasibility of intranasal delivery of an antigen mediated by nanoparticles in this species is necessary. Our unpublished data showed that cattle immunized with a dry powder nasal vaccine formulation of inactivated FMDV and a mucoadhesive compound developed an FMDV-specific sIgA response in nasal fluid and substantial lymphocyte proliferation. This study investigated these two delivery systems for reinforcing the mucosal immune response, systemic and cell immunity, and protection of cattle against direct-contact challenge at the primary portal for virus entry. We aimed to determine a suitable possible antigen carrier system for nasal administration.</p><p>Early evidence that the respiratory tract<xref rid="b43-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> was the natural route of infection implicated the nasal cavity<xref rid="b44-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> or lungs<xref rid="b45-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> as the sites of primary replication of FMDV in cattle. Detailed description of previremic stages after experimental aerosol infection in cattle indicated that the nasopharynx is the most important site of primary infection, that infection initiates in the nasopharynx and is promptly followed by pulmonary infection, and that the onset of viremia is coincident with increased viral load in the lungs and decreased virus in the nasopharynx.<xref rid="b46-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="b47-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Blocking the primary site of FMDV infection is critical to substantial decreased shedding, transmission, and severity of clinical signs in early FMD epidemics. Induction of FMDV-specific sIgA prevents attachment of viruses to the mucosa, preventing entry, and making blocking the primary site of FMDV infection suitable for mucosal defense. We determined the onset of the local anti-FMDV antibody response in nasal swabs, saliva, and in serum samples collected at days 1, 4, 7, and 10. Specific sIgA antibodies were initially detected at 4 dpv in nasal washes of cattle immunized through an intranasal route but not detected in cattle immunized through an intramuscular route with FMD inactivated vaccine. This result suggested that an intranasal route was superior to an intramuscular route for eliciting mucosal antibodies. All animals vaccinated through an intranasal route had low but detectable FMDV-specific neutralizing antibody responses on the day of challenge and a boost in titer after challenge (data not shown). Titers were significantly lower than neutralizing antibody titers (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) in the Gr-1 group immunized by an intramuscular route. However, after direct-contact challenge (10 dpv), three of four vaccinated animals in Gr-4 directly exposed to actively infected animals for a 2-day challenge period did not develop fever, were completely protected from clinical disease, and had enhanced nasal mucosal immune responses. The two cattle that were completely protected against contact challenge had the highest induced IgA responses after vaccination. Vaccination with cationic Chi-PLGA-DNA through the intranasal route resulted in better clinical protection of the inoculated cattle, and fewer contacted cattle became infected. In cattle, protection against challenge at 3 weeks after vaccination is correlated with induced virus-neutralizing antibodies caused by vaccination.<xref rid="b48-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> However, Golde et al<xref rid="b49-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> demonstrated that a commercially available, standard-dose vaccine formulation fully protected cattle against direct challenge with virus in as few as 7 days, with partial protection in 4 days. Further, animals challenged on day 4 had delayed and less severe disease and reduced virus in plasma and nasopharyngeal secretions. Our results demonstrated that intranasal delivery to cattle of FMDV antigen mediated by nanoparticles protected against clinical disease after vaccination against FMD as soon as 10 dpv. The reason for the difference in the start and duration of isotype-specific IgA and IgG responses and protection between our result and other studies might be attributed to the more severe challenge regime in our experiments.</p><p>To design the challenge regime, we used a 48-hour, direct-contact challenge to simulate an encounter with FMDV. For this, extrapolations were made to estimate challenges in natural conditions. In this study, cohabitation for more than 48 hours was adopted following our preliminary experiments on direct-contact challenge in cattle. Eight control cattle were housed with two infected donor cattle inoculated intradermally in the tongue at 48 hours before challenge with 0.2 mL cattle-passaged FMDV AF/72. After 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours of direct-contact challenge, donors were separated and killed. Of eight control cattle, only two groups (group 18 hours and group 24 hours) were clinically affected within 3&#x02013;5 days after contact challenge, a delay of 2&#x02013;3 days compared with the two donors, which showed clinical disease within 24&#x02013;48 hours after inoculation (unpublished data). Thus, cohabitation for more than 24 hours was suitable for direct-contact challenge of cattle. In our severe challenge model, intranasal delivery with FMDV antigen mediated by nanoparticles did not fully protect cattle against clinical disease; however, it reduced disease severity and virus excretion, and delayed clinical symptoms compared with negative-control animals. Thus, this mucosal vaccine would be likely to reduce the amount of released virus shortly after vaccination and in a field situation, reduce the risk of viral transmission to other herds or vaccinated animals. Even better protection might be observed after less severe FMDV challenge, eg, following indirect exposure to virus in the field when animal movement restrictions are in place.<xref rid="b50-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="b51-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></p><p>Empty viral capsids contain the entire repertoire of immunogenic sites of intact virus, are antigenically similar to infectious virus, and are as immunogenic as virions in animals.<xref rid="b52-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="b53-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> Using recombinant DNA technology we produced an FMD construct, pcDNA3.1/P12A3C, that included the coding region for the viral structural protein precursor P1-2A and 3C proteinase, the nonstructural protein required for capsid precursor processing and assembly.

We detected isotype-specific sIgA in nasal mucosa samples, and IgA and IgG responses in serum after vaccination of cattle at different time points. The isotype-specific sIgA responses in nasal secretion were initially detected at 4 dpv by an intranasal route, with cationic PLGA nanoparticles loaded with pcDNA3.1/P12A3C vaccine. Responses increased at 7 dpv and 10 dpv. Grubman et al<xref rid="b56-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> reported that the most rapid and long-lasting protection against FMDV challenge in swine was achieved by vaccination with antiviral interferon (IFN)a. Grubman et al found that swine inoculated with the type 1 IFN antiviral agent induced immediate protection, within 1 day, and lasted for 3&#x02013;5 days. Consequently, to induce an earlier onset of protection and longer immunity duration, the combination of nanoparticle-based nasal vaccines and type 1 IFN could contribute to protection against FMDV infection. This strategy would reduce viral replication and shedding, decreasing the spread of disease and reducing the number of animals that have to be destroyed during an outbreak. Therefore, the induction of mucosal immunity by intranasal immunization requires further research.</p><p>We also showed that vaccination with nanoparticles of Chi-Tre-Inactivated through an intranasal route induced systemic, mucosal sIgA responses and partial protection in cattle. To our knowledge, this is the first time that sIgA responses following nasal vaccination with FMDV nanoparticles of whole inactivated virus have been reported, although induction of systemic and mucosal immune responses by nasal vaccination with whole inactivated influenza virus has been reported in rats.<xref rid="b34-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="b57-ijn-9-5603" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> Our results indicated that animals in Gr-2 immunized three times by intranasal route with Chi-Tre-Inactivated nanoparticles on days 1, 4, and 7 had IgA responses that were slightly higher than the group immunized once with two intranasal doses of Chi-Tre-Inactivated nanoparticles (Gr-3) on 7 dpv and 10 dpv. Induction of IgA responses after vaccination and possible protection against challenge with FMDV requires further research.</p><p>In conclusion, we showed that although intranasal vaccination with FMDV antigen mediated by nanoparticles did not provide complete clinical or virological protection, it reduced virus excretion significantly, decreased disease severity, and delayed clinical symptoms. Moreover, IgA response after vaccination possibly protected against infection. The results of this study further showed that Chi-PLGA-DNA nanoparticles containing chitosan-coated PLGA-loaded FMDV DNA have potential as a nasal delivery system for vaccines.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the Chinese &#x0201c;863&#x0201d; National Programs for High Technology Research and Development (grant number 2011AA10A211), the European Commission&#x02019;s Seventh Framework Programme (grant number 226556), the International Science and Technology Cooperation Program of Gansu Province (grant number 1011WCGA160), the National Pig Industrial System (CARS-36-068), and the Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest (201203039).

After challenge, the donors were separated and killed, and unvaccinated cattle were removed and housed separately. The 24 vaccinated cattle were monitored daily for clinical signs of FMD after contact challenge. Signs included occurrence of vesicles, lameness, increased salivation, and fever (rectal temperature &#x0003e;39.5&#x000b0;C).
