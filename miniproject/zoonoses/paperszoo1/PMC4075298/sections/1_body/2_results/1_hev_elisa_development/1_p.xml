<p>As described in Material and Methods, several protocols were tested to set up an immunoassay based on HEV Gt3 recombinant antigen. Final performance of the developed HEV Gt3 immunoassay was assessed using sera of pigs experimentally infected with HEV Gt3, in comparison with a commercially available HEV Ab-ELISA (Axiom). The results showed slight differences in the kinetics of anti-HEV antibody detection, but seroconversion of HEV-infected pigs was detected with both detection methods (
