<p>The higher specificity of the Gt1 assay (0.94, 95%CI=0.92-0.96) was apparently achieved at the cost of a modest sensitivity (0.58, 95%CI=0.55-0.62). CVI Gt3 and Axiom had a similar specificity (0.89, 95%CI=0.88-0.90), but the estimated sensitivity of Axiom (0.93, 95%CI=0.90-0.94) was higher than that of CVI Gt3 (0.84, 95%CI=0.81-0.86).</p>
