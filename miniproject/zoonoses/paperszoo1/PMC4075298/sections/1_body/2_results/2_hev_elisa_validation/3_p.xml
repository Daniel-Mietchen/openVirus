<p>The estimated sensitivity and specificity of each of the three tests are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t03">Table 3</xref>, together with a 95% confidence interval (95%CI, credible interval). These results correspond to a threshold value of 20 for the CVI Gt3 assay. For threshold values of 23 and 25, similar values for estimated sensitivity and specificity were found for the Axiom and Gt1 assays. For a threshold value of 20, the CVI Gt3 assay showed the highest sensitivity. For threshold values of 20, 23, and 25, the CVI Gt3 assay showed similar specificities. For the CVI Gt3 immunoassay, the best results were obtained for the threshold value of 20; therefore, this value was chosen to be used as the primary choice cutoff value for the test.
