<p>The estimated median prevalence was 0.95 (95%CI=0.90-0.97). The estimate for standard deviation 
 <italic>Ïƒ</italic> is 0.87 (95%CI=0.66-1.03), which implies considerable variation among batches in prevalence: the odds ratio of two batches can be as high as 11, e.g., odds ratio 0.9/(1-0.9) 
 <italic>vs</italic> 0.45/(1-0.45) for prevalences of 0.90 and 0.45.
