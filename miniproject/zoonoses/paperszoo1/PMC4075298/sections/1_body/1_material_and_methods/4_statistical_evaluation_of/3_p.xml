<p>Data were collected in relatively small batches from different producers. In the statistical model, each batch has its own true prevalence, i.e., probability for a true seropositive, and these different prevalences are assumed to be sampled from a distribution of prevalence values. The probabilistic behavior of the tests, in relation to true antibody status, is modeled according to Engel et al. (
 <xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The model accounts for possible dependence between tests for true seropositives and true seronegatives.
