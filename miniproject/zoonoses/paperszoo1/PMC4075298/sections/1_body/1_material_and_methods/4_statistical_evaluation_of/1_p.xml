<p>The pig sera obtained at slaughter were used for a Bayesian evaluation of the accuracy of the three ELISA tests. In a Bayesian analysis two sources of information are combined: prior information about prevalence, test sensitivity, and test specificity, and new observations, which in this case were the ELISA test results. The prior information attaches a probability to each possible value of a parameter in the model, e.g., an unknown test sensitivity. Consequently, the prior information takes the form of a probability distribution for this sensitivity. This prior distribution is combined with the data into a posterior distribution, which is an up-to-date summary of all available information about the sensitivity. The median of this posterior distribution is presented as an estimate and the 95% range as a Bayesian confidence interval (credible interval) for the sensitivity.</p>
