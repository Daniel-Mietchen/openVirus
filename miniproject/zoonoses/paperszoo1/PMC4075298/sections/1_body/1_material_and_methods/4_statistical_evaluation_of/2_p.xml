<p>The statistical model distinguishes between the test results and the true antibody status of the sera. Because the tests are fallible, observed test results and unobserved true antibody status are not necessarily the same. The test results of the three ELISA tests were analyzed with a latent class model, where the true-antibody status (seropositive or seronegative) represents the latent classes.</p>
