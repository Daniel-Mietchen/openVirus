<p>Prior distributions were based on literature and expert opinion. For assays based on a Gt3 antigen, prior emphasis was on a slightly higher specificity. For assays using more isotypes of antibodies in the conjugate, prior emphasis was on slightly higher sensitivity. The prior median and 95% ranges for sensitivity and specificity are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref>. The prior range for median prevalence was chosen from 0.5 to 0.9. Further (technical) details about model and priors may be found in Supplementary Material.
