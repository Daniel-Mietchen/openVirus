<p>For coating onto polystyrene ELISA plates, the optimal dilution of the recombinant baculoprotein stock (0.3 µg/mL) was 1:1500 using a coating buffer (0.05 M sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.65). In the final procedure, 100 µL diluted baculoprotein was dispensed to each well of a polystyrene ELISA plate (Costar 9018, Greiner Bio-one, Alphen a/d Rijn, The Netherlands). Plates were covered with adhesive foil (plate sealer) and incubated overnight at room temperature. Before usage, ELISA plate(s) were washed three times using tap water supplemented with 0.05% Tween 80 in an ELISA plate washer. A volume of 100 µL StabilCoat
 <sup>¯</sup> (Diarect AG, Freiburg, Germany) (diluted 1:1 with PBS) was dispensed to all wells and incubated 30 min at room temperature. After removal of StabilCoat
 <sup>¯</sup>, ELISA plates were dried for 3 h at 37°C and stored at 4°C until use. In the final test procedure, sera were diluted 1:5 in serum dilution buffer: 10% bovine serum albumin+10% Elk+1% Tergitol (dissolved in PBS) added to low salt buffer (2.5 mL 10% Tween 80 in 500 mL PBS). One hundred microliters of diluted test serum was dispensed to the wells and, after sealing, plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After this first incubation, plates were washed three times using tap water supplemented with 0.05% Tween 80 in an ELISA plate washer. Anti-swine IgM HRP-conjugated monoclonal antibody (CVI 28.4.1.) was diluted 1:2000 and the anti-swine L-chain HRP-conjugated monoclonal antibody (CVI 27.2.1.) was diluted 1:1000 in conjugate buffer (5% fetal calf serum) in high salt buffer (14.5 g NaCl in 500 mL PBS, 2.5 mL 10% Tween 80). For the second incubation, 100 µL of the diluted conjugate solution was dispensed to each well. Plates were covered with a plate sealer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, plates were washed three times with tap water supplemented with 0.05% Tween 80 using an ELISA plate washer, and 100 µL ready-to-use 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate was dispensed to each well and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 µL 0.5 M sulfuric acid to all wells. The color intensity was measured at 450 nm within 15 min after color development had been stopped.
