<p>Two different HEV immunoassays were used for comparison, a commercially available immunoassay and an HEV immunoassay that was developed in-house. The commercially available HEV Ab-ELISA kit (Axiom, Germany) is a double-antigen sandwich ELISA based on a recombinant Burmese HEV Gt1 capsid protein derivative covering the carboxy-terminal amino acid residues 394-606. Due to its test principle, it can detect HEV-specific antibodies independently of the host species and immunoglobulin class. The manufacturer's instructions were strictly adhered to in the assay, including the recommended thresholds for definition of a positive serum. The in-house developed HEV immunoassay is a previously standardized in-house ELISA based on a purified 55-kDa truncated recombinant capsid protein of the Sar-55 strain of human HEV Gt1 (Gt1 assay). Based on its test principles, this immunoassay detects HEV-specific IgG in pig sera. This immunoassay was performed as described by Martin et al. (

Test samples with absorbances equal to or greater than the cutoff value (0.300) were considered to be positive for anti-HEV IgG. In all immunoassays, sera of HEV naive and HEV infected swine were used as negative and positive controls in each plate.
