<p>A recombinant expression product of HEV (ORF-2, Gt3, Subtype 3a) was produced in a baculovirus expression system as previously described (
 <xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). A synthetic gene encoding 497 amino acids of swine Gt3 HEV ORF-2, Subtype 3a, was engineered using the amino acid sequence published in GenBank AY585859 (Geneart, Germany). The part of the HEV capsid encoded by this gene includes the motifs needed for self-assembly into empty virus-like particles when expressed in Sf9 insect cells. Codon usage and percentage G and C nucleotide content were optimized for expression in Sf9 
 <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> insect cells and a Kozak sequence was introduced upstream of the ATG. The recombinant baculovirus was obtained using the Bac-to-Bac
 <sup>¯</sup> Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sf9 insect cells adapted to a serum-free medium (Invitrogen) were grown at 27°C in SF900 serum-free medium supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and fungizone (Invitrogen). Viral stocks were prepared on Sf9 cells, after two plaque purifications also on Sf9 cells.
