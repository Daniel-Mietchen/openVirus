<p>For the test principle, recombinant protein was coated onto polystyrene ELISA plates. Recombinant protein was dissolved 1:1500 in coating buffer (see ELISA procedures), and incubated with the test serum and HEV-specific swine antibodies were detected using anti-porcine anti-IgG and IgM conjugates. Antibodies present in the test serum bound to the antigen during the first incubation, and during the second incubation, the bound antibodies were detected using anti-swine monoclonal antibodies against IgM and against the L-chain conjugated to the enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP, see ELISA procedures). Bound conjugate was visualized by adding a substrate chromogen. Wells containing samples negative for HEV antibodies remained colorless. To optimize the ELISA, different concentrations of the purified recombinant protein were tested using a series of swine sera from an experimental infection. Swine sera were tested in different dilutions to establish the optimal dilution for test sera. A primary cutoff of the assay was established using sera from two cesarean-delivered colostrum-deprived, specific pathogen-free pigs. For primary estimation of sensitivity and specificity of the assay, sets of sera were used from pigs experimentally infected with HEV Gt3 (
