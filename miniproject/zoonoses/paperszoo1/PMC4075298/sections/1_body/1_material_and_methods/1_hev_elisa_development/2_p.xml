<p>Protein expression in the culture medium and cell lysate was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using negative and positive sera from swine. Sf9 cells were infected with the recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of five. The culture medium was harvested 5 days after infection. Cells and debris were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 11,000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 3 h in a Beckman SW28 rotor. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 4 mL PBS and held overnight at 4°C. The sample was then mixed with 0.44 g/mL CsCl and centrifuged at 15,000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 18 h at 4°C in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor. Fractions of 0.5 mL were collected from the bottom of each gradient and fraction densities were determined using an Abbe refractometer (Bioblock, France) and stored at a concentration of 0.3 μg/mL.
