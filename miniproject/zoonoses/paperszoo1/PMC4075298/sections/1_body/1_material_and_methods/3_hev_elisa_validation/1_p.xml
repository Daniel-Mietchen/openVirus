<p>For further validation of the assay and to definitely set its cutoff value, a batch of 1100 pig sera was used. The sera were obtained at slaughter from pigs from at least 550 pig farms (maximum two pigs per farm) in The Netherlands. Potential HEV infections in these pigs were of Gt3. To date, only HEV Gt3 infections have been found in pigs in The Netherlands. All pig sera were tested using the developed HEV Gt3 assay and the two comparison serologic assays based on HEV Gt1 antigens.</p>
