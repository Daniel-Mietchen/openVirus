<p>In the statistical model, it was assumed that there is an interdependency between assays for true seropositives and independence for true seronegatives. Without the last assumption, i.e., allowing for dependence between assays for true seronegatives as well, quite unrealistic results were found for the specificity of all three assays. Quite likely, this is connected to identification problems that influenced the prevalence structure of batches in the data set. Such identification problems are not specific to the statistical approach used in this article, and are potential problems shared by all methods used for diagnostic test evaluation in the absence of a gold standard. For true positives, dependence is likely, since all three immunoassays are based on more or less the same principle. Moreover, based on previous observations, it has been postulated repeatedly that it is likely that there is just one single serotype of mammalian HEV (
