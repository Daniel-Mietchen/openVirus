<p>To establish an HEV antibody assay for pigs, where HEV Gt3 is the predominant genotype in Europe and North America, an HEV antibody assay was developed based on the HEV Gt3 antigen. Since there is increasing evidence that human autochthonous hepatitis E cases are linked to swine reservoirs (
 <xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), HEV antibody testing in swine is indicated to estimate HEV prevalence. For this purpose, a validated HEV antibody assay for Europe, preferably HEV Gt3 based, is needed. Therefore, a recombinant expression product of HEV (ORF-2, Gt3, Subtype 3a) was chosen as antigen. For sensitivity testing of HEV antibody development in the acute phase of the infection, a conjugate including HEV-specific IgG and IgM was used. The effective performance of this format was tested using a set of serum samples obtained from experimentally infected pigs.
