<p>Validation of HEV antibody assays is hampered by the fact that a gold standard is not available. To get around this problem, different approaches have been used including Western blot and Bayesian analyses (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In this study, posterior Bayesian statistical inference was used for final validation and definitive choice of the cutoff value. Through a combined approach of testing, using swine sera obtained from experimental infections and from the field, and comparison of immunoassays using Bayesian evaluation of the accuracy of the assays, an adequate validation of the immunoassay could be established.
