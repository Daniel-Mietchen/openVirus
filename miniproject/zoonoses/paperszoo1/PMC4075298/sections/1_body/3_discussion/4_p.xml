<p>To better understand HEV transmission in autochtho-nous HEV infections in humans, HEV surveillance in pigs is needed. Using an accurately validated, sensitive HEV antibody assay based on the predominant antigen will result in more reliable surveillance data. The HEV antibody assay developed and validated in this study is suitable for detection of HEV-specific antibodies in swine reservoirs and can contribute to reliable estimates of HEV prevalence in swine in different regions.</p>
