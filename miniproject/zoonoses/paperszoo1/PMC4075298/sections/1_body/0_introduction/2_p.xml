<p>Despite the considerable genetic variability observed between genotypes, to date only one serotype has been identified. HEV Gt3 infections have been reported to be endemic in pigs in Europe (
 <xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and in North and South America (
 <xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). HEV infections in humans often run a subclinical course but can also cause serious acute hepatitis. The disease is characterized by a self-limiting jaundice of varying severity, which is hard to distinguish from hepatitis of other viral origin, and is often accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as fever, headache, and pain in the upper abdomen. In pigs naturally infected with HEV Gt3, microscopic lesions of hepatitis are observed, but overt clinical symptoms in pigs have not been reported. Autochthonous HEV Gt3 and Gt4 infections in humans may be zoonotic and may originate from swine reservoirs. For this reason, it is suggested that the study of HEV dynamics in pig populations be done in Europe and the Americas.
