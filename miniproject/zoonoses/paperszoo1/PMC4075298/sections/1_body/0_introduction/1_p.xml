<p>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a small nonenveloped RNA virus of approximately 7.2 kb, and has been classified within the family Hepeviridae, genus 
 <italic>Hepevirus</italic>. Four mammalian genotypes (Gt1-4) were identified in the 1990s, and avian HEV had been identified before that (

 <xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Gt1 and Gt2 are found exclusively in humans and are responsible for large waterborne epidemics and sporadic cases in endemic regions (Asia, India, Africa, and Mexico) (
 <xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Gt1 and Gt2 can be divided further into five (a-e) and two (a and b) subtypes, respectively. In contrast, Gt3 and Gt4 are responsible for sporadic cases in humans and are widespread in animals. Especially for HEV Gt3, it is assumed that zoonotic transmission plays an important role in human infections (
 <xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Genotypes 3 and 4 seem more variable and can be divided into 10 (a-j) and 7 (a-g) subgenotypes, respectively (
 <xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).
