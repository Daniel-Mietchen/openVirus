<p>For swine serology, several HEV antibody assays have been developed, mainly based on HEV Gt1 antigens, in particular open reading frame (ORF)-2 proteins or peptides. HEV Gt3 antibodies have been shown to cross-react with Gt1 antigens (
 <xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), but, given the high variability of strains, homologous assays may perform better. Since HEV Gt3 is the predominant genotype in pigs in Europe and North America, in this study an HEV antibody assay for pigs was developed based on the HEV Gt3 antigen. Due to the fact that there is no gold standard available, in-house developed or commercially available HEV immunoassays often have not been validated properly. For final validation and a definite choice for cutoff of the developed HEV Gt3 assay in this study, posterior Bayesian statistical inference was used.
