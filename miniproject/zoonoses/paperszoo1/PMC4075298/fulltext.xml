<italic>Hepevirus</italic>. HEV genotype 3 (Gt3) infections are endemic in pigs in
Western Europe and in North and South America and cause zoonotic infections in
humans. Several serological assays to detect HEV antibodies in pigs have been
developed, at first mainly based on HEV genotype 1 (Gt1) antigens. To develop a
sensitive HEV Gt3 ELISA, a recombinant baculovirus expression product of HEV Gt3 open
reading frame-2 was produced and coated onto polystyrene ELISA plates. After
incubation of porcine sera, bound HEV antibodies were detected with anti-porcine
anti-IgG and anti-IgM conjugates. For primary estimation of sensitivity and
specificity of the assay, sets of sera were used from pigs experimentally infected
with HEV Gt3. For further validation of the assay and to set the cutoff value, a
batch of 1100 pig sera was used. All pig sera were tested using the developed HEV Gt3
assay and two other serologic assays based on HEV Gt1 antigens. Since there is no
gold standard available for HEV antibody testing, further validation and a definite
setting of the cutoff of the developed HEV Gt3 assay were performed using a
statistical approach based on Bayes' theorem. The developed and validated HEV
antibody assay showed effective detection of HEV-specific antibodies. This assay can
contribute to an improved detection of HEV antibodies and enable more reliable
estimates of the prevalence of HEV Gt3 in swine in different regions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Hepatitis E virus</kwd><kwd>Zoonosis</kwd><kwd>Swine</kwd><kwd>ELISA</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="3"/><ref-count count="14"/><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a small nonenveloped RNA virus of approximately 7.2 kb, and
has been classified within the family Hepeviridae, genus <italic>Hepevirus</italic>.
Four mammalian genotypes (Gt1-4) were identified in the 1990s, and avian HEV had been
identified before that (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). More recently, HEVs
have also been identified in rats, rabbits, ferrets, bats, and trout (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Gt1 and Gt2 are found exclusively in humans and
are responsible for large waterborne epidemics and sporadic cases in endemic regions
(Asia, India, Africa, and Mexico) (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Gt1 and
Gt2 can be divided further into five (a-e) and two (a and b) subtypes, respectively. In
contrast, Gt3 and Gt4 are responsible for sporadic cases in humans and are widespread in
animals. Especially for HEV Gt3, it is assumed that zoonotic transmission plays an
important role in human infections (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Genotypes
3 and 4 seem more variable and can be divided into 10 (a-j) and 7 (a-g) subgenotypes,
respectively (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Despite the considerable genetic variability observed between genotypes, to date only
one serotype has been identified. HEV Gt3 infections have been reported to be endemic in
pigs in Europe (<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and in North and South America
(<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). HEV infections in humans often run a
subclinical course but can also cause serious acute hepatitis. The disease is
characterized by a self-limiting jaundice of varying severity, which is hard to
distinguish from hepatitis of other viral origin, and is often accompanied by
nonspecific symptoms such as fever, headache, and pain in the upper abdomen. In pigs
naturally infected with HEV Gt3, microscopic lesions of hepatitis are observed, but
overt clinical symptoms in pigs have not been reported. Autochthonous HEV Gt3 and Gt4
infections in humans may be zoonotic and may originate from swine reservoirs. For this
reason, it is suggested that the study of HEV dynamics in pig populations be done in
Europe and the Americas.</p><p>For swine serology, several HEV antibody assays have been developed, mainly based on HEV
Gt1 antigens, in particular open reading frame (ORF)-2 proteins or peptides. HEV Gt3
antibodies have been shown to cross-react with Gt1 antigens (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), but, given the high variability of strains, homologous assays
may perform better. Since HEV Gt3 is the predominant genotype in pigs in Europe and
North America, in this study an HEV antibody assay for pigs was developed based on the
HEV Gt3 antigen. Due to the fact that there is no gold standard available, in-house
developed or commercially available HEV immunoassays often have not been validated
properly. For final validation and a definite choice for cutoff of the developed HEV Gt3
assay in this study, posterior Bayesian statistical inference was used.</p><p>A total of 1100 serum samples from fattening pigs were tested using the newly developed
HEV Gt3 assay and two other HEV immunoassays for comparison. Test results of the three
assays were analyzed simultaneously with a latent class model [see Engel et al. (<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and references therein]. This statistical model
accounts for the lack of a gold standard, i.e., no assay or combination of assays was
chosen as a reference.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>HEV ELISA development</title><p>A recombinant expression product of HEV (ORF-2, Gt3, Subtype 3a) was produced in a
baculovirus expression system as previously described (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). A synthetic gene
encoding 497 amino acids of swine Gt3 HEV ORF-2, Subtype 3a, was engineered using the
amino acid sequence published in GenBank AY585859 (Geneart, Germany). The part of the
HEV capsid encoded by this gene includes the motifs needed for self-assembly into
empty virus-like particles when expressed in Sf9 insect cells. Codon usage and
percentage G and C nucleotide content were optimized for expression in Sf9
<italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> insect cells and a Kozak sequence was
introduced upstream of the ATG. The recombinant baculovirus was obtained using the
Bac-to-Bac<sup>&#x000af;</sup> Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen, France)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sf9 insect cells adapted to a
serum-free medium (Invitrogen) were grown at 27&#x000b0;C in SF900 serum-free medium
supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and fungizone (Invitrogen). Viral stocks
were prepared on Sf9 cells, after two plaque purifications also on Sf9 cells.</p><p>Protein expression in the culture medium and cell lysate was analyzed by sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using
negative and positive sera from swine. Sf9 cells were infected with the recombinant
baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of five. The culture medium was harvested
5 days after infection. Cells and debris were removed by centrifugation at 10,000
<italic>g</italic> for 30 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 11,000
<italic>g</italic> for 3 h in a Beckman SW28 rotor. The resulting pellet was
resuspended in 4 mL PBS and held overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The sample was then mixed with
0.44 g/mL CsCl and centrifuged at 15,000 <italic>g</italic> for 18 h at 4&#x000b0;C in a
Beckman SW50.1 rotor. Fractions of 0.5 mL were collected from the bottom of each
gradient and fraction densities were determined using an Abbe refractometer
(Bioblock, France) and stored at a concentration of 0.3 &#x003bc;g/mL.</p><p>For the test principle, recombinant protein was coated onto polystyrene ELISA plates.
Recombinant protein was dissolved 1:1500 in coating buffer (see ELISA procedures),
and incubated with the test serum and HEV-specific swine antibodies were detected
using anti-porcine anti-IgG and IgM conjugates. Antibodies present in the test serum
bound to the antigen during the first incubation, and during the second incubation,
the bound antibodies were detected using anti-swine monoclonal antibodies against IgM
and against the L-chain conjugated to the enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP, see
ELISA procedures). Bound conjugate was visualized by adding a substrate chromogen.
Wells containing samples negative for HEV antibodies remained colorless. To optimize
the ELISA, different concentrations of the purified recombinant protein were tested
using a series of swine sera from an experimental infection. Swine sera were tested
in different dilutions to establish the optimal dilution for test sera. A primary
cutoff of the assay was established using sera from two cesarean-delivered
colostrum-deprived, specific pathogen-free pigs. For primary estimation of
sensitivity and specificity of the assay, sets of sera were used from pigs
experimentally infected with HEV Gt3 (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>All experiments in this study involving the use of animals were approved by the
Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments of Wageningen University, in accordance with
legislation of The Netherlands and the European Union.</p></sec><sec><title>HEV ELISA comparison assays</title><p>Two different HEV immunoassays were used for comparison, a commercially available
immunoassay and an HEV immunoassay that was developed in-house. The commercially
available HEV Ab-ELISA kit (Axiom, Germany) is a double-antigen sandwich ELISA based
on a recombinant Burmese HEV Gt1 capsid protein derivative covering the
carboxy-terminal amino acid residues 394-606. Due to its test principle, it can
detect HEV-specific antibodies independently of the host species and immunoglobulin
class. The manufacturer's instructions were strictly adhered to in the assay,
including the recommended thresholds for definition of a positive serum. The in-house
developed HEV immunoassay is a previously standardized in-house ELISA based on a
purified 55-kDa truncated recombinant capsid protein of the Sar-55 strain of human
HEV Gt1 (Gt1 assay). Based on its test principles, this immunoassay detects
HEV-specific IgG in pig sera. This immunoassay was performed as described by Martin
et al. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The absorbance of each sample was
read with an ELISA plate reader with a 450-nm filter. Test samples with absorbances
equal to or greater than the cutoff value (0.300) were considered to be positive for
anti-HEV IgG. In all immunoassays, sera of HEV naive and HEV infected swine were used
as negative and positive controls in each plate.</p></sec><sec><title>HEV ELISA validation</title><p>For further validation of the assay and to definitely set its cutoff value, a batch
of 1100 pig sera was used. The sera were obtained at slaughter from pigs from at
least 550 pig farms (maximum two pigs per farm) in The Netherlands. Potential HEV
infections in these pigs were of Gt3. To date, only HEV Gt3 infections have been
found in pigs in The Netherlands. All pig sera were tested using the developed HEV
Gt3 assay and the two comparison serologic assays based on HEV Gt1 antigens.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical evaluation of diagnostic test accuracy</title><p>The pig sera obtained at slaughter were used for a Bayesian evaluation of the
accuracy of the three ELISA tests. In a Bayesian analysis two sources of information
are combined: prior information about prevalence, test sensitivity, and test
specificity, and new observations, which in this case were the ELISA test results.
The prior information attaches a probability to each possible value of a parameter in
the model, e.g., an unknown test sensitivity. Consequently, the prior information
takes the form of a probability distribution for this sensitivity. This prior
distribution is combined with the data into a posterior distribution, which is an
up-to-date summary of all available information about the sensitivity. The median of
this posterior distribution is presented as an estimate and the 95% range as a
Bayesian confidence interval (credible interval) for the sensitivity.</p><p>The statistical model distinguishes between the test results and the true antibody
status of the sera. Because the tests are fallible, observed test results and
unobserved true antibody status are not necessarily the same. The test results of the
three ELISA tests were analyzed with a latent class model, where the true-antibody
status (seropositive or seronegative) represents the latent classes.</p><p>Data were collected in relatively small batches from different producers. In the
statistical model, each batch has its own true prevalence, i.e., probability for a
true seropositive, and these different prevalences are assumed to be sampled from a
distribution of prevalence values. The probabilistic behavior of the tests, in
relation to true antibody status, is modeled according to Engel et al. (<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The model accounts for possible dependence
between tests for true seropositives and true seronegatives.</p><p>Prior distributions were based on literature and expert opinion. For assays based on
a Gt3 antigen, prior emphasis was on a slightly higher specificity. For assays using
more isotypes of antibodies in the conjugate, prior emphasis was on slightly higher
sensitivity. The prior median and 95% ranges for sensitivity and specificity are
shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref>. The prior range for median
prevalence was chosen from 0.5 to 0.9. Further (technical) details about model and
priors may be found in Supplementary Material.</p><p>

</p><p>Because batches of sera from the same producer tended to be small, often as small as
two sera from the same producer, parameters for prevalence were hard to identify from
the data. In order to obtain more reliable inference about the sensitivity and
specificity of the tests, it was assumed that dependence between tests, conditional
upon true-negative status, was negligible.</p><p>For the CVI (Central Veterinary Institute) test, binary data were generated at three
different thresholds (20,23,25) and three separate analyses were performed, one for
each threshold.</p></sec><sec><title>HEV ELISA procedures</title><p>For coating onto polystyrene ELISA plates, the optimal dilution of the recombinant
baculoprotein stock (0.3 &#x000b5;g/mL) was 1:1500 using a coating buffer (0.05 M sodium
carbonate buffer, pH 9.65). In the final procedure, 100 &#x000b5;L diluted baculoprotein was
dispensed to each well of a polystyrene ELISA plate (Costar 9018, Greiner Bio-one,
Alphen a/d Rijn, The Netherlands). Plates were covered with adhesive foil (plate
sealer) and incubated overnight at room temperature. Before usage, ELISA plate(s)
were washed three times using tap water supplemented with 0.05% Tween 80 in an ELISA
plate washer. A volume of 100 &#x000b5;L StabilCoat<sup>&#x000af;</sup> (Diarect AG, Freiburg,
Germany) (diluted 1:1 with PBS) was dispensed to all wells and incubated 30 min at
room temperature. After removal of StabilCoat<sup>&#x000af;</sup>, ELISA plates were dried
for 3 h at 37&#x000b0;C and stored at 4&#x000b0;C until use. In the final test procedure, sera were
diluted 1:5 in serum dilution buffer: 10% bovine serum albumin+10% Elk+1% Tergitol
(dissolved in PBS) added to low salt buffer (2.5 mL 10% Tween 80 in 500 mL PBS). One
hundred microliters of diluted test serum was dispensed to the wells and, after
sealing, plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After this first
incubation, plates were washed three times using tap water supplemented with 0.05%
Tween 80 in an ELISA plate washer. Anti-swine IgM HRP-conjugated monoclonal antibody
(CVI 28.4.1.) was diluted 1:2000 and the anti-swine L-chain HRP-conjugated monoclonal
antibody (CVI 27.2.1.) was diluted 1:1000 in conjugate buffer (5% fetal calf serum)
in high salt buffer (14.5 g NaCl in 500 mL PBS, 2.5 mL 10% Tween 80). For the second
incubation, 100 &#x000b5;L of the diluted conjugate solution was dispensed to each well.
Plates were covered with a plate sealer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature.
Subsequently, plates were washed three times with tap water supplemented with 0.05%
Tween 80 using an ELISA plate washer, and 100 &#x000b5;L ready-to-use
3,3&#x02032;,5,5&#x02032;-tetramethylbenzidine substrate was dispensed to each well and incubated for
10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 &#x000b5;L 0.5 M sulfuric
acid to all wells. The color intensity was measured at 450 nm within 15 min after
color development had been stopped.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>HEV ELISA development</title><p>As described in Material and Methods, several protocols were tested to set up an
immunoassay based on HEV Gt3 recombinant antigen. Final performance of the developed
HEV Gt3 immunoassay was assessed using sera of pigs experimentally infected with HEV
Gt3, in comparison with a commercially available HEV Ab-ELISA (Axiom). The results
showed slight differences in the kinetics of anti-HEV antibody detection, but
seroconversion of HEV-infected pigs was detected with both detection methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Hepatitis E virus genotype 3 (Gt3) antibody developments in experimentally

estimated sensitivity and specificity were found for the Axiom and Gt1 assays. For a
threshold value of 20, the CVI Gt3 assay showed the highest sensitivity. For
threshold values of 20, 23, and 25, the CVI Gt3 assay showed similar specificities.
For the CVI Gt3 immunoassay, the best results were obtained for the threshold value

for the test.</p><p>

</p><p>The higher specificity of the Gt1 assay (0.94, 95%CI=0.92-0.96) was apparently
achieved at the cost of a modest sensitivity (0.58, 95%CI=0.55-0.62). CVI Gt3 and
Axiom had a similar specificity (0.89, 95%CI=0.88-0.90), but the estimated
sensitivity of Axiom (0.93, 95%CI=0.90-0.94) was higher than that of CVI Gt3 (0.84,

deviation <italic>&#x003c3;</italic> is 0.87 (95%CI=0.66-1.03), which implies considerable
variation among batches in prevalence: the odds ratio of two batches can be as high
as 11, e.g., odds ratio 0.9/(1-0.9) <italic>vs</italic> 0.45/(1-0.45) for prevalences
of 0.90 and 0.45.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To establish an HEV antibody assay for pigs, where HEV Gt3 is the predominant genotype
in Europe and North America, an HEV antibody assay was developed based on the HEV Gt3
antigen. Since there is increasing evidence that human autochthonous hepatitis E cases
are linked to swine reservoirs (<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), HEV antibody testing in swine is indicated to
estimate HEV prevalence. For this purpose, a validated HEV antibody assay for Europe,
preferably HEV Gt3 based, is needed. Therefore, a recombinant expression product of HEV
(ORF-2, Gt3, Subtype 3a) was chosen as antigen. For sensitivity testing of HEV antibody
development in the acute phase of the infection, a conjugate including HEV-specific IgG
and IgM was used. The effective performance of this format was tested using a set of
serum samples obtained from experimentally infected pigs.</p><p>Validation of HEV antibody assays is hampered by the fact that a gold standard is not
available. To get around this problem, different approaches have been used including
Western blot and Bayesian analyses (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In this study, posterior Bayesian statistical
inference was used for final validation and definitive choice of the cutoff value.
Through a combined approach of testing, using swine sera obtained from experimental
infections and from the field, and comparison of immunoassays using Bayesian evaluation
of the accuracy of the assays, an adequate validation of the immunoassay could be
established.</p><p>In the statistical model, it was assumed that there is an interdependency between assays
for true seropositives and independence for true seronegatives. Without the last
assumption, i.e., allowing for dependence between assays for true seronegatives as well,
quite unrealistic results were found for the specificity of all three assays. Quite
likely, this is connected to identification problems that influenced the prevalence
structure of batches in the data set. Such identification problems are not specific to
the statistical approach used in this article, and are potential problems shared by all
methods used for diagnostic test evaluation in the absence of a gold standard. For true
positives, dependence is likely, since all three immunoassays are based on more or less
the same principle. Moreover, based on previous observations, it has been postulated
repeatedly that it is likely that there is just one single serotype of mammalian HEV
(<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Assumed independence for true
seronegatives was considered reasonable, because in that case there will not be an
immunogenic reaction related to the selected antigens in the assays.</p><p>To better understand HEV transmission in autochtho-nous HEV infections in humans, HEV
surveillance in pigs is needed. Using an accurately validated, sensitive HEV antibody
assay based on the predominant antigen will result in more reliable surveillance data.
The HEV antibody assay developed and validated in this study is suitable for detection
of HEV-specific antibodies in swine reservoirs and can contribute to reliable estimates
of HEV prevalence in swine in different regions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>
