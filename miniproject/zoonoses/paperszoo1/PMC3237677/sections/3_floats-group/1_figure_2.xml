  <p>Sequence changes over the SARS-CoV epidemic. Shown here are the most significant changes important for transition of SARS from civet to early, middle and late phases of epidemic strains. Mutations indicative of lineages that were not likely to have contributed to the expansion to other phases have been removed. All other positions in the genome are identical.</p>
