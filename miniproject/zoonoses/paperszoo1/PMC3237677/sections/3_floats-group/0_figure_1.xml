  <p>Spike phylogeny of representative CoVs and models of SARS-CoV emergence. 
   <bold>(a)</bold> The Spike peptide sequence of 40 representative CoVs demonstrates that CoVs make up three distinct groups named alpha, beta, and gamma. These names replaced the former group 1, 2, and 3 designation, respectively. Classical subgroup clusters are marked as 2aâ€“2d for the beta CoVs and 1a and 1b for the alpha CoVs. The tree was generated via Maximum Likelihood using the PhyML package. Major branch labels represent bootstraps that were greater than 70. SCoV: SARS-CoV; BtSCoV: bat SARS-like CoV; BtCoV, ZBCoV, and ARCoV: bat CoVs; HCoV: human; FCoV and FIPV: feline CoVs; BCoV: bovine; IBV: avian; PHEV, TGEV, PRV, PEDV: porcine CoVs; and MHV: murine hepatitis virus. 
   <bold>(b)</bold> Competing models of SARS-CoV emergence. Early data suggested that SARS-CoV initially jumped from the zoonotic reservoir, bats, to palm civets, followed by a second jump from civets to humans (blue arrow). More recent phylogenetic and receptor analysis studies suggest a direct emergence from bats to humans, with subsequent cross-transmission between humans and civets (red arrow).
