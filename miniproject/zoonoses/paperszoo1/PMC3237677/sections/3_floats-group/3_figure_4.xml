  <p>Experimental evolution at the SARS S glycoprotein RBD–ligand interface. The SARS RBD is heterogeneous and includes defined sequence variation at specific residues that engage the ACE2 receptor from different species (Parts 1 and 2). Bioinformatics can be used to predict and then test the impact of targeted mutations on variant virus–receptor interactions. Iterative rounds of mutation driven selection are also possible using recombinant viruses encoding targeted mutations and variant ACE2 receptors for docking and entry. The model allows a deep structural understanding of the potential pathways and molecular mechanisms that govern cross-species transmission and pathogenesis. The biological impact of host shifting on antigenicity can be predicted using structural models of antibody–RBD interfaces, and then studied using a panel of well characterized human and mouse monoclonal antibodies targeting the different SARS-CoV RBD domains (Part 3). In parallel, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies can be used to select for escape mutations (Part 4), allowing for iterative rounds of prediction and testing on how these mutations impact host range and ACE2 recognition.</p>
