<p id="par0080">The coronavirus Spike glycoprotein is remarkably plastic, capable of accommodating mutations and deletions up to 479 (MHV) or 681 nucleotides (PRCoV) while retaining receptor binding and entry functions [

 <xref rid="bib0335" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0340" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. To date, large deletions in the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein have not been reported. The S protein is divided into discrete domains: an N-terminal domain, RBD, two heptad repeats, a transmembrane anchor, and an intracellular tail [
 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Discrete regions can be exchanged between strains while preserving both protein function and antibody binding [

 <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Multiple coincident substitutions as well as contact interface site substitutions can be tolerated to allow escape from antibody neutralization while maintaining receptor specificity [
