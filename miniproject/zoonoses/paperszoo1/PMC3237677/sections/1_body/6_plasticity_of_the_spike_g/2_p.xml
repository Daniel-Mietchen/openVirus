<p id="par0085">Diversity and flexibility of the Spike glycoprotein is characteristic of coronaviruses beyond SARS-CoV. The lack of a clear ACE2 receptor binding motif (RBM) in the horseshoe Bat-SL-CoV Spike, and the inability to use hACE2 as a receptor, led to an early hypothesis that the human-SCoV emerged from Bat-SL-CoV following a recombination event, perhaps with a NL63-like CoV, as NL63 also uses ACE2 as a receptor. Such a recombination event would have allowed direct acquisition of an ACE2 binding motif and the resulting cross-species transmission [

Alternatively, SARS-CoV used batACE2 for docking and entry and introduction into human/civet populations selected for mutations that enhanced interaction with the civet or humanACE2 receptor. The recently published crystal structure of NL63-CoV complexed with the ACE2 receptor shows no structural homology with the SARS-CoV RBM or the core RBD (
