<p id="par0090">Early data suggested that the RBD of SARS-CoV and perhaps HCoV-NL63 were derived by recombination processes, rather than mutation driven evolution. While these ideas remain highly speculative, these data suggested that the S glycoprotein RBDs and/or fusion cores of CoVs may be interchangeable between distant strains. In support of this hypothesis, the consensus bat SARS-like genome HKU3 was replication competent, but was not sufficient for sequential rounds of infection, presumably because of the lack of appropriate receptors for docking and entry. The insertion of the SARS RBD into the HKU3 Spike allowed for the production of progeny virus that grew to high titer in ACE2-expressing DBT cells, and was capable of replicating in human airway epithelial cells and mouse lungs, although it grew with reduced efficiency in the latter [

Further, the bat-SARS-like coronavirus with the SARS RBD was capable of replicating in mouse lungs, although with greatly reduced efficiency. It is notable that attempts to isolate CoV from bats have repeatedly failed, limiting our ability to study adaptive mechanisms or pathogenesis of CoV in host species, but that synthetic biology provides alternative sources of these viruses. The construction of a synthetic bat SARS-like coronavirus provided strong evidence that the interspecies movement of coronaviruses, specifically SARS-like coronaviruses, resides strongly in the RBD [
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. While previous studies had indicated that small changes in the Spike glycoprotein could alter host specificity of coronaviruses, the sufficiency of a discrete RBD change in the context of a divergent 30 kb genome demonstrates the RBD is a minimum determinant of species tropism. Further, it suggests a potential mechanism of host range expansion, suggesting both recombination and single substitution events allow for infection of novel hosts. Determining receptor specificities for these novel bat coronaviruses offer considerable opportunity to enrich our understanding of coronavirus–receptor interactions, identify new receptors that coronaviruses use for docking and entry, and provide novel models for studying the ease and mechanism of cross-species transmission.
