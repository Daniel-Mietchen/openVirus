<p id="par0050">Coronavirusâ€“receptor interactions are key determinants regulating host range, cross-species transmission, and tissue tropism. The various coronaviruses demonstrate broad receptor and coreceptor usage, from proteases such as aminopeptidase N for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), canine-CoV, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), and HCoV-229E, to cell adhesion molecules such as CEACAM1a for MHV, to sugars as coreceptors for some alpha, beta, and gammacoronaviruses [

 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This diverse receptor usage directly impacts host range and tissue tropism as demonstrated by the closely related PRCoV and TGEV. PRCoV lacks the sugar-binding region of TGEV, and consequently is limited to a respiratory rather than enteric tropism [
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The recently crystallized structure of the group 2a coronavirus MHV complexed with its receptor, murine CEACAM1a, emphasizes again the broad diversity and flexibility of CoV Spike glycoproteins. The core structure of the MHV RBD is hypothesized to have been derived from a host sugar-binding protein (galectin) and subsequently modified to allow mCEACAM1a binding, thus enhancing MHV affinity for host cells [

 <xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The capacity to bind carbohydrates for docking and entry may provide an additional pathway for coronavirus host range expansion, cross-species transmission, and disease emergence, and requires further study.
