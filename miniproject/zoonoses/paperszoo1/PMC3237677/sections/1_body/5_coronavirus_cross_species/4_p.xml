 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Indeed, a minimum of 1–2 substitutions in the RBD are sufficient to allow the virus to alter host receptor specificity [
 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Experimental adaptation of civet-Spiked SARS virus to human ACE2 receptor by Sheahan 
 <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated the minimal requirements for host range expansion. In these studies, a civet-Spiked SARS-CoV was incapable of propagating in Vero cells until a human-tropic substitution was introduced at residue 479. When the civet-Spiked virus included the K479T substitution it was capable of propagating on Vero cells and further capable of replicating on human airway epithelial cells (HAE) and hACE2-expressing DBT cells, demonstrating that single substitutions are capable of expanding the virus host range. Interestingly, when the K479T-civet-SARS was experimentally selected for enhanced replication on human airway epithelial cells, the substitutions that improved replication did not exactly replicate the substitutions seen in the epidemic strains. Rather, an initial substitution at 479 was necessary for the civet-SARS to use primate ACE2 and propagate in Vero cells, but the adaptive mutations following passage on human airway epithelial cells (HAE) selected for substitutions at two different contact interface sites at residues 442 and 472, rather than the 487 site identified in the epidemic strain [

 <xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. It is interesting to note that this alternative pathway for recognizing hACE2 ablated interactions with the cACE2 receptor, supporting the hypothesis that epidemic SARS-CoV strains were coselected to efficiently recognize both civet and human ACE2 receptors.
