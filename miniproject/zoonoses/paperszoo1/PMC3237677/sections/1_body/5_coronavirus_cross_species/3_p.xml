<p id="par0060">SARS-CoV replicates but does not produce clinical disease in mice. Two experimental adaptations of SARS-CoV to murine hosts by serial passage independently identified a substitution in the Spike gene at residue 436 which alone has been shown to enhance infectivity and pathogenesis in mice, and is predicted to allow stronger binding to the murine ACE2 receptor [

 <xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">58â€¢</xref>]. However, substitutions outside of Spike are necessary for the full lethal disease phenotype in MA15, and presumably also in v2163 [
 <xref rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. For example, two other proteins, nsp9 and nsp13, contained mutations in both mouse-adapted strains, MA15 and v2163. Additionally, single substitutions in the M gene are common to MA15 and adaptation to persistent infection of human tubular kidney cells, suggesting the M protein influences tropism or pathogenesis by facilitating the efficiency of particle egress [
 <xref rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The substitutions common to both mouse-adapted strains suggest potential SARS-CoV virulence factors in the later stages of adaption to a novel host, and indicate potential mutation driven emergence pathways. The mouse-adapted viruses may not represent true cross-species transmission events, as SARS could already replicate in the mouse lung, but it is notable that the most conserved change in both mouse-adapted strains enhances receptor binding at the same Spike residue. Further, serological studies indicate multiple cross-species transmissions into humans in the years before the epidemic, suggesting that the virulence factors contributing to the later stages of adaptation to novel hosts, in Spike or elsewhere, are critically important [
