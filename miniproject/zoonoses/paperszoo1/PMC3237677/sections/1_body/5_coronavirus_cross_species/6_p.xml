<p id="par0075">Extensive structural modeling tools are available to predict receptor binding, antibody neutralization, or the stability of substitutions within the RBD of the SCoV Spike. Three coronavirus Spike-RBDs have been complexed with receptors to date, allowing for prediction and validation of the structural determinants of binding to host and orthologous receptors (
