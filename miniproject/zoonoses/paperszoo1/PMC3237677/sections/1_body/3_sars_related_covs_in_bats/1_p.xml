<p id="par0020">Following its emergence in 2003, SARS was quickly identified as a zoonotic virus, and the identification of the wet markets as a potential source may have assisted epidemiological control of the disease [
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. While palm civets, raccoon dogs, and horseshoe bats (
 <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> genus) have all been identified as hosts of SARS-like CoVs, it is suggested that only the horseshoe bats are likely reservoir hosts. Bats are widely distributed, highly diverse, and extremely mobile mammals with an established role as hosts of emergent RNA viruses. Coronaviruses occupy an exceptionally wide distribution in bats; recent surveillance studies have extended our recognition of this range to Africa, Europe, South America, and North America [

 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The genetic variation encoded within many recently discovered coronaviruses hosted by bats is far greater than the diversity noted between many human coronaviruses, despite a proportionally small sampling of the âˆ¼1200 bat species, leading some researchers to speculate that all mammalian coronaviruses are derived from bat reservoir strains [

 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The extensive sequence diversity provides considerable opportunity for the emergence of new animal and human coronaviruses, which would be sufficiently antigenically distinct as to not be influenced by preexisting exposure and memory immune responses to established human CoVs. For example, little antigenic cross reactivity exists between the S glycoproteins of more distantly related group 2b bat coronaviruses and the SARS-CoV [
