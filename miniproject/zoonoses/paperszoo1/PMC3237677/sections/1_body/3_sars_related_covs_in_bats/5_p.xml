<p id="par0040">A more recent study analyzed CoV sequences gathered from 24 
 <italic>R. sinicus</italic> bats in geographically distant regions of China, characterizing two distinct genotypes, Rs672 and Rs806 [

 </xref>]. Interestingly, one sequence (Rs672) and the previously published Rp3 are shown in a monophyly more closely related to human-SCoV than to bat SARS-like CoV strains, based on the strong similarity of Rs672 ORF1a/b region to human SARS sequences. This study also provided further evidence of recombination between Bat-SL-CoV, with a recombination breakpoint identified immediately after the start codon of Spike, identical to the recombination position in the Rp3 genome [
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39
  <sup>•</sup>
 </xref>]. The combination of highly diverse BtCoV species and divergent ACE2 molecules among bat hosts suggests direct bat to human transmission may be feasible. Thus, the field is left with two potentially competing models for the origins of the SARS-CoV epidemic: first, transmission from bats to an intermediate amplifying reservoir in small carnivores, with subsequent transmission to humans or second, direct bat to human transmission followed by cross-transmission between humans and civets and raccoon dogs (
