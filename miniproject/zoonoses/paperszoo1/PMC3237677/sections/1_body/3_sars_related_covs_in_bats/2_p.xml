<p id="par0025">Repeated efforts have been made in recent years to identify the zoonotic reservoir and path of emergence for SARS-CoV, both by sampling zoonotic populations and by attempting to clarify SARS-CoV receptor usage in alternate hosts. A recent study attempting to address the paucity of bat SARS-related coronavirus sequences gathered and analyzed SARS-related coronaviruses in 
 <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> bats (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV) (Rp3) genomes from horseshoe bats in China [

 </xref>]. Interestingly, several bats sampled were coinfected with HKU2, an alphacoronavirus, providing direct evidence that individual bats can host divergent coronaviruses, even across groups. Further, tagging and clinical assessment of infected bats over a four-year period showed only minor weight loss associated with Rp3 infection, with viral clearance occurring between two weeks and four months. Analysis of the ten novel genomes gathered in this study combined with previously published sequences demonstrated evidence of frequent recombination between the strains. They also note a 26-bp deletion in ORF8 near, but not identical to, the 29-bp deletion seen in human SARS-CoV epidemic strains, suggesting ORF8 may undergo frequent deletions [
