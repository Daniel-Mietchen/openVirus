<p id="par0035">Although original data suggested a bat to civet to human origin, evidence supporting direct bat to human transmission of SL-CoV emerged from recent phylogenetic studies, in addition to the receptor studies mentioned above (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>b). Initially, a reanalysis of published genome sequences developed phylogenies using outgroups that were non-SARS-CoV sequences, designed to test the monophyly of the SARS-CoV sequences [
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Under this assessment, bat isolates are ancestral host to all SARS-CoVs, while civet and raccoon dog sequences (small carnivores), as well as pig isolates cluster within the human SARS-CoV sequences. The small carnivore CoVs are consistently shown to be terminal branches with human CoVs intermediate, with later transmission of CoV between carnivores and humans responsible for isolated cases such as GD03, a late phase human isolate that phylogenetically clusters with civet rather than human sequences [
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This phylogeny therefore supports a direct bat to human transmission, with subsequent and bidirectional transmissions between civet cats, raccoon dogs, and humans.
