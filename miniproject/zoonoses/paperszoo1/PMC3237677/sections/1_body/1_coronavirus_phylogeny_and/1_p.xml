<p id="par0010">Following the SARS-CoV outbreak a surge in global coronavirus genome sequencing efforts vastly expanded our insight into the CoV phylogeny and resulted in the definition of several subclassifications (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> ). The greatest contribution of new strains was derived from the newly discovered bat coronavirus (BtCoV), which may be the source of most, if not all, mammalian CoVs identified to date [
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,

 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The high diversity of coronaviruses is attributable to three viral traits [
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The first characteristic is the potentially high mutation rates associated with RNA replication, generally estimated as 10
 <sup>−3</sup> to 10
 <sup>−5</sup>. Surprisingly, the estimated mutation rate for SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses approached 2 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> [
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In contrast to other RNA viruses, recent data suggest that coronaviruses encode an RNA proof-reading activity associated with the 3′–5′ exonuclease activity encoded within nsp14 [
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is not clear whether RNA proof-reading fidelity is altered in changing environmental settings or during virus replication under stress related conditions, but such possibilities may allow for rapid virus evolution in changing ecologic conditions [
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Second, recombination frequencies within the coronavirus family have been calculated to be as high as 25% during mixed infection, likely the result of discontinuous RNA transcription and the presence of full length and subgenomic negative strand RNAs that allow for frequent strand switching and recombination between viral genomes and subgenomic replication complexes [
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The role of discontinuous transcription in recombination is supported by the higher rate of recombination toward the 3′ ends of viral genomes and by targeted RNA recombination techniques designed to genetically manipulate the 3′ end of the genome [
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Although poorly studied, conservation of transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) sites across viral species may implicate these sequences as foci or hot spots of recombination [
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thirdly, as the largest of the RNA viruses at ∼27–31 kb, coronaviruses have both increased opportunity for change and room for modification, clearly evidenced by the presence of numerous unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded toward the 3′ end of the genome [
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These genomic characteristics allow for rapid adaptation to novel hosts, ecological niches, tissue tropism, and even generation of novel coronavirus species, as seen in the generation of FIPV type II strains from double recombination events between FIPV type I and CCoV [
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].
