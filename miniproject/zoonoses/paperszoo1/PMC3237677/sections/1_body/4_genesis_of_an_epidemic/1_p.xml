<p id="par0045">A chronological set of SARS-CoV sequence changes spanning the SARS outbreak provided an unparalleled opportunity to identify the genetic basis for zoonotic virus cross-species transmission and human adaptation during an expanding epidemic. Molecular changes noted at with the end of the early phase and expansion into the middle phase of the epidemic include A
 <sub>3047</sub>V, A
 <sub>3072</sub>V in the replicase and D
 <sub>778</sub>Y and perhaps E
 <sub>1163</sub>K in the Spike gene. Transition from the middle to late phase of the epidemic included A
 <sub>2552</sub>V in ORF1a, E
 <sub>1389</sub>D in ORF1b, D
 <sub>77</sub>G and T
 <sub>244</sub>I in the S gene, respectively (

It has been hypothesized that these alterations were key to an expanding epidemic, yet empirical data to support these claims and functional significance of these alterations remain unavailable. For example, it is not clear whether the ORF8 29Â bp deletion is central for human adaptation as suggested, or a genetic hitchhiker amplified and maintained following a selective sweep mediated by other beneficial mutations located elsewhere in the genome [

 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In addition to these changes, the SARS-CoV Spike glycoprotein was under strong positive selection, with 23 substitutions evolving during the expanding phases of the epidemic [
