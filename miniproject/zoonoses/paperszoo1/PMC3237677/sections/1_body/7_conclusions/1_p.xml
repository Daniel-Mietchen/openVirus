<p id="par0095">Fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms and pathways that govern virus cross-species transmission are central to protecting global health. Coronaviruses readily traffic between host species and the Spike glycoprotein is the most extensively characterized viral determinant of host range expansion. Binding of the coronavirus Spike to the host receptor is the minimum determinant of infectivity and species specificity, and many recent studies have demonstrated the ability of S RBD to mutate and engage ortholog receptors or escape antibody neutralization [

 <xref rid="bib0315" ref-type="bibr">63••</xref>]. We need to know more about the breath of novel coronavirus receptors that are used in nature and the mechanisms governing ortholog receptor recognition. Importantly, the coronavirus RBD interface is a robust iterative model for predicting structure–function relationships between mutation-driven host range expansion, virus–receptor interactions, and antibody binding and neutralization. The SARS S-RBD model captures highly regulated variables that recapitulate real-life biological processes critical for coronavirus cross-species transmission and host immune response (

The SARS RBD–receptor–neutralizing antibody interface provides considerable opportunity for predicting and studying the role of mutations in cross-species transmission and immunity. In addition, recent work has also expanded our appreciation of how intragenic recombination may influence coronavirus host range, as evidenced by targeted recombination, recombination between different bat coronaviruses, and identification of the RBD as a minimum determinant of host range expansion [

 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39•</xref>]. While the precise ancestor and route of emergence for SARS-CoV remains unidentified, extensive sampling and phylogenetic studies of bat CoVs has raised the possibility that the epidemic strain may have jumped directly to humans before jumping to civets. Thus, future coronavirus epidemics may be more frequent than appreciated as compared with a two-step emergence model that required an intermediate host. Additionally, while it remains unclear whether recombination and/or mutation of Spike mediated the emergence of SARS, both mechanisms can readily impact coronavirus host range. Future studies are needed to clarify the potential roles of host proteases or antibody mediated selection in cross-species transmission, and to clarify whether modulation of RNA proof-reading activity could impact viral adaptation to a novel host. Further, structural and mathematical modeling tools offer novel predictive capabilities that, when integrated with experimental studies, will assist in predicting the ease of cross-species transmission, the mechanisms of emergence, and contribute to improvements in therapeutic design.
