<p id="par0015">Coronaviruses have a strong history of host shifting as evidenced by phylogenetic incongruences in the family tree [
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition to SARS-CoV, two human coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, are now also recognized as having likely emerged from animal reservoirs. HCoV-OC43 and bovine coronavirus (BCoV), both betacoronaviruses, have very high sequence similarity suggesting a recent and common origin (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Molecular clock analysis of the Spike glycoprotein of both species estimates that HCoV-OC43 originated from a BCoV ancestor around 1890 [
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similarly, HCoV-229E likely emerged from a bat alphacoronavirus approximately 200 years ago [
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In an example of reverse zoonosis, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus emerged suddenly in the early 1980s, most likely originating from HCoV-229E [
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Additionally, a coronavirus isolated in 1988 from a child with acute diarrhea, HECV-4408, was shown to be closely related to bovine coronavirus (BCoV), indicating the continued introduction of zoonotic coronaviruses into human populations [
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The origins of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, the most recently discovered human coronaviruses, remain under study. The most recent example of zoonotic emergence of a human coronavirus is the example of SARS-CoV, which had at least two independent emergence events from zoonotic reservoirs, recognized in 2002 and 2003 [
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The most recent phylogenetic data estimate the emergence of SARS-CoV some seven years earlier, consistent with the identification of low sero-positive cases from archived serum samples in 2001 in China [
