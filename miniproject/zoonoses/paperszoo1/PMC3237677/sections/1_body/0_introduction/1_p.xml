<p id="par0005">Coronaviruses have an established potential for cross-species transmission that became broadly recognized with the emergence of a novel human coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), in 2002. SARS was first identified as an atypical pneumonia in isolated patients in Guangdong Province, China. The disease reached epidemic proportions following key super spreader events that were associated with a novel respiratory virus introduction into a globalized community. SARS-CoV caused about 8000 infections and 800 deaths worldwide by July 2003, by which time aggressive public health intervention strategies contained the epidemic absent any effective therapeutics [

A subsequent explosion of coronavirus research identified SARS-CoV in several small carnivores (palm civets and raccoon dogs) of the Chinese wet markets and SARS-like CoV in the predicted reservoir host, horseshoe bats (genus 
 <italic>Rhinolophus</italic>). The vastly expanded CoV phylogeny includes two novel human coronaviruses (NL63 and HKU1) and ultimately tripled the number of full-length genome sequences available in GenBank. SARS-CoV was shown to use a novel host receptor, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), for docking and entry and the viral attachment protein, Spike, was extensively characterized both as a determinant of host specificity and as a therapeutic target. The more recent studies of coronaviruses have progressed to increased surveillance and characterization of numerous new coronaviruses circulating in bats, bids, and other species, integrated bioinformatics and microbiological studies, and extensive evaluations of potential therapeutics [
