<p>Influenza A and B viruses circulate among humans causing epidemics almost annually. While various hosts were identified for influenza A viruses (for review see 
 <xref rid="pone.0089058-Runstadler1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0089058-Reperant1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>), influenza B viruses were until 1999 only detected in humans. In 1999, an influenza B virus was isolated from harbor seals (

In addition, during a sero-survey of seals of the Dutch coastal waters using serum samples collected from 2002 to 2012, antibodies were detected against influenza B virus in only 9 seals in 2010 (43% of the tested serum samples of this year) and one in 2011 (0.7% of the tested serum samples of this year; both harbor seals and grey seals [

 <xref rid="pone.0089058-Bodewes1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Additional analysis suggested that these seals were probably infected with an influenza B virus that was similar to influenza B/Yamanashi/166/1998 and B/Jiangsu/010/2003, and was different from both the influenza B viruses that were isolated from seals in 1999 and influenza B viruses circulating in humans in 2010â€“2011

 <xref rid="pone.0089058-deJong1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. These findings might be explained by introduction of influenza B viruses into the seal population of the Dutch coastal waters both in 1999 and 2010 by another, non-human, host. Since this non-human host might potentially be a reservoir of influenza B viruses that are antigenetically distinct from influenza B viruses that currently circulate among humans, it is of interest from a public health perspective to identify this/these novel host(s).
