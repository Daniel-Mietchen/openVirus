<p>Based on these conditions, there are a number of potential additional animal host reservoirs for influenza B viruses. Transmission of influenza A viruses from birds to marine mammals has been reported 
 <xref rid="pone.0089058-Runstadler1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, but there is no evidence that influenza B viruses circulate among birds. Influenza B viruses might also originate from migrating individuals of other seal species that inhabit Arctic waters, since antibodies against influenza B viruses were detected in various other species of otariids and phocids in other areas 
 <xref rid="pone.0089058-Blanc1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0089058-Ohishi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Spread of viruses from these populations to seals of the North Sea, including Dutch coastal waters, has been suggested previously 
 <xref rid="pone.0089058-Harkonen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, but no serological surveys were performed to show the absence/presence of influenza B infections in these seal populations. Besides seals, other species of marine mammals might be a source of influenza B viruses that transmits to seals.
