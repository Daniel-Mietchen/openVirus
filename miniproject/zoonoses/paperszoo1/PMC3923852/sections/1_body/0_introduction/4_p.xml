<p>Harbour porpoises (
 <italic>Phocoena phocoena),</italic> the most abundant marine mammal species of the North Sea, are sympatric with seals in the Dutch coastal waters

 <xref rid="pone.0089058-Geelhoed1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In March 2010, the population of harbour porpoises in Dutch waters was approximately 66,000, but their number varies with the season 
 <xref rid="pone.0089058-Scheidat1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In addition, harbour porpoises stranded alive on the Dutch coast are also rehabilitated, indicating that a small proportion of the total population of these animals lives in close contact with humans (for a short period) and could be infected with a human influenza B virus during that stay. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated in virus attachment studies that influenza B viruses do bind to cells of the respiratory tract of harbour porpoises, although mainly to cells of the lower respiratory tract 
 <xref rid="pone.0089058-Ramis1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Therefore, we hypothesized that harbour porpoises might be a host for influenza B viruses. In the present study, we evaluated an unique set of serum samples from live stranded harbour porpoises for the presence of antibodies against influenza A and B virus.
