<p>The targeting of the host-derived lipid envelope of viruses by tetherin, rather than a specific virally-encoded structure, means that viruses cannot simply mutate their structural proteins to evade it. For an enveloped virus to successfully produce cell-free progeny virus, therefore, it must evolve a counter-strategy, or bud from regions of the cell membrane devoid of tetherin.</p>
