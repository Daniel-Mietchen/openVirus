<p>There are now several examples of specific countermeasures that have evolved in diverse mammalian viruses to overcome restriction by tetherin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-viruses-03-00520">44</xref>]. To date, seven mammalian virus-encoded proteins have been reported to counteract tetherin: HIV-1 Vpu, HIV-2 Env, SIV Env, SIV Nef, SIV Vpu, KSHV K5, and the Ebola glycoprotein. All target tetherin differently to achieve the same purpose: the physical separation of tetherin from the site of assembling virions, usually resulting in cell surface downregulation. Tetherin antagonists are often (but not always) species-specific, and in the case of primate lentiviruses this interplay between host antiviral factor and virus-encoded countermeasure may have had profound effects on the zoonotic transmission of these viruses and their adaptation to new hosts.
