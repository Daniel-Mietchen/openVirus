<p>Before its identification as an antiviral factor, tetherin had been identified in a proteomic screen for novel targets of K5, a membrane-bound RING-CH (MARCH) domain E3 ubiquitin ligase encoded by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV; also known as human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8)) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b82-viruses-03-00520">82</xref>]. K5 is an immuno-modulator that mediates the downregulation of a variety of cell-surface molecules involved in the immune recognition of virally infected cells, such as MHC class I proteins, adhesion molecules and NK receptor ligands [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b83-viruses-03-00520">83</xref>]. K5 exerts its effects by directly ubiquitinating the cytoplasmic tails of its target proteins to induce ESCRT-dependent degradation. K5 induces a species-specific downregulation of human tetherin from the cell surface followed by its lysosomal degradation, and in its absence the release of progeny KSHV virions from tetherin positive cells is inhibited [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-viruses-03-00520">37</xref>]. This K5-mediated tetherin degradation is ESCRT-dependent and requires the direct ubiquitination of a lysine residue at position 18 in the cytoplasmic tail of tetherin [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-viruses-03-00520">37</xref>], and unlike Vpu this ubiquitin-coupled degradation is essential for K5 to counteract tetherin function. MARCH ligase homologues are found in several Î³2 herpesviruses and poxviruses although whether tetherin antagonism is a conserved function is unknown. Herpesviruses have a complex envelopment strategy involving budding and fusion of immature viruses through the nuclear membrane, followed by ESCRT-dependent budding through internal membranes. The implication of tetherin in restriction of KSHV particle release suggests that all herpesviruses may be susceptible to its antiviral activity. Given the proportion of the genomes of these viruses accounted for by immune evasion genes, it is likely that many other herpesvirus-encoded proteins with anti-tetherin functions await discovery.
