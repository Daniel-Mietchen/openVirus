<p>Tetherin antagonism is a highly conserved attribute amongst primate lentiviruses, implying that evading tetherin is essential for replication of these viruses 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Remarkably, the ability to counteract tetherin has arisen in three different primate lentiviral proteins (Vpu, Nef and Env), with the adaptation of these proteins seemingly related to the natural history of cross-species transmission and species-specific differences in primate tetherins (

Amongst the six major lineages of primate lentiviruses, only two lineages contain Vpu in their genome, the SIVcpz/HIV-1 lineage and certain members of the SIVsyk lineage that include the SIVgsn sublineage (SIVmus, SIVmon, and SIVgsn), as well as the SIVden isolate.
