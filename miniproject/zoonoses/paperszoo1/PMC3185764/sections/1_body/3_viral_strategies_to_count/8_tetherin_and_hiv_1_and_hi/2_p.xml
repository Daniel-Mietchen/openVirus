<p>Of the four HIV-1 groups (M, N, O and P) that arose from independent zoonoses of SIVcpz, only Vpu proteins of HIV-1 group M and a few strains from group N appear able to efficiently counteract tetherin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66-viruses-03-00520">66</xref>]. Group M has given rise to the HIV-1 pandemic, whilst group O has caused localized epidemics predominantly in Cameroon where it represents 1â€“2% of the total HIV-1 incidence. Very few isolates of Groups N and P have been sequenced. The relative inefficiency of HIV-1 Group O transmission despite maintaining the ability to cause AIDS, has led to speculation that adaptation of Vpu to human tetherin was an essential step in the establishment of the HIV-1 human pandemic. In the few sequences available for HIV-1 group N, by contrast, tetherin antagonism is variable, but CD4 degradation (present in SIVcpz Vpu) was lost, suggesting that the pressure to adapt to human tetherin in Group N may have disabled this function. Analysis of the TM domains of M, N and O and SIVcpz Vpu proteins reveals that the SIVcpz and Group O TMs differ significantly along their length including in positions known to be important of Group M Vpu function [

Finally, while Group O Vpu proteins lack tetherin antagonism, it is not known whether the virus has, like HIV-2, acquired this function in its envelope protein. There is one report of an HIV-1 group M virus (AD8) with a Vpu-like activity associated with its envelope [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80-viruses-03-00520">80</xref>], but to date this observation has not been confirmed in the light of the discovery of tetherin.
