<p>It is clear that the Env protein of HIVs and SIVs has the capacity to evolve anti-tetherin activity. This may represent a “reserve” measure in certain situations, as demonstrated by the fact that the HIV-2 Env and an SIVmac Env have gained this function independently and in different regions of the protein. Neither virus was able to enlist Nef to overcome tetherin in its host species: clearly in the 
 <italic>nef</italic>-deleted SIVmac this is because the virus was engineered to lack Nef; for HIV-2 this was a consequence of the human tetherin lacking the five amino acids that confer susceptibility to Nef. Likewise, both viruses are descendents of an SIV lineage that does not encode a Vpu protein. Therefore, Env acts as a third means of counteracting tetherin and establishing infection in a new host. We can only speculate as to whether this has a cost for the virus. In the case of HIV-1 and SIV, tetherin counter-strategies are adopted by accessory proteins that play multiple roles in the modulation of the host environment 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. In contrast, for HIV-2/SIV Envs, this role is undertaken by a major structural protein, responsible for the entry of the virus into target cells whilst under pressure to constantly evolve to evade attack by the humoral immune response. Furthermore, as Env appears to counteract tetherin by chaperoning and sequestering it in intracellular compartments, this might decrease the levels of infectious virus produced due to a reduced availability of Env protein during assembly. Thus, it is possible that maintaining tetherin antagonistic ability in the Env protein has consequences for viral fitness. Whether this contributes to the lower virulence of HIV-2 is unknown.
