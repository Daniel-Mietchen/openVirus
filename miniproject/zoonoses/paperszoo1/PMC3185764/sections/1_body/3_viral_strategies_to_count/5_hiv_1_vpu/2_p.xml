<p>The prototype viral tetherin countermeasure, HIV-1 Vpu, is a small oligomeric transmembrane protein that resides in infected cells predominantly within the TGN and the endosomal system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-viruses-03-00520">4</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-viruses-03-00520">45</xref>]. For many years the two known functions of Vpu were the degradation of CD4, and the enhancement of virus release from certain cell types. The former function is well-defined and entails the rapid proteasomal degradation of newly synthesized CD4 molecules to prevent their interference with the trafficking of viral envelope proteins (reviewed in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-viruses-03-00520">46</xref>]). The nature of the latter function has become clearer since the identification of tetherin as the cellular factor responsible for impeding the release of Vpu-defective HIV-1 mutants. The mechanism by which Vpu antagonizes tetherin is still matter of debate, and to date all experiments studying the molecular basis of this process have been conducted with Vpu proteins derived from Clade B laboratory isolates. It is clear that Vpu expression induces tetherin accumulation in the TGN and that cytoplasmic tail truncations of Vpu that exhibit defects in localisation to the TGN are impaired in antagonism [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-viruses-03-00520">47</xref>]. Moreover, Vpu expression causes a downregulation of cell-surface tetherin levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-viruses-03-00520">3</xref>], and the total level of cellular tetherin are decreased in the presence of Vpu in most cellular systems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-viruses-03-00520">15</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-viruses-03-00520">48</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-viruses-03-00520">51</xref>]. However, whether degradation and downregulation of tetherin are absolutely required for Vpu antagonism of tetherin-mediated restriction is less apparent.
