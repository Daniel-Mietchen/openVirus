<p>Several studies have demonstrated that HIV-1 Vpu and human tetherin physically interact via their respective transmembrane domains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52-viruses-03-00520">52</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57-viruses-03-00520">57</xref>]. This interaction is highly species-specific as single point mutations in the transmembane domain of tetherin render it resistant to Vpu-mediated antagonism [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-viruses-03-00520">12</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-viruses-03-00520">15</xref>]. Reciprocally, mutations in the transmembrane domain of Vpu diminish its ability to interact with and antagonize tetherin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54-viruses-03-00520">54</xref>]. Interestingly mutations in both proteins’ transmembrane domains that abolish physical interaction lie along single faces of the respective membrane spanning helices [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54-viruses-03-00520">54</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-viruses-03-00520">56</xref>]. This, and the fact that Vpu transmembrane domain mutants that are defective for tetherin interaction are distinct from those that contribute to Vpu’s multimerization or putative ion channel function [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54-viruses-03-00520">54</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57-viruses-03-00520">57</xref>], are suggestive that Vpu targets tetherin as a monomer.
