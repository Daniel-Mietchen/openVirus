<p>The expression of Vpu induces tetherin ubiquitination, with the human tetherin cytoplasmic tail possessing both lysine and serine/threonine residues that can act as ubiquitin acceptors in the presence of Vpu [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61-viruses-03-00520">61</xref>]. The most likely E3-ligase candidate for direct tetherin ubiquitination is the β-transducin repeat-containing protein 2 (β-TrCP) subunit of a Skp1-Cullin1-F-box ubiquitin ligase complex. As observed with Vpu-mediated CD4 downregulation, recruitment of β-TrCP-SCF-Skp 1-Cul1-F-box is required for tetherin degradation. β-TrCP 1 and 2 bind to a highly conserved phosphorylated serine motif (DSGNES) in the Vpu cytoplasmic tail, and are linked to the rest of the E3 ligase complex via an F-box motif [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55-viruses-03-00520">55</xref>], there is increasing evidence to show that Vpu’s anti-tetherin mechanism does not necessarily require degradation of the restriction factor. For instance, mutation of both serine residues within the Vpu DSGNES motif preclude binding to β-TrCP and prevent cell surface downregulation of tetherin, yet this mutant Vpu retains some ability to promote virus release [
