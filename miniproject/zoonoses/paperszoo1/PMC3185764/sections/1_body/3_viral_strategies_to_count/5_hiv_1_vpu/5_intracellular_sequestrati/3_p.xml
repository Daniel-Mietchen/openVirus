<p>The Vpu proteins from SIVgsn (greater spot-nosed monkey), SIVmus (mustached monkey), SIVmon (Mona monkey) and SIVden (Dentâ€™s Mona monkey) are capable of counteracting tetherin of their simian hosts [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67-viruses-03-00520">67</xref>]. SIVcpz is in fact a recombinant virus derived from two lineages of SIV and as outlined below, tetherin antagonism has developed separately in two other lentiviral genes. Furthermore, the re-adaptation of HIV-1 Vpu to human tetherin may have had profound consequences for the spread of these viruses in humans.
