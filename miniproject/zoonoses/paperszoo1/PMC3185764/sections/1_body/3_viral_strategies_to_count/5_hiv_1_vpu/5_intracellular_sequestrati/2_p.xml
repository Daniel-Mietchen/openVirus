<p>If tetherin degradation is dispensable for Vpu activity, the most likely mechanism for antagonism of its function is its physical compartmentalization away from budding virions at the cell surface. Many studies have shown that tetherin is downregulated from the cell surface in response to Vpu expression, leading to less incorporation into virions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-viruses-03-00520">41</xref>]. Vpu does not affect the rate of internalization of cell surface tetherin [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55-viruses-03-00520">55</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60-viruses-03-00520">60</xref>], but rather sequesters 
 <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized or recycling tetherin away from the plasma membrane, probably in the TGN [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55-viruses-03-00520">55</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58-viruses-03-00520">58</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65-viruses-03-00520">65</xref>]. This sequestration is sufficient to block the restriction activity of tetherin, and the appropriated tetherin is presumably redirected to the lysosomal compartment for degradation, leading to net depletion of tetherin from the cell surface [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60-viruses-03-00520">60</xref>]. This Vpu-mediated sequestration of tetherin may also be ubiquitin dependent. Recently serine- and threonine-linked ubiquitination of tetherin has been implicated in inactivation and surface downregulation by Vpu [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61-viruses-03-00520">61</xref>], although whether this is demonstrable at physiological tetherin expression levels is unclear. In some cases, this trapping antagonism mechanism may be augmented by concomitant Vpu-dependent Î²-TrCP-dependent degradation of tetherin, suggesting that Vpu uses more than one mechanism to counteract tetherin restriction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55-viruses-03-00520">55</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65-viruses-03-00520">65</xref>]. A recent study suggested that HRS, an ESCRT-associated factor that binds ubquitinated cargo, interacts with Vpu/tetherin complexes and was required for antagonism in addition to its clear role in tetherin degradation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59-viruses-03-00520">59</xref>]. However, a potential confounding issue with these observations is that HRS depletion has a marked inhibitory effect on HIV-1 particle production irrespective of whether cells express tetherin or not.
