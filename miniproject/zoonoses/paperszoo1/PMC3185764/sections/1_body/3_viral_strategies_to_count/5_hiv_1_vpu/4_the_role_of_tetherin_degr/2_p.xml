 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53-viruses-03-00520">53</xref>] leading to debate as to whether tetherin is degraded in lysozomes or by cytoplasmic proteasomes after extraction from intracellular membranes. Because inhibition of tetherin degradation in infected cells by proteasomal inhibitors requires prolonged exposure that is known to deplete cytoplasmic ubiquitin, the more likely situation is that tetherin is degraded by an ubiquitin-dependent endosomal degradation, recently furthered by the implication of HRS and the ESCRT pathway in tetherin turnover [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59-viruses-03-00520">59</xref>]. Moreover data supporting proteasomal-dependent degradation of Vpu have in general come from the use of exogenously expressed epitope-tagged tetherin, which often results in a “backing-up” of immature tetherin molecules in the ER and subsequent ER-associated degradation, suggesting that initial reports of the 20S proteasome being directly involved in tetherin degradation are artifactual [
