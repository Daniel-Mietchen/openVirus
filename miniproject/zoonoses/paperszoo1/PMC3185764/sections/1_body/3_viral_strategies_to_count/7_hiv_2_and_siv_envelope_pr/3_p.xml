<p>Interestingly, there are two documented cases of SIV Env proteins able to antagonise tetherin. The first is an Env protein from a virus originally isolated from a naturally infected tantalus monkey [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76-viruses-03-00520">76</xref>]. This SIVtan Env shows a similar ability to HIV-2 Env and HIV-1 Vpu to exclude tetherin from the site of viral budding, resulting in a reduction in surface tetherin levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-viruses-03-00520">14</xref>]. The laboratory strain of SIVtan was first isolated from the tantalus monkey by co-culturing monkey and human lymphocytes, and the Nef protein from this virus does have weak activity against its host species tetherin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-viruses-03-00520">16</xref>]. This raises the possibility that this human cell type adaptation has influenced its ability to antagonise human tetherin, and may not be reflective of Env-mediated antagonism in the natural host. The second case of an SIV Env tetherin antagonist involves a pathogenic 
 <italic>nef</italic>-deleted SIVmac virus isolated from experimentally infected rhesus macaques. Nef-defective mutants of SIVmac are generally attenuated, maintaining a low level chronic infection that does not usually progress to AIDS. However, on occasion pathogenic revertants have been isolated. Upon investigation of the determinants of re-acquired pathogenicity, it was shown that the Env protein had acquired the ability to overcome restriction of virus release specifically by an allele of rhesus tetherin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77-viruses-03-00520">77</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78-viruses-03-00520">78</xref>]. The exact determinants of tetherin antagonism in the SIV Env protein were mapped, and it is of note that they are different from those implicated in the HIV-2 Env [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78-viruses-03-00520">78</xref>]. While both Envs require the membrane-proximal GYxxÏ• endosomal sorting motif in the gp41 cytoplasmic tail, the remainder of the cytoplasmic tail is dispensable in HIV-2 Env [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-viruses-03-00520">31</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72-viruses-03-00520">72</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79-viruses-03-00520">79</xref>], with the ectodomain postulated to interact with tetherin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-viruses-03-00520">31</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72-viruses-03-00520">72</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74-viruses-03-00520">74</xref>]; for the 
 <italic>nef</italic>-deleted SIVmac, the ectodomain of Env is dispensable and activity maps to several amino acid substitutions in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, and grafting of the tail onto a heterologous membrane protein (CD4) is sufficient to generate a chimeric tetherin antagonist [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78-viruses-03-00520">78</xref>]. Unlike HIV-2, SIVmac Env-mediated tetherin interaction and targeting is highly species-specific and is determined by residues flanking the tetherin di-tyrosine endocytic sorting motif, which is also essential for antagonism. There is no effect of the A100D determinant in the tetherin coiled-coil. Thus, the acquisition of function in the SIV Env protein represents an independent and distinct parallel of the evolution of the tetherin antagonistic property of HIV-2 Env.
