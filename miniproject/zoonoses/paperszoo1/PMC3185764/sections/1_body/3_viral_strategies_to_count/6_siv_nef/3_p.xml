<p>None of the SIV Nef proteins are able to counteract human tetherin, and this specificity maps to five amino acids (G/DDIWK) in the cytoplasmic domain of simian tetherin that are missing from the human orthologue [

The reinsertion of this motif into human tetherin is sufficient to render it sensitive to SIVmac Nef [
