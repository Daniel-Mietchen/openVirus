<p>Many SIV strains do not encode a Vpu protein. Rather, the Nef protein of SIVmac (macaque), and also of SIVagm (African green monkey), SIVsm (sooty mangagey), SIVblu (blue monkey), and SIV cpz (chimpanzee), can enhance virus release from cells expressing the tetherin proteins derived from their simian hosts [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69-viruses-03-00520">69</xref>]. Nef is a myristoylated adaptor protein that localizes to the cytosolic face of cellular membranes. This immunomodulatory protein is known to remove cell-surface proteins involved in immune recognition, including CD4, MHC class I and II [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70-viruses-03-00520">70</xref>]. Many SIV Nef proteins also induce the cell-surface downregulation of primate tetherin molecules and this downregulation correlates with enhanced viral particle release [
