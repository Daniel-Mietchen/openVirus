<p>Ebola virus encodes 7 genes, of which the viral glycoprotein (GP), found on the surface of virions and responsible for mediating target cell entry, is able to antagonize tetherin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-viruses-03-00520">33</xref>]. Through a mechanism that is currently unclear, Ebola virus GP appears to counteract tetherin without removing it from the cell surface [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b81-viruses-03-00520">81</xref>]. Furthermore, the Ebola GP does not seem to require specific tetherin sequences for its activity, as it is able to counteract an artificial tetherin, and to date is the only viral tetherin antagonist able to do so [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b81-viruses-03-00520">81</xref>]. Supporting a less specific mode of action, Ebola GP is also able to antagonize mouse tetherin, a protein possessing only 36% sequence homology to primate tetherins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-viruses-03-00520">33</xref>]. Thus, Ebola GP seems to have a broader activity than the lentiviral antagonists, perhaps reflecting the breadth of mammalian host species infected by the Ebola virus.
