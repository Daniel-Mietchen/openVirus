<p>Another intriguing possibility is whether tetherin plays a role in the structure of the VS itself. While Vpu mediates tetherin downregulation in infected T cells, in one study this effect appeared delayed [

Whether this is related to the situation in polarised epithelial cells, wherein tetherin has been shown to interact with the underlying actin cytoskeleton via the BAR-RacGAP protein RICH2 and is concentrated at the apical surface of the cells, remains to be seen [
