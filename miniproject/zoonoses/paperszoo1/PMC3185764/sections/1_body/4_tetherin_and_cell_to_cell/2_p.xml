<p>HIV-1 and other human retroviruses spread within a host both through cell-free virus dissemination and through direct cell-to-cell contact via the virological synapse (VS) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b85-viruses-03-00520">85</xref>]. Formation of the virological synapse between infected and target cells is an active process, analogous to the formation of the immunological synapse, involving polarized cytoskeletal remodeling and enrichment of viral proteins and cellular receptors at the site of cell contact. Viral production in the infected cell is polarized towards the site of contact with the target cell, and several recent studies have confirmed the presence of tetherin at the VS [
