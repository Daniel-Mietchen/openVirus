<p>Tetherin-mediated retention of mature virions on the cell surface might inhibit cell-to-cell virus transfer due to aggregation and reduced infectivity of the virions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b94-viruses-03-00520">94</xref>] or could promote cell-to-cell transfer by providing a concentration of immobilized, infectious virions at the focal point of virus production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b86-viruses-03-00520">86</xref>]. Indeed, as the recent literature supports both scenarios it is likely that the outcome is influenced by cell type, modulation of tetherin expression levels by interferon, and the kinetics of the process itself. For example, it has been observed that in macrophages the replication of a virus expressing a Vpu severely impaired in its ability to counteract tetherin was significantly compromised compared to the wildtype virus, whereas replication of the same Vpu-defective virus was not significantly diminished in CD4+ T cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b95-viruses-03-00520">95</xref>]. Furthermore, despite apparently contrasting results with regards to the effect of tetherin on cell-to-cell virus transmission, all studies demonstrated that the reductions in cell-free virus production caused by tetherin were far more effective than any reduction seen in cell-to-cell spread [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b86-viruses-03-00520">86</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b87-viruses-03-00520">87</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b94-viruses-03-00520">94</xref>]. The possibility emerges, therefore, that cell-to-cell spread may allow the systemic spread of virions that would otherwise be thwarted by tetherin, particularly considering that no retrovirus beyond the lentivirus genus has been described to encode a tetherin antagonist. Since tetherin antagonism is highly conserved this would imply that, for primate lentiviruses at least, efficient replication and transfer
