<p>In the last few years, much understanding of tetherin structure and function has been gleaned, particularly with respect to its interactions with HIVs and SIVs, and has led to suggestions that it has acted as a powerful selective pressure on primate lentiviruses. However, the seeming simplicity of its mechanism underlines its potential to act as a potent generalized inhibitor of enveloped virus release. Furthermore, virus/tetherin interactions 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> are likely to lead to further immune activation that may augment and modulate adaptive antiviral responses. The high degree of positive selection on tetherin during mammalian evolution, and the coding capacity that several diverse enveloped viruses have given to develop proteins that specifically target it, imply that tetherin is an important antiviral weapon in the arsenal of the innate immune response.
