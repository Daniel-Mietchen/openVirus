<p>To date, tetherin has been shown to restrict the release of retroviruses (all classes) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-viruses-03-00520">7</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-viruses-03-00520">30</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-viruses-03-00520">32</xref>], filoviruses (Ebola virus and Marburg virus) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-viruses-03-00520">30</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-viruses-03-00520">33</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-viruses-03-00520">34</xref>], arenaviruses (Lassa virus and Machupo virus) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-viruses-03-00520">34</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-viruses-03-00520">35</xref>], a paramyxovirus (Nipah virus) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-viruses-03-00520">35</xref>], gamma-herpesviruses (Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-viruses-03-00520">36</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-viruses-03-00520">37</xref>] and rhabdoviruses (vesicular stomatitis virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-viruses-03-00520">38</xref>]). The ability of tetherin to target such a diverse group of viruses resides in its ability to target a feature common to them all: their host cell-derived lipid bilayer. This list of susceptible viruses is bound to grow, as in principal tetherin could target any enveloped virus that buds from cellular membrane enriched in tetherin.
