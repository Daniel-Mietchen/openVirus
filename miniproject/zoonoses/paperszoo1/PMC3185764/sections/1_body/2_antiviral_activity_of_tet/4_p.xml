<p>EM studies reveal electron-dense tethers visible between the cell and the virus, or between two virions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-viruses-03-00520">40</xref>]. Furthermore, recent immune-electron microscopy studies demonstrate that tetherin is present between the cells and the virions, and is therefore likely to constitute the physical linkage responsible for attachment of nascent HIV-1 virions to the plasma membrane [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-viruses-03-00520">41</xref>]. However, electron tomography studies will be required to provide conclusive evidence for a direct tethering mechanism. Partial protease stripping experiments demonstrated that tetherin is incorporated into HIV-1 virions in a parallel configuration, although additional conformations cannot be ruled out[

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-viruses-03-00520">40</xref>]. Interestingly, tetherin was found enriched on filamentous structures, far longer than the 17nm estimate of a single tetherin molecule, connecting virions to the plasma membrane [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-viruses-03-00520">40</xref>]. The nature of these structures and their role in tethering virus particles at the plasma membrane remain to be clarified.
