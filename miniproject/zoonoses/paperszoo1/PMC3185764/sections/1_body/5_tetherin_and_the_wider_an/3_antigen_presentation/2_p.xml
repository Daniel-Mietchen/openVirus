<p>Viral particles targeted to degradative compartments by tetherin may have consequences in antigen presenting cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. For example, in macrophages, the localization of HIV-1 assembly is complex. Virions assemble and accumulate in deep invaginations of the plasma membrane, where they might be sequestered and released on contact with T cells across synaptic structures [

This raises the possibility that in antigen presenting cells, such as macrophages, which are targets for HIV-1 infection 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, tetherin-restricted virions could be targeted for proteolytic destruction in phagosomes and viral components processed for antigen presentation. If so, tetherin-mediated enhanced presentation of viral components to the adaptive immune system will be important in the generation and augmentation of an adaptive immune response.
