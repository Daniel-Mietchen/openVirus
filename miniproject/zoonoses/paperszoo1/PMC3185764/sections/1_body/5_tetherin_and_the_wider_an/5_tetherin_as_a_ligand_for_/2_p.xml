<p>Recent data have suggested a role for tetherin as a regulator of the interferon response to tumor cells. Specifically, tetherin can act as a ligand for the leukocyte inhibitory receptor ILT7, both of which are expressed on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-viruses-03-00520">11</xref>]. This interaction in 
 <italic>cis</italic> on pDC surfaces inhibits signaling through Toll-like receptors 7 and 9 (TLR 7/9) to their respective ligands. Detection of viral nucleic acid by TLRs 7 and 9 induces an interferon response in pDCs, and these cells are recognised as being among the most potent producers of type I IFN during viral infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b99-viruses-03-00520">99</xref>]. While the production of IFN by pDCs induces the upregulation of tetherin on cells in the vicinity, the engagement ILT7 by tetherin inhibits the production of IFN and inflammatory cytokines by pDCs in a negative feedback loop [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-viruses-03-00520">11</xref>]. However ILT7 expression is restricted to pDCs. Does tetherin affect TLR function differently in the absence of ILT7 or in 
 <italic>trans</italic>? Lysosomal degradation of viral particles releases virion components that are ligands for endosomal TLRs. Tetherin restriction of viral particles may therefore lead to increased recognition of viral nucleic acid by TLRs 7 and 9 either in 
 <italic>cis</italic> or 
 <italic>trans</italic>, and in turn upregulate the host response to viral infection by increasing the expression of IFN, inflammatory cytokines and molecules involved in viral immune surveillance. Furthermore tetherin may itself possess an intrinsic signaling capacity. In a large-scale screening study it was identified as a potent inducer of NF-kB [
