<p>All studies on tetherin thus far have addressed its effects on virus replication and virion production 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. However the importance of tetherin in the global immune response to viral infection has yet to be addressed. There are several points at which the actions of tetherin may influence other components of the immune response, all of which may account for the pressure to develop tetherin antagonists over and above its inhibitory activity on virion production.
