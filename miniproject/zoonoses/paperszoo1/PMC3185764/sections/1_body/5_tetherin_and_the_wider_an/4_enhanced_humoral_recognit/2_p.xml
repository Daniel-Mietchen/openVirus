<p>A further, more general effect of tetherin-restriction of particle release, is the “visibility” that this may give an infected cell to adaptive humoral responses. Depending on the length of exposure to the extracellular milieu, the cell surface-tethered virions themselves may be targets for enhanced antibody deposition. Therefore, virions trapped on the cell surface (and the cell itself) may be subject to complement-mediated destruction or direct cytotoxicity by phagocytes and natural killer cells and the enhanced inflammatory signals that these activities stimulate.</p>
