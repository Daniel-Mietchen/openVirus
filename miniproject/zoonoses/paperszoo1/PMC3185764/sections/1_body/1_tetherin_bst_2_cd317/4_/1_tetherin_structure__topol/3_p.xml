<p>Tetherin is located both at the plasma membrane and in intracellular compartments. At the plasma membrane, the GPI anchor embeds the C terminus of tetherin in cholesterol-rich microdomains, from which HIV-1 and other enveloped viruses preferentially bud [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-viruses-03-00520">27</xref>]. The intracellular pool of tetherin is located predominantly in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), but is also found in early endosomes and potentially in recycling endosomes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-viruses-03-00520">28</xref>]. Trafficking of tetherin between the plasma membrane and the TGN requires a tyrosine-based sorting signal in the tetherin cytoplasmic tail. This YxYxxϕ motif recruits clathrin adaptor complexes and is highly conserved in all known tetherin proteins [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-viruses-03-00520">29</xref>]. This site has been shown to interact with both clathrin adaptors AP1 and AP2. The AP2 complex delivers tetherin to early endosomes, and the AP1 complex then mediates transport of tetherin between these endosomes and the TGN [
