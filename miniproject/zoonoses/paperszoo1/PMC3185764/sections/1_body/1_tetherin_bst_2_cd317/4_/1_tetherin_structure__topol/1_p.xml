<p>Tetherin is a small type II membrane protein of 181 amino acids with a molecular weight of between 29 and 33 kDa depending on its glycosylation state. It has an unusual topology with both ends embedded in the cellular membrane by two different types of membrane anchor: a transmembrane domain proximal to the N-terminus and a C-terminal glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor [
