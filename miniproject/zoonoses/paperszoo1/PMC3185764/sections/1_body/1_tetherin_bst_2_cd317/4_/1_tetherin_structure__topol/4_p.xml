<p>In polarized epithelial cells tetherin localizes specifically to the apical surface. Knockdown of tetherin expression leads to disappearance of the underlying cortical actin network. This linkage between tetherin-containing microdomains and the actin cytoskeleton is mediated by BAR-RacGAP protein RICH2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-viruses-03-00520">25</xref>]. Disruption of tetherin/RICH2 interactions leads to activation of Rac1, explaining the change in actin dynamics. However, what the physiological role of tetherin is in polarized cells remains to be determined.
