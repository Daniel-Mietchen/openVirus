<p>The two membrane anchors are connected by the extracellular domain of tetherin, comprising an extended coiled-coil structure; the intracellular N terminus consists of a short cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular domain of tetherin contains two N-linked glycosylation sites, and mediates homodimerization through disulfide linkages formed by at least one of three cysteine residues [
