<p>Tetherin orthologues have been identified in the genomes of all mammals analyzed to date, and of those tested all possess the ability to inhibit retroviral particle release [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-viruses-03-00520">12</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-viruses-03-00520">14</xref>]. Curiously, the tetherin gene was duplicated in ruminants prior to the diversion of sheep, goats and cows [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-viruses-03-00520">7</xref>]. Both sheep orthologues have antiviral activity, although some differences exist in their relative potency [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-viruses-03-00520">7</xref>]. Sequence analyses have demonstrated that tetherin, like many immunological effector molecules, has been under high levels of positive selection during mammalian evolution, particularly in areas of the protein implicated as targets for virally encoded countermeasures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-viruses-03-00520">12</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-viruses-03-00520">15</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-viruses-03-00520">16</xref>] (see below). These analyses, while differing in their interpretation of the relative levels of positive selection between domains of the tetherin protein, all suggest that tetherin evolution has been shaped by the constant interaction with viruses and their encoded antagonists.
