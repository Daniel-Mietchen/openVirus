<p>Tetherin is widely expressed in response to type I IFN, and is also constitutively expressed on several cell types, including mature B cells, plasma cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-viruses-03-00520">6</xref>]. It can also be upregulated on myeloid cells and lymphocytes by various activatory stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, and in ruminants is highly expressed in the endometrial stroma surrounding the conceptus [

Prior to the discovery of its role as an antiviral effector molecule, it had been designated as the tumor antigen HM1.24 due to its expression on multiple myeloma cells, and has been of interest in this regard as a target for cancer immunotherapy [
