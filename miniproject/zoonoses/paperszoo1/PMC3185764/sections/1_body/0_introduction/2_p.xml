<p>The induction of the interferon response by viral infection leads to a cellular “antiviral state”, in which various signaling pathways trigger the upregulation of an array of cellular genes involved in host defense. Some of these genes encode proteins that directly inhibit various stages of mammalian virus replication. In the last decade, several examples of host-encoded antiviral proteins that potently inhibit aspects of retroviral replication (so-called retroviral restriction factors) have been identified on the basis of the cell-type or species specificity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication. Of these proteins, members of the APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases and tetherin/BST-2 are particularly notable because they target molecular features of the virus that cannot be varied (the chemical nature of the genome or the lipid envelope), and have thus necessitated the development of virus-encoded countermeasures to evade them—the accessory genes Vif and Vpu, respectively [
