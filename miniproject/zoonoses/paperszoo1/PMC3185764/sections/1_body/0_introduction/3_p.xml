<p>Tetherin (bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2—BST-2, CD317) was discovered as the factor responsible for the defect in virion release of HIV-1 mutants lacking the accessory gene 
 <italic>vpu</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-viruses-03-00520">2</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-viruses-03-00520">3</xref>]. In the absence of Vpu expression, cell-free HIV-1 particles are poorly released from CD4+ T cells and macrophages, and mature virions accumulate on the cell surface and in vacuolar structures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-viruses-03-00520">4</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-viruses-03-00520">5</xref>]. It has subsequently become clear that tetherin’s unique mode of action allows it to target a wide range of mammalian enveloped viruses, and there are now several examples of viral proteins, which, like Vpu, specifically counteract this antiviral factor. In this review we will focus on the recent progress and future directions in our understanding of tetherin’s mechanism of action, how virally encoded countermeasures target its activity, and the potential role of these interactions in 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> viral transmission and pathogenesis. While most of the studies so far focus on primate lentiviruses, we will draw attention to general principles likely to be applicable to many other enveloped viruses.
