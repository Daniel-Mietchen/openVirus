  <p>
   <bold>A.</bold> Representative images of 
   <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells treated with control (β-gal) or dXPO1 dsRNA, and infected with WNV, WNV-KUN, DEN, SIN, RVFV, or VSV (blue, nuclei; green, virus). 
   <bold>B</bold>. Quantification of fold change in infection for dsRNA treated cells as in 
   <bold>A</bold>. Mean ± SD for 3 independent experiments; * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01. 
   <bold>C–D</bold>. Viral RNA levels measured using RT-qPCR in Drosophila cells treated with β-gal (control) or dXPO1 dsRNA and infected with WNV (
   <bold>C</bold>) or VSV (
   <bold>D</bold>). Mean ± SD of fold change for 3 independent experiments; * p&lt;0.05. 
   <bold>E–H</bold>. Adult flies of the indicated genotypes were challenged with vehicle or WNV-KUN (
   <bold>E, G</bold>) or VSV (
   <bold>F, H</bold>) and mortality (
   <bold>E, F</bold>) was monitored as a function of time post-infection (** p&lt;0.01 log rank). (
   <bold>G, H</bold>) Groups of 15 flies of the indicated genotypes were challenged, and viral titer was assessed by plaque assay in 3 or 4 independent experiments (shown as individual dots) with controls (set to 1) and fold change shown at day 6 post infection. Line represents mean. 
   <bold>I–J</bold>. Aag2 cells were treated with the indicated dsRNA and then infected with (
   <bold>I</bold>) WNV-KUN or (
   <bold>J</bold>) VSV. Mean ± SD of fold change in percent infection compared to control (β-gal dsRNA) for 3 independent experiments; * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01.
