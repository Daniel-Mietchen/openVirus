  <title>dRUVBL1 is a broadly antiviral gene.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>A.</bold> Representative images of 
   <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells treated with control (β-gal) or dRUVBL1 dsRNA, and infected with WNV, WNV-KUN, DEN, SIN, RVFV, or VSV (blue, nuclei; green, virus). 
   <bold>B</bold>, Quantification of fold change in infection for dsRNA treated cells as in A. Mean ± SD for 3 independent experiments; * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01. 
   <bold>C–D</bold>. Viral RNA levels measured using qRT-PCR in 
   <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells treated with β-gal (control) or dRUVBL1 dsRNA infected with WNV (
   <bold>C</bold>) or VSV (
   <bold>D</bold>) Mean ± SD of fold change for 3 independent experiments; ** p&lt;0.01. 
   <bold>E–H</bold>. Adult flies of the indicated genotypes were challenged with vehicle or WNV-KUN (
   <bold>E–F</bold>) or VSV (
   <bold>G–H</bold>). Mortality was monitored as a function of time post-infection (
   <bold>E,G)</bold> (log rank: * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01). (
   <bold>F,H)</bold> Groups of 15 flies of the indicated genotypes were challenged, and viral titers were assessed by plaque assay in 4–7 independent experiments (shown as individual dots) with controls (set to 1) and fold change shown at day 6 post infection. Line represents mean.
