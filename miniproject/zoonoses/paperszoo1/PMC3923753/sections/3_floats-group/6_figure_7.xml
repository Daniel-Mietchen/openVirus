  <title>RUVBL1 and XPO1 restrict viral infection in mammalian cells.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>A–D.</bold> Human U2OS cells were transfected with siRNAs against a control, hRuvBL1, or hXPO1 and challenged 3 days post transfection with WNV-KUN for 20 hours (
   <bold>A–B</bold>) or VSV for 12 hours (
   <bold>C–D</bold>). Cells were fixed, processed for microscopy and quantified in 
   <bold>A, C</bold>. Mean ± SD of fold change compared to control for 3 independent experiments; * p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01. Cells were processed for northern blots and quantified displaying the mean for 3 independent experiments with control set to 1; * p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01 in 
   <bold>B, D</bold>. 
   <bold>E</bold>. 293T cells were transfected with siRNAs against control or two independent siRNAs against hTIP60 and challenged 3 days post transfection with WNV for 24 hours and processed by flow cytometry. Three independent experiments were quantified; Mean ± SD of the fold change in infection is shown and normalized to the control; **p&lt;0.01. 
   <bold>F</bold>. Primary neurons transduced with lentiviruses expressing the indicated shRNAs were infected with WNV for 24 hours and processed for viral yield by focus forming assays. Mean ± SD for 3 independent experiments; * p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01. 
   <bold>G–H</bold>. U2OS cells were treated with vehicle or LMB and infected with (
   <bold>G</bold>) WNV-KUN or (
   <bold>H</bold>) VSV. Mean ± SD of fold change in percent infection compared to control (vehicle) for 3 independent experiments; * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01.
