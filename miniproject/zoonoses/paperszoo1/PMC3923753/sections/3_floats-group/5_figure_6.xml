  <title>dXPO1 targets dALDOA and restricts viral infection.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>A.</bold> Table of genes whose mRNA export is LMB-dependent, their level of induction by VSV infection, and whether they have been identified as antiviral previously. 
   <bold>B</bold>. Schematic overview of glycolysis pathway (red, Aldolase (Ald); blue, enzymes tested; black, enzymes not tested; green, inhibitors). 
   <bold>C–D</bold>. DL1 cells were treated with the indicated dsRNA and then infected with (
   <bold>C</bold>) WNV-KUN or (
   <bold>D</bold>) VSV. Data is presented as Mean ± SD of fold change in percent infection compared to control (β-gal dsRNA) for 3 independent experiments; * p&lt;0.05.
