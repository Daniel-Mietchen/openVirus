  <title>Genome-wide RNAi screen in 
   <italic>Drosophila</italic> for host factors involved in WNV infection.
  </title>
  <p>
   <bold>A.</bold> Representative images of DL1 cells treated with the indicated dsRNAs and infected with WNV (nuclei, blue; WNV NS1, green). 
   <bold>B</bold>. Quantification of fold change in infection for dsRNA treated cells as in A. Mean ± SD for 3 independent experiments; ** p&lt;0.01. 
   <bold>C</bold>. Schematic of screening pipeline including the scatter plot of Robust Z-scores for each gene assayed in duplicate. VSFs (376) and VRFs (161) are noted. 
   <bold>D</bold>. Bioinformatics show fraction of candidate genes that have human or mosquito orthologs. Significant enrichment of conserved genes (p&lt;0.0001) and under-enrichment of 
   <italic>Drosophila</italic>-specific genes (p&lt;0.0001) as analyzed by chi-squared test. 
   <bold>E</bold>. Pie chart of candidate genes and validation results (50 VRF, 96 VSF, 71 not validated). 
   <bold>F–G</bold>. Gene ontology enrichment of validated genes with five or more members displayed (p&lt;0.001). 
   <bold>F</bold>. VSF categories enriched. 
   <bold>G</bold>. VRF categories enriched.
