  <title>Tip60 complex has antiviral activity.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>A.</bold> Table of RUVBL1-associated complexes, whether the complex is dependent on RUVBL2, and other genes in the complexes tested for antiviral activity. Genes in red were found to be antiviral against both WNV and VSV. 
   <bold>B–C</bold>. DL1 cells were treated with the indicated dsRNA and then infected with (
   <bold>B</bold>) WNV or (
   <bold>C</bold>) VSV. Mean ± SD of fold change in percent infection compared to control (bgal dsRNA) for 3 independent experiments; * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01. 
   <bold>D–E</bold>. Aag2 cells were treated with the indicated dsRNA and then infected with (
   <bold>D</bold>) WNV-KUN or (
   <bold>E</bold>) VSV. Mean ± SD of fold change in percent infection compared to control (bgal dsRNA) for 3 independent experiments; * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01.
