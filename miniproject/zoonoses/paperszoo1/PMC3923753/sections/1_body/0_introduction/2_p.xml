<p>Flaviviruses are small (∼50 nm diameter) enveloped viruses that contain a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of ∼11-kb with a 5′ cap, but unlike mRNA, lack a 3′ polyadenylated tail 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Wengler1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. WNV enters both vertebrate and invertebrate cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Bressanelli1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and then traffics to an acidic compartment that facilitates viral fusion with endosomal membranes and release of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-SanchezSanMartin1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The viral genome encodes one open reading frame and is translated as a single polyprotein at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is subsequently processed by both viral and cellular proteases into 3 structural and 7 non-structural viral proteins 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Chambers1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Viral RNA replication occurs within cytoplasmic complexes associated with perinuclear membranes requiring lipid rearrangements

 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Welsch1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and progeny viruses bud into the ER and traffic through the Golgi network where virions are processed into mature particles prior to exocytosis
