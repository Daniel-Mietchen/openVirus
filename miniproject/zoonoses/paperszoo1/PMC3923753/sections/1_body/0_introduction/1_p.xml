<p>Historically, West Nile virus (WNV) epidemics were observed in Africa, the Middle East, Europe, India, Australia, and parts of Asia, In 1999, WNV entered into the North America as part of an outbreak of neuroinvasive disease in New York City 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Nash1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, and since then has become endemic in the United States with large numbers of cases occurring annually in different regions of the country. Indeed, the occurrence, size, and severity of outbreaks in humans overall have increased worldwide since the mid 1990s 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, with a large outbreak in Texas in 2012 leading to many fatalities

 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Roehr2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Different strains of WNV, with variable worldwide distributions, exhibit significant differences in pathogenesis. In humans infected with North American WNV strains, approximately 80% of infections are asymptomatic, with 20% developing WNV fever and other relatively mild symptoms, and 1% progressing to encephalitis, meningitis, or flaccid paralysis 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In contrast, WNV-Kunjin, endemic in Australia, has not been associated with any human fatalities or severe disease 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The natural transmission cycle of WNV is between mosquitoes and birds, with humans, horses, and other vertebrates being incidental dead-end hosts 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. WNV is a member of the Flavivirus genus, which includes many globally important vector-borne pathogens, such as Dengue (DENV), yellow fever (YFV), tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV), and Japanese encephalitis viruses (JEV) 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Gubler1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. DENV is endemic in more than 110 countries with 3.6 billion people at risk, and 390 million people infected yearly 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Gubler2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Bhatt1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. At present, there are no specific antiviral therapies against any flavivirus, and only three insect-borne flaviviruses have approved vaccines for humans (YFV, TBEV, and JEV)
