<p>In this study, we used Drosophila to identify cell-intrinsic antiviral genes that restrict WNV and hypothesized that a number of these would restrict other insect-borne viruses, and some might have conserved roles in vector insects such as mosquitoes. Since many antiviral pathways (e.g., autophagy, Jak/Stat and Toll pathways) are active both in mammals and insects, we speculated that some of these newly identified factors also would confer antiviral activity in mammalian cells. To identify such genes using an unbiased approach we performed a genome-wide high-content RNAi screen in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells to identify cellular factors that limited WNV infection. To date, RNAi screens have mainly focused on cellular factors usurped by pathogens to promote infection. While 22 restriction factors have been identified as anti-flaviviral in genome-wide RNAi screens 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Sessions1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Krishnan1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, only 2 of these are conserved between humans and insects. We optimized the assay for the discovery of restriction factors and identified 50 genes that when silenced resulted in enhanced WNV infection in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. All 50 are conserved in mosquitoes and 86% have clearly defined human orthologs. Furthermore, 17 of these genes had antiviral activity against multiple flaviviruses, and 7 genes were antiviral against a diverse panel of additional vector-borne RNA viruses. We focused on two broadly acting conserved genes, dRUVBL1 (pontin) and dXPO1 (embargoed), and found both restricted viral infection in adult flies, were antiviral in mosquito 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> cell culture as well as in human cells. Furthermore, since WNV is neurotropic we tested whether RUVBL1 contributes to control of WNV in neurons and found it to be antiviral in these cells. Mechanistically, our studies establish that dRUVBL1 along with other members of the Tip60 histone acetylase complex are antiviral suggesting a role for this complex in virus restriction. Furthermore, we found that dXPO1 controls the nuclear export of specific host mRNAs, including the mRNA encoding Aldolase, which we identified as antiviral. Collectively, we identified additional novel, broadly acting cell-intrinsic antiviral genes in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> at least some of which function in mosquito and vertebrate cells.
