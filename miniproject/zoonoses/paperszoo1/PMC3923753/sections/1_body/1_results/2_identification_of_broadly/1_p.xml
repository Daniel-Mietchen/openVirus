<p>While few antiviral pathways have been described in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the well characterized ones (e.g., RNA silencing machinery) appear to inhibit infection of diverse viruses

 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Sabin2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Given this, we explored whether the anti-WNV factors identified also restricted other viral pathogens. We tested two additional flaviviruses: the WNV strain Kunjin (CH 16532; WNV-KUN) and Dengue virus (
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> adapted Dengue-2 (DENV)). In addition we tested three additional human vector-borne viruses: Sindbis virus (HRsp; SINV), Rift Valley Fever virus (MP12; RVFV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (Indiana; VSV) (

 </xref>). All of these are enveloped RNA viruses transmitted to vertebrates by an insect vector. While mosquitoes are the natural vector for WNV, WNV-KUN, DENV, SINV and RVFV, sandflies are the primary vector for VSV. The flaviviruses and SINV are positive sense RNA viruses, whereas RVFV and VSV are negative sense. RVFV has a tri-segmented genome, while the other viruses encode a non-segmented genome. Thus, these viruses represent divergent families and genomic architectures.
