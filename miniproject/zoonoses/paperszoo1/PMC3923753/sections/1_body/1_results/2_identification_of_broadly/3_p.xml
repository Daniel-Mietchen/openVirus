<p>The WNV VRFs had a high propensity to impact infection by multiple different viruses. There was a high concordance of gene dependencies across the three flaviviruses; 31 genes (86%) restricted WNV-KUN and 22 genes (61%) restricted DENV (

 <bold> and

 </bold>). There also was a large overlap between WNV and SINV VRFs (64%), while less so with RVFV (38%) and VSV (25%). Thus, many anti-WNV factors appear broadly antiviral against other flaviviruses and an unrelated positive strand RNA virus in insect cells. The degree of VRF overlap diminished as the viruses became more disparate (

Nonetheless, we identified 7 host factors that significantly restricted infection by all six vector-borne viruses tested (p&lt;0.05): dXPO1 (emb), dRUVBL1 (pont), dYARS (Aats-tyr), dEIF1B (CG17737), dPPM1L (CG7115), dCTNS (CG17119) and dICT1 (CG6094). All seven of these VRF genes have human and mosquito orthologs (
