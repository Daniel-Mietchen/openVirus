<p>We and others have previously infected

 <italic>Drosophila</italic> has not been characterized. WNV-KUN is a less pathogenic strain of WNV endemic to Oceania 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. We found that WNV-KUN, analogous to WNV New York, productively infected 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003914.s005">Text S1</xref>
 </bold>). Next, we optimized conditions for RNAi screening in 384 well plates using both negative and positive control dsRNAs based upon our previous studies selecting conditions to identify restriction factors for WNV-KUN, DENV, SINV, RVFV and VSV (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003914-g002">
  <bold>Figure 2B</bold>
 </xref>). The four positive sense viruses clustered together (flaviviruses WNV, WNV-KUN, and DENV, and alphavirus SINV), while RVFV and VSV, the two negative sense viruses clustered together. This suggests the gene signature of restriction is related to a fundamental aspect of viral structure.
