<p>Since WNV is a neurotropic virus we tested whether RUVBL1 restricted infection in primary neuronal cultures. We prepared cerebellar granule cell neurons from wild-type C57BL/6 mice and transduced them with lentiviruses expressing either a control shRNA, or 4 independent shRNAs against RUVBL1. Three days later, we challenged the cells with WNV (MOI = 0.1), and harvested virus in the supernatant 24 hours later. Notably, all four independent shRNA depleted RUVBL1 to varying extents (
