<p>Our initial studies in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> were performed in a single round of infection suggesting that the requirements for the genes in the viral lifecycle included: entry, uncoating, translation, polyprotein processing, and RNA replication. To study the step in the viral lifecycle impacted by the Tip60 complex in mammalian cells we took advantage of a human cell line (293T) that stably maintains a subgenomic WNV replicon expressing GFP

If these genes restricted infection downstream of entry, but upstream of assembly, they should restrict the replication of this WNV replicon. Indeed, siRNA depletion of hRUVBL1 or hTIP60 led to increased levels of WNV replicon replication as measured by immunoblot (
