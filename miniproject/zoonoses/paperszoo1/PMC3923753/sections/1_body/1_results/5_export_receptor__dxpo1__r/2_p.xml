<p>Next, we assessed whether dXPO1 was antiviral

 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Collier1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref> so we again used an inducible RNAi and observed 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> silencing of the mRNA (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003914.s005">Text S1</xref>
 </bold>). We then challenged control (hs-GAL4&gt;+) or dXPO1-depleted (hs-GAL4&gt;dXPO1 IR) flies with vehicle, WNV-KUN or VSV. While unchallenged flies or control challenged flies did not exhibit increased mortality, dXPO1-depleted flies challenged with either WNV-KUN or VSV had increased mortality (p&lt;0.01,
