<p>One advantage of the 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> system is the powerful genetic tools including the availability of genome-wide 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> RNAi transgenic flies. Furthermore, 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> are not hematophagous, so they can be challenged easily and safely with highly pathogenic human viruses. We took advantage of WNV-KUN as it is a BSL2 agent in comparison to the more virulent North American WNV strains, which require a BSL3 facility 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Scherret1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Wild-type flies were permissive to WNV-KUN infection as measured by plaque assay and exhibited no increase in mortality compared to control flies (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003914.s005">Text S1</xref>
 </bold>). This is consistent with the natural infection of mosquitoes where limited pathogenesis is observed, and similar to our observations with other vector-borne viruses (VSV, SINV, RVFV) that display limited pathology upon viral infection

 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Filone1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. However, loss of innate immune defenses in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> or mosquitoes can render insects more susceptible to infection and result in increased viral replication and mortality

 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Bellosta1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. We used the GAL4/UAS system to promote expression of a UAS- inverted repeat (IR) transgene that bears long hairpin dsRNA against dRUVBL1 to target the endogenous transcript 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. We induced expression of the transgene using a heat shock (hs) promoter in adult flies allowing us to bypass any developmental requirements. Indeed, expression of the hairpin during development was lethal (data not shown). Importantly, heat shock driven dRUVBL1 RNAi flies had decreased dRUVBL1 mRNA (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003914.s005">Text S1</xref>
 </bold>). Next, dRUVBL1-depleted (hs-GAL4&lt;dRUVBL1 IR) and control flies (hs-GAL4&lt;+) were challenged with WNV-KUN and survival was monitored. Unchallenged dRUVBL1-depleted flies exhibited no increase in mortality nor did control flies challenged with WNV-KUN. Notably, the majority of WNV-KUN infected dRUVBL1-depleted flies succumbed to infection (p&lt;0.01,

 </xref>). We next tested if there was an impact on viral load. Groups of 15 flies were challenged, and whole animals were crushed, and assayed for WNV-KUN by plaque assay in four independent experiments (shown as individual dots). We observed modest, but increased viral loads in dRUVBL1-depleted animals compared to controls (set to 1) at day 6 post infection; similar results were observed at day 9 post infection (
