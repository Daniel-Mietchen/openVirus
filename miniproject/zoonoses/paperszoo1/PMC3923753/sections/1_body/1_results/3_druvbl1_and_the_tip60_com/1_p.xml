<p>Among the validated WNV VRFs, genes with putative nuclear roles were enriched (p&lt;0.00012) and included dRUVBL1 (pontin, also known as Tip49), which was antiviral against all six viruses. RUVBL1 is an ATP-binding protein belonging to the AAA+ (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities) family of ATPases implicated in diverse cellular pathways in the nucleus and cytoplasm

First, we validated the antiviral activity of dRUVBL1 using independent dsRNA targeting dRUVBL1 outside of the screening format and observed a significant increase (p&lt;0.05) in infection by WNV, WNV-KUN, DENV, SINV, RVFV and VSV compared to control (
