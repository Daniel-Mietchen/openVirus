<p>dRUVBL1 has been shown to function in many complexes, most often in conjunction with another AAA+ ATPase, dRUVBL2 (reptin, also known as Tip48) (depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003914-g004">
  <bold>Figure 4A</bold>

 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Bellosta1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Indeed, structural and functional analysis of human and yeast RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 suggest these proteins work as a scaffold in addition to functioning as ATPases, potentially explaining their association with a diverse set of cellular complexes 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Grigoletto1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. dRUVBL1, along with dRUVBL2, is involved in chromatin remodeling, most notably in the Ino80 and Tip60/Swr1 complexes

 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Doyon1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Furthermore, roles in transcriptional regulation facilitating the activity of c-Myc and β-catenin also have been reported in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human cells 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Wanzel1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Bauer1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Additional roles for dRUVBL1 and dRUVBL2 have been described in snoRNA maturation, nonsense mediated mRNA decay, and telomere maintenance. Lastly, dRUVBL1 also has been implicated in chromatin remodeling with the 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> Trithorax complex, although this is thought to be independent of dRUVBL2 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Diop1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Based on these possible functions, we tested components of these complexes for their impact on viral infection to identify which of the putative dRUVBL1 containing complex(es) mediated the antiviral activity. We designed dsRNAs against dRUVBL2 along with the indicated genes in each of the complexes

  <bold>Figure 4A</bold>
 </xref>. Cells were treated with these dsRNAs, along with β-gal (negative) and dRUVBL1 (positive) controls. Importantly, no impact on cell viability was observed (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003914.s005">Text S1</xref>
 </bold>). Next, the dsRNA treated cells were infected with either WNV or VSV. Depletion of c-Myc, arm (
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> β–catenin), Smg1, Fib and Nop60B did not impact WNV or VSV infection levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003914-g004">
  <bold>Figure 4B and C</bold>
 </xref>). In contrast, dRUVBL2 was antiviral against both VSV and WNV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003914-g004">
  <bold>Figure 4B and C</bold>
 </xref>). Depletion of both dRUVBL1 and dRUVBL2 together did not increase infection beyond that observed with silencing of either gene, indicating their effect was not additive (data not shown). Increased WNV and VSV infection also was observed when dTIP60 (Tip60), dEP400 (domino (dom)) and dSMARCA4 (Brahma (brm)) were depleted. Since dRUVBL1, dRUVBL2, dEP400 and dTIP60 are all antiviral, and members of the Tip60 complex, these data suggest that a major antiviral role of dRUVBL1 is through its function in the Tip60 complex.
