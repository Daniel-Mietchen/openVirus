<p>Since dXPO1 is as a nuclear export receptor, we speculated that dXPO1-dependent regulation of either host genes required for infection or virus-induced antiviral genes may account for the antiviral activity. Indeed, antiviral transcriptional programs have been shown to restrict viral infections in

 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Herold1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. One gene, bsg, was XPO1-dependent and required for WNV infection. However, this cannot explain the phenotype of XPO1 because bsg was required for WNV infection and not the other viruses that are sensitive to XPO1 restriction (

 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. We generated dsRNAs targeting CG4294 and CG30389 but observed no impact on WNV-KUN or VSV infection (

  <bold>Figure 6C and D</bold>
 </xref>). None of the 50 VRFs from our screen were within this set; however, data mining of an RNAi screen with VSV in DL1 cells (S. Cherry unpublished data) identified one additional gene (Aldolase, dALDOA) from this LMB-dependent gene set that showed antiviral activity against VSV (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003914.s005">Text S1</xref>
 </bold>) but resulted in a 1.5 to 2.5-fold increase (p&lt;0.05) in the percentage of cells infected with WNV-KUN and VSV, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003914-g006">
  <bold>Figure 6C and D</bold>
 </xref>). This suggests that dXPO1-dependent mRNA export of dALDOA contributes to the defense against multiple virus families.
