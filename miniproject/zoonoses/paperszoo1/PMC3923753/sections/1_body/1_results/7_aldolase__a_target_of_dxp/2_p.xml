<p>Aldolase is a critical enzyme in glycolysis, catalyzing the conversion of fructose 1,6-biphosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) (

  <bold>Figure 6B</bold>
 </xref>). However, Aldolase may have functions apart from glycolysis, as its expression but not all core glycolytic enzymes are increased in response to LPS treatment 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Scharte1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. To define whether the antiviral activity of Aldolase was related to glycolysis we performed two complementary experiments. First, we depleted 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells of additional enzymes essential for glycolysis (Phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi), Phosphofructokinase (Pfk), Phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk), and Phosphoglycerate mutase (Pglym87)) (

  <bold>Figure 6B</bold>
 </xref>). Depletion of these canonical glycolysis enzymes had no impact on cell number (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003914.s005">Text S1</xref>
 </bold>) or WNV-KUN and VSV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003914-g006">
  <bold>Figure 6C and D</bold>
 </xref>). Second, to overcome the fact that RNAi is incomplete, and that these are enzymes which may be fully active at low levels, we took advantage of two specific and potent glycolysis pathway inhibitors, Dichloracetic Acid (DCA), which inhibits the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, and a hexokinase inhibitor (3Br) 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Pelicano1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. Neither of these treatments impacted cell number (
 <bold>Figure S6B–E in 
  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003914.s005">Text S1</xref>
 </bold>) or WNV-KUN and VSV infection of 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003914-g006">
  <bold>Figure 6B–D</bold>
 </xref>). Together, these data suggest the antiviral effect of Aldolase is not mediated through the glycolysis pathway.
