<p>Mosquitoes are the natural vectors for WNV, WNV-KUN, DENV, RVFV and SINV although the particular mosquito species that transmit each of these viruses varies

 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is the primary vector species for DENV transmission, and can be infected by RVFV, WNV, WNV-KUN, and SINV 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Moutailler1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Furthermore, the 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> genome has been sequenced 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Nene1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref> and the 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> cell line Aag2 is amenable to RNAi and routinely used as a model for mosquito cell studies
