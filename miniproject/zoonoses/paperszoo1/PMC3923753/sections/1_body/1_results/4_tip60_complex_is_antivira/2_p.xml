<p>We designed dsRNAs against 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> RUVBL1 (AAEL004686), RUVBL2 (AAEL010341), and TIP60 (AAEL014072) orthologs. Prior to infection, Aag2 cells were treated with these dsRNAs or with dsRNAs against Bgal or the viral genome as negative and positive controls, respectively. Loss of RUVBL1, RUVBL2, or TIP60 mosquito orthologs did not affect cell number (
