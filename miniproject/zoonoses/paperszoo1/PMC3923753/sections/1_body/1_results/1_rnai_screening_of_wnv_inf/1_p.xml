<p>To identify cellular factors that restrict WNV infection, we first characterized the infection of a pathogenic North American WNV isolate (New York 2000) (referred to as WNV) 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Ebel1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> DL1 cells. WNV successfully infected and produced infectious virions from DL1 cells, although infection levels were substantially lower than that observed in human cells (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003914.s005">Text S1</xref>
 </bold>). Kinetic experiments revealed that peak immunofluorescence signal of virally produced NS1 protein was 48 hours post infection (hpi), a time point prior to substantial virus spread (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003914.s005">Text S1</xref>
 </bold>). We next tested whether WNV infection of 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells was dependent on similar entry and replication pathways as in mammalian and mosquito cells. Chlorpromazine, an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, blocks entry of WNV in both mammalian and mosquito cells

 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Chu1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, and also effectively inhibited WNV infection of 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> DL1 cells (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003914.s005">Text S1</xref>
 </bold>). Ribavirin, a nucleoside analog and a inhibitor of Flavivirus replication in many mammalian cell types 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, also inhibited WNV infection of 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (
