<p>A genome-wide RNAi screen was performed in duplicate and statistical analysis identified 537 genes (3.6% of the 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome) that when silenced had a significant effect on the percentage of WNV infected cells, with a robust Z score of ≥2 or ≤−2 in both replicates (p&lt;0.001; ∼40% change; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003914-g001">
  <bold>Figure 1C</bold>
 </xref>). None of the non-targeting controls spotted on each plate were identified whereas 100% of the positive control dsRNAs spotted on each plate against WNV genome and Ars2 were identified. Silencing of 376 of these 537 genes resulted in decreased viral infection, indicating WNV was dependent on these genes for replication (viral sensitivity factors (VSF)). Silencing of 161 genes resulted in increased WNV infection suggesting they normally restrict replication (viral resistance factors (VRF)). As WNV infects mosquitoes, birds, and vertebrates we were interested in those genes having orthologs in hosts that normally encounter the virus, rather than genes annotated as 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> specific, as flies are not natural hosts. Analysis of this candidate gene list revealed that ∼59% of the genes have orthologs in both humans and mosquitoes (p&lt;0.0001), with 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic>-specific genes being greatly under-represented (∼23% of the total; p&lt;0.0001) (

 </xref>). Of the 537 genes identified in the primary screen, 147 were cytotoxic (robust Z score&lt;−2 in duplicate; ∼15% decrease in cell number) and were excluded from further analysis. Only one gene had a robust Z score&gt;2 in duplicate but did not validate subsequently. Additionally, 131 genes were not clearly conserved in mosquitoes or humans (as determined by Homologene) and also were excluded from further analysis. Of the 280 remaining genes, we set out to validate all of the genes except for a handful that were members of complexes in which we identified &gt;2 components. In those cases, we chose to validate representative genes from these complexes (

 </bold>). To do this, we generated independent dsRNA reagents that targeted 217 genes and screened this secondary gene set under two conditions: we infected cells at a low level of infection (4%) to maximize identification of genes that restricted infection, and at a higher level of infection (18%) to maximize validation of genes that promote infection. Of the 217 genes, 121 validated (56%): 82 genes (68%) facilitated WNV infection (VSFs) and 39 genes (32%) restricted infection (VRFs). We also validated a total of 23 genes from larger complexes (

 </bold>). If we include the remaining 17 genes in the complex, the screen identified 96 VSFs and 50 VRFs in total (
