<p>To assess whether XPO1 also had antiviral activity in the vector mosquito cells, we treated Aag2 cells with dsRNAs against the 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> XPO1 ortholog (AAEL001484) or against Bgal or the viral genome as negative and positive controls, respectively. These cells were subsequently challenged with WNV-KUN or VSV. While depletion of XPO1 did not affect cell number (
