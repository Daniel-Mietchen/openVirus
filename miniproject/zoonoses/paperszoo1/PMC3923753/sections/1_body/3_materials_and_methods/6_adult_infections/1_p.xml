<p>All flies were maintained on standard medium at room temperature. Flies carrying UAS-dXPO1 IR (VDRC v3347) or UAS-dRUVBL1 IR (VDRC v105408) were crossed to heat shock (HS)-GAL4 flies (Bloomington) at room temperature. On the day of injection, the progeny were heat-shocked at 37Â°C for 1 hour and shocked every 2 days throughout the experiment. Adults of the stated genotypes were challenged with WNV-KUN or VSV as previously described
