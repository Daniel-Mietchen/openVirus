<p>For siRNA treatments, mammalian cells were reverse transfected with 20 nM siRNA (Ambion: Negative Control #1 (AM4611), GFP (AM4626), XPO1 (s14937), RUVBL1 (s16370)), KAT5 (s20630, s20631) using HiPerfect according to the manufacturers protocol (Qiagen). 60 hours post-transfection, for immunofluorescence, cells were replated in a 96-well format and infected with either VSV or WNV-KUN virus 12 hours later. For FACS the cells were infected with WNV for 24 hours and stained for NS1 or TIP60 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref> or infected and processed for northern blot or immunoblot at 12 hr p.i. for VSV and 20 hr p.i. for WNV-KUN.
