<p>Similar to the primary screen, secondary screen plates were arrayed with dsRNA (250 ng) targeting a different region of the genes identified in the primary screen (DRSC). WNV infections were performed in duplicate at a higher (20) and lower (5) MOI (18% and 4% respectively). Infections with other viruses used the same protocol as WNV and were fixed at the following hours post-infection: WNV-KUN - 48 hrs (MOI = 10), DENV - 72 hrs (MOI = 10), SINV – 40 hrs (MOI = 5), VSV – 24 hrs (MOI = 1), RVFV MP12 – 30 hrs (MOI = 1). Robust Z-scores in each duplicate viral infection set of ≥1.5 or ≤1.5 in duplicate (∼40% change) were considered ‘hits’ (p&lt;0.009); none of the negative controls (non-targeting) were identified as positive, and all of the positive controls (dsRNA against virus genome) were identified.</p>
