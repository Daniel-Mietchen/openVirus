<p>For the primary WNV screen dsRNAs targeting 13,071 genes were pre-arrayed in thirty-two 384-well plates at 250 ng per well (Ambion). 16,000 DL1 cells were seeded in serum-free Schneider's media (10 uL/well). One hour later complete media was added (20 uL/well). Three days post plating, cells were infected with WNV at an MOI of 10 (10 uL/well). 48 hours post infection cells were fixed (4% formaldehyde), and a mAb against WNV NS1 (9-NS1) was used to identify infected cells (anti-mouse Alexa-fluor488 (Jackson Immunochemicals)) and counterstained with Hoechst 33342 to monitor nuclei. 3 images per well were captured at 20× using an automated microscope (ImageXpressMicro) and analyzed using MetaXpress software. Average infection and nuclei number were calculated for each site and averaged for each well. The percent infection was log-transformed, and the median and interquartile range were used to calculate a z-score: (log
 <sub>10</sub>(%infection)-log
 <sub>10</sub>(median))/(IQR*0.74) for each plate. The entire screen was performed in duplicate and those wells with Robust Z-scores≥to 2.0 or ≤to −2.0 in both replicates were considered ‘hits’.
