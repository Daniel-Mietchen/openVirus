<p>DL1 and Aag-2 cells were grown as previously described 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. BHK, U2OS, and 293T cells were maintained as previously described 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Moser1" ref-type="bibr">[102]</xref>. 293T cells harboring WNV subgenomic replicon were maintained as previously described

 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Pierson1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. Cerebellar granule cell neurons from neonatal (E6) wild-type C57BL/6 mice were generated from cerebella dissected in HBSS and dissociated in 1 mg/ml trypsin with 125 U/ml DNAse (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 20 min. Enzymatic digestion was quenched with DMEM/10% FCS and the tissue was pelleted, washed in HBSS, dissociated by trituration through a P-200 pipette tip and layered on a Percoll gradient. Cells were plated in neurobasal media (Gibco) supplemented with B-27 serum-free supplement (Gibco) on poly-D-lysine (PDL)-treated dishes for 1 hour to remove adherent glial cells. Nonadherent cells were then washed in HBSS, counted plated on PDL-coated wells in serum-free DMEM (supplemented with N2 growth medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) and 20 mM KCl. Cultures were &gt;95% pure and were used 3 to 4 days later for lentivirus infections 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Szretter1" ref-type="bibr">[103]</xref>. Antibodies were obtained from the following sources, anti-WNV NS1 (9-NS1; 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Chung1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>), anti-RVFV N (1D8 – gift from C. Schmaljohn), anti-hTIP60 (abcam, ab23886) and Alexa-488 donkey anti-mouse secondary (Jackson Immunochemicals). The following inhibitors were used: Leptomycin B (SIGMA) 50 ng/ml; Dichloracetic Acid (SIGMA) 60 µM; Hexokinase II inhibitor II (Calbiochem) 0.1 mM.
