<p>RUVBL1 had antiviral activity in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mosquito cells. Depletion of dRUVBL1 in adult flies converted a non-pathogenic infection by WNV-KUN or VSV into a pathogenic infection with increased mortality and viral replication. These data suggest that RUVBL1 has a highly conserved role in antiviral defense in insects, including mosquito vectors. RUVBL1 is an AAA+ ATPase implicated in many cellular pathways 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Jha1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> and that interacts with a number of other molecules that impact its function. By methodically suppressing each of its known interacting partners, we found that components of the Tip60 chromatin-remodeling complex (TIP60, EP400 and RUVBL2) that regulates transcription 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Jha1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> were antiviral against multiple viruses in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mosquito cells. dTip60 also was antiviral in adult flies. Furthermore, silencing of RUVBL1 led to increased viral infection in human cultured cells and primary mouse neurons. Silencing of TIP60 in human cells also rendered them more susceptible to WNV infection. Together, these results suggest a conserved role for the Tip60 complex in antiviral defense across phylogeny. WNV subgenomic replicons were used to show that the requirement for these genes in restriction is downstream of entry and upstream of viral assembly, suggesting a restriction of translation, polyprotein processing and/or RNA replication. While further investigation is required to determine the Tip60 targets that are responsible for the antiviral activity and the precise step of the lifecycle impacted, the identification of a chromatin remodeling complex as broadly antiviral is intriguing. Innate immunity is controlled, in large part, through the tight regulation of sequential gene expression programs that have effector function to restrict pathogen replication. We recently characterized a complex and rapid transcriptional antiviral host program active in insects that includes both primary responses which are translation-independent and secondary responses that are translation-dependent 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Half of this response was controlled at the level of transcriptional pausing, which also plays a role in innate immune responses in mammals

 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Bhatt2" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>. This antiviral transcriptional program was active against a broad panel of viruses, as we found with the Tip60 complex here. Thus, we hypothesize that the Tip60 chromatin remodeling complex may contribute to the orchestration of this sophisticated antiviral transcriptional response.
