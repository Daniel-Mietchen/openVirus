<p>A recent study found that RUVBL2 was antiviral against influenza virus by interfering with nucleoprotein (NP) oligomerization that drives viral RNA polymerase activity in the nucleus; however, in contrast to our findings, this effect was independent of RUVBL1 function 
 <xref rid="ppat.1003914-Kakugawa1" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>. This may be a distinct and direct role for RUVBL2 in influenza replication independent of the role for the Tip60 complex in antiviral defense.
