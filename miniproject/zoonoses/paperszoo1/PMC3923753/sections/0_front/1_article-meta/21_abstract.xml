 <p>West Nile virus (WNV) is an insect-borne virus that has re-emerged globally and for which there are no specific therapeutics or vaccines. We set out to identify cellular factors that impact infection using Drosophila as a model insect. Using a genome-wide RNAi screen we identified a large number of genes that altered WNV infection. We focused on genes that restricted infection and validated 50 genes that were conserved from insects to humans that inhibited infection. Since WNV is a flavivirus, we tested whether additional flaviviruses were restricted by these genes and found that 17 also had antiviral activity against Dengue virus. There are additional families of insect-transmitted viruses that infect humans. Accordingly, we tested whether these genes also were antiviral against the bunyavirus Rift Valley Fever virus, the alphavirus Sindbis virus and the rhabdovirus Vesicular Stomatitis virus. From this analysis, we identified seven genes that are antiviral against all of these divergent arthropod-borne pathogens expanding our knowledge of cell-intrinsic immunity in insects. Lastly, we found that XPO1 and the Tip60 complex had antiviral activity in mammalian cells. These data demonstrate the existence of previously unknown antiviral genes that restrict infection of multiple viruses across divergent hosts.</p>
