 <p>Background: The extent to which climate change may affect human health by increasing risk from vector-borne diseases has been under considerable debate.</p>
 <p>Objectives: We quantified potential effects of future climate change on the basic reproduction number (
  <italic>R</italic>
  <sub>0</sub>) of the tick vector of Lyme disease, 
  <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic>, and explored their importance for Lyme disease risk, and for vector-borne diseases in general.
 </p>
 <p>Methods: We applied observed temperature data for North America and projected temperatures using regional climate models to drive an 
  <italic>I. scapularis</italic> population model to hindcast recent, and project future, effects of climate warming on 
  <italic>R</italic>
  <sub>0</sub>. Modeled 
  <italic>R</italic>
  <sub>0</sub> increases were compared with 
  <italic>R</italic>
  <sub>0</sub> ranges for pathogens and parasites associated with variations in key ecological and epidemiological factors (obtained by literature review) to assess their epidemiological importance.
 </p>
 <p>Results: 
  <italic>R</italic>
  <sub>0</sub> for 
  <italic>I. scapularis</italic> in North America increased during the years 1971–2010 in spatio-temporal patterns consistent with observations. Increased temperatures due to projected climate change increased 
  <italic>R</italic>
  <sub>0</sub> by factors (2–5 times in Canada and 1.5–2 times in the United States), comparable to observed ranges of 
  <italic>R</italic>
  <sub>0</sub> for pathogens and parasites due to variations in strains, geographic locations, epidemics, host and vector densities, and control efforts.
 </p>
 <p>Conclusions: Climate warming may have co-driven the emergence of Lyme disease in northeastern North America, and in the future may drive substantial disease spread into new geographic regions and increase tick-borne disease risk where climate is currently suitable. Our findings highlight the potential for climate change to have profound effects on vectors and vector-borne diseases, and the need to refocus efforts to understand these effects.</p>
