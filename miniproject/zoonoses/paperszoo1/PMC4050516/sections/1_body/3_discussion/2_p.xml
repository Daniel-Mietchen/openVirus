<p>The immediate importance of future increased 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> of 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> in the northeast and upper Midwest of North America is that 
 <italic>a</italic>) regions currently climatically unsuitable become suitable for 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> establishment (i.e., 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> changes from &lt; 1 to &gt; 1; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>); 
 <italic>b</italic>) in regions currently suitable for 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> (where 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 1), tick invasion speed will accelerate as the likelihood of stochastic tick population fade-out reduces (
 <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">May et al. 2001</xref>), and tick-borne pathogen invasion speed increases due to increasing tick abundance (
 <xref rid="r62" ref-type="bibr">Ogden et al. 2007</xref>); and 
 <italic>c</italic>) risk from 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic>â€“transmitted pathogens may increase where the tick and pathogen are already established due to increased tick abundance up to a point at which this is limited by density-dependent regulation (
 <xref rid="r62" ref-type="bibr">Ogden et al. 2007</xref>). To date, 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> invasion in the northern United States and Canada has been followed by invasion of the agent of Lyme disease, 
 <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> sensu stricto (
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">Hamer et al. 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="r66" ref-type="bibr">Ogden et al. 2013</xref>), hence we assume northward 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> range expansion is synonymous with expansion in Lyme disease risk.
