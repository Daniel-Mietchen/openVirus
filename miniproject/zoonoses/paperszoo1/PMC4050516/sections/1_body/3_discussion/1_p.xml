<p>These findings suggest that increasing temperatures in northern North America that support an 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> for 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> of &gt; 1.5 have been coincident with, or in advance of, but not subsequent to, expanding numbers of locations where 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> populations have become established. In Canada, where we have tracked the spread of 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic>, temperature has remained a statistically significant determinant of 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> occurrence in field studies and analyses of surveillance data that accounted for alternative environmental determinants (e.g., host abundance, altitude, rainfall, habitat types, tick immigration rates) (

 <xref rid="r69" ref-type="bibr">Ogden et al. 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="r64" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). These observations supported a key role for temperature in 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> populations becoming established at the northern edge of the tick’s range. Also, 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> population expansion in Canada is occurring despite an overall deforestation (
 <xref rid="r58" ref-type="bibr">Natural Resources Canada 2013</xref>) rather than the reforestation thought to have driven the initial reemergence of Lyme disease in the United States (
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">Barbour and Fish 1993</xref>). Forest fragmentation may enhance Lyme disease risk for a variety of reasons; however, 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> ticks are invading Canada where forest fragmentation occurred over time scales long predating current 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> invasion (
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">Elliott 1998</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that even if recent warming in the region (5–10% increases in DD &gt; 0°C; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) was not associated with global warming, a future warming climate will increase 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> of 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> in northern North America. Increases in 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> may drive increased Lyme disease risk where it is already endemic (within limits determined by density-dependent regulation of the tick) and drive range expansion into more northern regions where it is currently absent. Furthermore, they support the hypothesis that climate warming in northeastern North America may have co-driven the emergence of Lyme disease risk, alongside other hypothesized factors such as reforestation and burgeoning deer populations (
 <xref rid="r94" ref-type="bibr">Wood and Lafferty 2013</xref>), by facilitating the spread of 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> from refuges. Expansion of 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> in the northern United States has then provided the source of ticks to fuel its northward expansion into Canada.
