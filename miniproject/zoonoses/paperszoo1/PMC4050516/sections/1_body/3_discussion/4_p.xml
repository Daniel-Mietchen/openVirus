 <sub>0</sub> increases associated with climate change may be limited in some circumstances. Host population densities and habitat do not seem to be currently limiting on 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> range expansion, but they may be in the future. Mosquitoes and other dipteran vectors can be dispersed by wind (
 <xref rid="r84" ref-type="bibr">Service 1997</xref>), but ticks need hosts for their dispersal to effect range expansion. 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> are dispersed over long distances by migratory birds, but ticks that are not carried by migratory animals would be expected to have less capacity to invade climatically suitable environments. Ticks of public health importance such as 
 <italic>I. ricinus</italic> and 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> are mostly host and woodland habitat generalists, which facilitates range changes, whereas the more highly specialized the niche of a species, the less likely it will be to be dispersed and/or capable of becoming established in new locations (
