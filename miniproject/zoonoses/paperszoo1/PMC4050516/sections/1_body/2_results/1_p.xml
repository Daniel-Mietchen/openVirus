 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> in the late 1970s—when Lyme disease emerged in the northeastern United States (
 <xref rid="r94" ref-type="bibr">Wood and Lafferty 2013</xref>)—was estimated at approximately 3 and 1.9 in Old Lyme and Fort McCoy, respectively; at between 2 and 3 in Southern Ontario; approximately 1.5 in Huron Ontario and South-Western Quebec, but mostly &lt; 1 in Upper Southern Ontario and the Boreal region (

 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> increased almost linearly to approximately 3.5 by 1999 during the first period of expansion of 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> in the northeastern United States. In Fort McCoy, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> increased slightly, but this increase was small compared with interannual variations. In Southern Ontario, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> increased to 4 by the early 2000s; during which time 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> populations emerged at a number of locations in this region (Point Pelee National Park, Turkey Point, Rondeau Provincial Park;

 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> increased from 1.5 to 2.5 by the early 2000s; and subsequent to this (mostly from 2000 onward), 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> populations began to emerge in South-Western Quebec (

 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> increased to &gt; 1 in the late 1990s, but in the Boreal region

 <sub>0</sub> remained below unity for the whole 1971–2010 period (
