 <sub>0</sub> values for 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> obtained in model simulations using projected climate data were similar for an ensemble of climate models, and we used bias-corrected output from the regional climate model CRCM4.2.3 as a representative of the ensemble because of its spatial resolution and predictive accuracy. 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> for 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> in Canada was projected to increase 1.5 to 2.3 times from the period 1971–2000 to 2001–2050, and 2.2 to 4.6 times from the period 1971–2000 to 2051–2069 depending on location (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>); and in the United States, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> was predicted to approximately double to 7.1 and 5.2 in Old Lyme (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) and Fort McCoy, respectively, by 2051–2069 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Increases in 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> to values &gt; 1 predicted in regions where 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> was &lt; 1 during the period 1970–2000 would be expected to facilitate range expansion of 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> northward and possibly westward (
