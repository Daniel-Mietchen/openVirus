 <italic>I. scapularis</italic>, we performed a literature review to obtain published estimates of how 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> for parasites and pathogens varies due to changes in factors already recognized as having ecological or epidemiological importance. These include variations in geographic location, host density, strain or genotype, disease control effort, and variations among different epidemics. Articles were searched in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information PubMed search site (

 <italic>a</italic>) “basic reproduction number,” without specifying pathogens or parasites, and then 
 <italic>b</italic>) “basic reproductive number,” repeated with one of the following terms: tick, mosquito, chagas, malaria, dengue, nematode, “seasonal influenza,” “pandemic influenza”, pH1N1, “avian influenza,” measles, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), and fluke. Abstracts were reviewed, and relevant articles were reviewed in full. Relevant articles were those in which 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> for parasites and pathogens was calculated to explicitly estimate its value under field, rather than theoretical, conditions. This meant articles that employed simulation models using field data, fitting of epidemiological data (e.g., age–seroprevalence or age–infection prevalence), or other methods such as estimates from phylogenetic analysis. We did not review and use 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> ranges obtained in model-based sensitivity analyses, variations in 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> associated with seasonal variations in mosquito abundance in one location (which may vary from zero to very high values), estimates where control methods effectively eradicated disease resulting in almost infinite values for changes in 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, or model-predicted variations across whole potential geographic ranges that range from a theoretical high to zero values (e.g., 
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">Estrada-Peña et al. 2013</xref>). We also did not use some very high modeled ranges of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> for malaria [e.g., 1–11,000 (
 <xref rid="r85" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al. 2007</xref>)] when the modeling of empirical age–infection prevalence data produced strongly contrasting single-digit estimates of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> (
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">Hagmann et al. 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">Hay et al. 2005</xref>). The goal of the literature search was to provide an illustration of how important projected changes in 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> of 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> could be, compared with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> of other parasites and pathogens; it was not intended to be an exhaustive cataloging of all literature in this field. Further, we recognized that 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> estimates are not precise and vary according to the estimation method used (
 <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">Heffernan et al. 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2011</xref>).
