 <italic>Mapping</italic> R
 <italic>
  <sub>0</sub> under current and future climate
 </italic>. We mapped 30-year mean values of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> for 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> using observed and projected values. Maps of DD &gt; 0°C for North America north of 40°N and east of the Rocky Mountains were generated using observed data for 1971–2000, and using DD &gt; 0°C projected by bias-corrected CRCM4.2.3 output for the period 2001–2070. We then computed 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> for each year from the gridded DD &gt; 0°C data using the formula 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 1.072 × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> DD &gt; 0°C–4.658 × 10
 <sup>–3</sup> DD &gt; 0°C
 <sup>2</sup> + 5.556, obtained using observed temperature data as described in Supplemental Material, “Mapping 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>,”pp. 15–16, Figure S9 (the threshold for 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> ≥ 1 was DD &gt; 0°C ≥ 2859.6°C). We then mapped mean 30-year values for 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> for the periods 1971–2000, 2011–2040, and 2041–2070 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Regions west of the Rocky Mountains were masked because it was assumed that 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> will not cross the Rocky Mountains, west of which Lyme disease risk will continue to depend on transmission of 
 <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> by the tick 
 <italic>I. pacificus</italic> (
