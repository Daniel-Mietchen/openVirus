  <sub>0</sub> under current climate
 </italic>. For observed temperatures, we used Australian National University Splines (ANUSPLIN) (
 <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">Hutchinson et al. 2009</xref>) of 10-km gridded daily time-series data, which were obtained by thin-plate smoothing spline interpolation of daily climate station observations while accounting for latitude, longitude, and elevation. ANUSPLIN data cover the 40 years (1971–2010) that encompass the period of Lyme disease emergence in North America, have coverage across northern North America, and account for missing data by temporal and spatial interpolation. A mean daily near-surface temperature was assigned to the 32 study sites, which were weather stations located over a wide range of the orographic and forest ecosystems of Ontario and Quebec or interpolations of ANUSPLIN data for locations in the United States. Monthly mean near-surface air temperatures were used to parameterize the 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> population model for estimating annual values of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> for each site, for each year from 1971 to 2010 (see Supplemental Material, “Variation in temperature and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> amongst sites,” pp. 2–6). Values for annual cumulative degree days &gt; 0°C (DD &gt; 0°C), contemporaneous for each estimated 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> value, were computed as the accumulation of daily temperature &gt; 0°C for each year for each site. The tick model calculated 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> for each year using temperature data for that year, but in reality 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> will depend on the temperature conditions over the 2- to 3-year life cycle of the tick. Therefore, we used the moving average of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> over 3 years (that year, the previous year, and the subsequent year) to describe 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> for each year for each site; so for each site, we obtained a time series for 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and DD &gt; 0°C for 38 years (1972–2009) and DD &gt; 0°C for 40 years (1971–2010).
