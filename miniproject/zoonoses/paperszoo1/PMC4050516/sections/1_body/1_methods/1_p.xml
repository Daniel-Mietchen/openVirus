<p>We estimated

 <sub>0</sub> under current and future projected climatic conditions at 30 sites in Canada that formed two roughly south–north transects in Ontario and Quebec, two Canadian provinces where 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> ticks are becoming established. These transects were chosen to capture the climate variability that exists in the region. For simplicity in data presentation, the sites were grouped into clusters [Southern Ontario, Huron Ontario, Upper Southern Ontario, South-Western Quebec, and the Boreal region (see Supplemental Material, Table S1 and Figure S1)] according to geographic proximity and similarity in temperature conditions (see Supplemental Material, “Variation in temperature and

 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> for two sites in the United States where Lyme disease is endemic in the Northeast and upper Midwest, respectively: Old Lyme (Connecticut), where the human Lyme disease cases were first recognized (
