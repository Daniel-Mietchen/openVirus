<p>We chose bias-corrected output from Canadian RCM CRCM4.2.3, version 4 (

 <xref rid="r56" ref-type="bibr">Music and Caya 2007</xref>) to provide temperature data for the 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> model because it relatively accurately and conservatively hindcasted observed ANUSPLIN data in comparison with other climate models and because it provided projected temperatures at a local scale. For full details justifying the climate model selection, see Supplemental Material, “Validation of climate model output,”pp. 11–14, Figures S7 and S8. Like other RCMs, CRCM4.2.3 dynamically downscales output from a coarser resolution GCM and produces data at a horizontal resolution of approximately 50 km. CRCM4.2.3 is driven by initial and boundary conditions of the Canadian GCM CGCM3.1 T47 (McFarlane et al. 2005; 
 <xref rid="r82" ref-type="bibr">Scinocca et al. 2008</xref>). Hindcasting up to 2000 used greenhouse gas emissions for CGCM3.1 T47 as in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) 20th century experiment (
 <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">Meehl et al. 2000</xref>). For future projections starting in 2001, we chose the A2 scenario (mid-high Green-House-Gas emission scenario) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
 <italic>Special Report on Emission Scenarios</italic> (
 <xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr">Nakicenovic and Swart 2000</xref>) because of the availability of regional climate model output using this scenario and because current actual trajectory of emissions corresponded best to this emissions scenario.
