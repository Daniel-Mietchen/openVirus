<p>Many vector-borne diseases of public health significance (e.g., Lyme disease, West Nile virus) are, however, maintained in transmission cycles that involve wild animal hosts. These cycles are independent of human cases, and the spatio-temporal risk of human disease is less dependent on the direct effects of human activities than is the risk from malaria and dengue. Nevertheless, despite some assessments (
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">Gubler et al. 2001</xref>), the effects of climate change on vector-borne zoonoses have also been downplayed mostly on the basis of limited evidence for recent effects of climate change (
 <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">Kilpatrick and Randolph 2012</xref>). Lyme disease emerged (or likely reemerged) in the northeastern United States in the late 1970s due to the expansion of tick populations, which was generally thought to have been associated with changes in land use over some decades that resulted in reforestation and expansion of the population of the deer that are key hosts for the ticks (
