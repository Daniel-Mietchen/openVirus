<p>A mechanistic simulation model of the 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> life cycle has identified temperature effects on 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> population survival in order to assist in assessment of current and future on-the-ground Lyme disease risk in Canada (

 <xref rid="r68" ref-type="bibr">2006b</xref>). Prospective field studies and retrospective analyses of surveillance data on tick and pathogen emergence in southeastern Canada validated the model findings and identified temperature as a statistically significant determinant and possible driver of emergence of the tick in Canada (

 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and its estimation for a wide range of parasites and pathogens under many different conditions, allowed comparison of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> variations in the present study with observed variations for other parasites and pathogens.
