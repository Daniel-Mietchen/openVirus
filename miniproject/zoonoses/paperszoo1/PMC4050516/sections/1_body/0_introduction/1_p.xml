<p>Considerable attention has been devoted to the possibility that climate change will exacerbate the burden of mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue, with important impacts on public health (
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">Githeko et al. 2000</xref>). Early assessments of the effects of climate change on malaria and dengue used simplistic models to assess possible effects of climate change on their basic reproductive numbers (

 <sub>0</sub>, the universally recognized metric of the capacity of a parasite or pathogen to reproduce given particular environmental conditions) (
 <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">Martens et al. 1995</xref>;

 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">Githeko et al. 2012</xref>). Consequently, the strength of evidence for recent climate warming effects on malaria risk has been questioned and much debated (
