<p>We estimated the degree to which projected climate change may impact the ecology of arthropod vectors and, by inference, vector-borne diseases. The emergence of Lyme disease in North America may itself have been partly driven by recent climate change. Confidence in our projections is increased by observed changes in temperature and estimated

Our findings suggest that effort should be refocused on assessing the health risks due to vector-borne disease, particularly vector-borne zoonoses, associated with our changing climate.
