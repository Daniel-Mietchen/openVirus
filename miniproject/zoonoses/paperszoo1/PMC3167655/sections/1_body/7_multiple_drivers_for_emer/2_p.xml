<p>Current unpublished MEZE work in Kosova is showing that multiple drivers may be driving cycles of CCHFV and 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> ticks. It appears that a combination of the decline in agriculture (hence the encroachment of scrub and grassland close to the village fringe), the dramatic increase in reservoir host numbers as a possible consequence of predator decline, coupled with the importation of virus-naive livestock (following the recent conflict), could all be contributory factors to increasing the abundance and public exposure of 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> and enhancing the circulation of CCHFV in ticks in parts of rural Kosova.
