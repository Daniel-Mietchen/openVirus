<p>The arrival and expansion of BTV, CHIKV and USUV raises questions as to which pathogens and/or vectors will next appear in Europe. Will we see the movement of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) from Africa and the Arabian Peninsula? Will CCHFV expand to match the distribution of its vector? Will 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, the principal vector of dengue (DENV), spread from Madeira to mainland Portugal and beyond? Looking further ahead perhaps, will we see the re-emergence of malaria and DENV to previously endemic zones in the Mediterranean basin (for example malaria occurred in Italy and large outbreaks of DENV occurred in Greece, although the latter will be dependant on the spread of invasive 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>)? The latter few might seem fanciful, but we should not be complacent. If we learn any lesson from the past, it is time to expect, and prepare, for the unexpected.
