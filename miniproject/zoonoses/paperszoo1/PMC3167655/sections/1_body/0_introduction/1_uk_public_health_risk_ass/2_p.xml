<p>Since 2003, the Human Animal Infections Risk Surveillance (HAIRS) group, coordinated by the Health Protection Agency (HPA), has provided expert advice on emerging infections to the UK Chief Medical Officer's National Expert Panel on New and Emerging Infections. This group draws in experts largely from the medical and veterinary sectors across the UK
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref> and assesses the risks posed to UK public health by potential emerging infectious diseases threats using a published methodology.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref> The Medical Entomology and Zoonoses Ecology (MEZE) group at HPA are members of HAIRS, providing input to discussions primarily on vectorborne zoonoses (VBZ). When considering the possible risks of infections that essentially occur within nature (whether it be wildlife, or an invertebrate vector), various considerations are required that may be crucial to the final assessment of public health risk.
