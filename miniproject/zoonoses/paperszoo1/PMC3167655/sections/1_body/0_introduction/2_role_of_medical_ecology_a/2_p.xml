<p>Such pathogens occur in enzootic cycles within nature, with humans often acting as incidental hosts. To fully understand and to better predict the dynamics of associated human disease outbreaks, we need to have an intimate knowledge of their ecology and transmission cycle. Without such an understanding, the ability to prepare for, react to, and mitigate the effect of these pathogens is severely hindered. An ecological perspective to the risk assessment process can quickly shed light on what appears initially as an unpredictable complex disease dynamic. In contrast, it can also complicate a seemingly simple disease formula. It may also provide greater opportunities to disrupt the transmission cycle at its weakest point, which in turn can reduce or eliminate the public health burden.</p>
