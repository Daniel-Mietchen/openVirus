<p>A large proportion of emerging human pathogens have a zoonotic source and many of these have wildlife origins or are transmitted via arthropod vectors.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref> Given the prospects of climate change, coupled with large-scale ecological and agricultural change, the dynamics of these pathogens will ebb and flow and we are already beginning to see signs of this in Europe.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref> With increasing global travel and trade, the geographic distributions of key vectors and their pathogens are equally dynamic.
