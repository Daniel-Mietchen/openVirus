<p>This review does not aim to cover all components of disease emergence such as clinical, virological, bacteriological or immunological changes; although the authors agree such drivers have equal importance. This article will purely review where an ecological/entomological input has been required by MEZE in assessing VBZ risk and, using examples elsewhere in Europe, provide an overview of other ecologically driven disease transmission scenarios that have relevance to informing policy decisions and risk assessment on VBZ; concluding with some discussion of what challenges might arise in the UK over the next 50 years.</p>
