<p>Similarly, one of the primary vectors of RVFV is 
 <italic>A. vexans</italic>, which also exists as a species complex including subspecies 
 <italic>vexans</italic> and 
 <italic>arabiensis</italic>; for example, 
 <italic>A. vexans arabiensis</italic> is an important vector in Senegal and Saudi Arabia. 
 <italic>A. vexans</italic> occurs also in parts of western Europe
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0044">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0045">45</xref> and in a recent study involving MEZE in Epping Forest was found to cause nuisance biting close to the London Olympics village site.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0046">46</xref> Should this be a concern, and should we assess its taxonomy and vector competence?
