<p>A number of studies, including those by MEZE on WNV and SINV, have taken an entomological perspective to risk assessment, by reviewing the status, behaviour and distribution of putative vector species.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0043">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0047">47</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0049">49</xref> This rapidly identifies which species could function as vectors, their likely aquatic breeding sites (and hence synanthropic/sylvatic issues) and, if known, their biting behaviour. Often important data are lacking, particularly information on the host preferences (for example bird or horse biting) of certain vector species, which can be significant in understanding transmission cycles and disease risk. Such reviews also help to target research gaps for field entomology and ecology and to identify key species for vector competence studies and viral isolations.
