<p>For non-medical entomologists, a list of potential vector species and their distribution can be misleading without specific knowledge on their biology, ecology, classification and vector competence. Recent examples of this relate to potential mosquito vectors of WNV and RVFV. During the outbreak of WNV in North America, C. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> was quickly implicated as a key vector in the eastern states.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0040">40</xref> In the UK it exists as two separate forms, an exclusive ornithophagic 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> form, and predominantly mammalophilic (also partly ornithophilic) 
 <italic>molestus</italic> form.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0041">41</xref> These two forms adopt hugely different behaviour and aquatic habitats and do not, as far as we are aware, hybridize. In the USA, however they do and some studies have found that 40% of C. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> are hybrids and consequently feed on both birds and humans, thus driving the transmission cycle.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0042">42</xref> In the UK then, although our 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> form might be an important enzootic vector, it is unlikely to be a human vector despite its synanthropic container breeding habits and its propensity for over-wintering in the cool recesses of houses.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0043">43</xref> The status of the British forms of this mosquito is still a topic of much debate in DNA barcoding circles.
