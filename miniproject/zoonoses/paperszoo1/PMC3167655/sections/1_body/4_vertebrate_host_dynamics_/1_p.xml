<p>Knowledge of the involvement of vertebrate species as reservoirs or amplifying species can rapidly affect the level of risk attributed to an emerging disease. Even with an abundant vector population, the absence of key vertebrate hosts for all or part of the year is significant. Studies from Sweden and Finland on Sindbis virus (SINV; the cause of Ockelbo and Pogosta diseases in humans) illustrate this point very well.
