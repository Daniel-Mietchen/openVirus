<p>This work concluded that particular tetraonid bird species 
 <italic>(Tetrao urogallus, Tetrao tetrao)</italic> that amplify the virus in Finland
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0054">54</xref> also occur in Britain, but only in a few Scottish forest and moorland sites. Both species are rare and consequently unlikely to be important in amplifying the virus or contributing significantly to virus cycles in birds. Given the ubiquity of passerines in the UK however, and their general role as reservoirs in Sweden, it is suggested that perhaps a lack of reservoir hosts might not be a limiting factor in transmission. However, Swedish studies found that human outbreaks of Ockelbo disease appeared to be linked to the occurrence of certain migratory thrush species.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0055">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0057">57</xref> Redwing 
 <italic>(Turdus iliacus</italic>), fieldfare 
 <italic>(T. pilaris)</italic> and song thrush 
 <italic>(T. philomelos)</italic> were found to have high prevalence rates for virus and were implicated as key amplifying hosts. These species breed in Sweden in the summer and have large numbers of fledgelings during the main peak in mosquito activity. In autumn, redwing and fieldfare fly south to spend the winter in Britain, usually after the peak in mosquitoes, and hence are unlikely to contribute significantly to virus amplification. An understanding of the role of different hosts and bird life histories can significantly change our perception of disease risk.
