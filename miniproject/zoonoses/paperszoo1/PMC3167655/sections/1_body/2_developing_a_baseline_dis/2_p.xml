<p>Without substantive and ongoing funded programmes to map vector species, the sustainable and affordable option is to capitalize on and engage the volunteer recording network. In the UK, naturalists and scientists have been recording species occurrence since the eighteenth century, with 15 million records of 12,000 species currently held by the Biological Records Centre.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0036">36</xref> Of course much of the data relate to non-vector species of biodiversity interest, but it illustrates the potential of thousands of invertebrate recorders willing to submit data. In 2005, MEZE established a tick recording scheme,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0038">38</xref> Added to 4500 historical records, this provides our best data set for ticks, and is now being used to facilitate geo-spatial mapping.A similar initiative for mosquitoes has also been running since 2005.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0039">39</xref> Although this kind of data are often regarded as ‘
 <italic>ad hoc</italic>’ and unsystematic, they inform public and veterinary health authorities where nuisance-biting vectors occur, provide an early warning system for exotic or expanding species and provide a bank of samples for pathogen analysis. Furthermore, it is very cost-effective and requires the time of the scheme coordinators to perform and validate identifications.
