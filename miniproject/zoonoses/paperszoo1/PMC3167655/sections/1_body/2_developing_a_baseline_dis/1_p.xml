<p>A crucial component to any risk assessment on VBZ is knowledge of the distribution and abundance of potential vector species. Without this baseline data it is impossible to assess whether a ‘new finding’ of an unusual or exotic species is significant. It is not generally considered to be cost-effective to have long-term nationwide surveillance programmes for all potential vectors, particularly when they do not currently transmit disease. Occasionally, there are funded programmes that monitor species abundance at a number of key sites across a country and these data are important; however it tells us very little about the nationwide distribution of vector species. It is also of limited use in the development of predictive distribution maps, unless the survey locations are both numerous and reflect the sufficient diversity of ecozones. Recently, in response to the outbreak of CHIKV in Italy, ECDC funded a project to map the European distribution of 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic>. In less than 3 months, and following concerted European-wide collaboration between entomologists, a map now exists for this exotic mosquito species across more than 20 countries. This has facilitated predictive mapping of their current distribution and the potential consequences of climate change.
