<p>A recent example studied by MEZE has identified a different implication to the movement of wildlife zoonoses through pet travel. There is currently much debate in the UK over the relaxation of tapeworm control in dogs returning to the UK from continental Europe.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0086">86</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0088">88</xref> Current controls are in place to maintain the UK free of 
 <italic>E. multilocularis</italic>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0089">89</xref> which is an emerging urban zoonosis in continental Europe
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0090">90</xref> exacerbated by the urban fox population.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0091">91</xref> This parasite occurs within enzootic cycles between voles (including the water vole, 
 <italic>Arvicola terrestris</italic>) and the fox (
 <italic>Vulpes vulpes</italic>). A recent assessment by MEZE
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0092">92</xref> has highlighted that in addition to the public health issues, the importation of this parasite by dogs into the UK could undermine current UK wildlife policy
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0093">93</xref> and legislation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0094">94</xref> that promote the protection of water voles and enhance both their habitats and the grassland habitats of another potential reservoir host, the field vole 
 <italic>(Microtus agrestis).</italic> Coupled with an established urban fox population there is the prospect that an inadvertent importation of this parasite on health risk assessment grounds could conflict with environmental impact assessment, thus undermining green initiatives and establishing enzootic cycles that would be difficult to eradicate. MEZE findings
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0092">92</xref> also question whether such an act could be at odds with EU legislation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0095">95</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0096">96</xref> on non-native species and their effect on native fauna.
