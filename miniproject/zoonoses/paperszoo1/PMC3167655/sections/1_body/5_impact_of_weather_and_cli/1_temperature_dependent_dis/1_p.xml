<p>Many aspects of ecological systems are affected by climatic changes, particularly the effect of temperature. The expected change in summer and winter temperature as a consequence of climate change will change vector behaviour and seasonality, and often this requires a longer-term assessment of risk. For example, phlebotomine sandflies are acutely responsive to temperature changes and new reports of their survival further north (that is, north of the Mediterranean) have been reported in Germany.

 <italic>Phlebotomus</italic> sandflies are vectors of canine and human leishmaniasis, and there is a genuine concern that travelling dogs that are returning to the UK with 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites could create a reservoir of infection, which in the event of sandflies establishing could lead to local cycles.
