<p>These relatively simple uses of weather and climate data are providing important insights into the effects of climate change and possible changes in disease risk. However, climate should not be taken in isolation. Recent studies on TBEV in eastern Europe have shown that climate changes may be masking underlying societal changes, suggesting that economicand climate-influenced factors are combining to impact on the transmission of TBEV. For example, in the Baltic states there has been an increase in outdoor activities as a consequence of increased wealth since the decline of Communism; a decline in industry has changed the amount of local solar radiation, adapting the local climate, thus favouring co-incident seasonality of tick stages, thus increasing co-feeding transmission, and hence increased exposure to virus.
