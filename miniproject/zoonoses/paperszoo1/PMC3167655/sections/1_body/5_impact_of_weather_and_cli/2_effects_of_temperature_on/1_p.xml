<p>Many arthropod-borne pathogens undergo a period of development through the vector, known as the extrinsic incubation period. This period, particularly for parasites like 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and 
 <italic>Dirofilaria</italic>, is temperature dependent, with parasite development enhanced above a set temperature threshold. Laboratory and field studies on these two parasites in the USA on 
 <italic>Dirofilaria</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0065">65</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0068">68</xref> and in Russia on 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0069">69</xref> have aided MEZE and others in our predictions of the likely period of incubation of their larval stages through a hypothetical mosquito.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0070">70</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0072">72</xref> This enables us to predict currently (that is based on current weather patterns) how many days the development of the parasite through to the infective third larval stage might be permissible. This information is making us re-assess our opinions on whether northern Europe is too cold to prevent or limit transmission of seemingly tropical or Mediterranean pathogens. However, other factors, such as availability of infected hosts, abundance of receptive vectors and the impact of treatments, need to be considered.
