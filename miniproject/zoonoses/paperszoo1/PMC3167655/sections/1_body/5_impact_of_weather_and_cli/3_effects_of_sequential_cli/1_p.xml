<p>Studies on the impact of weather patterns on non-arthropod wildlife zoonotic infections, for example, those caused by Puumala virus, have shown that interpreting sequential climate events can allow prediction to be made about changes in the abundance of reservoir hosts (that is, 
 <italic>Myodes glareolus</italic> voles)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0073">73</xref> and outbreaks of human disease (for example 
 <italic>Nephropathia epidemica)</italic>.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0074">74</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0075">75</xref> The essence of this approach taken by MEZE is to predict the peak years in tree nut production that drive the peaks of vole cycles. In the case of beech 
 <italic>(Fagus sylvatica)</italic>, a sequence of climate events over 2–3 years stimulates a synchronous increase in seed/nut production; known as a ‘masting event’. The vole population consequently peaks the following year and stimulates an increased circulation of virus, which leads to outbreaks of human disease. Equally this has implications for other pathogens like 
 <italic>B.</italic>
 <italic>burgdorferi</italic> that circulates in rodent populations.
