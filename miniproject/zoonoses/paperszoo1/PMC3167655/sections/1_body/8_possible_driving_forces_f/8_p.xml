<p>In conclusion, possible environmental change may have significant impacts on the future changes in VBZ. It is paramount therefore that medical entomologists and epidemiologists work with ecologists, environmental scientists and land managers to pre-empt, prepare for and mitigate the possible changes in VBZ through environmental management. Achieving this preparedness and establishing routes of communication take time, but it should not be left to hastily prepared responses to nuisance biting or outbreaks of disease. A balanced evidence-based opinion is required whereby public health matters are considered, but not in an alarmist way that undermines biodiversity and water management objectives. We have the opportunity as public health practitioners to work with the environment sector to ensure that an increase in biodiversity does not lead to emergence or re-emergence of VBZ.</p>
