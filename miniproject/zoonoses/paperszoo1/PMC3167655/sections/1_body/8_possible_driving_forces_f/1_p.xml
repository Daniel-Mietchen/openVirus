<p>A key component of ‘horizon scanning’ is looking for future issues. Arthropod disease vectors such as mosquitoes and ticks are, like all invertebrates, acutely responsive to changes in their environment, with an ability to evolve to local climate rapidly. There has been much discussion over the role of weather and climate on infectious diseases, with some models able to predict future epidemics and new foci.Notable examples for RVFV,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0098">98</xref> meningitis,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0099">99</xref> malaria
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0100">100</xref> and TBEV
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0101">101</xref> have included environmental parameters such as rainfall, wind direction, temperature and seasonal climate. Much less discussion has focussed on non-climate-related environmental changes, or environmental changes as a consequence of adaptation to climate change. Some examples from a UK context are briefly discussed here.
