 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0121">121</xref> there is good reason to be cautious about the management of water in domestic settings. Currently water butts provide a suitable habitat for mosquito species such as C. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> and 
 <italic>Culiseta annulata</italic>, which are not currently involved as disease vectors in the UK. Following the introduction of an exotic vector species that can exploit these habitats, a re-assessment of our domestic husbandry regarding conserving water will be required, as occurs in Italy.
