<p>Allied to terrestrial UK initiatives are nationwide plans to return large parts of the UK's drained agricultural land to wetland, fen and salt marsh (for example UK Wetland Vision).
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0112">112</xref> This is likely to have huge biodiversity benefits by making the wildlife of existing wetlands more sustainable, increasing the general available resource for wildlife as well as providing better management of flood waters in low lying areas, river valleys and flood alleviation schemes in urban areas. It would seem prudent therefore that habitat creation plans include a health risk assessment component to the management plan, focusing on the possible effects on mosquito habitats and nuisance biting/disease transmission. MEZE are currently working on such an approach with the Great Fen Project; an environmental project that plans to restore &gt;3000 hectares of arable farmland in Cambridge-shire back to fen, wetland and wet woodland. Some question whether new wetland means more mosquitoes,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0113">113</xref> others argue that focus should be given to managing habitats for the vectors’ natural predators as they may have some role in keeping vector populations at manageable levels.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0114">114</xref> Wetland initiatives along the coast have other motives, such as creating salt marshes to help defend an eroding coastline (for example, in eastern England) or by inadvertently adapting coastal habitats to harness the power of tides, such as the Severn Tidal Barrage.
