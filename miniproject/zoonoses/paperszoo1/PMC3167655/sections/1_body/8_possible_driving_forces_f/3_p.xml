<p>It is not known what effect this will have on disease vectors. Undoubtedly it provides a more robust network for movement of vector hosts (for example, deer, small mammals) and an increase of ecotonal habitat (that is, habitat at the interface of two habitats, for example grassland and woodland) so often favoured by 
 <italic>I. ricinus</italic> ticks and their hosts (for example pheasant). Some authors argue that habitat de-fragmentation can increase the transmission of zoonotic and anthropozoonotic diseases by bringing humans, livestock, wildlife and their pathogens ever closer together.
