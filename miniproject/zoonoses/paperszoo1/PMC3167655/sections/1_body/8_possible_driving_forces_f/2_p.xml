<p>Biodiversity-enriching strategies are likely to have some impact on vector survival, activity and spread. Recent UK biodiversity initiatives promote habitat connectivity by encouraging wildlife corridors on a national

These strategies aim to de-fragment habitats, allowing more vulnerable species of nature conservation concern to move between habitats and hence respond to climatic changes. Often this landscape ecology approach encourages the parcelling of the landscape into habitat patches that form mosaics of biotypes linked by an ecological matrix connecting the fragments of species-rich habitats.
