<p>In Alaska, human cases are reportable to the SOE and animal and wildlife cases to the OSV (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0057">57</xref>). From 1946â€“2009, there have been 29 human cases of tularemia reported to the SOE. Since 2001, there have been five human cases. Four of the five resided in and were infected in Alaska. The majority of cases occurred in the summer and were likely to be related to time spent outdoors and exposure to vectors. There is no surveillance in animal or insect vector reservoirs in Alaska and cases in domestic animals are likely under-reported as animals are often treated empirically. There is a need to increase surveillance of disease in wildlife to be able to monitor the impact of climate change on epizootics events of tularemia.
