<p>Tularemia results from infection with the bacterium 
 <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> through the bite of an arthropod or through an open wound while handling contaminated water or animal carcasses, from the inhalation of dust from contaminated hay or soil, or from the consumption of inadequately cooked meat of infected animals. Person-to-person transmission has not been described. After a 3–5-day incubation period (range 1–10 days), any of five different presentations of tularemia may develop depending upon the portal of entry: (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>) Ulceroglandular, characterised by a painful skin lesion or ulceration with subsequent acutely enlarged and tender regional lymph nodes; the most common form. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>) Glandular with acutely enlarged and tender lymph nodes without skin lesions. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>) Oropharyngeal, severe exudative pharyngitis, sometimes accompanied by vomiting, abdominal pain or diarrhoea resulting from ingestion of the bacteria. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>) Oculoglandular severe conjunctivitis with regional lymph node involvement; the most rare form, (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>) Typhoidal tularemia with pneumonia, septicaemia and hepatosplenomegaly; the most severe form. Tularemia occurs throughout North America and northern Europe, China and Japan. Reservoirs include wild or feral animals: rabbits, hares, voles, muskrats, beavers and some domestic animals. A rodent–mosquito cycle has been described (
 <italic>F. tularensis</italic> sub-species 
 <italic>holarctica</italic>) in Scandinavia and Russia (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0055">55</xref>). In Alaska, both 
 <italic>F. tularensis</italic> sub-species holarctica and the more virulent subspecies tularensis have been isolated from patients (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0056">56</xref>). Humans are infected via the bite of an arthropod (commonly ticks in North America and mosquitos in northern Europe) or by inoculation through the skin, conjunctiva oropharyngeal mucosa via contaminated water, blood, and tissue while handling infected carcasses. Other routes include the ingestion of contaminated meat from infected animals or by the inhalation of contaminated dust from soil, grain, hay or animal pelts.
