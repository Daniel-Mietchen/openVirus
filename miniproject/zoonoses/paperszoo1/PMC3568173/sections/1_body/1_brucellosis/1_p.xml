<p>Brucellosis is a systemic disease caused by a number of different species of bacterium (
 <italic>Brucella</italic>) that may result in abortion, infertility and chronic infections in animals. The bacterium can be passed from domestic and wild animals to humans via ingestion of raw milk products, exposure to fluids and tissues of infected animals, through cuts or abraded skin and exposure by infectious aerosols via lungs and eyes. There are 10 species of 
 <italic>Brucella</italic> recognised in animals and some include different strains or biovars. Three main species are known to cause illness in humans: 
 <italic>Brucella abortus</italic> (from cattle and bison), 
 <italic>B. melitensis</italic> (from sheep and goats) and 
 <italic>B. suis</italic> (from pigs, caribou and reindeer). 
 <italic>B. suis</italic> biovar IV have been found in caribou and reindeer (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>). Eating raw, undercooked, dried, smoked or frozen meat or organ tissue (liver, kidney, bone marrow) can expose people to the infection. Brucellosis is a systemic bacterial disease of acute or insidious onset with continued intermittent or irregular fever of variable duration with headache, weakness, sweating, chills, joint pain and weight loss. The first human case of 
 <italic>B. suis</italic> biovar IV was detected in Alaska in 1959 and was linked to the consumption of raw caribou (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>). Since then, human infections have been linked to the consumption or processing of raw caribou meat, and infection has been shown to be endemic in many caribou and reindeer herds across Alaska and northern Canada (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>). This is in contrast to other parts of the United States, where the most common route of transmission is through the consumption of raw dairy products and meat. However, there is little data on the prevalence of brucellosis in humans or wildlife in Alaska. More contemporary data on the prevalence of brucellosis in humans and wildlife in Alaska are needed. Other 
 <italic>Brucella</italic> spp. can also infect other land and marine mammals (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>). While human infections caused by a marine 
 <italic>Brucella</italic>, found in seals (
 <italic>B. pinnipedialis</italic>), has also been documented (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>), evidence for the direct transmission from seals to humans has yet to be established, as is the risk to humans who depend on marine mammals as a food source. In Alaska, human 
 <italic>Brucella</italic> infections are reportable conditions to the State of Alaska, Division of Public Health, Section of Epidemiology (SOE) and infections in wildlife, domestic herds and other animals are reported to the Office of the State Veterinarian (OSV). Since 1973, there have been 17 reported human cases in Alaska (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>). Reporting in animals is complicated by the absence of standardised diagnostic tests for different species of animals. Current serologic tests are not species-specific and cross-react with other bacteria and 
 <italic>Brucella</italic> spp underscoring the need for the development of standardised, validated 
 <italic>Brucella</italic> specific tests. Efforts are underway to establish and validate simple filter paper blood collection systems that can be used by hunters and wildlife biologist for wildlife in the field (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>) for the detection of 
 <italic>Brucella</italic> antibody using serology. Preventive measures include vaccination of domestic livestock (cattle, reindeer), community education recommending fully cooking meat, cleaning of surfaces and tools with a water/bleach solution after contact with meat. Hunters should take special precautions when butchering animals in the field, such as careful examination of the animal carcass for abnormalities suggesting brucellosis, wearing gloves and glasses to avoid being infected by animal blood through cuts and abrasions on hands or contact with the eyes or mouth.
