<p>It is unclear if or how climate change may influence brucellosis rates in animals or people. A warming Arctic may change the range of many animals, contribute to the greater survival of infected animals during winter, which in turn could either increase or decrease herd densities and contribute to greater comingling of species, thus increasing the potential for greater interspecies transmission and transmission to humans. Conversely, changes in weather patterns (more snow and ice cover) may limit access to important food sources, affecting animal nutrition resulting in decreased herd densities, fewer animals to harvest and reduced opportunities for human infection with
