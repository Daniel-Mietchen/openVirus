<p>Rabies is an acute viral infection causing progressive viral encephalomyelitis that is nearly always fatal. Rabies is caused by RNA viruses in the family 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Lyssavirus</italic>. Transmission is most often through saliva via a bite from an infected animal. Mammals are the natural hosts of rabies. Reservoirs consist of the 
 <italic>Carnivora</italic> (canids, skunks, raccoons, mongooses) and 
 <italic>Chiroptera</italic> (bats). Dogs are the main source of infection for humans, although wildlife is also an important source of infection in developed countries where dog rabies has been mostly eliminated. Rabies is enzootic among the fox populations of northern and western Alaska, with periodic epizootics documented every 3–5 years following variation in prey and predator populations (

Although rabies has been documented in animals every month of the year, most cases are usually reported during early fall through early spring. In early spring, Arctic foxes tend to move inland off the sea ice, increasing the likelihood of coming into contact with domestic animals or humans. Dogs can readily serve as a transmission vehicle of the rabies virus from wildlife to humans; therefore, it is especially critical during these seasons to ensure that adequate rabies prevention and control measures are in place. The prevalence of rabies in wildlife reservoirs is unknown and reducing rabies in the Alaskan fox populations is not yet feasible. Therefore, the mainstays of preventing human rabies cases are the use of a non-veterinarian lay vaccinator programme in rural areas, public education of the risk in the wildlife (fox) population, vaccination of domestic animals against rabies and prompt administration of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis to persons potentially exposed to the rabies virus (
