<p>Human cases and potential exposures are reportable to the SOE which are promptly investigated. Three human cases have been reported since 1914, but none since 1942. Between 15 and 50 cases in wildlife are reported each year. Many gaps in our understanding of this disease remain, and areas requiring further investigation include: (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>) factors influencing epidemics in animals (epizootics); (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>) the lack of evidence of animal rabies in the interior of Alaska; (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>) the ecology and interaction between Arctic and Red foxes; and (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>) the potential impact of climate change on disease and the role of species incursions (red foxes and bats). While standard fluorescent antibody microscopy diagnostics are available at Alaska State Virology Laboratory in Fairbanks, a key challenge is the lack of the full range of in-state veterinary diagnostics. Some surveillance is currently underway by the Alaska Department of Fish &amp; Game and the University of Alaska Fairbanks using the direct rapid immunohistochemical test (DRIT). However, funding for surveillance of animal rabies is currently dependent on investigator-driven research grants.
