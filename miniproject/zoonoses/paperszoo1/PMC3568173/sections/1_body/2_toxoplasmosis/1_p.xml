<p>Toxoplasmosis is caused by infection with 
 <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, a widespread protozoan parasite of mammals and birds. Members of the cat family are the only known definitive host of 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic>. However, the asexual encysted stage can be found in muscle tissues of other animals and can serve as the main reservoir of infection in cat-free areas. Humans become infected by ingesting raw or insufficiently cooked meat or foods that have come into contact with viable oocysts from soil, or items that have come into contact with cat faeces (unwashed vegetables). Typically, the infection in humans is mild, with fever and lymphadenitis or can be asymptomatic. In immune-compromised individuals, more severe complications such as encephalitis or acute toxoplasmic chorioretinitis may occur. However, the main health concern is in pregnant women where tachyzoites can migrate transplacentally resulting in foetal morbidity or mortality.
