<p>While there is no evidence yet of increased transmission of 
 <italic>toxoplasma</italic> associated with climate change effects, there are climate and weather effects that may either increase or decrease the survival of parasites in the environment, increase or decrease the abundance of host species, and may result in the emergence of disease at altered interfaces among wildlife, domestic animals and human populations. For example, higher humidity and warmer soil temperatures may increase the rate of sporulation and survival of oocysts (

Increased storm events predicted with climate change are likely to result in damage to community water intake systems, increased runoff into rivers or other fresh water sources and increased chances of contamination of community water supplies with oocycts (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">28</xref>). Storm related runoff also increases water turbidity, frequently compromising water purification filter systems. This together with damage to water and sanitation infrastructure caused by melting permafrost potentially increases the chance of water borne outbreaks of toxoplasmosis in these communities. The dramatic loss of Arctic sea ice may result in animal crowding on land and remaining sea ice, increased mortality and scavenging that may increase the transmission of oocysts to carnivores, marine shellfish and thence to other marine mammals, whales, walrus, otters and seals, which are all important substance species for Alaska Natives (
