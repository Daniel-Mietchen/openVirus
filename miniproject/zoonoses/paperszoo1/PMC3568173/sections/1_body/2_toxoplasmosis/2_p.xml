<p>A serosurvey was conducted in the 1960s and 70s which showed that 15% of Alaska Natives had antibodies to 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic>, a rate similar to that found in the United States (

 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> in polar bears and Arctic foxes in Svalbard in the absence of a definitive host also highlights the existence of alternative transmission routes. (

 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> in animals in this region may have been introduced to this region by migratory birds. The prevalence of 
 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> in polar bears in Svalbard, the Barents Sea Region and Eastern Greenland areas has doubled in the last decade (now 46%), and detection in Ring Seals for the first time highlights the role of predatorâ€“prey cycles as a mechanism of maintaining this infection in this region, and the risk of infection in human populations that rely on marine mammals for food (
