<p>The disease in wildlife domestic herd and other animals is reportable to the OSV. However, better surveillance data for 
 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> in wildlife species is needed to understand the ecology of the disease in Alaska. Two diagnostic tests are available for 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> that can be used in various species of animals â€“ a molecular method (multiplex PCR) and a multi-species enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) that detects its antibodies in blood or tissue fluid. An absorbent filter paper method to collect blood from animals under field conditions for the diagnosis of 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> in wildlife is being developed (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref>). This will simplify blood collection under Arctic conditions and facilitate sample collection by hunters.
