<p>Trichinellosis is caused by any species of 
 <italic>Trichinella</italic>, an intestinal roundworm whose larvae migrate and become encapsulated in muscle tissue of domestic (commonly pigs) or wild animals. In the Arctic, bear and walrus meat are the main sources of human infection. The most common species in Arctic regions are 
 <italic>T. nativa</italic> and 
 <italic>Trichinella</italic> genotype T6 which, unlike other 
 <italic>Trichinella</italic> species, survives freezing. Infection in humans occurs following consumption of raw or undercooked meat containing viable encysted larvae. Illness in humans is variable ranging from asymptomatic infection to a rarely fatal disease, depending on the number of larvae ingested.
