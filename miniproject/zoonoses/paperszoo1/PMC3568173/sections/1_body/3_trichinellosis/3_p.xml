<p>Prevention messages should stress that 
 <italic>T. nativa</italic> in bear and walrus meat is cold resistant and that meat should be cooked to a temperature of at least 160
 <bold>Â°</bold>F. Smoking, salting, fermenting or drying meat are not reliable methods for killing the parasite (

 <italic>Trichinella</italic> in subsistence food animal populations in Alaska would help inform prevention efforts. A model programme exists in Nunavik where walrus harvested by hunters is tested before consumption (
