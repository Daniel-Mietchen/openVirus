<p>The most frequent reports of human trichinellosis in Alaska are multi-person outbreaks that result from more than one person consuming the same meal of under-cooked bear, walrus or seal meat (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0030">30</xref>). In Alaska, from 1974 to 1994, 203 cases of 
 <italic>Trichinella</italic> were reported to the SOE. Of the 34 outbreaks documented, 20 (59%) were caused by the consumption of bear meat, 13 (38%) from walrus meat and in one case (3%) from the consumption of either walrus or seal meat. Most outbreaks of trichinellosis in Canada have been due to 
 <italic>Trichinella nativa</italic> or Trichinella genotype T6 which is generally found in game animals such as black bears, grizzly bears, polar bears and walrus (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0032">32</xref>) In Alaska, 
 <italic>Trichinella</italic> infections are reportable to SOE and the OSV. 
 <italic>Trichinella</italic> can be detected in muscle tissue by laboratory methods that use artificial digestion of muscle tissues followed by microscopy or DNA analysis by PCR. Microscopy introduces the possibility of false negative result if small numbers of larvae are present. Antibodies to 
 <italic>Trichinella</italic> can be detected by ELISA. However, antibody cross-reactivity with antigens of other parasites may give false positive results, underscoring the need for more species-specific antibody assays (
