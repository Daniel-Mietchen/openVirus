<p>In Alaska, for these potentially climate sensitive pathogens, the gaps in knowledge and solutions for each pathogen tend to be similar (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table I</xref>). Surveillance for infection and disease caused by many of these pathogens in both humans and animals is incomplete. It is not clear whether this is because of under reporting or under diagnosis due to a lack of adequate diagnostics, staffing issues in remote locations and logistical difficulties associated with remote specimen collection and shipping. Surveillance evaluations for zoonotic infections all of which are potentially climate sensitive infections are needed. As part of a strategy to improve reporting to SOE and OSV, education materials should be developed and distributed to medical providers and laboratories emphasising the importance of complete surveillance and reporting.
