<p>The increasing ambient temperature in Alaska and other regions of the Arctic may influence the incidence and distribution of zoonotic and parasitic infections in humans by changing the population density and range of wild and domestic animals and insect hosts. The public health response should include enhancing the capacity to monitor those potentially climate-sensitive infections that are most likely to have a large public health impact; investigating promptly infectious disease outbreaks that may be related to climate change; and conducting research into the relationship between climate and infectious disease emergence to guide early detection and public health interventions (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0060">60</xref>). The communication strategy should include education of the general public, at risk sub-populations (hunters, trappers, subsistence users wildlife biologists, livestock farmers pet owners). At particular risk are Alaska Natives who often depend on land and sea mammals to provide a healthy affordable sustainable and culturally meaningful diet. However, such a diet may place people at risk of acquiring a zoonotic disease. For example, much of the sea and land mammals that are consumed by Alaska Natives are dried or eaten raw after freezing. While this is an economical and efficient way to prepare meat preserving both nutritionally and culturally, such methods of food preparation may carry more risk for acquiring a zoonotic disease than cooking the meat.
