<p>Ecosystem health, wildlife health and human health are interconnected and there is a need to develop a coordinated plan to monitor projects and activities that focus on the impact of climate change on zoonotic and parasitic infections in Alaska. This can be facilitated by forming a working group that would include representation from State of Alaska Departments of Health and Social Services, Environmental Conservation and Fish &amp; Game; Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, University of Alaska, the CDC's Arctic Investigations Program, the US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service and others to monitor activities and ensure coordination and sample sharing between appropriate agencies, institutes and organisations.</p>
