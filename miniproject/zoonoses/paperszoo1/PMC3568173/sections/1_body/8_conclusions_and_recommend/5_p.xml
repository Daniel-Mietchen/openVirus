<p>There is a need to improve diagnostics. Current serologic tests for many pathogens of concern are not species-specific and often cross-react with other bacteria complicating their interpretation and hindering our understanding of their ecology in nature. Efforts are underway to establish and validate simple filter paper blood collection systems that can be used by hunters in the field. Such samples could be used for the detection of antibodies using serologic methods and pathogen specific DNA by molecular methods. DNA sequencing methods allows for the detection of molecular variation among pathogen strains suggesting that certain assemblages are more likely to be associated with specific animal species, i.e. parasites found in humans are more likely to align with assemblages consisting of isolates from other humans, as opposed to parasites from non-human animal species. These methods could greatly increase our understanding of disease ecology of these pathogens in humans and animals living in Alaska. More research is needed not only to understand the disease ecology of these and other emerging pathogens in humans and animals living in Alaska, but also to understand the impact of climate change on disease occurrence in humans and wildlife.</p>
