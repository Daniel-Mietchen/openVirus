 <italic>Echinococcosis granulosis</italic> has worldwide distribution (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0042">42</xref>) and there are two recognised biotypes: northern (or sylvatic) and the domestic biotype. Northern strain cystic hydatid disease is caused by 
 <italic>Echinococcus granulosus</italic> which maintains a cycle that includes an adult cestode stage in the definitive host such as a wolf, coyote, fox or dog, and a larval cestode stage in an intermediate host such as a moose, deer, caribou, reindeer but does not cross-infect domestic livestock (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0043">43</xref>). Humans usually acquire the infection via exposure to eggs that were shed in canid faeces and are an accidental host (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0043">43</xref>). The infection caused by the northern biotype in humans is relatively benign (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0044">44</xref>), developing over many years and resulting in cyst formations in the liver and lungs (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0042">42</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0044">44</xref>). In contrast, human alveolar hydatid disease caused by 
 <italic>Echinococcus multilocularis</italic> is associated with a much higher mortality rate than cystic hydatid disease. Alveolar hydatid disease has a distribution throughout the northern hemisphere (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0042">42</xref>) and is endemic in south-central Canada and the northern Midwestern United States (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0045">45</xref>). 
 <italic>Echinococcus multilocularis</italic> maintains a cycle that includes an adult cestode stage in the definitive host, commonly a fox, wolf, coyote or dog, and a larval cestode stage in an intermediate host such as a vole or a deer mouse.
