<p>In Alaska, cases of human disease caused by 
 <italic>Echinococcus</italic> species (both 
 <italic>granulosus</italic> and 
 <italic>multilocularis</italic>) are reportable to the SOE. Since the 1950s, over 300 cases of echinococcosis were reported (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0046">46</xref>). Since 1990, only eight cases of 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> and no cases of 
 <italic>E. multilocularis</italic> have been reported (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0046">46</xref>). Because cases may be asymptomatic, the actual number of infections could be higher. In Alaska, there were 193 (mostly Alaska Native) cases diagnosed up until 1980, and various reports document similar numbers from various regions of northern Canada (
