<p>More specific serologic tests for diagnosis and seroprevalence studies are needed. New molecular typing methods are being developed (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0051">51</xref>). However, many of these programmes have since been discontinued. An assessment of these remaining programmes is needed to improve educational outreach, community based control programmes and guidelines for dealing with dogs. Prevalence of the domestic biotypes in the domestic livestock populations is also unknown. A survey of infection rates in animal reservoirs is needed in order to identify geographical distributions and to lay a baseline for future climate related fluctuations in reservoir populations. This would require local laboratory capacity, mapping resources, trained technical staff and funding.
