<p>Wildlife and domestic animal disease caused by 
 <italic>Giardia</italic> or 
 <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> are reportable to the OSV but is most likely under-reported by practitioners unfamiliar with regulation and animals are often treated clinically rather than diagnoses due to financial limitations. The prevalence of

It is important to protect public water supplies against contamination with animal or human faeces and ensure adequate filtration of community water supplies.
