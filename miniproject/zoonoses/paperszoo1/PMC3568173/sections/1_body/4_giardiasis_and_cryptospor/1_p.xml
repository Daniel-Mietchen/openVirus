<p>Giardiasis is caused by infection with 
 <italic>Giardia</italic> protozoa (
 <italic>Giardia intestinalis</italic>), and in humans it is typically characterised by self-limited diarrhea (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0037">37</xref>). Cryptosporidiosis, also a self-limited diarrheal disease in humans, is caused mainly by infection with 
 <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> or 
 <italic>C. hominis</italic>. Fatalities can occur in widespread outbreaks where the elderly or immunosuppressed are infected. Both 
 <italic>Giardia</italic> and 
 <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> protozoa are widespread in the environment. While 
 <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> infections are often associated with the consumption of untreated surface water contaminated with animal faeces, 
 <italic>Giardia</italic> is most commonly associated with the ingestion of water contaminated by human faeces. Recently characterised molecular variation among 
 <italic>Giardia</italic> and 
 <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> parasites has allowed genotypes to be divided into assemblages, which are grouped by degree of similarity (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0038">38</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0039">39</xref>). Data suggest that among 
 <italic>Giardia</italic> protozoa, certain assemblages are more likely to be associated with specific animal species, and parasites found in humans are more likely to align with assemblages consisting of isolates from other humans, as opposed to parasites from non-human animal species. This might mean that person-to-person transmission, an acknowledged but not typically emphasised route, is more common than previously expected, as opposed to transmission being primarily from a zoonotic or environmental source.
