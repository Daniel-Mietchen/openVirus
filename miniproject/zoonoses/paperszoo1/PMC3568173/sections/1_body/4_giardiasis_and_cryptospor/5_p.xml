<p>Giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis may be sensitive to climate change. Higher temperatures and a changing environment may favour the migration of host animals northward into regions where disease has yet to be established. In Alaska, the tree line has moved northward as have beaver and muskrat populations, potentially exposing human residents of these regions to new diseases such as

Increased runoff into drinking and recreational water sources may increase the concentration of organisms and potential for transmission. Increased storm events may result in damage to community water intake systems, increased runoff into rivers or other fresh water sources, increasing the chance of contamination of community water supplies (

This together with damage to water and sanitation infrastructure caused by melting permafrost potentially increases the chance of water borne outbreaks of giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis in these communities.
