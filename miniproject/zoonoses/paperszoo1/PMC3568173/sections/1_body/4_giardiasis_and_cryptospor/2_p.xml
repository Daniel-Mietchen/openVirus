<p>In Alaska, human cases of both 
 <italic>Giardia</italic> and 
 <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> are reportable to the SOE. From 2001â€“2010, 1,042 human cases of giardiasis were reported, and annual rates of giardiasis in Alaska are routinely higher than in the rest of the United States (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0037">37</xref>). The number of reported giardiasis cases underestimates the true incidence of disease by an unknown amount, as only laboratory-confirmed infections are typically reported to SOE and empiric treatment of suspected cases based on clinical presentation are not usually reported to SOE.
