<p>Of the 335 new emerging infectious diseases that were identified between 1940–2004, 60.3 percent were zoonoses, 71.8 percent of which originated in wildlife.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref> As pathogen emergence has also been increasing overtime, coupled with greater rates of global dissemination,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref> the threat to global health and economies is profound. Strategies that can identify viral threats that emerge as a consequence of advantageous mutations in response to select evolutionary pressure(s) would provide profound advances in the ability of the Global Health Response Network to control emerging diseases. The existence of a defined ExoN-mediated mutator phenotype may allow for mechanistic insights and modeling of the mutation repertoires that govern: (a) the rapid selection of host range expanded mutant viruses which represent precursors to future epidemic emergences; (b) pathways of escape from therapeutic human monoclonal antibodies and drugs; (c) limits of genome variation and stability; and (d) replicase mutations and interacting networks which restore fidelity in passaged ExoN mutant viruses. For example, CoV phylogeny is punctuated by numerous shifts between host species and cross-species transmission is readily achieved in co-cultures and during persistent infections in vitro.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref> In nature, human coronavirus (HCoV) °C43 emerged around 1,900 from closely related bovine CoVs, whereas HCoV 229E likely emerged from closely related group 1 bat coronaviruses around 1,800 in Africa,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref> leading some to propose that nearly all human and animal CoVs originated from a vast reservoir of strains circulating in bat species.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref> SARS-CoV is also a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats, following amplification in other species (civet cats, raccoon dogs), prior to transmission to humans.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref> Our group has used synthetic biology to reconstruct full-length genomes of SARS-like bat CoV precursors to the 2002–2003 epidemic strains.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">101</xref> Although these strains replicate but do not spread because they lack the appropriate receptor-binding domain, recombinant bat coronaviruses harboring the SARS-CoV receptor binding domain (RBD) replicate efficiently and use angiotensin 1 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for docking and entry. These data suggest that the trimeric spike glycoprotein of CoVs may be plastic and modular in design, readily allowing for protein domains to be exchanged between divergent S glycoproteins from different strains.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> We propose that blending the ExoN mutator phenotype into synthetically reconstructed zoonotic viruses provides a strategy to rapidly identify pathway components and mutation sets that govern trans-species movement in cell or organ cultures and in vivo. We hypothesize that the CoV ExoN mutator phenotype constitutes a robust investigative platform to predict mutations and possibly recombinants in advance of their occurrence by identifying advantageous mutations governing host range and virus cross-species transmission.
