<p>CoVs are enveloped viruses that have positive-sense, non-segmented RNA genomes 27–32 kb in length. The basic gene organization and replication is similar for all CoVs and is illustrated for SARS-CoV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">

 </xref>). Gene 1 encodes all predicted replicase/transcriptase proteins, which are translated from input genome RNA (RNA1). Genes 2–9 encode structural and accessory proteins, which are translated from separate subgenomic (sg) mRNAs.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> CoVs, as members of the Nidovirales order, generate not only new genome RNA, but also a 3′-nested set (Nido = nest) of subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs). Along with a portion of the 3′ genome sequence, each CoV sgRNA also contains the first approximately 70 nt of the 5′ leader sequence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">
  <bold>Fig. 2</bold>
 </xref>). Coronavirus RNA synthesis can be conceptualized as involving two stages: genome replication and subgenomic RNA transcription. In genome replication, the plus-strand genome RNA is transcribed into a full-length minus-strand template RNA, and then significantly more plus-strand genome RNAs are synthesized from that minus-strand template. In subgenomic RNA transcription, 3′-nested subgenomic RNAs are transcribed to serve as templates for translation of the viral structural and accessory proteins. This stage of viral RNA synthesis involves a discontinuous RNA transcription model termed transcription attenuation during negative strand RNA synthesis.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> During negative strand synthesis, the viral RdRp recognizes virus-specific conserved sequences termed transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRSs), located just upstream of each subgenomic ORF. At these points, the polymerase either reads through to the next TRS or dissociates from the template strand, then re-associates with the leader TRS, located in the 5′ UTR, and completes synthesis of a set of subgenomic length negative strand RNA containing an antileader RNA sequence and equivalent in size to each viral mRNA. These subgenomic negative strand RNAs then function as the principal templates for the production of subgenomic mRNAs that are 3′-coterminal, and that all possess an ∼70 nt 5′ leader sequence. Because of this transcription mechanism, alterations in TRS sequences can influence viral replication efficiency.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> Importantly, the primary TRS sequence seems less important, as recombinant viruses engineered to encode completely new TRS networks are viable, suggesting that regulatory sequences flanking the TRS elements are critical regulators of subgenomic transcription.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> Recently, Wu and Brian have shown that artificial, marked positive-sense subgenomic mRNAs can function as templates for minus strand synthesis and likely contribute to amplifying the amounts of plus-strand sg mRNAs synthesized during infection. Moreover, mRNAs also can serve as templates for the synthesis of smaller sg mRNAs by recognition of internal TRS elements as well.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> The specific mechanism that confers the capacity of the polymerase to dissociate and reassociate is not well understood, but is thought to be mediated by complementary binding of the anti-TRS on the nascent minus strand with the leader template TRS on the plus strand.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> As rare misaligned leader-body junctions are occasionally seen during transcription,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> it is possible that one or more unique RNA modifying activities, like nsp14 ExoN which encodes a 3′–5′ exonuclease activity (see below), may process the ends of incomplete negative strand RNAs to promote base-pairing and the priming of antileader RNA synthesis.
