<p>The availability of mutator phenotype mutants of both MHV and SARS that can tolerate up to 20-fold increase in mutation rate, accumulate massive mutational diversity at the population level and survive extended population and plaque passage, represents a powerful tool to directly test long-standing questions concerning the role of diversity and fidelity in virus replication, pathogenesis and evolution. How do CoVs maintain a large and complex genome over time while allowing sufficient mutation rates for adaptation and trans-species movement? Is the fidelity of wt CoV replication fixed by highly selected interactions between the RdRp, ExoN and possibly other viral and cellular proteins or is it flexible in response to altered environmental conditions as has been shown for bacteria such as 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>? What are the limitations to CoV genome diversity in vitro and in vivo? Does the ExoN mutator phenotype result in more rapid adaptation or attenuation associated with lethal mutational load and rapid extinction during infection in vivo? Does the mutator phenotype increase susceptibility to mutagens for lethal mutagenesis? Clearly, CoVs provide a rich empirical platform to address these interesting and unique questions in virus evolution and adaptation.
