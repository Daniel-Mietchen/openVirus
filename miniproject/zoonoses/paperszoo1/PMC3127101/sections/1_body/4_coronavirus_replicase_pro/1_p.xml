<p>The viral proteins responsible for CoV replication, transcription and recombination are encoded as protein domains of the largest known RNA virus polyproteins (

 </xref>). The CoV ORF1a and fusion ORF1ab replicase polyproteins are expressed from the ∼20 kb gene 1 on the input genome RNA and subsequently are processed by viral proteinases to yield 16 mature nonstructural proteins (nsps 1–16), as well as several intermediate precursors, as recently reviewed in reference 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>. Nsps 4–16 are significantly conserved in all known CoVs and have been experimentally demonstrated or predicted to be critical enzymes in CoV RNA synthesis and modification, including: nsp7–nsp8, hexadecamer with putative processivity activities; nsp8, primase;

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref> nsp13, RNA helicase-ATPase (Hel);
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref> In addition, multiple nsps may be required for certain functions in RNA synthesis, as it has recently been shown that interactions of nsps 10, 14 and 16 are required for methyl transferase activity.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref> Remarkably, viruses with mutations that ablate the 2′-O-methyl transferase activity encoded in nsp16 are highly sensitive to the activity of the interferon stimulated gene IFIT-2, which likely inhibits the translation of RNA molecules lacking 2′-O-methyl modifications.
