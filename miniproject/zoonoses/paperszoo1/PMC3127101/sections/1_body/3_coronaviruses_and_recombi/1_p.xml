<p>Recombination has shaped the population genetic structure of coronaviruses, promoting cross-species transmission and pathogenesis while complicating vaccine design.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> Coronaviruses are quite capable of mediating homologous RNA recombination, with rates approaching 20% during mixed infection of closely related strains in the same group.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref> This high recombination frequency is likely due to the large size of the genome, paired with replication machinery that is already equipped to dissociate and reassociate from the template RNA (site-assisted copy choice recombination), as well as the availability of full-length and subgenomic-length strands for template switching.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref> This view is supported by studies showing targeted recombination between specially designed mutant subgenomic mRNAs and genome length templates.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref> Viable mutant CoVs can be recovered with artificial TRS sequences, as long as the leader and intergenic TRS sequences match. Further, these artificial TRS sequence viruses prevent recombination with virus containing the native TRS sequences.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> These factors combine to allow for the predicted rapid evolution of structural genes, especially within the Spike gene, which undergoes high positive selective pressure during emergence and host-shift events.
