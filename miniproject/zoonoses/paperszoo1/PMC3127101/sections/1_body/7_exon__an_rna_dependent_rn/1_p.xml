<p>The results from both M-ExoN and S-ExoN mutants, as well as the in vitro ssRNA exonuclease activity of SARS-CoV nsp14, all argue strongly that nsp14-ExoN directly mediates or participates in the prevention or repair of mutations, which would constitute RNA proofreading, an enzymatic activity not previously reported during the replication of RNA viruses. A nuclease activity of influenza virions in removing non-cognate residues from the 3′ termini of capped primers was reported as evidence of proofreading, but this was not tested during replication and has not been further investigated or confirmed by other labs.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref> and have generally concluded that the energy and fitness cost exceeded the need for error recognition or repair mechanisms. Thus it may be that the incorporation of nsp14 ExoN in the coronaviruses both allowed expansion of the genome and then was required for maintenance of the large and complex genome integrity. In this case the central unanswered research question remains: by what mechanism does nsp14 increase fidelity? There are several possible models, each of which would be unprecedented among RNA viruses, and which could occur alone or in combination as functions of nsp14 or with other replicase proteins. (1) Nsp14 ExoN could directly mediate RNA proofreading. This would be analogous to DNA proofreading where the exonuclease activity is oftentimes provided by a subunit distinct from the polymerase activity. In this regard it is notable that DNA proofreading exonucleases also belong to the DE-D-D superfamily. (2) Nsp14 could stimulate an intrinsic putative 3′-to-5′ ExoN activity of the RdRp. This would be similar to RNA proofreading during cellular transcription by eukaryotic RNA pol II and bacterial RNAP.

Although a precedent of this situation in DNA or RNA proofreading is not obvious, there are numerous examples of cofactor-enzyme allostery. (4) Nsp14 ExoN could participate in repair by RNA recombination. Considering that high-frequency homologous recombination in the form of discontinuous transcription is central to nidovirus gene expression, and that ExoN mutants of human CoV-229E have altered subgenomic mRNA ratios and aberrant mobilities,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref> it is reasonable to propose that subgenomic transcriptional and recombination repair may have evolved in CoVs and that nsp14-ExoN is required for this process. A most likely model is that nsp14 cooperates with other CoV enzymes to form a complex that is involved in error recognition and repair. Although nsp14 alone has been shown so far only to hydrolyze nucleotides at the 3′ terminus of RNA, sequential action of nsp15-EndoU and nsp14-ExoN would theoretically allow removal of internal, mismatched nucleotides. Thus, whereas nsp14 can facilitate correction of residues at only the growing end of a nascent RNA chain, cooperative interaction of nsp15 and nsp14 could facilitate correction of residues at other sites, and conceivably in full-length molecules that are no longer nascent. Finally, CoVs encode methyltransferase (nsp16) that interacts specifically with nsp14 for cap methylation and which could also be participating in fidelity or other RNA modifications that allow expansion of the CoV genome.
