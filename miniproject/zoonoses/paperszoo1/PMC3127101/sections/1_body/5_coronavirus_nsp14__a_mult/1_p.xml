<p>At 27 to 32 kb, the positive-sense RNA genomes of CoVs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">
  <bold>Fig. 1</bold>
 </xref>) are the largest known RNA genomes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref> at up to twice the length in nucleotides as those of the next-largest non-segmented RNA virus.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref> The bioinformatics prediction of a putative exoribonuclease (ExoN) encoded in replicase nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) of all CoVs led to the speculation that ExoN functions in proofreading during replication and that acquisition of ExoN by a precursor virus was critical for expansion and maintenance of the large RNA genomes of CoVs.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref> The amino-terminal half of the 59-kDa nsp14 includes 3′-to-5′ ExoN motifs I (DE), II (D) and III (D), which were originally identified in cellular enzymes of the DEDD superfamily, including those that catalyze DNA proofreading.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref> Bacterially expressed SARS-CoV nsp14 has been shown to have 3′-to-5′ ExoN activity in vitro, and alanine substitution of the DE-D-D residues profoundly impairs or abolishes this activity.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref> The intracellular RNA targets for ExoN activity likely include viral RNA intermediates; importantly, however, they may also include cellular mRNAs, noncoding RNAs and/or microRNAs, which encode or regulate critical antiviral activities during infection.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref> Studies from our laboratories also indicated that the carboxy-terminal half of nsp14 has independent functions in RNA synthesis and virulence in animals,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref> a conclusion which was confirmed by the demonstration that the carboxy-terminal half of nsp14 encodes a novel cap N7-methyltransferase function.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref> Proteomic studies, while controversial, indicate robust two-way interactions between nsp14, nsp8 and ORF9b or nsp14 and nsp10; the latter study also hinting at less robust interactions with nsp5 and ORF3b. Clearly, additional biochemical and genetic studies are needed to identify the nsp14 viral and cellular protein interactome.
