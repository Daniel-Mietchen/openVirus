<p>The genomes of positive-strand RNA viruses have considerable capacity to evolve quickly in response to changing ecologic conditions and/or host environments. Mutation rate is a critical parameter for understanding virus evolution, and restriction in genetic diversity within a population of viruses leads to lower adaptability and pathogenicity. Moreover, a general trend toward an inverse correlation between genome size and replication fidelity has been demonstrated by high variations in RdRp error rates that range from about 10
 <sup>−4</sup> to 10
 <sup>−6</sup>.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref> Based primarily on studies with enteroviruses, RNA viruses with smaller genome sizes seem to regulate replication fidelity by a long distance network of dynamic interactions throughout the 3Dpol RdRp that function to regulate RNA binding and recognition, ligand recognition and binding, protein conformation and RNA synthesis.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref> Fidelity can be further modified by virus-host interactions that regulate RNA replicase fidelity or RNA recombination and repair. In contrast to other positive strand RNA viruses, CoVs appear to have expanded replicase fidelity by acquiring and evolving a unique enzymatic activity, encoded with the ExoN nsp14 replicase protein.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> Clearly, the existing paradigm of a lumbering error-prone RdRp will be replaced with one that recognizes a more complex, highly tuned and regulated protein machine that was likely essential for the expansion of the CoV genome. There is a critical need to elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing ExoN fidelity regulation, and we are in the process of designing in vitro ExoN mutant assays. Nonetheless, the existence of a non-essential exogenous activity which appears to modify CoV RdRp fidelity provides novel opportunities for experimental testing of the fundamental relationships between fidelity and replication, recombination, adaptation, cross species transmission, genome evolution and pathogenesis while simultaneously providing new avenues for therapeutic enhancement of lethal mutagenesis and the rational design of live attenuated vaccines.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref> Historically, the extent of genetic diversity in RNA virus populations has most often been analyzed by sequencing a small number of genomes at low coverage or a small region at high coverage. The former approach lacks resolution while the latter is narrowly focused, so extrapolation to the entire genome can be misleading. Deep sequencing approaches like mRNA-seq provide new opportunities for high resolution mapping of mutation distributions across genomes.
