<p>The susceptibility to varying degrees of genetic bottleneck has been addressed for the M-ExoN and S-ExoN mutator viruses in comparison with wt parental cloned strains. SARS-CoV and S-ExoN were passaged as populations (three independent passages each) at fixed intervals (18 h) and with titer determination and equivalent MOI for passage 20 times (

 </xref>). Interestingly, both SARS-CoV and S-ExoN had similar responses, with selection for increased titer (1â€“2 log) by passage 10, after which adaptation reached a plateau. Analysis of sequence showed retention of the ExoN mutations at passage 10, indicating that a primary revertant was not the cause of increased growth. Further, up to passage 10 the total mutational diversity of the S-ExoN populations dramatically exceeded that of wt SARS-CoV. These results demonstrated that in population passage with selection limited only to growth at 18 h, massive diversity in the population was tolerated and still allowed adaptation for increased growth. The effect of more stringent genetic bottleneck (Muller's Ratchet) was tested using MHV-ExoN, in which plaque-to-plaque passage of 10 plaques each of wt MHV and M-ExoN was performed in parallel (

 </xref>). Ten clones each of WT-MHV-A59 and MHV-ExoN were subjected to ten serial plaque-to-plaque transfers in murine DBT cells. Two M-ExoN1 clones became non-recoverable during this passage series (one at p4 and one at p8), whereas all MHV clones were recoverable throughout. Moreover, titers from M-ExoN plaque passage showed a trend of decreasing average titer over passage, whereas the titer from WT-MHV remained constant. The results suggest that ExoN mutator viruses may be more susceptible to accumulation of deleterious mutations driven by repeated population bottlenecks. Conversely, it was surprising that the plaque passage revealed no rapid extinction of the mutant, suggesting that other mechanisms have evolved to stabilize populations and prevent lethal mutagenesis, and/or that CoVs tolerate the accumulation of massive mutational loads across the expanded genomes. Comparison of complete genome sequences of extended plaque and population passages will be required to test these possibilities.
