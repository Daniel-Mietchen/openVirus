<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a family of RNA viruses that cause significant diseases in humans such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and other respiratory infections, as well as a variety of respiratory, gastrointestinal and other infections in an increasingly large variety of mammals and birds. The capacity CoVs possess for trans-species movement and adaptation, long recognized in the laboratory,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> was confirmed in nature by the recent emergence of several animal coronavirus pathogens of domesticated animals and SARS-CoV. Data on the latter emergence event indicated that SARS likely resulted from human infection and adaptation by a Bat SARS-like CoV.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> suggests that many, if not all, mammalian CoVs may originate from bats.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> However, the mechanisms of CoV host species movement and adaptation for replication and pathogenesis are poorly understood. This review will discuss the role of RNA replication fidelity in RNA virus replication and pathogenesis, and will focus on a novel exoribonuclease universally encoded within CoV genomes that likely mediates RNA-dependent RNA proofreading during virus replication.
