<p>To further characterize the co-infected viruses in bat paramyxovirus-positive samples, Illumina high-throughput sequencing was conducted. Total nucleic acids were extracted as described above. Viral nucleic acid samples were then pooled, and a 3 μg pooled sample was used for sequencing library preparation. The synthesis of first and second-strand cDNA from the viral RNA was performed using random oligonucleotides/SuperScript II and DNA Polymerase I/RNase H, respectively. After the 3'-end adenylation, DNA fragments were ligated with Illumina PE adapters on both sides to purify and selectively enrich the 200 bp fragments using the AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA) and Illumina PCR Primer Cocktail in a 10 cycle PCR reaction. Finally, a sequencing library was generated by Illumina TruSeq
 <sup>TM</sup> RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s recommendations and four index codes were added to attribute sequences. The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumina, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After cluster generation, the library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform and 100 bp paired-end reads were generated. Reads that were contaminated with adapter or of low quality, as well as poly-N reads, were removed from raw data and clean reads were obtained.
