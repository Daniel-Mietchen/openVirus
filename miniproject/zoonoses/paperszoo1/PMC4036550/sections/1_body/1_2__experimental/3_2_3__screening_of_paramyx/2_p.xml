<p>To assess the phylogenetic relationship of paramyxoviruses identified in this study, 79 partial and full L-gene nucleotide sequences were downloaded from NCBI with the GenBank accession numbers listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="viruses-06-02138-s001">Table S2</xref>. Nucleotide sequences were then aligned and translated by using ClustalX 1.83 [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The best-fit model (GTR + I + G) of the phylogenetic relationship was determined by Modeltest 3.7 [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and the phylogenetic trees of L-gene were constructed by MrBayes 3.1.1 [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], with the sequences of 
 <italic>Pneumovirinae</italic> subfamily as an outgroup.
