<p>Sensitive and broadly reactive RT-PCR assays were performed at Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciecnces. In this study, the primers, which were designed according to the conserved motifs of the RNA polymerase (L)-coding sequence, were from the reference Tong 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and could be used for identification of novel paramyxoviruses. The 560 bp fragments of the RNA polymerase (L)-coding sequence conserved in the 
 <italic>Paramyxovirinae</italic> subfamily were amplified, according to the reference Tong 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] with no modification. The PCR productions were sequenced using Big Dye Terminator kits (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) on an ABI 3730 automated sequencer with primer PAR-R.
