<p>Clean reads from Illumina were compiled with 
 <italic>de novo</italic> assembly, using de Bruijn graphs assembly algorithms [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and contigs &lt;200 bp in length were not analyzed further. Remaining sequences underwent sequential BLASTx searching against GenBank database to eliminate the bacteria and eukaryotes contigs and identify suspect-viral sequences, which were longer than 200 bp, and taxonomic classification was queried from the NCBI taxonomy web service. The reference sequence of the source organism with the best contig alignment (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, the alignment with the lowest e-value ≤ 0.0001) was retrieved. Contigs of bacteria and eukaryotes were eliminated. If the reference sequence taxonomy was viral and aligned with the contig with an e-value of ≤0.0001, the sequence was flagged as suspect-viral and retained for further analysis.
