<p>Suspect viral sequences related to invertebrate virus families were excluded. Reference sequences were downloaded from NCBI. Global alignments with contigs were generated using ClustalX 1.83 [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], translated in MEGA 5 [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and edited with BIOEDIT v7.0 [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Gap-stripped alignments were then used to construct the phylogenetic trees by MrBayes 3.1.1 [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].
