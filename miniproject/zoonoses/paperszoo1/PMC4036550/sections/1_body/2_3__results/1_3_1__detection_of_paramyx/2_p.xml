<p>The phylogenetic tree of the L-gene, based on a 529 bp alignment is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-02138-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The phylogenetic analysis indicates that the paramyxovirus sequences identiﬁed in this study are separated into three distinct genera. Of them, KC599259 identified in 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <italic>. leschenaulti</italic>
 <italic>i</italic> was clustered with 
 <italic>Rubulavirus</italic>. KC599257 detected in 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <italic>. spelaea</italic> showed a close relationship with paramyxoviruses from 
 <italic>Eidolon helvum</italic> in urban Africa, which formed an unclassified sister clade to the genus 
 <italic>Henipavirus.</italic> The third cluster is that of five novel paramyxoviruses sharing a common ancestor and forming a phylogenetically diverse subgroup, closely related to genus 
 <italic>Jeilongvirus</italic>, comprising Jeilongvirus (J-virus) and Beilong virus [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Moreover, this cluster can be further divided into two clades, KC599255 and KC599258 from 
 <italic>Hipposideridae</italic>; and KC599260, KC599261, and KC599263 from 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <italic>. melanopogon</italic> (family 
 <italic>Emballonuridae</italic>). The deduced amino acid identity analysis supported the phylogenetic relationship observed using the nucleotide sequences (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="viruses-06-02138-s001">Table S3</xref>). KC599259 had the lowest homology (37.58%–40.61%) with other paramyxovirus sequences identified in this study and had a higher identity (61.49%–78.74%) with known 
 <italic>Rubulavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Rubulavirus</italic>-related virus. The novel paramyxoviruses (KC599255, KC599258, KC599260, KC599261 and KC599263) from insectivorous bats shared the highest amino acid identities (74.55%–100%), and had a relatively high homology with Jeilongvirus (74.25%–78.44%) and KC599257 (59.39%–64.85%). On the other hand, KC599257 was most closely related to Henipaviruses (92.94%).
