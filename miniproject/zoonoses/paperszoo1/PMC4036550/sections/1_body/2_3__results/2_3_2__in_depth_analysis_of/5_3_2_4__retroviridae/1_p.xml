<p>We identified 100 contigs, primarily related to three genera of retroviruses (Gamma, beta and unclassified retroviruses), and with e-values of 5

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="viruses-06-02138-s002">Table S6</xref>). These retroviral sequences related to all three canonical genes of retrovirus, including 28 Gag proteins, 66 protease/polymerase (Pol) and 6 envelope glycoproteins (Env), and some of them are highly closed to known bat tretroviruses [

 <xref rid="B39-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Three retrovirual contigs, which code Pol, Gag and Env of gammaretrovirus respectively and have the longest CDS, were used for phylogenetic analysis. Due to the amplification of the short retroviruses sequences, we have adjusted the tree according to the published bat retrovirus trees [

 <xref rid="B40-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] by removing some of the reference sequences. The phylogenetic trees indicated that Pol (KF547868) and Gag (KF547870) showed high homologous with bat gammaretroviruses, whereas Env (KF547869) couldn’t clade with those of bat gammaretroviruses indicating the possibility of new viruses (

Moreover, sequence analysis indicated that the translations of 55 of the 100 retrovirus contigs contained stop codons within the region of BLASTx alignments, suggesting that they originated from non-functional, endogenous/exogeneous retroviruses. In addition, BLASTx searching indicated that many contigs (such as comp6291_c0_seq1, comp48905_c0_seq1, comp8098_c0_seq1, comp6984_c0_seq1, comp92776_c0_seq1, comp71626_c0_seq1 and comp36376_c0_seq1) shared equivalent or relatively higher amino acid identity (52%–85%, e-values of 7
