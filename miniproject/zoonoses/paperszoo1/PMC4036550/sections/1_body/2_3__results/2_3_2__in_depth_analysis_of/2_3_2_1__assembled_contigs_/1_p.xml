<p>A total of 7066 assembled contigs (≥200 bp) were constructed and 6880 contigs with e-value ≤ 0.0001 were obtained. Data showed that the longest contig was 6481 bp and 310 contigs were longer than 1000 bp. A total of 73.1% (5029/6880) of contigs associated with microorganisms. 118 contigs that were homologous to eukaryotic viruses and phage. Moreover, we found 17 contigs that were homologs of parasites (
