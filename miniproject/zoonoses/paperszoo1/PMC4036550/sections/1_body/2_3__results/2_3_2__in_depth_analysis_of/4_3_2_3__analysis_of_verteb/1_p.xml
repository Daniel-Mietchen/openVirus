<p>Thirteen contigs of phage, 1 insect-virus, and 1 mycovirus contig were removed, and 103 contigs belonging to two mammalian-infecting viral families were left. Of them, 97% (100/103) were related to retroviruses and three contigs were related to a polyomavirus of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). For the 103 contigs of vertebrate viruses, the amino acid sequences were 35% to 90% homologous with viral protein sequences (e-value â‰¤ 0.0001). In these, 79 cotigs displayed low identity (&lt;70%) to known viruses at the amino acid level, suggesting that these belong to novel and genetically divergent viruses. The nucleotide BLASTx searches against the GenBank database are listed in
