<p>With the increase of human activities, habitat and survival of bats are severely reduced, thus causing habitat shifts in bat populations and increased opportunity for contact with humans. The close contact between humans and bats expands the opportunity for cross-species transmission of new zoonotic viruses to humans [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In the current study, we identified seven bats [including three insectivorous bats (
 <italic>Hipposideros cineraceus</italic>, 
 <italic>H</italic>
 <italic>. armiger</italic> and 
 <italic>Taphozous melanopogon</italic>) and two frugivorous bats (
 <italic>Eonycteris spelaea</italic> and 
 <italic>Rousettus leschenaultii</italic>)] positive for paramyxovirus by RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that paramyxoviruses carried by insectivorous bats were distinct from those found in frugivorous bats (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-06-02138-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Virus sequences from insectivorous bats could not be definitely assigned to any existing paramyxovirus genus, however, they appeared to cluster within the relatively new genus of the 
 <italic>Jeilongvirus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Moreover, we found that KC599257 (
 <italic>E</italic>
 <italic>. spelaea</italic>) and KC599259 (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <italic>. leschenaulti</italic>) from fruit bats belonged to 
 <italic>henipavirus</italic>-related paramyxovirus and 
 <italic>Rubulavirus</italic> genus, respectively. The finding of a henipavirus-related agent in 
 <italic>E. spelaea</italic> provides further evidence that there is a large spectrum of henipa-like viruses among bats, including insectivorous species. Li 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] previously found serological evidence of henipa-like viruses in bats, including 
 <italic>Rousettus spp.</italic>, 
 <italic>Myotis spp</italic>., 
 <italic>Hipposideros spp.</italic>, and 
 <italic>Miniopterus spp.</italic> in China. Henipaviruses have thus far overwhelmingly been identified in 
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> and 
 <italic>Eidolon</italic> species, though this may, in part, be due to a lack of surveillance in non-pteropodid bats [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The phylogenetic distance of species may constrain both cross-species transmission and host shifts and thus result in the separation of viruses [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Previous studies demonstrate that humans can be infected by paramyxoviruses through a secondary host species, such as horses and pigs, or directly from bats [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Although it is currently unknown whether paramyxoviruses, such as Jeilongvirus, are capable of infecting people, the potential risks of bat borne paramyxoviruses to human health should be considered and surveys of human populations highly exposed to bats for evidence of spillover of bat paramyxoviruses would help establish the public health risk.
