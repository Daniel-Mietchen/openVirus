<p>Over 120 bat species have been identified in China, and many are widely distributed throughout the southern provinces of Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These more ubiquitous bat species, which are in the genera of 
 <italic>Rousettus</italic>, 
 <italic>Myotis</italic>, 
 <italic>Miniopterus</italic> and 
 <italic>Hipposideros</italic>, naturally reside in close proximity to humans, thus increasing the potential of transmission of zoonotic pathogens to humans. Highly pathogenic paramyxoviruses have been identified in a variety of vertebrates, including humans, and phylogenetic reconstruction of host associations suggests a predominance of host switches from bats to other mammals and birds [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and often cause serious outbreaks of diseases [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, assessing the variety of paramyxoviruses circulating in bats in China could provide important guidance for the control and prevention of future epidemics.
