<p>Bats (order Chiroptera) comprise the second largest mammalian group in the world and are widely distributed across six continents [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Numerous bat species have been implicated as natural reservoirs for significant zoonotic viruses, including Ebola and, Marburg viruses; Nipah and Hendra viruses; SARS coronavirus; and most recently [

 <xref rid="B5-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Collectively, bats harbor a broad diversity of viruses, and it has been proposed that entire viral families and genera, such as pararmyxoviruses, hepaciviruses, and pegiviruses, may have originated from bats [

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. More than 170 viruses have been detected in bats, and many of these viruses are highly pathogenic to humans [

 <xref rid="B9-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], rabies virus [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], Australian Bat Lyssavirus [

 <xref rid="B13-viruses-06-02138" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Notably, the outbreak of SARS coronavirus in 2002, which originated in horseshoe bats in China and infected more than 8000 people globally, has spurred increased efforts from the international research community to characterize the diversity and distribution of bat viruses around the world [
