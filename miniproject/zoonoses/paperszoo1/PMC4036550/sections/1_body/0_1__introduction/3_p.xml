<p>Recently, high-throughput sequencing (e.g., Illumina, Solexa, 
 <italic>etc</italic>.)—a rapid and efficient technique using sequence-independent amplification of nucleic acids followed by shotgun sequencing—has been employed with great success to discover an enormous diversity of viruses in a range of samples, including marine and fresh water [

In this study, we used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to survey the prevalence of paramyxoviruses in bats from Yunnan China, and then conducted Illumina sequencing to characterize paramyxoviruses from bat samples. To date, this is the first reported metagenomic analysis in fecal samples of both insectivorous and frugivorous bats in China.
