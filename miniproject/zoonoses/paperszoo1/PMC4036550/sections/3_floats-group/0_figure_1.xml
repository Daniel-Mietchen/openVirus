 <caption>
  <p>Phylogenetic analysis of paramyxovirus L-gene identified by RT-PCR. Phylogenetic tree of paramyxoviruse L-gene was constructed based on a 529 bp sequence alignment with 
   <italic>Pneumovirinae</italic> subfamily as an outgroup. The accession numbers of sequences identified in this study are red and posterior probability values are shown next to the tree nodes. Posterior probability values are shown at each node (&gt;70%) and the bar represents the expected number of amino acid substitutions per site.
