<p>We detected WNV neutralizing antibodies in serum and CSF samples by using a modified method (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). In brief, we mixed 50% tissue culture infective doses of Kunjin virus strain MRM61C (100 U/mL) in 2% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 2-fold dilutions of heat-inactivated patient serum (1:10–1:640) in equal volumes and incubated the mixture for 1 h at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. We then added 1 volume of Vero cells (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL) in 2% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL of penicillin, and 100 μg/mL of streptomycin (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) and incubated the mixture for 72 h at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Samples were considered positive for WNV neutralizing antibodies if &lt;25% of the cells/well displayed cytopathic effect. Comparative testing with Wesselsbron virus, a closely related flavivirus, did not show cross-reactivity within the parameters of what we considered positive.
