<p>Nested rRT-PCR results and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the presence of lineage 2 WNV in the CSF sample from 1 patient (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure</xref>); sequencing showed that the virus is closely related to 2 neuroinvasive WNV lineage 2 strains identified in South Africa (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The low rate of PCR-positive cases was not entirely unexpected and may be explained by 2 factors: 1) PCR has limited success for detecting arboviruses because CSF contains low levels of virus and arbovirus-associated viremia is brief (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), and 2) false-negative test results may occur if samples are not properly stored to protect the integrity of potential viral RNA.
