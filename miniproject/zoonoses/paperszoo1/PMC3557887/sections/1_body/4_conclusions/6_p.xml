<p>Our findings confirm that WNV is being overlooked as a cause of severe neurologic disease in South Africa, and they suggest a need for increased clinical awareness, enhanced prospective surveillance, and a more current serosurvey of WNV infection in humans. PCR may be a useful diagnostic method during early infection, but after seroconversion has taken place, serologic tests (e.g., IgM ELISA in conjunction with virus neutralization) are more likely to yield accurate results.</p>
