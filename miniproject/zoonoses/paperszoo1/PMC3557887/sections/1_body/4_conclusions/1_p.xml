<p>We conducted a retrospective investigation of patients hospitalized with febrile illness or neurologic disease of unknown etiology in the Pretoria region of South Africa to determine whether some of the cases could be ascribed to WNV infection. Evidence of acute WNV infection was identified in samples for 7 patients (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). For 2 of the patients, WNV infection was identified by the presence of IgM and neutralizing antibodies in serum samples; these patients had been hospitalized for febrile illness. For the other 5 patients, infection was identified by a WNVâ€“positive (by PCR) CSF sample (1 patient) and by the presence of neutralizing antibodies in CSF samples (4 patients); these patients had been hospitalized for neurologic signs and symptoms.
