<p>To evaluate the sensitivity of the 3 diagnostic methods used in our study, we conducted a time-trial experiment by using retrospective serum samples from a patient in whom WNV meningoencephalitis developed after a needlestick injury (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Early samples (postexposure days 8 and 9) were positive for WNV by rRT-PCR only. Results for samples obtained ≥13 and ≥16 days after exposure were positive by neutralization assays and IgM ELISA, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), may imply that some cases of WNV infection in humans and animals may be missed if IgM ELISA is the only serologic test used.
