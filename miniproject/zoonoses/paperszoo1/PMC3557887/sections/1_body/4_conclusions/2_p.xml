<p>The 4 patients with neutralizing antibodies in CSF all had severe neurologic complications (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Samples from these patients were insufficient for performing IgM testing; thus, WNV infection cannot be definitively determined. However, the presence of WNV neutralizing antibody in CSF samples plus acute clinical signs and symptoms of WNV infection provide a high index of suspicion for WNV infection in these patients. Factors such as increased bloodâ€“brain barrier permeability and the persistence of WNV antibodies long after infection may also serve as explanations for the presence of neutralizing antibodies in their CSF.
