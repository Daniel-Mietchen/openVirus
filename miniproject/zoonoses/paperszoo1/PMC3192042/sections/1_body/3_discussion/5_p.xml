<p>There are an increasing number of commercially available systems for simplified PCR testing for influenza viruses 
 <xref rid="pone.0025526-Teo1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> at various stages of development and validation that may be able to fulfill similar roles. Some are designed for possible use outside large laboratories 
 <xref rid="pone.0025526-Popowitch1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> but have not been tested in field laboratories. Others have the potential to deliver results closer to the patient 
 <xref rid="pone.0025526-Teo1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0025526-Daum1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> but have yet to be evaluated in that setting for humans, though there is some early data from animal studies 
 <xref rid="pone.0025526-Takekawa1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> . The weaknesses of all these devices is that they are not easily or quickly adaptable to new or changing pathogens, they may not offer the range of tests required in different geographic or climatic situations, and they may be expensive to perform.
