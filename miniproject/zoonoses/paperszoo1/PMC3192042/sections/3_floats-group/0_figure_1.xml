  <p>Deployable molecular biology equipment used during the exercise. The layout corresponds to the two modules; left table – static field hospital used for real time PCR assays, right table – field portable. Only the hand-held magnetic bead extraction device from the field portable module was used in an attempt to detect influenza A by PCR assay during the military exercise.</p>
