<p>To test this MMTV resistance hypothesis further, we simulated the evolution of an MMTV-resistant receptor by mutating only the residue positions under positive selection in the MMTV binding surface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001571-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). We mutated the TfR1 of house mouse, the MMTV host, so that these three positions now encode the amino acids found in the TfR1 of the vesper mouse, which is not susceptible to MMTV. MDCK (dog) cells were transduced to stably express the mutant or wild-type TfR1 protein. These cells were chosen because dog TfR1 does not support entry by arenaviruses

 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. An extracellular FLAG tag was added to each receptor so that cell surface expression could be monitored on live cells by flow cytometry. We then measured the cellular entry of GFP-encoding retroviral vectors expressing the MMTV Env on their surface (MMTV pseudoviruses). Indeed, the three mutations in house mouse TfR1 almost completely abolished the entry of MMTV into cells (Welch t-test,

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001571-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). None of the sites of positive selection that we identified are found near the dimerization domain of TfR1, the region known to be most important for interaction with iron-transport binding partners (

 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Giannetti1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. We confirmed that these mutations indeed do not alter transferrin binding (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001571-g006">Figure 6C,D</xref>). Thus, amino acid substitutions at these sites in TfR1 can block virus entry without deleterious consequences to surface expression or receptor function, providing a clear hypothesis for why they might have a strong selectable advantage in MMTV-infected rodent populations.
