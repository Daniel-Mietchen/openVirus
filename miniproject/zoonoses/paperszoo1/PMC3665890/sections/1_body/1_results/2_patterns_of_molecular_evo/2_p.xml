<p>Arms races are predicted to drive positive selection in both the host and virus genes involved, so we next analyzed the gene encoding the arenavirus surface protein, GP, for signatures of positive selection. Because the co-crystal structure has been solved of the Machupo virus surface glycoprotein subunit GP1 in complex with TfR1, the specific residues on GP1 that interact with TfR1 are known (blue lines below protein schematic in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001571-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We analyzed an alignment of 
 <italic>gp1</italic> from 13 human and mouse isolates of Machupo virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001571-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In this alignment, 11 codons bear the signature of dN/dS&gt;1 (red lines above diagram in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001571-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001571.s004">Table S2</xref>). Ten of these correspond to surface-exposed residues in the GP1 structure 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Bowden1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. Strikingly, all 10 are located on the surface of GP1 that faces TfR1, and none fall on the opposite side of GP1 that faces the virion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001571-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Four of the residues under positive selection directly contact TfR1, and the rest are located near residues that do (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001571-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Using a permutation test, we find that the 16 TfR1-binding residues of GP1 are significantly enriched for sites of positive selection (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005). Like all virus surface proteins, GP1 will have also experienced selection for immune escape, a complication that makes signatures of dN/dS&gt;1 more difficult to interpret in viral genes than in host genes. However, GP1 residues in direct contact with TfR1 are unlikely to successfully mutate for the purpose of immune escape during an active infection. An arms race between rodent TfR1 and arenavirus GP1 is thus supported by the rapid evolution of each partner in this interaction, specifically in residues that are known to mediate contact with the other.
