<p>In the 
 <italic>TFR1</italic> dataset analyzed, only one of the rodent species included is known to harbor MMTV in the wild (house mouse; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001571-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). It was thus unclear why we detected positive selection in the MMTV binding surface of TfR1 with the rodent dataset that was used. We hypothesized that either the evolutionary signature in the MMTV binding surface of TfR1 was driven by something else, or that MMTV-like viruses once circulated more widely through rodent genera. We reasoned that if the latter hypothesis is true, “fossils” of these extinct viruses might be found in the form of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) integrated into the genomes of their former host species. Indeed, we identified MMTV-like ERVs in the genomes of the brown rat (
 <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>) and the North American deer mouse (
 <italic>Peromyscus maniculatus</italic>) (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001571.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The full-length ERV identified in the deer mouse genome is particularly interesting because this rodent is in the same family as the arenavirus host species (
 <italic>Cricetidae</italic>; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001571-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). These ERVs reveal that MMTV-like viruses once circulated more widely amongst rodents, supporting the model that rodent 
 <italic>TFR1</italic> may have experienced selection imposed by these viruses. Interestingly, MMTV appears to be a virus in retreat, with a shrinking host range. We cannot exclude the possibility that MMTV-like viruses still infect other rodent species and have simply not been identified, but such viruses have not been reported in the literature or in GenBank

 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Phan1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. These MMTV ERVs are thus reminiscent of the many ERV families found in the human genome, none of which currently circulate in infectious form
