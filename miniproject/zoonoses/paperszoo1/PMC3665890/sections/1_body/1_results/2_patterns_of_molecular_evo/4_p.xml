<p>Based on these findings, TfR1 may have experienced high levels of sequence divergence on the MMTV-binding surface due to selection for mutations that blocked entry by these MMTV-like viruses. Consistent with this, we find that TfR1 orthologs from three different 
 <italic>Cricetidae</italic> species are highly recalcitrant to entry by MMTV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001571-g004">Figure 4</xref>), even though this rodent family appears to once have harbored a similar virus. In an arms race between TfR1 and MMTV, the MMTV Env should also be evolving in response to the evolution of TfR1. Compared to Machupo virus GP1, far less is known about the amino acids in MMTV Env that bind to TfR1, as there is no co-crystal structure of Env in complex with TfR1. However, a five amino acid receptor binding motif in MMTV Env has been identified 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. We find that this motif has a distinct protein sequence depending on the particular rodent host species from which each virus was isolated (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001571.s002">Figure S2</xref>), consistent with viruses having uniquely evolved compatibility with each host TfR1 (before they potentially went extinct). An incomplete understanding of receptor binding determinants in MMTV Env, and the fact that most of these viruses now exist as endogenous copies, make it difficult to draw specific conclusions about the evolution of MMTV Env. Nonetheless, an arms race between TfR1 and MMTV is supported by the rapid evolution of residues on the MMTV-interaction surface of TfR1, the discovery that MMTV-like viruses once infected rodents more broadly providing a model for what drove this selection, and the observation that several 
 <italic>Cricetidae</italic> TfR1 in their current form do not support MMTV entry, suggesting that they could have been selected for this property.
