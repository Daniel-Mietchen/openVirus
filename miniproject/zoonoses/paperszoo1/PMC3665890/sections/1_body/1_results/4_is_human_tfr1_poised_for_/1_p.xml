<p>Every round of positive selection of the rodent 
 <italic>TFR1</italic> gene began with a random mutation that arose in a single rodent individual. If this mutation offered protection against virus entry while not otherwise causing major fitness defects related to iron homeostasis, it would have been favored by natural selection and would have become more common or even fixed in the population where it arose. Because the New World arenaviruses are currently emerging into human populations, they are now beginning to exert selective pressure on the human population as well. For instance, there have been approximately 30,000 cases of Argentine hemorrhagic fever caused by the Junin virus since the 1950s, with a case fatality rate of 20% 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Charrel1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The geographic region at risk for this disease is expanding into north-central Argentina, and currently includes an area populated by around 5 million people 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Charrel1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Individuals with genotypes that make them less susceptible to infection or severe illness are expected to survive with bias over other individuals. This selection would intensify as the frequency or severity of the disease increases. In such cases, natural selection would be expected to act at any genetic locus where functionally distinct alleles exist within the human population. We wished to investigate whether 
 <italic>TFR1</italic> may be one such locus.
