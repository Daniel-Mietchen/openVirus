<p>The L212V SNP has only been reported in Asian populations (Chinese and Japanese), while TfR1-utilizing arenaviruses have only been found in the Americas. We sequenced 
 <italic>TFR1</italic> from 18 indigenous Central and South American individuals, but identified no instances of this polymorphism. Like all SNPs, this SNP arose randomly and may have no fitness advantage or disadvantage in the Asian populations where it is found, since TfR1-utilizing arenaviruses are not found in that part of the world. Nonetheless, this SNP could begin to experience selection if the rodent populations that carry these viruses were introduced into Asia, if these arenaviruses ever evolved to spread efficiently from human to human, or in the event of an intentional release of these viruses 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Borio1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. The data shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001571-g007">Figure 7C,D</xref> indicate that protective 
 <italic>TFR1</italic> alleles can act in a semidominant fashion with regards to virus entry, because the human cells used in these experiments also express wild-type TfR1. We speculate that this occurs either because mutant and wild-type TfR1 proteins are forming heterodimers with one another, or because expression of a second allele that is functional for iron-uptake results in lower levels of wild-type TfR1 (
 <italic>TFR1</italic> expression levels are tightly regulated for the purpose of maintaining iron homeostasis 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Choe1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>). Either model would also be relevant in heterozygous individuals, suggesting that selection could act on SNPs conveying protection against viral entry even when they are rare and found predominantly in heterozygotes.
