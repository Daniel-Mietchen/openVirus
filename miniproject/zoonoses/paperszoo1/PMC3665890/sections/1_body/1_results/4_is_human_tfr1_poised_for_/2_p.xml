<p>TfR1 interacts with arenaviruses and MMTV through distinct interaction surfaces (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001571-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). TfR1 is 760 amino acids long, but a small stretch of nine residues from 204 to 212 is the major determinant of species-specificity for arenavirus entry (colored yellow in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001571-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). These residues span two beta strands and the intervening loop (βII-1–βII-2). Two of the sites of positive selection (residues 205 and 209) fall in this stretch of nine residues, and the third (residue 215) falls three amino acids away (colored red in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001571-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). As we demonstrated for the sites under positive selection in the MMTV binding surface, the introduction of amino acids from different rodent species at positions in this stretch has been previously shown to alter patterns of virus compatibility

 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Abraham2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. By querying SNP databases, we identified a human SNP located in this structural feature, L212V (colored blue in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001571-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Because of the localization of this SNP near the residues under positive selection, we hypothesized that the L212V human polymorphism might affect arenavirus entry.
