<p>To test this, we again focused on Machupo virus. We constructed stable cell lines that express either human 212L or 212V TfR1. In the context of MDCK cells, dog TfR1 does not allow entry by Machupo virus, so the expression of either human allele allows more virus entry than is observed in MDCK cells alone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001571-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). However, the minor TfR1 212V variant supports about half the level of entry as seen with TfR1 212L (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001571-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Valine at position 212 may lead to a modest decrease in binding affinity with GP1 due to loss of a hydrophobic contact, based on the observation that two residues of Machupo GP1 (Phe226 and Pro223) are in van der Waals contact with TfR1 Leu212 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Abraham1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. We next stably expressed the human 212V and 212L 
 <italic>TFR1</italic> alleles in human cell lines that are themselves homozygous for 212L: HEK293 (kidney) and HEL299 (lung). Lung cells are especially relevant since arenaviruses are transmitted to humans through respiratory inhalation. In both cases, expression of the minor 212V allele was again protective against virus entry compared to the wild-type allele (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001571-g007">Figure 7C,D</xref>). Thus, we have identified a SNP (L212V) that conveys some protection against arenavirus entry, at least in vitro.
