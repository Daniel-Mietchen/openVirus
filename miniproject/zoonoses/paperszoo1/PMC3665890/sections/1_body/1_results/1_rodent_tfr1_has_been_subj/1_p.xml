<p>We investigated the evolution of 
 <italic>TFR1</italic> in rodents, where two different virus families use this receptor for cellular entry. The type of selective pressure that has acted on a gene can be inferred from the pattern of mutations that it has accumulated over time 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Holmes1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. The rate at which mammalian genes accumulate amino acid–altering DNA mutations (dN; nonsynonymous mutations) is typically far slower than the rate at which they accumulate mutations that leave the amino acid unchanged (dS; synonymous mutations) 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Meyerson1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. This is because most amino acid–altering mutations are deleterious. This signature (dN/dS&lt;&lt;1) stands in contrast to the pattern that is observed when genes have experienced multiple rounds of positive selection for protein-altering mutations (dN/dS&gt;1). However, in host-virus arms race situations, patterns of dN/dS&gt;1 would not be expected throughout the entire length of a gene, but rather specifically in the codons correlating to the interaction interface between host and virus proteins (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Meyerson1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Daugherty1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>). We used the codeml program in PAML 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Yang2" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref> to analyze dN/dS ratios in codons in an alignment of 
 <italic>TFR1</italic> from seven rodent species, five of which are known host species for the New World arenaviruses or MMTV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001571-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We found variable patterns of codon evolution in 
 <italic>TFR1</italic>. For instance, in codon model M2a, maximum likelihood estimation indicates that 78% of codons are extremely conserved with dN/dS = 0.09, 19% evolve neutrally with dN/dS = 1, and 2.4% are under positive selection with dN/dS = 4.2. Codon models that allow a subset of codons to evolve under positive selection (dN/dS&gt;1) fit the data significantly better than models where positive selection is not allowed (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001571.s003">Table S1</xref>). Thus, while much of the protein sequence of TfR1 is extremely conserved, a small percentage of residue positions are rapidly evolving.
