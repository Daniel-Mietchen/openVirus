<p>There is reason to believe that host-virus arms races are also shaping the protein sequence of other virus entry receptors in the manner described here. There are several other examples where significant sequence and functional divergence exist both on the side of a virus and its host entry receptor. For instance, certain strains of murine leukemia virus (MLV) use the rodent XPR1 receptor for cellular entry 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Kozak2" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>. There are several functionally distinct variants of the 
 <italic>XPR1</italic> gene encoded by rodents of the genus 
 <italic>Mus</italic>, each with its own pattern of virus susceptibilities. The viruses that use this receptor are also highly variable in the receptor-binding portion of their surface protein, Env. High levels of sequence divergence and disparate interaction specificities have also been observed between the entry receptor TVB encoded by birds and the avian leukosis virus (ALV) strains that use this receptor 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Rainey1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. In neither of these cases is the housekeeping function or structure of the receptor known, so the pleiotropic consequences of pathogen-driven selection remain to be explored. However, both of these viruses can evolve to use new allelic forms of their receptor encoded by new hosts, suggesting that the receptors are important determinants of host range. High levels of sequence divergence, along with polymorphic and species-specific interactions between receptors and viruses, should be the hallmark for this type of evolution. These patterns have also been observed in other pairs of receptors and viruses

 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Demogines2" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>, suggesting that arms races might shape many receptors and potentially other types of housekeeping proteins exploited by viruses as well
