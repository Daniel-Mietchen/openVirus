<p>Transferrin receptor (TfR1) is the cell-surface receptor for iron-loaded transferrin circulating in the blood 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Aisen1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. TfR1-transferrin complexes are internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and iron is released in acidic endosomes. Besides transferrin, the other major binding partner of TfR1 is the hereditary hemochromatosis protein (HFE), which negatively regulates iron uptake. In addition to these host-beneficial interactions, three different families of viruses are known to interact with TfR1 to trigger their own cellular entry. TfR1 likely constitutes an attractive target for viruses because it is both ubiquitous and specifically up-regulated in rapidly dividing cells 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Aisen1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Because of the tremendous investment that has been made in understanding both TfR1 and the viruses that exploit it, there are rich structural and functional data available. For instance, co-crystal structures have been solved of human TfR1 in complex with both of its cellular iron-transport binding partners

 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Abraham1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. For this reason, TfR1 provides an ideal opportunity to investigate how cellular housekeeping proteins evolve to combat viruses that are exploiting them while simultaneously preserving critical cellular functions.
