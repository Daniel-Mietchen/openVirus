<p>While infectious disease research has long focused on host antiviral proteins, host proteins that facilitate viral replication are now an exploding area of inquiry 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Friedel1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. These proteins represent novel targets for the development of antiviral drugs because interruption of the interactions between virions and host proteins like TfR1 are predicted to block viral replication. In nature, evolution has utilized two paradigms for achieving this same goal. In some cases, host genes encoding pathogen entry receptors have accumulated promoter or other mutations that cause reduced or no expression of the receptor protein 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Riddick1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Clifford1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, 
 <italic>TFR1</italic>, given the essential nature of its housekeeping functions, would be unlikely to tolerate hypomorphic mutations. For retroviruses, host genomes are known to employ a second mechanism to block virus entry, one that exploits a unique property of the retroviral lifecycle. Unlike other viruses, retroviruses permanently integrate into the host genome during viral replication. If viral genomes become integrated in the host germline, they can be passed to future generations and inherited in a Mendelian fashion

 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Stoye1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In several instances, retroviral surface proteins (Envs) expressed from these integrated retroviral copies compete with exogenous viruses for receptor use

 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-McDougall1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Host genomes are presumably selected to keep these retroviral 
 <italic>env</italic> open reading frames intact because they offer protection against infection by exogenous viruses that use the same receptor 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Jern1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Stoye1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Aswad1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Given the critical role of TfR1 in iron homeostasis, there may be a fitness cost to competitive binding by genome-encoded copies of the retroviral Env. Indeed, there is no evidence for either of these models (hypomorphic mutations or competitive inhibition) in the 
 <italic>TFR1</italic> literature. How, then, do critical genes like 
 <italic>TFR1</italic> respond to virus-driven selective pressure?
