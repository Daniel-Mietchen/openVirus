<p>Most of what is known about the evolutionary dynamics between host and virus genomes comes from studies of antiviral genes, particularly those encoding viral sensors. Viral sensors (also referred to as “pattern recognition receptors” or “restriction factors”) are host proteins like RIG-I and TRIM5α that recognize and destroy viruses that are attempting to replicate inside of host cells

 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Malim1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Because these sensors can be so effective, viruses often encode proteins that antagonize them or their downstream executors

 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Duggal1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>). Arms races play out in the protein–protein interactions that exist between host and virus proteins, and they drive endless rounds of “positive selection” for mutations that alter these interactions. This results in the rapid evolution of both proteins (host and virus) engaged in the conflict. Indeed, host-encoded viral sensors are often exceptionally genetically divergent between species and diverse within species

 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Sawyer2" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. As a result, such genes are appreciated as major genetic barriers to host switching by viruses in nature, because unique virus mutations are required to counteract the divergent viral sensors present in each new host species
