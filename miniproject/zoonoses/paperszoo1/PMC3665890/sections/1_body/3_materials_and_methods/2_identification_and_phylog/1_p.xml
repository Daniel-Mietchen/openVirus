<p>Full-length MMTV sequences were obtained on GenBank (AF228552, D16249, AF033807, AF228551). These sequences were used to BLAT 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Kent1" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref> the current assemblies of the 
 <italic>M. musculus</italic> (mm9) 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Mouse1" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref> and 
 <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> (rn4) 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Gibbs1" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref> genomes on the UCSC genome browser 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Fujita1" ref-type="bibr">[92]</xref>, recovering the indicated ERVs in these genomes. The nr/nt database for rodents (taxid:9989) at NCBI was searched for similar sequences in other species using the discontiguous megablast search algorithm with full-length MMTV as a query, and using the tBLASTx algorithm with MMTV 
 <italic>pol</italic> as a query. Both of these approaches identified the 
 <italic>Peromyscus maniculatus</italic> ERV buried in the sequence of GenBank record EU204642 (a BAC clone containing the deer mouse beta-globin gene cluster). A relatively young age of this ERV can be inferred from the fact that one open reading frame (
 <italic>pol</italic>) is still uninterrupted, and from the observation that the 5′ and 3′ LTRs differ at only 1 out of 917 positions. The giraffe, bison, and musk ox sequences are from 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Gifford1" ref-type="bibr">[93]</xref>. Exogenous and endogenous beta-retrovirus genome sequences were aligned with MUSCLE 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Edgar1" ref-type="bibr">[94]</xref> as implemented in MEGA5 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Tamura1" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>. jModeltest v2.1.1 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Darriba1" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref> was used to select GTR+I+G as the best-fit model of nucleotide substitution. Phylogenetic trees were built by the maximum likelihood method implemented in MEGA5. Positions in which one or more sequences contained a gap were excluded during tree building. One thousand bootstrap replicates were performed and results are presented as percentage of replicates that supported each node.
