<p>The above described LPCX:
 <italic>TFR1</italic> retroviral vectors were packaged in 293T cells by co-transfecting them along with the NB-MLV packaging plasmid pCS2-mGP 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Yamashita1" ref-type="bibr">[95]</xref> and pC-VSV-G using Fugene (Roche). Supernatants were collected and used to infect MDCK.2 (dog) cells. After 24 h, media containing 3.5 µg ml
 <sup>−1</sup> puromycin was added to select for transduced cells (1.0 µg ml
 <sup>−1</sup> puromycin was added when creating the HEK293 and HEL299 stable cell lines). These receptors have a C-terminal FLAG tag that is extracellular when the receptor is at the cell surface 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Abraham2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Expression of TfR1 proteins was detected in live cells by flow cytometry using an anti-FLAG antibody conjugated with Allophycocyanin (Abcam, catalog ab72569). Stable cell lines expressing human 212L and 212V 
 <italic>TFR1</italic> alleles were made in MDCK, HEK293, and HEL299 cells as described above.
