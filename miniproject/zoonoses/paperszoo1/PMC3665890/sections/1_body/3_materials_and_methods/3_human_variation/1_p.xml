<p>The L212V SNP in human 
 <italic>TFR1</italic> (rs41301381) was identified in data deposited by the 1000 Genomes Project (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://browser.1000genomes.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://browser.1000genomes.org</ext-link>). As of Release 12, L212V had been found as a heterozygous SNP in 11 individuals, with no homozygous carriers identified. Three of these individuals were Han Chinese from the South (CHS population), six were Han Chinese from Beijing (CHB population), and two were Japanese individuals (JPT population). In total, 11 out of 286 Asian individuals surveyed were heterozygous at this position, yielding a genotypic frequency of 0.038 in Asia. This SNP has not been included in the HapMap Genotyping Project (as of Release 28).
