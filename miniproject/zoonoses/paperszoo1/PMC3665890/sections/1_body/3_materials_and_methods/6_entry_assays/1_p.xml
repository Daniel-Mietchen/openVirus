<p>Arenavirus GP or MMTV Env pseudotyped MLV recombinant retroviruses were packaged in 293T cells. Fugene (Roche) was used to co-transfect the GFP-encoding transfer vector pQCXIX (BD Biosciences) along with plasmids encoding MLV Gag-Pol and one of the viral surface glycoproteins Machupo GP, Junin GP, Guanarito GP, or MMTV Env. After 48 h, supernatants containing viruses were harvested, filtered, and frozen at −80°C. For entry assays, cell lines stably expressing various TfR1 orthologs or human alleles were plated at a concentration of 1.0×10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well in a 24-well plate and, after 24 h, infected with pseudotyped virus along with 5 µg ml
 <sup>−1</sup> polybrene. The plates were spinoculated with centrifugation at 350
 <italic>g</italic> for 1.25 h at 30°C. After 2 h of incubation at 37°C, cells were washed once with PBS and the media was replaced. Two days postinfection, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells were first gated for live cells and then, using an anti-FLAG antibody conjugated with Allophycocyanin (APC; Abcam, catalog ab72569), further gated such that all samples were narrowed to the same log decade of receptor expression (capturing the majority of cells but excluding outliers). Where TfR1 expression levels are reported, this is the mean fluorescent intensity within this gated population (10,000 cells). These same 10,000 cells were scored for expression of GFP (viral entry). Analysis of flow cytometry data was performed using FlowJo 8.8.6 (TreeStar Inc, Ashland, OR).
