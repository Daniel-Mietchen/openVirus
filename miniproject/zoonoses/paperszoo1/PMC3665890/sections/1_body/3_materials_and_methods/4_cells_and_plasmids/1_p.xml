<p>Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (ATCC CRL-11268), HEK293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573), human embryonic lung HEL299 cells (ATCC CCL-137), and canine kidney MDCK.2 cells (ATCC CRL-2936) were all maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100 units ml
 <sup>−1</sup> penicillin, 100 µg ml
 <sup>−1</sup> streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine (Cellgro). Human, 
 <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, 
 <italic>Calomys musculinus</italic>, 
 <italic>Calomys callosus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Zygodontomys brevicauda TFR1</italic> with an encoded C-terminal FLAG tag were moved from pcDNA3.1 (+) vectors (described previously 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Radoshitzky2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>) into the Gateway entry vector pCR8 using the pCR8/GW/TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). The following primers were used to amplify 
 <italic>TfR1</italic> for TA cloning: 
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′</named-content> and 
 <named-content content-type="gene">5′-TAGAAGGCACAGTCGAGGC-3′</named-content>. Gateway LR recombination (Invitrogen) was performed to transfer 
 <italic>TFR1</italic> genes from pCR8 into the entry site in a Gateway-converted LPCX retroviral vector. Site-directed mutagenesis of the human, 
 <italic>M. musculus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Z. brevicauda TFR1</italic> orthologs was performed using QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmids encoding Machupo, Junin, and Guanarito GP have been described previously 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Radoshitzky1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. An MMTV Env-encoding plasmid (pQ61) was kindly provided by Dr. Susan Ross (via Dr. Jackie Dudley).
