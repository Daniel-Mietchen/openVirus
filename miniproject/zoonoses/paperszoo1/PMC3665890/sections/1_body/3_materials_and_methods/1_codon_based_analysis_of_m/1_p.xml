<p>Rodent 
 <italic>TFR1</italic> and Machupo 
 <italic>gp1</italic> sequences were analyzed for positive selection. Database accession numbers for sequences used are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001571.s003">Tables S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001571.s004">S2</xref>. Sequences were aligned in Clustal 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>, with minor adjustments made by hand (these two alignments contain few or no indels, respectively). jModeltest v2.1.1 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Darriba1" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref> was used to select the best-fit model of nucleotide substitution, which was HKY+G in both cases. Phylogenetic trees for each sequence set were built by the maximum likelihood method implemented in MEGA5 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Tamura1" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>. The 
 <italic>TFR1</italic> gene tree matches the species tree of these rodents 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-DEla1" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>. Because the Machupo 
 <italic>gp1</italic> sequences represent viral isolates from the same population, GARD 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Pond1" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref> was run on the 
 <italic>gp1</italic> alignment to confirm the lack of phylogenetic breakpoints indicative of recombination. For both datasets, maximum likelihood analysis of dN/dS was then performed with codeml in the PAML 4.1 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Yang2" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref> software package. To detect selection, multiple alignments were fit to the NSsites models M1a (neutral model, codon values of dN/dS are fit into two site classes, one with value between 0 and 1, and one fixed at dN/dS = 1), M2a (positive selection model, similar to M1a but with an extra codon class of dN/dS&gt;1 allowed), M7 (neutral model, codon values of dN/dS fit to a beta distribution, dN/dS&gt;1 disallowed), M8a (neutral model, similar to M7 except with a fixed codon class at dN/dS = 1), and M8 (positive selection model, similar to M7 but with an extra class of dN/dS&gt;1 allowed). Model fitting was performed with multiple seed values for dN/dS (ω) and assuming either the f61 or f3x4 model of codon frequencies 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Goldman1" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>. Likelihood ratio tests were performed to assess whether permitting some codons to evolve under positive selection gives a significantly better fit to the data than models where positive selection is not allowed. The results obtained were shown to be robust to changes in the codon frequency model used, and the seed value for dN/dS (
