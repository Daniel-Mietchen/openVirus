  <title>Mutations at sites of positive selection do not alter TfR1 association with host proteins.</title>
  <p>Co-crystal structures of human TfR1 in complex with (A) human transferrin (1SUV) 
   <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and (B) human HFE (1DE4) 
   <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Bennett1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> illustrate that sites of positive selection (red) fall at a distance from these protein–protein interaction surfaces. Thus, mutations at these sites are not predicted to affect important host-beneficial functions of TfR1. MDCK cells stably expressing wild-type and mutant TfR1 were incubated with media containing FITC-labeled iron-loaded mouse transferrin. The cells were then washed and analyzed by flow cytometry for the mean fluorescent intensities (m.f.i.) of (C) FITC-transferrin and (D) a fluorescently labeled α-FLAG antibody measuring TfR1 surface expression. In all experiments, three replicates were performed and error bars indicate one standard deviation.
