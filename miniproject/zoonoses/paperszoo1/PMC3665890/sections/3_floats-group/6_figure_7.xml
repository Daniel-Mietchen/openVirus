  <title>A human SNP in TfR1 is protective against Machupo virus entry.</title>
  <p>(A) The apical domain of human TfR1 is shown in green, in a co-crystal structure with the Machupo GP1 shown in grey (PDB 3KAS) 
   <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Abraham1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The βII-1–βII-2 species-specific virus binding motif (residues 204–212) is highlighted in yellow. The side chains of residue positions identified as evolving under positive selection are shown in red. A human SNP (L212V; rs41301381) has been reported at position 212, shown in blue. (B) MDCK, (C) HEK293, or (D) HEL299 cells were stably transduced to express either 212L TfR1 or 212V TfR1 (or an empty vector) and then infected with various amounts of Machupo pseudovirus. Virus entry is scored by percentage of cells that become GFP positive (+). The error bars in the HEL299 experiment are large due to difficulty in sorting these cells. Nonetheless, this pattern of relative entry between the different 
   <italic>TFR1</italic> alleles expressed in HEL299 cells was observed in four independent experiments (not shown). (B, C, D, right-hand panels) Relative cell-surface expression of human TfR1 variants in each cell line was measured on live cells with a fluorescently labeled α-FLAG antibody. In all experiments, three replicates were performed and error bars indicate one standard deviation.
