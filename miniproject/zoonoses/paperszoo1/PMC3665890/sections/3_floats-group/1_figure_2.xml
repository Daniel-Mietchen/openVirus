  <title>Residues under positive selection on the receptor binding surface of Machupo virus GP1.</title>
  <p>(A) A diagram of the Machupo virus surface glycoprotein precursor protein, GP. This protein is cleaved into three subunits: the stable signal peptide (SSP), the receptor-binding component GP1, and a transmembrane component GP2. The 16 residue positions that directly contact TfR1, as defined previously 
   <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Abraham1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, are shown with blue lines positioned at the bottom of the diagram. An alignment of codons 24â€“256, spanning part of the SSP and almost all of GP1, was analyzed for codons with dN/dS&gt;1. Residues corresponding to dN/dS&gt;1 codons are indicated with red lines positioned above the diagram. Asterisks indicate four residues that both directly contact the receptor and are under positive selection. (B) A maximum likelihood tree of the 13 Machupo virus sequences analyzed. All of these viruses were isolated in Bolivia, in the years and regions indicated, from either humans (bold sequences) or 
   <italic>Calomys</italic> mice (other sequences). The tree is unrooted. (C) The crystal structure of Machupo GP1 (PDB 2WFO) 
   <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Bowden1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref> showing residues that contact TfR1 
   <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Abraham1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> (blue), residues under positive selection (red), and the four residues that both contact TfR1 and are under positive selection (purple).
