  <p>Evolution of the putative receptor binding motif of MMTV Env. A partial alignment of the viral protein Env is shown. The alignment includes all available rodent MMTV and MMTV-like virus sequences, as described in more detail in the manuscript, including the endogenous retrovirus found in the 
   <italic>Peromyscus maniculatus</italic> genome. The TfR1 binding determinants of MMTV Env have not fully been mapped, but a TfR1-binding motif has been described 
   <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref> and is shown here in yellow. Changes from the MMTV sequence in this region are shown in bold. Viruses and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) isolated from each of the three species encode different residues in this motif, but the functional significance of this is unknown.
