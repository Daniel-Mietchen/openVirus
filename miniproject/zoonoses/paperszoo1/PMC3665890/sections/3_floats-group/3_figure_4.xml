  <title>Cellular entry of MMTV and Machupo virus is permitted by some but not all rodent TfR1 orthologs.</title>
  <p>MDCK cells were transduced to stably express the TfR1 of various 
   <italic>Cricetidae</italic> and 
   <italic>Muridae</italic> species used in the evolutionary analysis, or human TfR1. An extracellular FLAG tag was added to each receptor and cell surface expression was monitored on live cells by flow cytometry. These cells were infected with GFP-encoding retroviral vectors pseudotyped with the surface glycoproteins of (A) MMTV or (B) Machupo virus. Relative entry is scored by the mean fluorescent intensity (m.f.i.) of GFP. As previously reported, the surface protein of Machupo virus mediates cellular entry through the TfR1 of the Machupo virus host species, the vesper mouse (green line), and to a lesser extent through TfR1 of zygodont (orange line) and human TfR1 (red line) 
   <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Radoshitzky2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In contrast, cellular entry of MMTV was supported strictly by the TfR1 of house mouse.
