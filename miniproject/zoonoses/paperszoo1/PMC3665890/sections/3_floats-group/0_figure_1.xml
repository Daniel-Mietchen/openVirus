  <title>
   <italic>TFR1</italic> evolution in rodents has been shaped by two separate host-virus arms races.
  </title>
  <p>(A) A cladogram illustrates the evolutionary relationship of the rodent species analyzed. These species fall into two major families: 
   <italic>Muridae</italic> and 
   <italic>Cricetidae</italic>. The retrovirus (MMTV) and arenaviruses known to be harbored by these rodents in nature are also indicated. Three of the rodent arenaviruses (Guanarito, Machupo, and Junin) are zoonotically transmitted to humans. (B) Red stars represent the six rapidly evolving codon positions identified in rodent 
   <italic>TFR1</italic>, mapped to a linear schematic of the TfR1 ectodomain. The amino acid encoded by human 
   <italic>TFR1</italic> at each of these positions is indicated. Residue 109 was also identified as being under positive selection (
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001571.s003">Table S1</xref>). Although potentially of functional relevance, this residue lies outside of the structure of the TfR1 ectodomain and therefore was not analyzed further in the current study. (C) Residue positions under positive selection are indicated in red on the structure of human TfR1 (PDB 1CX8) 
   <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Lawrence1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. TfR1 is a homodimer, and the six sites of positive selection are indicated on the outer edge of each monomer. Known binding regions on TfR1 for Machupo virus GP 
   <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Abraham1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and MMTV Env 
   <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> are indicated in gray and blue, respectively, and the small region where they overlap is indicated with crosshatching. To the right is shown a rotated view of one edge of the TfR1 dimer.
