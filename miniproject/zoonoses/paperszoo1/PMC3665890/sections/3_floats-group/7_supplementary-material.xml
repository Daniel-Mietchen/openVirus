 <caption>
  <p>Phylogenetic analysis of MMTV-like beta-retroviruses. Beta-retrovirus phylogeny constructed from (A) approximately 900 bases in the region of 
   <italic>pro-pol</italic> or (B) for select viruses where full-length sequence was available, approximately 5,000 aligned bases spanning from the middle of 
   <italic>gag</italic> to the end of 
   <italic>pol</italic>. In bold are exogenous viral sequences. All others are endogenous viral sequences found integrated in the genomes of the indicated host species. In both panels, maximum likelihood trees are shown. On each node are bootstrap values, given as percentage of 1,000 replicates. Trees were rooted with FIV (feline immunodeficiency virus), a lentivirus that is not in the beta-retrovirus family. The two human ERVs included here (HERV-K50B and HERV-K33) are the highest scoring HERV matches to MMTV, based on BLAST search scores.
