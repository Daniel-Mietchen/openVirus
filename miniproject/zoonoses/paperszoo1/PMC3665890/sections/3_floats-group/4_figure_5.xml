  <title>Mutations at sites of positive selection alter MMTV entry through TfR1.</title>
  <p>(A) A partial TfR1 sequence alignment shows the three residue positions under positive selection (highlighted in yellow) located in the MMTV binding region. Asterisks indicate completely conserved residue positions, while positions under positive selection are highly variable. The viruses that have been previously shown to enter cells via each of these receptors are also summarized (although in the case of brown rat, cellular entry of MMTV via the rat TfR1 does not lead to productive infection 
   <xref rid="pbio.1001571-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, consistent with TfR1 usage being a necessary but not sufficient determinant of host range in the wild). In the remaining panels, amino acids are swapped between the species indicated at these three positions under positive selection. In one case (blue graphs), these three positions in the house mouse TfR1 were altered to encode the amino acids found in the vesper mouse TfR1. In the second case (orange graphs), these three positions in the zygodont TfR1 were altered to encode the amino acids found in the house mouse TfR1. (B and D) MDCK cells stably expressing the indicated TfR1-FLAG were infected with GFP-encoding retroviral vectors pseudotyped with the surface glycoprotein of MMTV. Virus entry was scored by measuring the percentage of GFP positive cells using flow cytometry. (C and E) Cell surface expression of TfR1 (mean fluorescent intensity) measured on live cells with a fluorescently labeled Î±-FLAG antibody. (F) Cellular entry of retroviral vectors pseudotyped with the surface glycoproteins of three different arenaviruses (Machupo, Junin, and Guanarito). In all experiments, three replicates were performed and error bars indicate one standard deviation.
