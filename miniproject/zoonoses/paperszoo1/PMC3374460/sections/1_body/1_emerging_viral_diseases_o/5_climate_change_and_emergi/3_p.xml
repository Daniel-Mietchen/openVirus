<p>The effects of climate change are beginning to be perceived, and at the same time remarkable changes in the geographic range and incidence of some infectious diseases are being observed, suggesting some kind of relationship, which is difficult to ascertain. As remarked above, climate change is not the only factor influencing infectious disease emergence, as there are other components in the global change which have also important effects on disease emergence. The following sections deal with two of the emerging arboviral diseases of animals that have changed more radically their epidemiological patterns in recent years: BT and WNF (
