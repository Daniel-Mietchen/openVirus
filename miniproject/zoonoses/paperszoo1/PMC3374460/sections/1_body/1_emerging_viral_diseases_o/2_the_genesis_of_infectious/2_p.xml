<p>The term 
 <italic>emerging infectious diseases</italic> applies to those diseases in which any of the following situations is applicable: (1) a known infection spreading to a new geographic area or population, (2) a new infection that occurs as a result of evolution or change of an existing pathogen, and (3) a previously unknown disease or pathogen that is first diagnosed (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">Lederberg, 1997</xref>) and/or to the concomitant appearance of changes in the environment that offer new opportunities for pathogens to thrive (

With regard to adaptation to new species, first it is worth reminding that every virus has its own “host range,” that is, the variety of species susceptible to be infected by a particular virus. There are, on one hand, viruses with a broad range of hosts, for example, West Nile virus (WNV), that is capable of infecting hundreds of species of birds, as well as many species of mammals, reptiles, and amphibians (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">McLean et al., 2002</xref>), and, on the other hand, viruses with a narrower range of hosts such as, for instance, classical swine fever virus, which only infects suidae (pigs and wild boar; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">OIE, 2008</xref>), or the aforementioned herpesviruses, each of which usually infect specifically one or a few related species (
