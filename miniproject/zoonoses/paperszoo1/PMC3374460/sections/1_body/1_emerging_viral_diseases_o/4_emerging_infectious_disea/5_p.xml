<p>Deforestation and biodiversity loss are often cited as causes of increased incidence of emerging infections in certain regions. An example can be found in the emergence of Junin virus in Argentina (

Changes in water use are, nonetheless, one of the factors most clearly related to the modification of eco-epidemiological patterns accompanying emerging infectious diseases. New irrigation plans, construction of dams, etc. have a direct effect on the abundance of competent vectors for transmission of various arboviruses. The new irrigation in northwestern Australia seem to be the main cause of the recent expansion of Murray Valley fever, an emerging zoonotic arbovirus in that country (

The construction of dams may have caused an important impact on the recent emergence of Rift Valley fever in East Africa, causing highly virulent outbreaks for both man and livestock, by allowing a dramatic increase in mosquito populations involved in transmission (
