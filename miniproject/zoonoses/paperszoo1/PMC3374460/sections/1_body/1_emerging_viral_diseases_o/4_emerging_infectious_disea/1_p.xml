<p>The Planet Earth is in continuous change. Environmental changes are driven by both abiotic and biotic factors. Of these, impact caused by humans has gained importance as the human population has risen, from the local level to reach a global scale (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">Meadows et al., 1972</xref>). Global change is defined as the impact of human activity on the fundamental mechanisms operating in the biosphere (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Duarte, 2006</xref>). Global change comprises not only impacts on climate, but also on the water cycle, land use, biodiversity loss, invasion of alien species into new territories, introduction of new chemicals in Nature, etc. The influence of global change on emerging infectious diseases has been the subject of different revisions (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Fayer, 2000</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B140">Weiss and McMichael, 2004</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B141">Wilcox and Gubler, 2005</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">Patz et al., 2008</xref>). As noted above, environmental changes largely determine the evolution of many emerging infectious diseases, most notably arthropod-borne ones (see reviews by 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B129">Sutherst, 2004</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Gould and Higgs, 2009</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B130">Tabachnick, 2010</xref>), Therefore, climate changes will impact necessarily on these diseases (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B116">Rosenthal, 2009</xref>). However, there are many other driving factors – not only those related to climate changes – that have or have had a powerful influence on the occurrence or change of many infectious diseases. 
 <bold>Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>
 </bold> shows some of these drivers, identified as relevant in the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases in a recent study (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B147">Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005</xref>). It is not the purpose of this article to review systematically all these factors, which have been reviewed elsewhere (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B124">Smolinski et al., 2003</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B147">Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005</xref>) but to briefly expose some examples, in order to highlight their relative importance in the emergence of infectious diseases in an overall context of globalization.
