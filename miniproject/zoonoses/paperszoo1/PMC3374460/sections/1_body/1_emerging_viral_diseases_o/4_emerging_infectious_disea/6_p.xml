<p>Healthcare is another area of human activity that, somehow paradoxically, is linked in many instances to infectious disease emergence. Iatrogenic transmission of infectious diseases, through transfusions, transplants, and other medical interventions, has undoubtedly had an effect on the expansion of certain pathogens such as hepatitis C virus (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">Parkman, 1996</xref>). Despite strict controls on each batch of vaccine for the presence of certain pathogens, there have been cases of transmission of adventitious viruses in contaminated vaccines. One of the best known cases of this kind is represented by bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), a pestivirus affecting cattle. In the manufacturing process of many vaccines, cell cultures are widely employed, and fetal calf serum is used as an additive common to cell culture media. BVDV is highly prevalent in cattle and certain variants of the virus remain unnoticed in cell cultures. In some cases, batches of fetal calf serum from BVDV-infected animals were used inadvertently, resulting in viral contamination of vaccines. Some of them (those addressed to the bovine, such as vaccine against bovine herpesvirus type 1) eventually resulted in outbreaks of viral diarrhea in vaccinated cattle, which alerted for the presence of the virus (
