<p>Regarding arboviral diseases, the impact of trade and transport on the distribution of vectors is reflected by the global expansion of the tiger mosquito (
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>), associated with trade in used tires (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B113">Reiter and Sprenger, 1987</xref>) or in 
 <italic>Dracaena</italic> plants (“lucky bamboo”; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">Madon et al., 2002</xref>). Rain causes small pools of water inside the tires stored outdoors. This constitutes an excellent breeding habitat for this mosquito, because it mimics the hollow trunks of rainforest trees that are its natural habitat. Through transport of used tires containing 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> eggs, this mosquito has reached a worldwide distribution. This mosquito is a competent vector of many pathogens, including dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and WNF (
