<p>For instance, intercontinental transport by air makes it possible to move persons and goods thousands of miles away within few hours. For a person who has just acquired an infection it is possible to arrive to destination even within the incubation period, and develop (and transmit) the disease upon arrival, resulting in an “imported disease.” This not only applies to people, but occurs similarly as a result of trade of live animals and their products, an important economic activity worldwide, which is subjected to strict regulations (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">OIE, 2011</xref>) that must be implemented in coordination with all countries, precisely to prevent the spread of infectious diseases harmful to livestock, which in this context are called “exotic” or “transboundary” diseases. However, these rules have been insufficient to halt the spread of many infectious animal diseases of tremendous economic impact, partly because control and surveillance systems do not always work effectively. As an example of what an effective control can achieve, it is worth to mention what constituted the first detection in Europe of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 from Asia, which occurred in 2004 at a border checkpoint in the airport of Brussels (Belgium). Customs officers detected in the luggage of a traveler from Thailand two mountain hawk eagles (

This case also reminds that, in addition to the above, illegal trafficking of animals, including exotic species, must also be considered as a relevant factor involved in importation of transboundary diseases. A good example was given in 2003 by the occurrence of outbreaks of monkeypox in humans in the U.S., originated as a result of illegal import of infected exotic rodents from Ghana (
