<p>In the case of vector-borne diseases, in addition to pathogen and host, infectious cycle requires a third player: the vector. This fact results in a more complex eco-epidemiology. Habitats of arthropod vectors depend on a number of environmental conditions, including range of temperature, humidity, water availability, etc. Arboviruses (i.e., viruses transmitted by arthropod vectors), are distributed necessarily in areas where populations of competent vectors (i.e., vectors which are able to spread the disease to new hosts) are abundant enough. Each arthropod vector species occupies a particular ecological niche within specific environmental conditions, so that its distribution can be greatly affected by changes in temperature, rainfall, humidity, plant coverage, etc. (
