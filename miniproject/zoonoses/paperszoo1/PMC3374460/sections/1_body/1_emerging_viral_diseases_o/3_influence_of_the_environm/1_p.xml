<p>The environment of viruses is constituted essentially by the cells they infect. Viruses must parasitize cells to ensure their propagation. Outside cells, viruses lack of activity, although to allow transmission to another individual they need to survive outside the cell. The way a virus survives in the environment is the result of an adaptation that largely determines how it is transmitted. Viruses can be transmitted through direct contact between individuals, or through other ways such as, for instance air, water, feces, body fluids, food, or fomites. In some cases, transmission needs the participation of other living organisms, so-called vectors, in which the virus is equally propagated. These vectors are often blood-sucking insects that inoculate the infectious pathogen through their bites, thus spreading the infection in a population. A virus may preferably use a single transmission route, but viruses using more than one way of transmission are frequent.</p>
