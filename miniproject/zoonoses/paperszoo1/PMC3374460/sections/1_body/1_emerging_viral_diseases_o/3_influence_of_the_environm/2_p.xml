<p>The progress of a viral infection in a population is a multifactorial process, depending on a range of both biotic and abiotic factors. These factors and their influence on the development and transmission of the infection at the population level constitute the eco-epidemiology of an infectious disease. There is a strong relationship between the route of transmission and the eco-epidemiology of a given infectious disease. For example, the spread of infections that are transmitted by direct contact largely depends on the population density, which determines the distance between infected and susceptible individuals. For airborne infections, temperature, humidity, and wind can have a significant influence on the progress of the epidemic. Waterborne and foodborne viruses are usually highly resistant to adverse environmental conditions. A particular case of this type of transmission is represented by the fecal–oral route (often water, food, or objects are contaminated by fecal waste). Viruses that are transmitted through this route have a characteristic resistance to low pH, allowing them to pass through the animal’s digestive tract, overcoming the natural barrier that represents the acid secretion of gastric parietal cells. Often, these viruses produce diarrhea, thus being shed in large amounts and returning to the environment, where they can remain infectious for a variable period (up to several months in some instances), depending mainly on environmental temperature (the colder the longer), but also on the presence of salts, organic matter, moisture, solar radiation, etc., until they reach another host and begin the infectious cycle again (
