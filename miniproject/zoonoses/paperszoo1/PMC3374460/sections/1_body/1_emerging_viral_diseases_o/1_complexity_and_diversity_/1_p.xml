<p>To illustrate the enormous complexity of animal viruses, consider the following example: take any animal species, e.g., bovine. There are five known species of herpesviruses that could infect bovines specifically. Similarly, there are nine different known equine herpesviruses, eight human herpesviruses, and so on and so forth (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">Pellet and Roizman, 2007</xref>). Bearing in mind that there are approximately 5,400 different species of mammals (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B144">Wilson and Reeder, 2005</xref>) and that most of them have yielded at least one, most frequently several distinct herpesviruses on examination, the number of existing mammalian herpesvirus species would be huge, probably in the range of thousands. But there are also herpesviruses specific for birds, for reptiles, for amphibians, etc., so the above number would be increased consequently with the number of other vertebrate species (for the moment viruses of invertebrates, a world largely to be discovered, will not be considered). Likewise, letâ€™s bear in mind that there are other taxonomic families of viruses besides the 
 <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> family, like the 
 <italic>Poxviridae</italic> (e.g., smallpox and myxomatosis), 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> (e.g., yellow fever and dengue), 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> (e.g., influenza), 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> (e.g., foot-and-mouth disease, polio, and hepatitis A), 
 <italic>Reoviridae</italic> (e.g., BT and African horse sickness), etc., and for each family of viruses one can reason about in the same way. In light of this example, a first conclusion is that we only know a fraction of the viral pathogens that actually exist. To these, we must add the non-pathogenic viruses that circulate silently, which obviously are less known, and which probably exist in far greater numbers and variety than their pathogenic counterparts. The complexity of viruses of plants, bacteria, fungi, and parasites is not lower than that of animal viruses. This gives a rough idea of the real complexity of the virus world in which only a small part is known.
