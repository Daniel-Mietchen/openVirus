<p>Certain arboviral animal diseases such as BT and WNF have undergone significant changes in their known epidemiology, gaining unprecedented importance in the past 15 years. It is plausible that this increase has been influenced by climate changes, although their importance relative to other environmental factors (changes in agriculture, land uses, etc.) is difficult to estimate. Predictive models on climate in the coming years foresee an intensification of the circumstances favoring the activity of these arboviral pathogens. BT and WNF constitute paradigms of emerging infectious diseases whose fate is linked to global changes.</p>
