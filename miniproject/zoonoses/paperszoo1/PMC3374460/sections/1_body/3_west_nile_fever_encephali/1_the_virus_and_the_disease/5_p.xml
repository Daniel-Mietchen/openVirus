<p>In horses (reviewed in 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Castillo-Olivares and Wood, 2004</xref>) neurological disease is manifested by approximately 10% of infections, and is mainly characterized by muscle weakness, ataxia, paresis, and paralysis of the limbs, as a result of nerve damage in the spinal cord. They may also suffer from fever and anorexia, tremors and muscle stiffness, facial nerve palsy, paresis of the tongue, and dysphagia, as a result of affection of the cranial nerves. A proportion of horses infected with WNV die spontaneously or is slaughtered to avoid excessive suffering. The mortality rate can vary between outbreaks. For example, in the outbreak in 2000 in the Camargue (France), 76 horses were affected, of which 21 died (

Rodents such as laboratory mice and hamsters are highly susceptible, so they can be used as experimental model of WNV encephalitis. Lemurs and certain types of squirrels appear to be the only mammals capable of maintaining the virus in local circulation (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">Root et al., 2006</xref>). WNV can also infect other mammals, including sheep, in which it causes abortions, but rarely encephalitis (

 <italic>Rana ridibunda</italic>), which in turn are bitten by mosquitoes, so that the existence of an enzootic cycle in these amphibians is postulated, at least for some variants of the virus (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Kostiukov et al., 1986</xref>). Outbreaks of severe WNF with high mortality have been reported in captive alligators and crocodiles, presumably transmitted through feeding of contaminated meat (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">Miller et al., 2003</xref>). It has been shown experimentally that WNV can infect asymptomatically pigs (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B132">Teehee et al., 2005</xref>) and dogs (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Blackburn et al., 1989</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Austgen et al., 2004</xref>). However, guinea pigs, rabbits, and adult rats are resistant to infection with WNV (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">McLean et al., 2002</xref>). Among non-human primates, rhesus and bonnet monkeys (but not 
 <italic>Cynomolgus</italic> macaques and chimpanzees), inoculated with WNV develop fever, ataxia, prostration with occasional encephalitis and tremor in the limbs, paresis or paralysis. The infection can be fatal in these animals.
