<p>West Nile fever/encephalitis is a disease transmitted mainly by mosquitoes, while wild birds are its natural reservoir. WNV is capable of infecting a wide range of bird species. Nevertheless, birds were considered less susceptible to the disease until the recent epidemic of WNV in North America, affecting many species of birds lethally, made to re-examine this concept (

Other domestic birds like chickens and pigeons, are susceptible to infection but do not get sick, and are often used as sentinels for disease surveillance. In addition to birds, WNV can also affect a wide range of vertebrates species, including amphibians, reptiles, and mammals, and it is particularly pathogenic in humans and horses, which act epidemiologically as “dead end hosts,” that is, they are susceptible to infection but do not transmit the virus (
