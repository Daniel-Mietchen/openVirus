<p>The virus is propagated in the reservoir hosts, resulting in a viremic phase that usually lasts no more than 5â€“7 days (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Komar et al., 2003</xref>). The duration and level of viremia depends on the species infected (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Komar et al., 2003</xref>). The detection of the virus or its genetic material in serum or cerebrospinal fluid in a laboratory test is a proof of diagnostic value (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">De Filette et al., 2012</xref>). The virus is evidenced by virological (virus isolation) or molecular (RT-PCR-conventional and real-time, NASBA) techniques. In epidemiological surveillance it is useful to detect the presence of WNV in mosquitoes, for which they are homogenized and analyzed using the same methods mentioned above (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B134">Trevejo and Eidson, 2008</xref>). Specific antibodies against the virus are detectable in blood few days after infection (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Komar et al., 2003</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">De Filette et al., 2012</xref>). Antibody detection is performed by serological tests (enzyme immunoassay or ELISA, hemagglutination inhibition or HIT) which can be confirmed by more specific serological techniques (virus-neutralization test; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B127">Sotelo et al., 2011c</xref>). Serological diagnosis of acute infection should be done by detection of IgM antibodies in serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid using an immunocapture ELISA together with the detection of an increase in antibody titer in paired sera taken one in the acute phase and the other, at least 2 weeks later (
