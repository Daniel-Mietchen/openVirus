<p>As far as we know, there are no serotypes of WNV, but two main genetic variants or lineages can be distinguished, namely lineages 1 and 2. While the former is widely distributed in Europe, Africa, America, Asia, and Oceania, the second is found mostly restricted to Africa and Madagascar, although it has recently been introduced in Central and Eastern Europe (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108">Platonov et al., 2008</xref>) and has further extended to southern Europe (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Bagnarelli et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">Papa et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, other viral variants closely related phylogenetically to WNV have been described, which are different from lineages 1 and 2, and have been proposed as additional WNV lineages. One of them, known as “Rabensburg virus,” isolated form mosquitoes in the Czech Republic in 1997, shows low pathogenicity in mice (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Bondre et al., 2007</xref>), Russia (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Lvov et al., 2004</xref>) Malaysia (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B118">Scherret et al., 2001</xref>), and Spain (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B136">Vazquez et al., 2010</xref>). All these viruses have been proposed to represent different genetic lineages of WNV. Except for the Indian variant, which has been involved in outbreaks of encephalitis in humans, the rest are of unknown relevance for animal and human health.
