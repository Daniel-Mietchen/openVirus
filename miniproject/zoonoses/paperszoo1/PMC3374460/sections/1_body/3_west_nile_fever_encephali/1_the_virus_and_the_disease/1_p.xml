<p>West Nile virus is the etiological agent of an emerging zoonotic disease whose impact on animal and public health is considerable, being the most widespread arbovirus in the world today (reviewed in

 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>. Virions are spherical in shape, about 50 nm in diameter, and consist of a lipid bilayer that surrounds a nucleocapsid that in turn encloses the genome, a unique single-stranded RNA molecule, which encodes a polyprotein that is processed to give the 10 viral proteins. Of them, three (C, E, and M) form part of the structure of the virion, and the rest (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, and NS5) are so-called “non-structural” and play important roles in the intracellular processes of replication, morphogenesis, and virus assembly. Inserted into the lipid bilayer are two proteins, E (from “envelope”) and M (“matrix”), which participate in important biological properties of the virus, such as its host range, tissue tropism, replication, assembly, and stimulation of cellular and humoral immune responses. E protein contains the major antigenic determinants of the virus.
