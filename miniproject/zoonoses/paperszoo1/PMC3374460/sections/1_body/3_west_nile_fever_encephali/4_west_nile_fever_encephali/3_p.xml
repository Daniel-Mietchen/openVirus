<p>Significantly, all weather conditions favoring the occurrence of WNF outbreaks, mentioned above, such as extremely hot summers, mild winters, droughts, floods, hurricanes, etc., tend to increase in frequency and intensity according to predictions on climate changes described in Section “Climate Change and Emerging Infectious Diseases” and listed in 
 <bold>Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>
 </bold>. However, current WNV emergence cannot be easily explained by a single factor such as climate change, but, more likely, a number of factors, both abiotic and biotic, might contribute. Among these factors, the emergence of new virus phenotypes, more virulent and/or more transmissible and/or more adapted to their hosts and/or vectors, could play an important role (

Also, other factors related to globalization mentioned above, such as increase of transport, animal movements, etc., are likely to be involved in the observed geographical expansion of WNV. Taking these factors into account, and the observed climate trends mentioned above, WNF will only be expected to move forward in the twenty-first century.
