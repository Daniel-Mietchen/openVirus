<p>West Nile virus is maintained in nature in an enzootic (“rural” or “sylvatic”) cycle between its natural reservoirs, wild birds, and ornithophilic mosquitoes acting as vectors. WNV is a generalist pathogen, as exemplified by the fact that in North America the virus has been found infecting 284 different species of birds and 59 species of mosquitoes, although of these not more than 10 have a relevant role as vectors (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Kramer et al., 2008</xref>). Primary enzootic vectors are most often mosquitoes belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Culex</italic>, but the virus can be transmitted by mosquitoes of other genera (e.g., 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> sp.) Transovarial transmission of the virus has been shown to occur in at least some 
 <italic>Culex</italic> species (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">Mishra and Mourya , 2001</xref>), and this may provide an overwintering mechanism in very cold climates. However, it is not clear whether transovarial transmission takes place as effectively as to allow overwintering. The virus has been repeatedly isolated from ticks, and transmission through tick bites has been shown experimentally (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Hutcheson et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Formosinho and Santos-Silva, 2006</xref>). This has led to the postulation of a role for ticks in overwintering, though this issue needs further studies to be ascertained. WNV can also be transmitted in the absence of vector, using different routes. Firstly, there is experimental evidence of direct transmission in poultry (geese; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Banet-Noach et al., 2003</xref>). Secondly, carrion birds found infected during periods of absence of vector suggests oral transmission, likely through feeding on contaminated carrion (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Garmendia et al., 2000</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Dawson et al., 2007</xref>). In humans, WNV transmission routes such as intrauterine, lactogenic, and iatrogenic (through transfusions and transplants), are well documented (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Hayes et al., 2005b</xref>). Occupational exposure of laboratory workers handling contaminated samples has also led to some cases of disease, mostly through cuts or punctures with contaminated material (
