<p>Birds are the natural reservoirs of WNV. Once infected, they are able to replicate the virus in sufficient quantity to enable its transmission to a blood-sucking mosquito. This is not the case of mammals, in general poorly effective as hosts for the virus (

In some instances a spillover from this cycle occurs which enables the establishment of a urban cycle, producing outbreaks, sometimes of epidemic character, especially in equines and humans, but also affecting susceptible birds.
