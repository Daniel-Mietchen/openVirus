<p>Infectious disease can be viewed as a play involving at least two characters: the pathogen and the host. While both roles can be represented by a great variety of performers, pathogens exhibit by far the highest variety and complexity. This review is about viral infections in animals. It aims first to give an idea of the enormous complexity and diversity of the existing infectious agents, emphasizing their extraordinary capacity for change and adaptation, which eventually leads to the emergence of new infectious diseases. Secondly, it focuses on the influence of the environment in this process, and on how environmental (including climate) changes occurring in recent times, have precise effects on the emergence and evolution of infectious diseases, some of which will be illustrated with specific examples. Finally, it describes the recent and dramatic expansion of two of the most important emerging animal viral diseases at present, bluetongue (BT) and West Nile fever/encephalitis (WNF), dealing with their relationship to climate and other environmental changes, particularly those linked to human activities, collectively known as “global change,” and that can be at least in part seen a consequence of the “globalization” phenomenon.</p>
