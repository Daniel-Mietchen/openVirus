<p>Viremia is transient, starting at 3–5 days after infection in sheep somewhat later in other ruminants, peaking at about 7–10 days, declining slowly thereafter (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Jimenez-Clavero et al., 2006</xref>). The host’s immune system responds to infection by generating serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies, which are widely recognized as key factors in the long-term protective response against infection (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B120">Schwartz-Cornil et al., 2008</xref>). Seroconversion occurs between 1 and 2 weeks after infection. Serogroup-specific antibodies are directed primarily to the VP7 protein of the virus capsid, which are commonly detected by enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) employing recombinant VP7 antigen (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">Mecham and Wilson, 2004</xref>), while serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies (which are detected by specific neutralization tests) recognize epitopes in the VP2 capsid protein (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">DeMaula et al., 1993</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107">Pierce et al., 1995</xref>). The presence of specific antibodies in serum samples is another common diagnostic test, which indicates that infection has occurred, or that the animal has been vaccinated. There are live attenuated and inactivated vaccines, which are specific for each serotype.
