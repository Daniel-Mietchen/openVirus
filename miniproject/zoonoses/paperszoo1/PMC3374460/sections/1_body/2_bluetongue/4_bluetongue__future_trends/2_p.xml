<p>What is the explanation for all these changes? Undoubtedly, the rising temperature in Europe in recent years (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">EEA, 2012</xref>) is a factor having a major influence in this situation (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110">Purse et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B142">Wilson and Mellor, 2008</xref>). Particularly, unusually mild winters that occurred in 2006–2007 and 2007–2008 in the affected areas have probably favored the habitat of certain 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species that could act as vectors in these regions, promoting their geographical expansion. Some studies indicate that the distribution of 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic>, the principal vector of BTV in southern Europe, has undergone a geographic expansion, reaching areas where it had never been observed, for example the North of Spain (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Goldarazena et al., 2008</xref>), although some authors have not observed expansions of this vector in Italy in recent years (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Conte et al., 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, in northern and central Europe, competent vector species must be different, because 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> is not present in these areas (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B117">Saegerman et al., 2008</xref>). Other likely competent vectors for BT which are present in Europe are 
 <italic>C. obsoletus</italic>, 
 <italic>C. pulicaris</italic>, 
 <italic>C. scoticus</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. dewulfii</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B117">Saegerman et al., 2008</xref>). For some of these vector species, their vectorial capacity for BT transmission was considered secondary or even irrelevant, as compared to 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic>. However, changes in circulating viruses involving adaptations to some of these vectors may have improved this capability. On the other hand, it is a well-known fact that the temperature can affect vector competence, effectively increasing it above a certain temperature threshold (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B143">Wilson and Mellor, 2009</xref>).
