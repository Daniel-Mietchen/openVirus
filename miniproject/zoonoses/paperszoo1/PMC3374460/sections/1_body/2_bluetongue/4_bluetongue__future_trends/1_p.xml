<p>In the past 15 years very significant qualitative changes have occurred with regard to the epidemiology of BT, which has reached unprecedented severity in Europe (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B143">2009</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B149">Zientara et al., 2009</xref>). Some important trends observed in this period are: (1) a major increase in the frequency of BTV incursion events in Europe, (2) a geographic expansion of the disease, reaching latitudes close to parallel 55°N, i.e., 15° beyond the classic northern distribution limit for BT in Europe, (3) an ability to overwinter in locations
