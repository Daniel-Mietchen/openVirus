<p>But recent occurrence of BT in Europe has not been limited to the, otherwise outstanding, BTV8 epizootic. Other serotypes have reached the shores of the southern European countries and caused severe harm to livestock in these years (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B117">Saegerman et al., 2008</xref>). Of particular relevance were the incursions of BTV serotype 4 in Spain, Italy, and the western Mediterranean islands in 2003â€“2004, and the entry of a particularly highly pathogenic strain of BTV serotype 1 first in Sardinia (Italy) in 2006, and then in Spain in 2007, which extended rapidly to Portugal and France, causing also many thousands of outbreaks in these countries. The same strategy adopted to fight against the BTV8 epizootic, based on vaccination campaigns, was used simultaneously against BTV1 and BTV4, with the same success at reducing disease incidence to almost negligible (
