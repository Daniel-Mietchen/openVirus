<p>Survival and transmission of BT in an area requires the presence of 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> vectors. To be transmitted, BTV must infect a competent 
 <italic>Culicoides </italic>vector. In this process the vector acquires the infection by feeding on blood from a viremic host, then the virus multiplies and disseminates throughout the vector body, reaching the salivary glands, ready to be inoculated in the next host after biting on a further blood feed. There is no transovarial transmission of the virus. There are approximately 1,500 known species of 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> midges, of which about 50 have been shown to be competent for BTV transmission (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B143">Wilson and Mellor, 2009</xref>). In different endemic areas, BTV is transmitted through one or a few distinct local 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species. For example, in North America this species is 
 <italic>Culicoides sonorensis</italic>, while in southern Europe and Africa 
 <italic>Culicoides imicola</italic> is the dominant vector. The distribution and abundance of 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species involved in BTV transmission matches with the distribution of the disease in endemic areas (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">Mellor and Wittmann, 2002</xref>). It also depicts the maps of areas at risk for its introduction. Similarly, seasonality strongly influences vector populations throughout the year, and this determines the periods of occurrence of disease cases (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">Mellor and Wittmann, 2002</xref>). For instance, in temperate zones of the northern Hemisphere most cases of disease occur between August and November, coinciding with the period of greatest abundance of vectors. Among the key factors linking weather to BTV epidemiology, temperature has a crucial influence on vector survival, which, as noted above, directly affects disease occurrence, transmission, and spread. For example, the mean survival time of a 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> midge depends on the temperature, i.e., survive longer at lower temperatures (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B138">Veronesi et al., 2009</xref>). By contrast, higher temperatures promote breeding and feeding of the vectors, which increases virogenesis and transmission of BTV (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B143">Wilson and Mellor, 2009</xref>). The optimal range of temperature lies between 13 and 35째C. However, excessively high (above 40째C) or low (&lt;0째C) temperatures are lethal in a short period of time. Between 0 and 13째C 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> midges remain in a state of dormancy that allows them to survive until more favorable temperatures allow resuming their activity. Relative humidity is also a key factor in 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> life cycle (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B145">Wittmann et al., 2002</xref>). The mentioned temperature ranges are valid only above a minimum relative humidity. Winter survival (overwintering) is crucial for the maintenance and consolidation of the presence of BTV in a geographic area. Midge survival is favored by mild, frost-free, winters. Wind is another important factor that links weather to BTV eco-epidemiology. Wind blows can drag swarms of 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> midges, and bring them hundreds of kilometers away. This mechanism has been widely recognized as an important way 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> (and BTV, if present in the vectors) spread, bridging distances up to 700 km under favorable conditions (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Carpenter et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">MacLachlan and Guthrie, 2010</xref>). This form of dispersal is the most likely way BTV has reached the shores of southern Europe from Africa in many occasions in the last years (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B143">Wilson and Mellor, 2009</xref>).
