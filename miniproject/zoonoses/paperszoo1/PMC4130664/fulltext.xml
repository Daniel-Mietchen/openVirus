Despite their scientific and public health significance, however, there remains much to be understood about the ecology and evolution of AIVs in wild birds, where major pools of genetic diversity are generated and maintained. Here, we present comparative phylodynamic analyses of human and AIVs in North America, demonstrating (i) significantly higher standing genetic diversity and (ii) phylogenetic trees with a weaker signature of immune escape in AIVs than in human viruses. To explain these differences, we performed statistical analyses to quantify the relative contribution of several potential explanations. We found that HA genetic diversity in avian viruses is determined by a combination of factors, predominantly subtype-specific differences in host immune selective pressure and the ecology of transmission (in particular, the durability of subtypes in aquatic environments). Extending this analysis using a computational model demonstrated that virus durability may lead to long-term, indirect chains of transmission that, when coupled with a short host lifespan, can generate and maintain the observed high levels of genetic diversity. Further evidence in support of this novel finding was found by demonstrating an association between subtype-specific environmental durability and predicted phylogenetic signatures: genetic diversity, variation in phylogenetic tree branch lengths, and tree height. The conclusion that environmental transmission plays an important role in the evolutionary biology of avian influenza viruses&#x02014;a manifestation of the &#x0201c;storage effect&#x0201d;&#x02014;highlights the potentially unpredictable impact of wildlife reservoirs for future human pandemics and the need for improved understanding of the natural ecology of these viruses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Human populations have experienced several pandemics involving new subtypes of influenza virus over the past century. All of these pandemic strains contained gene segments that originated in wild birds, a host pool that supports a very large and genetically diverse array of influenza viruses. However, once an avian strain establishes itself within the human population, the genetic diversity of the resulting human subtypes is typically quite low compared to that of their avian counterparts. Here we compare the evolutionary dynamics of human and avian influenza viruses in North America and test different hypotheses that might explain these two contrasting evolutionary patterns. Our analysis shows that a combination of characteristics of the host (especially demography) and virus (such as durability in water and mutability) explains the diversity observed. Using a theoretical model, we show that the combination of the short lifespan of wild birds, and greater durability of viruses in aquatic environments, is key to maintaining the high levels of influenza diversity observed in wild birds.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (5U19Cl000401), the James S.

In contrast, influenza A viruses in avian populations exhibit a rich array of subtypes, with fully 13 of the known 18 HA subtypes isolated from North American birds over this time span (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). This pattern of higher subtype diversity through time is further enriched by higher genetic diversity within subtypes, for instance in H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1G</xref>) and H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1H</xref>). Indeed, AIVs typically exhibit a scaled effective population size (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pbio.1001931.e002.jpg"/></inline-formula>, which measures the phylogenetic diversity of the virus population <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Bedford1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>) that is an order of magnitude greater than for their human counterparts: We estimated <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pbio.1001931.e003.jpg"/></inline-formula> to be 7.0 y and 1.5 y, respectively, for H1 and H3 in humans and 38.7 y and 77.5 y in birds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1E and 1F</xref>; as we show below, other avian subtypes also exhibit higher diversity than commonly observed in H1 and H3 human subtypes). Thus, although phylogenetic trees of H1 and H3 AIVs show some evidence of selection (immune escape) <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Dugan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, they also document broad viral coexistence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1K and 1L</xref>).</p><p>The mechanistic origins of these differences remain unclear.

In this study, we address these hypotheses through a combination of statistical analysis of empirical covariates and epidemiological modeling to identify the most parsimonious explanation for the observed differences of HA genetic diversity between human and AIVs.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Empirical Covariates of HA Diversity</title><p>We analyzed available AIV sequence data from GenBank for 11 HA subtypes from 1976&#x02013;2013 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> as well as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s022">Text S1</xref>, section S2) and developed a set of covariates reflecting specific predictions of the competing hypotheses. We sought to place these covariates on an equal footing and simultaneously to assess the contribution of each to HA diversity using a statistical model. Ordinary linear regression with a large number of covariates (of the same order as the number of observations) results in variance inflation, low statistical power, and issues of statistical identifiability <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Tibshirani1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. We therefore adopted a regularized regression method, known as elastic-net regression <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Friedman1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, that solves this problem using a shrinkage estimator to trade off a small amount of bias for substantial reductions in the variance of estimated parameters. As a side effect of this estimation scheme, the resulting coefficients may be interpreted as evidence for or against the inclusion of a covariate (if the coefficient shrinks either to nonzero or zero, respectively).

Indeed, the strongest covariates were immune selective pressure (Hypothesis 1, quantified via the amino acid substitution rate) and the environmental durability of virions (Hypothesis 6, inferred by experimental incubation data on viral persistence), whose respective impacts were at least twice as big as the effects of nucleotide mutation rate (Hypothesis 4, quantified by multiplication of nucleotide substitution rate by the substitution rate at third position sites), geographic structure (Hypothesis 3, inferred by <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> that measures population differentiation through space), and host diversity (Hypothesis 2, characterized by Shannon Index of host species sampled).</p><table-wrap id="pbio-1001931-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1001931.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Elastic-net multiple regression model testing the association between HA sequence diversity and alternative hypothesized mechanisms.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pbio-1001931-t001-1" xlink:href="pbio.1001931.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hypothesis</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Test Variable</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Coefficient</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Host immunity</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Amino acid substitution rate</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0.995</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Host diversity</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Host Shannon Index</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.111</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Geographic structure</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fixation index, (<italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic>)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0.285</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mutation rate</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nucleotide mutation rate</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.276</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Transmission ecology</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Environmental durability</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.687</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><label/><p>The associations tested (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s022">Text S1</xref>, section S4 for additional analyses) are between subtype-specific average <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pbio.1001931.e004.jpg"/></inline-formula> and (I) strength of selection (amino acid subsitution rate), (II) Shannon Index of bird species identified in genetic sequences, (III) geographic population structure (<italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic>), (IV) nucleotide mutation rate, and (VI) environmental durability (Rt).

For instance, our finding concerning the modest contribution of host species diversity to HA genetic variation had previously been observed by Chen and Holmes <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and probably arises from frequent interspecies transmission. Similary, the impact of geographic structuring on gene flow among North American AIVs has been elegantly demonstrated elsewhere <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001931-Bahl1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The important novel result to emerge from our statistical analyses is the substantial contribution of virus durability to HA genetic diversity. This is a component of virus biology not previously considered in the study of AIV evolution. Thus, to better dissect how the durability of AIVs in the environment affects transmission dynamics and subsequently HA diversity and simultaneously to explore Hypothesis 5 (host demography), we constructed a mechanistic phylodynamic model.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Computational Model of Influenza Evolution</title><p>Our model is stochastic, seasonally forced, and agent-based <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Roche1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and incorporates a one-dimensional antigenic space, where nonneutral mutations change antigenic phenotype from neighbor to neighbor, thus decreasing cross-immunity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s022">Text S1</xref>, section S3) <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Gog1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Crucially, our model allows the tracking of virus antigenic diversity and hence reconstruction of within-subtype digital phylogenies from model output (algorithm detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s022">Text S1</xref>, section S3.3, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s007">Figures S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s008">S8</xref>), as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g002">Figure 2</xref>. Virus diversity is quantified in our model by the number of different antigenic strains at a given time and provides an analog to the diversity inferred by the scaled effective population size on genetic data. This model also enables assessing the role played by host demography (Hypothesis 5) on the maintenance of virus diversity. If these factors are to explain the observed differences between human and avian strains described above, then we expect to observe rapid population turnover and an absence of genetic diversity in a host population parameterized for humans <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Ferguson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001931-Koelle1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001931-Bedford2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, whereas a model parameterized for birds should show broad coexistence of viral strains (parameters are detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s019">Table S3</xref>). Because the modeling framework we adopt may give rise to either restricted or expansive antigenic diversity depending on epidemiology <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Gog1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, the inferences one draws are not a result of prejudicial selection of model parameters or functional forms.</p><fig id="pbio-1001931-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1001931.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Illustration of our individual-based transmission model.</title><p>The model takes into account seasonality in host population size (for breeding and migration) and virus durability (driven by fluctuations in temperature), direct (fecal-oral) transmission, and the deposition of virus in the environment, leading to indirect transmission chains with infection probability determined by virus EID<sub>50</sub>.

Furthermore, recent research points to direct bird-to-bird transmission via the respiratory route <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Kleijn1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Evidence is accumulating, however, to suggest that an additional transmission route is possible via long-lived viruses in environmental reservoirs <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Hinshaw1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1001931-Roche2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, effectively giving rise to a second (longer) time scale over which transmission can occur. This hypothesis is based in part on the routine isolation of AIVs from mud samples, soil swabs <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Hinshaw1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, unconcentrated lake water <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Vong1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, feathers <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Delogu1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, and the observation of prolonged virus durability in water <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Webster1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001931-Stallknecht1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1001931-Terregino1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and other media <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Nazir1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Virus durability is commonly quantified by Rt, which is the time required to reduce infectivity by 90%, and may vary from a couple of days to several months <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Stallknecht1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.

Consequently, Hypothesis 6 suggests that environmental transmission could act on a distinctly longer time scale than direct fecal-oral transmission, thereby significantly impacting virus diversity and phylogenetic structure through frequent re-seeding of the avian virus gene pool, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s001">Figure S1</xref>.</p><p>To quantify the influence of Hypothesis 5 (host demography) on influenza virus diversity, we first parameterized our model to mimic the within-subtype dynamics of human influenza, assuming only direct transmission. Seeding simulations with only a few antigenic variants, we observed the continual replacement of a dominant strain by new antigenic variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), driven by selective pressure to escape herd immunity in the host population, as empirically observed <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Ferguson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001931-Koelle1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001931-Bedford2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.

Model output remained qualitatively unaffected, demonstrating continuous antigenic evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), with low-standing antigenic diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3E</xref>; five strains coexist on average) and a slender trunk in the phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3H</xref>). Thus, in this model, host demographic properties alone do not strongly influence levels of genetic variation. In contrast, we found that the inclusion of environmental transmission dramatically increased standing antigenic diversity of AIVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3C and 3F</xref>; 60 strains coexist on average), resulting in both immune selection and virus diversification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3I</xref>). The phylogenetic tree contains lineages that would have gone extinct in the absence of environmental transmission, demonstrating the punctuation of antigenic evolution with reintroduction of past dominant variants, to which there is little immunity in the population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p>Next, we carried out sensitivity analyses spanning the parameter space of the most common influenza systems, including swine and equine influenza (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We found that the long natural lifespan (and low fecundity) of free living mammalian hosts sustain the selective pressure exerted by herd immunity in the population on dominant strains. Indeed, in the presence of long lifespan and associated long-lived immunity, even substantial levels of environmental transmission do not dramatically increase antigenic diversity. Reduced host lifespan, however, leads to a faster turnover of the population, reducing the selective impacts of herd immunity. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g004">Figure 4</xref>, it is the combination of high lifetime fecundity and environmental transmission that produces dramatic increases in genetic diversity and the coexistence of distantly related viral lineages.

For comparison, we performed a parallel analysis of the most prevalent subtype observed in human (H3), equine (H3), and swine (H1) influenza viruses. Recalling that HA durability correlates with HA genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001931-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s010">Figure S10</xref>), we further observed that scaled effective population size (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pbio.1001931.e005.jpg"/></inline-formula>) increases with HA durability either estimated at a fixed temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) or averaged over a season (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s016">Figure S16</xref> and Table S15).

In particular, the analyses reveal that our hypotheses act in concert to shape the phylodynamics of AIVs. These results are consistent with prior studies that have examined each mechanism in isolation. For instance, it has been shown that strong spatial structuring is an important factor in the phylogeography of these viruses <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001931-Bahl1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Similarly, the modest association between genetic diversity and host species number is known <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Although it is widely hypothesized that increasing antigenic evolution decreases genetic diversity across human subtypes <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Bedford3" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> and between human and swine H3 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-DeJong1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, our research has also demonstrated that increasing avian immune selective pressure acts to reduce influenza virus diversity.</p><p>Our most surprising empirical finding is that HA genetic diversity increases with virus durability, as measured in experimental assays, across AIV subtypes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001931-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The corresponding theoretical result is that, in short-lived hosts, increasing the frequency of environmental transmission results in greater equilibrium levels of viral genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g004">4</xref>). Thus, both empirical and theoretical results suggest that environmental transmission acts in wild bird populations to increase avian influenza genetic diversity. As emphasized throughout, our results do not exclude a role for additional mechanisms (e.g., Hypotheses 1&#x02013;3), but establish statistically that the size of the effects of subtype-specific amino acid substitution rates and environmental durability are largest.</p><p>Two limitations of this study warrant further investigation. First, a detailed understanding of cross-immunity remains an important empirical limitation to any study of avian influenza evolution. Establishing the duration and extent of protective immunity against heterotypic viruses, particularly, remains a priority. At present, comparative data to test this idea directly are lacking, although work showing the absence of immunity conferred by DNA subtype-specific vaccines to challenge strains from other subtypes <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> suggests that the effect of cross-immunity will be limited. Second, our model assumed a one-dimensional strain space for the practical purpose of numerical tractability <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Gog1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Future work should investigate the effects of incorporating other structures of cross-immunity <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Ferguson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001931-Koelle1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> into epidemiological models of across-species influenza. Similarly, our findings show the relative importance of environmental persistence on phylodynamics of AIVs. Crucially, viral persistence may also occur in nonaquatic environments, including lake sediment, feathers, and feces <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Hinshaw1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001931-Delogu1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001931-Nazir1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>Elsewhere, it has been shown that the environmental reservoir can be a crucial source for sparking off annual outbreaks <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Rohani1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and may have an impact on interannual AIV durability <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Breban2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. As we have demonstrated here, another consequence of this feature of AIV transmission is broad strain coexistence that is similar to an ecological phenomenon called the &#x0201c;storage effect&#x0201d; <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Chesson1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001931-KelIy1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. This effect has been identified for soil bacteria, where dormancy is thought to generate a high level of microbial diversity <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Lennon1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Dramatically, one of the main predictions of the storage effect theory is that large fluctuations in recruitment rates are expected of low-density species <xref rid="pbio.1001931-KelIy1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Indeed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, at any given time, the dominant strain may have first appeared far in the past, and as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s009">Figure S9</xref>, this pattern of dominance is not predictable. Within an epidemiological context, this suggests that unpredictable outbreaks of rare subtypes may occur due to the absence of herd immunity.</p><p>Finally, our findings have practical implications for the management of influenza in wild birds. Particularly, our results indicate that&#x02014;in addition to movement restrictions <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Lam1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> and measures aimed at population size <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Capua1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>&#x02014;considering an environmental dimension to AIV control may be advisable <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Vong1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Particularly, contaminated environments may remain infectious for an extended period following the cessation of transmission among hosts.

The second postinoculation time point varied with each trial and was determined based on prior estimates of the time required for the titer of the virus in the water sample to be reduced by at least 1 log10 TCID50/ml <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Stallknecht1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001931-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Duplicate 0.5 ml samples of AIV-inoculated water were diluted 1&#x02236;1 by addition of 0.5 ml of 2&#x000d7; serum-free MEM. Ten-fold dilutions (10<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>) were then made in 1&#x000d7; MEM supplemented with antibiotics. These titers were used to estimate Rt as the time required to reduce infectivity by 90%, assuming a linear association.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Regularized Regression Analyses</title><p>The goal of regression analysis was to estimate the size of statistical effect on AIV diversity of covariates corresponding to alternative causal hypotheses. As described above, a covariate corresponding to each hypothesis was developed and assessed for each antigenic subtype. These covariates were (i) <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> (the proportion of genetic variance contained in a subpopulation relative to the total variance) of each subtype (geographic hypothesis), (ii) number of species where strains have been sampled (host diversity hypothesis), (iii) subtype-specific nucleotide mutation rate (genetic hypothesis), (iv) amino acid substitution rates characterizing an immune selective pressure (immunological hypothesis), and (v) environmental durability Rt under natural physical conditions (temperature, 20&#x000b0;C; salinity, 0; pH 7.2; epidemiological hypothesis). Due to correlations among these variables, univariate analysis was not considered to provide reliable estimates of covariate effects. But ordinary least squares multiple regression would be equally ill-advised, resulting in weakly identifiable parameters and variance inflation. A generic solution to this problem is provided by penalized least squares models, such as ridge regression and elastic-net regression. These methods introduce a new estimator, which differs from the maximum likelihood estimator by an additional penalty. In effect, the penalized estimator trades a small amount of bias for a large reduction in the variance of the estimated coefficients. We chose to use elastic-net regression, which takes the maximum likelihood and ridge regression estimators as limit cases and therefore can be fine-tuned to balance the bias-variance tradeoff. Fitting of an elastic-net regression model requires the estimation of an additional tuning parameter (the penalty coefficient), which was numerically selected using cross-validation following <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Friedman1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The outcome of this procedure is a statistical model with coefficients shrunk to minimize generalization error. Covariates for which shrunk coefficients are zero can be inferred to have no effect.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Individual-Based Modeling and Digital Phylogenies</title><p>The individual-based model developed here has been shown to generate evolutionary dynamics that are not statistically distinguishable from the classic <italic>SIR</italic> model in the limiting cases where analogous mathematical models can be still formulated <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Roche1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.
