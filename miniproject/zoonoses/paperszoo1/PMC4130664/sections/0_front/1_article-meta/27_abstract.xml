 <title>Author Summary</title>
 <p>Human populations have experienced several pandemics involving new subtypes of influenza virus over the past century. All of these pandemic strains contained gene segments that originated in wild birds, a host pool that supports a very large and genetically diverse array of influenza viruses. However, once an avian strain establishes itself within the human population, the genetic diversity of the resulting human subtypes is typically quite low compared to that of their avian counterparts. Here we compare the evolutionary dynamics of human and avian influenza viruses in North America and test different hypotheses that might explain these two contrasting evolutionary patterns. Our analysis shows that a combination of characteristics of the host (especially demography) and virus (such as durability in water and mutability) explains the diversity observed. Using a theoretical model, we show that the combination of the short lifespan of wild birds, and greater durability of viruses in aquatic environments, is key to maintaining the high levels of influenza diversity observed in wild birds.</p>
