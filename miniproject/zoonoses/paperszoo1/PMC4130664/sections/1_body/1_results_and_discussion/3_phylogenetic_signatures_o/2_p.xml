<p>We tested for the presence of the first association using phylogenies inferred for 10 different avian influenza HA subtypes isolated from North American wild birds (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s022">Text S1</xref>, section S2). For comparison, we performed a parallel analysis of the most prevalent subtype observed in human (H3), equine (H3), and swine (H1) influenza viruses. Recalling that HA durability correlates with HA genetic diversity (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s010">Figure S10</xref>), we further observed that scaled effective population size (

Because long-term transmission chains resulting from environmental durability should directly increase AIV generation time (the average time between infections), a correlation between

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Third, we found that variance in branch lengths correlated with HA durability across subtypes (
