<p>One final model prediction, that co-infection frequency should increase with environmental durability, is of great evolutionary relevance, as co-infection is necessary for reassortment, which may be a prerequisite to the evolution of pandemic strains

 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Holmes2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Although co-infections are expected to occur infrequently and mainly between related strains in humans (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3J</xref>), environmental transmission in avian communities allows for substantially more frequent co-infections, especially between antigenically distant variants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3L</xref>). This is due to effects of environmental transmission increasing the propensity for co-infection (an empirically supported phenomenon 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Sharp1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>), together with the high antigenic diversity generated by environmental transmission (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g004">Figure 4</xref>). To test this prediction, a regression of subtype-specific HA diversity against the entropy of associated NA subtypes failed to detect any significant relationship (
