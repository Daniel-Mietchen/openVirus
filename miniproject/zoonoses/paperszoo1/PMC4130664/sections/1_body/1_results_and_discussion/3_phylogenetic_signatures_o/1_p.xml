<p>Four testable predictions arise from our model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g004">Figure 4</xref>), three of which can be explored using our existing data set. First, viruses with greater environmental durability are predicted to exhibit greater genetic diversity when host lifespan is short (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Second, increasing viral durability in the environment is predicted to facilitate the reintroduction of past virus variants and hence to correlate with the estimated time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA). Third, the variable nature of indirect transmission chains via the environmental reservoir 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Rohani1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Breban1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> is predicted to generate greater variability in branch lengths. Fourth, and finally, environmental transmission should increase the frequency of co-infection events between antigenically distant viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3Jâ€“L</xref>) and therefore the number of co-circulating subtype combinations.
