<p>Some of these results are not surprising. For instance, our finding concerning the modest contribution of host species diversity to HA genetic variation had previously been observed by Chen and Holmes 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and probably arises from frequent interspecies transmission. Similary, the impact of geographic structuring on gene flow among North American AIVs has been elegantly demonstrated elsewhere 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Bahl1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The important novel result to emerge from our statistical analyses is the substantial contribution of virus durability to HA genetic diversity. This is a component of virus biology not previously considered in the study of AIV evolution. Thus, to better dissect how the durability of AIVs in the environment affects transmission dynamics and subsequently HA diversity and simultaneously to explore Hypothesis 5 (host demography), we constructed a mechanistic phylodynamic model.
