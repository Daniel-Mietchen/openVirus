<p>We analyzed available AIV sequence data from GenBank for 11 HA subtypes from 1976â€“2013 (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> as well as 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s022">Text S1</xref>, section S2) and developed a set of covariates reflecting specific predictions of the competing hypotheses. We sought to place these covariates on an equal footing and simultaneously to assess the contribution of each to HA diversity using a statistical model. Ordinary linear regression with a large number of covariates (of the same order as the number of observations) results in variance inflation, low statistical power, and issues of statistical identifiability 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Tibshirani1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. We therefore adopted a regularized regression method, known as elastic-net regression 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Friedman1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, that solves this problem using a shrinkage estimator to trade off a small amount of bias for substantial reductions in the variance of estimated parameters. As a side effect of this estimation scheme, the resulting coefficients may be interpreted as evidence for or against the inclusion of a covariate (if the coefficient shrinks either to nonzero or zero, respectively). Furthermore, by normalizing covariates we can straightforwardly quantify and compare the relative size of each effect.
