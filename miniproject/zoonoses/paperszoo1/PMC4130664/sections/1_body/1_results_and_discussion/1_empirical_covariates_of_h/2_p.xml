<p>This regression analysis yielded the following conclusions (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s022">Text S1</xref>, sections S4.1â€“S4.3). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001931-t001">Table 1</xref>, among AIV subtypes, each hypothesis we considered made a contribution towards HA genetic diversity, though the magnitude of effects varied considerably (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s018">Table S2</xref> for covariates values). Indeed, the strongest covariates were immune selective pressure (Hypothesis 1, quantified via the amino acid substitution rate) and the environmental durability of virions (Hypothesis 6, inferred by experimental incubation data on viral persistence), whose respective impacts were at least twice as big as the effects of nucleotide mutation rate (Hypothesis 4, quantified by multiplication of nucleotide substitution rate by the substitution rate at third position sites), geographic structure (Hypothesis 3, inferred by

  <sub>ST</sub>
