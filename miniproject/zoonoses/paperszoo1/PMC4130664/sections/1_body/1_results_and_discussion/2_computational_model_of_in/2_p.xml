<p>An innovative aspect to this model is our formulation of transmission. AIV transmission has been thought to be predominantly fecal-oral, which has been considered as essentially direct because of (i) the proximity between susceptible and infected birds needed for infection and (ii) the scaling of transmission with the duration of infectivity. Furthermore, recent research points to direct bird-to-bird transmission via the respiratory route 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Kleijn1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Evidence is accumulating, however, to suggest that an additional transmission route is possible via long-lived viruses in environmental reservoirs

 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Roche2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, effectively giving rise to a second (longer) time scale over which transmission can occur. This hypothesis is based in part on the routine isolation of AIVs from mud samples, soil swabs

 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Terregino1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and other media 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Nazir1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Virus durability is commonly quantified by Rt, which is the time required to reduce infectivity by 90%, and may vary from a couple of days to several months 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Stallknecht1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Rt is determined both by physical environmental conditions, notably temperature, pH, and salinity

 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Webster2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, as well as by subtype identity 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Brown2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Consequently, Hypothesis 6 suggests that environmental transmission could act on a distinctly longer time scale than direct fecal-oral transmission, thereby significantly impacting virus diversity and phylogenetic structure through frequent re-seeding of the avian virus gene pool, as illustrated in
