<p>To quantify the influence of Hypothesis 5 (host demography) on influenza virus diversity, we first parameterized our model to mimic the within-subtype dynamics of human influenza, assuming only direct transmission. Seeding simulations with only a few antigenic variants, we observed the continual replacement of a dominant strain by new antigenic variants (

 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Bedford2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The direct measure of antigenic diversity generated by our model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3D</xref>; six antigenic strains coexist on average) is consistent with our estimates of scaled effective population size of human influenza (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3G</xref>) is also “ladder-like,” characteristic of the strong immune escape signature observed in data (
