 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g002">Figure 2</xref>. Virus diversity is quantified in our model by the number of different antigenic strains at a given time and provides an analog to the diversity inferred by the scaled effective population size on genetic data. This model also enables assessing the role played by host demography (Hypothesis 5) on the maintenance of virus diversity. If these factors are to explain the observed differences between human and avian strains described above, then we expect to observe rapid population turnover and an absence of genetic diversity in a host population parameterized for humans
