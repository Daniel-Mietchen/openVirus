<p>We then addressed demographic explanations by exploring the impact of host biology alone, reparameterizing the model to take into account the reduced lifespan, increased fecundity, and seasonal breeding of birds compared with humans. Model output remained qualitatively unaffected, demonstrating continuous antigenic evolution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), with low-standing antigenic diversity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3E</xref>; five strains coexist on average) and a slender trunk in the phylogenetic tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3H</xref>). Thus, in this model, host demographic properties alone do not strongly influence levels of genetic variation. In contrast, we found that the inclusion of environmental transmission dramatically increased standing antigenic diversity of AIVs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3C and 3F</xref>; 60 strains coexist on average), resulting in both immune selection and virus diversification (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3I</xref>). The phylogenetic tree contains lineages that would have gone extinct in the absence of environmental transmission, demonstrating the punctuation of antigenic evolution with reintroduction of past dominant variants, to which there is little immunity in the population (
