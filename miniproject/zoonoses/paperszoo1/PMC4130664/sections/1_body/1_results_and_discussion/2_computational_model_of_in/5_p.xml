<p>Next, we carried out sensitivity analyses spanning the parameter space of the most common influenza systems, including swine and equine influenza (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We found that the long natural lifespan (and low fecundity) of free living mammalian hosts sustain the selective pressure exerted by herd immunity in the population on dominant strains. Indeed, in the presence of long lifespan and associated long-lived immunity, even substantial levels of environmental transmission do not dramatically increase antigenic diversity. Reduced host lifespan, however, leads to a faster turnover of the population, reducing the selective impacts of herd immunity. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g004">Figure 4</xref>, it is the combination of high lifetime fecundity and environmental transmission that produces dramatic increases in genetic diversity and the coexistence of distantly related viral lineages. In

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s020">Table S4</xref>), we present results of sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the robustness of this broad conclusion to changes in assumed duration of immunity, the strength of cross-protection, the infectious period, direct transmission rate, and the mutation rate. This result also shows very little variation in stochastic realizations of the model.
