<p>Our study identified the mechanisms that act to determine hemagglutinin genetic diversity in avian influenza viruses. In particular, the analyses reveal that our hypotheses act in concert to shape the phylodynamics of AIVs. These results are consistent with prior studies that have examined each mechanism in isolation. For instance, it has been shown that strong spatial structuring is an important factor in the phylogeography of these viruses

 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-DeJong1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, our research has also demonstrated that increasing avian immune selective pressure acts to reduce influenza virus diversity.
