<p>Finally, our findings have practical implications for the management of influenza in wild birds. Particularly, our results indicate that—in addition to movement restrictions

If complete elimination of the virus is desired, then environmental decontamination may be required. Because of the outer lipid envelope associated with influenza viruses, chlorination has been proposed as a potentially effective method for decontamination
