<p>Elsewhere, it has been shown that the environmental reservoir can be a crucial source for sparking off annual outbreaks 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Rohani1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and may have an impact on interannual AIV durability 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Breban2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. As we have demonstrated here, another consequence of this feature of AIV transmission is broad strain coexistence that is similar to an ecological phenomenon called the “storage effect” 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Chesson1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-KelIy1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. This effect has been identified for soil bacteria, where dormancy is thought to generate a high level of microbial diversity 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Lennon1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Dramatically, one of the main predictions of the storage effect theory is that large fluctuations in recruitment rates are expected of low-density species 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-KelIy1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Indeed, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, at any given time, the dominant strain may have first appeared far in the past, and as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s009">Figure S9</xref>, this pattern of dominance is not predictable. Within an epidemiological context, this suggests that unpredictable outbreaks of rare subtypes may occur due to the absence of herd immunity.
