<p>Our most surprising empirical finding is that HA genetic diversity increases with virus durability, as measured in experimental assays, across AIV subtypes (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The corresponding theoretical result is that, in short-lived hosts, increasing the frequency of environmental transmission results in greater equilibrium levels of viral genetic diversity (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g004">4</xref>). Thus, both empirical and theoretical results suggest that environmental transmission acts in wild bird populations to increase avian influenza genetic diversity. As emphasized throughout, our results do not exclude a role for additional mechanisms (e.g., Hypotheses 1â€“3), but establish statistically that the size of the effects of subtype-specific amino acid substitution rates and environmental durability are largest.
