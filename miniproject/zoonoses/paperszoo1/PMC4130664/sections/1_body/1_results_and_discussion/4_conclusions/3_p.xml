<p>Two limitations of this study warrant further investigation. First, a detailed understanding of cross-immunity remains an important empirical limitation to any study of avian influenza evolution. Establishing the duration and extent of protective immunity against heterotypic viruses, particularly, remains a priority. At present, comparative data to test this idea directly are lacking, although work showing the absence of immunity conferred by DNA subtype-specific vaccines to challenge strains from other subtypes 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> suggests that the effect of cross-immunity will be limited. Second, our model assumed a one-dimensional strain space for the practical purpose of numerical tractability 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Gog1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Future work should investigate the effects of incorporating other structures of cross-immunity

Similarly, our findings show the relative importance of environmental persistence on phylodynamics of AIVs. Crucially, viral persistence may also occur in nonaquatic environments, including lake sediment, feathers, and feces
