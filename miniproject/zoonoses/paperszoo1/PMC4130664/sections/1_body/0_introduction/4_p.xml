<p>The mechanistic origins of these differences remain unclear. Here, we propose the following nonmutually exclusive hypotheses as possible explanations: (1) The 
 <italic>immunological hypothesis</italic> holds that more rapid loss of immunity and/or weaker heterologous cross-protection in birds than humans reduces competition among strains, leading to higher diversity; (2) the 
 <italic>ecological hypothesis</italic> suggests that associations between virus lineages and avian host species diversity allow contemporaneous evolution within multiple bird species, sustaining an enriched gene pool; (3) the 
 <italic>geographic hypothesis</italic> supposes that greater geographic isolation in birds than in humans leads to allopatric evolution; (4) the 
 <italic>genetic hypothesis</italic> posits that mutation rate differences between avian and human viruses explains the disparity in viral diversity; (5) the 
 <italic>demographic hypothesis</italic> focuses on the higher fecundity and shorter lifespan of birds compared to humans, which may mitigate the selective pressure of herd immunity via substantial recruitment of immunologically na√Øve individuals propagating the pathogen; and finally, (6) the 
 <italic>epidemiological hypothesis</italic> predicts that there exists a long-lived environmental reservoir for avian strains, but not for human strains, facilitating coexistence of a broad spectrum of genetically, immunologically, and ecologically similar viruses.
