<p>These patterns in human influenza are consistent with “immune escape,” a phenomenon that has been suggested to be common in directly transmitted, immunizing pathogens with a short infectious period, in which antigenic evolution results in partial cross-immunity between strains 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Grenfell1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In contrast, influenza A viruses in avian populations exhibit a rich array of subtypes, with fully 13 of the known 18 HA subtypes isolated from North American birds over this time span (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). This pattern of higher subtype diversity through time is further enriched by higher genetic diversity within subtypes, for instance in H1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1G</xref>) and H3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1H</xref>). Indeed, AIVs typically exhibit a scaled effective population size (

 </inline-formula>, which measures the phylogenetic diversity of the virus population 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Bedford1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>) that is an order of magnitude greater than for their human counterparts: We estimated

 </inline-formula> to be 7.0 y and 1.5 y, respectively, for H1 and H3 in humans and 38.7 y and 77.5 y in birds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1E and 1F</xref>; as we show below, other avian subtypes also exhibit higher diversity than commonly observed in H1 and H3 human subtypes). Thus, although phylogenetic trees of H1 and H3 AIVs show some evidence of selection (immune escape) 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Dugan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, they also document broad viral coexistence (
