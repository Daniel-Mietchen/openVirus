<p>Seasonal epidemics of influenza viruses are responsible for significant human morbidity and mortality 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Cox1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Owing to their RNA makeup, evolution of influenza A viruses occurs rapidly

 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Koelle1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Over the past decade, there has been an extensive effort to understand the concurrent epidemiology and evolutionary trajectory of human influenza viruses

 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Arinaminpathy1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, an approach termed “phylodynamics”

 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Olsen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, are lacking. Such analysis is particularly timely because of the recent recognition of H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) as pandemic threats
