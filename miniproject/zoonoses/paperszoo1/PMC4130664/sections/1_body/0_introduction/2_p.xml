 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1</xref>. In humans, seasonal influenza outbreaks exhibit substantial annual variation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), which is also reflected in shifting dominance of co-circulating subtypes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Human influenza viruses exhibit very limited subtype diversity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), as defined by the number of serologically distinct hemagglutinin (H or HA) glycoprotein types 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Webster1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, where only H1 and H3 subtypes of influenza A viruses have significantly circulated since 1968 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Palese1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In addition to this paucity of subtypes, genetic diversity is also limited within H1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1E</xref>) and H3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1F</xref>) subtypes, as reflected in the slender trunk of the consensus phylogenetic tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1I and 1J</xref>).
