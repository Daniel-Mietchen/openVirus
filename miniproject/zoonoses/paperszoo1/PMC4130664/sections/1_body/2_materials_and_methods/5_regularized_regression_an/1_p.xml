<p>The goal of regression analysis was to estimate the size of statistical effect on AIV diversity of covariates corresponding to alternative causal hypotheses. As described above, a covariate corresponding to each hypothesis was developed and assessed for each antigenic subtype. These covariates were (i)

 </italic> (the proportion of genetic variance contained in a subpopulation relative to the total variance) of each subtype (geographic hypothesis), (ii) number of species where strains have been sampled (host diversity hypothesis), (iii) subtype-specific nucleotide mutation rate (genetic hypothesis), (iv) amino acid substitution rates characterizing an immune selective pressure (immunological hypothesis), and (v) environmental durability Rt under natural physical conditions (temperature, 20Â°C; salinity, 0; pH 7.2; epidemiological hypothesis). Due to correlations among these variables, univariate analysis was not considered to provide reliable estimates of covariate effects. But ordinary least squares multiple regression would be equally ill-advised, resulting in weakly identifiable parameters and variance inflation. A generic solution to this problem is provided by penalized least squares models, such as ridge regression and elastic-net regression. These methods introduce a new estimator, which differs from the maximum likelihood estimator by an additional penalty. In effect, the penalized estimator trades a small amount of bias for a large reduction in the variance of the estimated coefficients. We chose to use elastic-net regression, which takes the maximum likelihood and ridge regression estimators as limit cases and therefore can be fine-tuned to balance the bias-variance tradeoff. Fitting of an elastic-net regression model requires the estimation of an additional tuning parameter (the penalty coefficient), which was numerically selected using cross-validation following
