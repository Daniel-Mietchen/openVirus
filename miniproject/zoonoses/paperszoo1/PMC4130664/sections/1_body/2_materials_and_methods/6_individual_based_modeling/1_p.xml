<p>The individual-based model developed here has been shown to generate evolutionary dynamics that are not statistically distinguishable from the classic 
 <italic>SIR</italic> model in the limiting cases where analogous mathematical models can be still formulated 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Roche1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Its main algorithm is detailed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s022">Text S1</xref> (section S3.1). Only nonneutral antigenic mutations have been explicitly considered within the model. The reconstruction of neutral mutations to infer the digital phylogenies has been implemented in a second step, detailed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s022">Text S1</xref>, section S3.3. To avoid definitive extinctions, immigration of infectious individuals was included, with immigrant strains randomly selected according to the proportion of each variant present during the previous epidemic in order to avoid a strong influence of infectious immigration. Simulations start with four different strains far enough to avoid cross-immunity between them (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s022">Text S1</xref>, section S3.2).
