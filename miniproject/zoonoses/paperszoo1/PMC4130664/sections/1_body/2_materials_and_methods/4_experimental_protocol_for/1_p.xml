<p>Data on environmental durability for each subtype come from experimental data 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Brown2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. For each virus subtype, infective virions were diluted 1∶100 in water samples. The inoculated water samples were then divided into 3.0 ml aliquots in 5.0 ml polystyrene tubes and placed in incubators set to the appropriate treatment temperature. For each virus temperature trial, the viral inoculated water was sampled at the time of viral inoculation and at a second time point postinoculation. Titrations at all time points were performed in duplicate. The second postinoculation time point varied with each trial and was determined based on prior estimates of the time required for the titer of the virus in the water sample to be reduced by at least 1 log10 TCID50/ml 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Stallknecht1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>,
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Duplicate 0.5 ml samples of AIV-inoculated water were diluted 1∶1 by addition of 0.5 ml of 2× serum-free MEM. Ten-fold dilutions (10
 <sup>−1</sup> to 10
 <sup>−8</sup>) were then made in 1× MEM supplemented with antibiotics. These titers were used to estimate Rt as the time required to reduce infectivity by 90%, assuming a linear association.
