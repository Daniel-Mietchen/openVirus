<p>We measured nucleotide substitution rate at third position sites as a proxy for nucleotide mutation, as evolution at third position sites should primarily represent synonymous change 
 <xref rid="pbio.1001931-Shapiro1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. We also measured amino acid substitution rate, which is affected by both nucleotide mutation rate and selective effect of mutations. In the regression analysis, we find that amino acid substitution rate has a much stronger correlation with

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001931-t001">Table 1</xref>). This suggests that it is the differing levels of selection on different HAs that determines viral diversity, rather than differing intrinsic mutation rates. The finding of a strong negative correlation between amino acid substitution rate and
