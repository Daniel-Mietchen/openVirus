<p>For the phylogenetic analyses presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1</xref>, we focused on the HA gene for 10 subtypes sampled from wild bird species in North America between 1976 and 2001. We restricted our attention to this period because of the availability of parallel subtype-specific AIV prevalence data. For the remaining phylogenetic analyses (such as those presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001931-t001">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g005">Figure 5</xref>), we examined sequence data from 1976â€“2013 from North America (United States and Canada) for avian, swine, and equine subtypes (
