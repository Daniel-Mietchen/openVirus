  <title>Sensitivity of simulated pathogen diversity to host lifespan and environmental transmission.</title>
  <p>Simulations were run for 50 y, with the first 10 y discarded as transients. We assumed a population size of 10
   <sup>4</sup> individuals, with no seasonality in demography or environmental durability. The 
   <italic>z</italic>-axis corresponds to the mean antigenic diversity over the 40-y period. A decrease in environmental uptake rate (
   <italic>x</italic>-axis) dramatically reduces mean antigenic diversity (average of the number of strains) and switches the phylogenetic pattern from one that depicts broad coexistence to an immune escape profile. This switch in phylogenetic pattern is most pronounced when host lifespan (
   <italic>y</italic>-axis) is short. To estimate digital phylogenies, 100 strains were sampled over the last 25 y of simulations. Other parameters are as in
