  <title>Illustration of our individual-based transmission model.</title>
  <p>The model takes into account seasonality in host population size (for breeding and migration) and virus durability (driven by fluctuations in temperature), direct (fecal-oral) transmission, and the deposition of virus in the environment, leading to indirect transmission chains with infection probability determined by virus EID
   <sub>50</sub>. The framework can accommodate multiple host species, but results presented in this study are from a single species model (
