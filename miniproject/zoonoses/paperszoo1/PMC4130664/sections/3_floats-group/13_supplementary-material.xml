  <p>Test of neutral mutation reconstruction algorithm. Panels on the left represent model parameters leading to a perfect immune escape pattern (each strain is replaced at the next time step). Panels on the right depict viral coexistence. The phylogenies reconstructed (Bottom) through the algorithm detailed in
