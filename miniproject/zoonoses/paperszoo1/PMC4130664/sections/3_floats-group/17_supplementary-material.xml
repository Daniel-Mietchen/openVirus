  <p>Phylodynamics simulated with environmental transmission and different values for key parameters. Parameters are the same as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3</xref> with environmental transmission. (B) Infectious period is set at 3 d. (C) Infectious period is set at 7 d. (D) Parameter Î¸ (see eqn S1 in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s022">Text S1</xref>) is set at 0.5 instead of 0.7. (E) Parameter 
   <italic>d</italic> (see eqn S1 in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s022">Text S1</xref>) is set at 5 instead of 3. Co-infection patterns are depicted by the absolute number of co-infection events in order to complete the figures shown in the main text, where number of co-infections are scaled by host population size.
