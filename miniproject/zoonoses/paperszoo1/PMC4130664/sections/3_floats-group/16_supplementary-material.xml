  <p>Phylodynamics simulated with different hypotheses than environmental transmission. Parameters are the same as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3</xref> (A) without environmental transmission. (B) A temporary immunity of 6 mo is assumed. (C) Mutation rate is set at 2.10
   <sup>−5</sup> per base per day on 12,000 bases (assuming the whole genome is coding for antigenic variation) instead of 2,000 (assuming that only mutation on HA is coding). (D) Less efficient cross-protection (changing the cross-immunity parameter 
   <italic>d</italic> = 1, see eqn. S1 in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s022">Text S1</xref>). (E) Longer infectious period (20 d) by keeping R0 of direct transmission constant. (F) With environmental transmission. Co-infection patterns are depicted by the absolute numbers of co-infection events in order to complete the figures shown in the main text, where number of co-infections are scaled by host population size.
