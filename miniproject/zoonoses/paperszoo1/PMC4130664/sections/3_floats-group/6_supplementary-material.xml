  <p>Conceptual summary of study findings. The figure depicts the contrasting transmission dynamics of human (top panels) and avian (bottom panels) influenza viruses. When host lifespan is long and transmission is only via direct contact (as is the case with human influenza viruses), herd immunity to a given antigenic variant produces strong selection pressure for immune evasion, as indicated by strain replacement events in the top panel. With AIVs, however, the long-term environmental reservoir leads to the episodic introduction of older lineages and facilitates viral coexistence.</p>
