<p>The probability that 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> fed on humans increased over the mosquito season ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040082-g001">Figure 1</xref>A; logistic regression of individual blood meals on Julian date: intercept = −7.3, slope = 0.025; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 148 blood meals; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.004). The probability that 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> fed on mammals also increased ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040082-g001">Figure 1</xref>A; intercept = −6.8, slope = 0.025; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 148 blood meals; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). However, the probability of feeding on nonhuman mammals did not increase significantly (intercept = −6.5, slope = 0.017; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 148 blood meals; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.14), suggesting that the increase in mosquitoes' preference for humans was responsible for the apparent shift to mammals. As would be expected, the probability of feeding on avian hosts declined over the same period (intercept = 11.9, slope = −0.046; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 148; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Using the fitted logistic equations, the probability of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> feeding on humans and mammals increased from 0.040 and 0.064 in mid-June to 0.28 and 0.39 in mid-September, which roughly match the monthly groupings of the data ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040082-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). These are 7-fold and 6-fold increases, respectively.
