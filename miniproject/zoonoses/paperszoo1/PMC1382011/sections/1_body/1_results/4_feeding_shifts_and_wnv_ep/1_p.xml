<p>Previously documented shifts from birds to mammals in 
 <italic>Cx. tarsalis</italic> in California [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and Colorado [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] also intensify WNV epidemics in these states ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040082-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The fraction of feedings from mammals in peak WNV months (July through September) in California and Colorado were 4.1- and 1.7-fold higher, respectively, than those in June, suggesting that feeding shifts substantially increased the number of human WNV cases in these regions. The July and August peaks in human WNV cases in Colorado and California follow the peak in the abundance of WNV-infected mosquitoes that occur in June and July, respectively [

 <italic>Cx. tarsalis</italic> feeding from birds to mammals. These feeding shifts occur during the late summer periods of postbreeding dispersal and migration of robins in these regions ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040082-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In support of the link between feeding patterns and the dispersal and decline of passerine migrants, the fraction of feedings of 
 <italic>Cx. tarsalis</italic> from passerines (many of which are competent for WNV [
