<p>In early summer (May and June), 51% of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic>' blood meals came from a widespread, competent avian host, the American robin 
 <italic>(Turdus migratorius)</italic> [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], despite the fact that this species made up only 4.5% of the avian community ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040082-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) (2% to 7% at each site). The abundance of robins in urbanized areas declined over the next 4 mo ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040082-g001">Figure 1</xref>B; relative abundance of American robins = 3.25 − 0.0116 * Julian date; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 24; 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 30.2%; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.004), as robins dispersed after breeding. As the availability of robins declined, the probability they were fed upon by 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> also declined markedly ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040082-g001">Figure 1</xref>B; logistic regression of individual blood meals on Julian date: intercept = 6.5, slope = −0.037; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 148; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), which coincided with the rise of humans as an important source of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> blood meals ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040082-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). In contrast, the total abundance of birds, which was dominated by house sparrows, 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Passer domesticus</named-content> (42% to 67% of total abundance), increased over this period as a result of reproduction ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040082-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Thus, the shift in 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> feeding from birds to humans is not a result of decreasing avian abundance but is more likely the result of the decline in the abundance of robins, their preferred host.
