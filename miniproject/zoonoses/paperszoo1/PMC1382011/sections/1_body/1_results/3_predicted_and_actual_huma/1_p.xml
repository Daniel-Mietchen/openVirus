<p>Our model-predicted risk of the transmission of WNV to humans by 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> peaked from late July to mid-August, declined in late August, and increased slightly at the end of September ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040082-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) before a period of cold weather greatly decreased mosquito activity in early October. Human WNV infections in the surrounding area showed a strikingly similar pattern ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040082-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), with a steep rise in cases occurring approximately 14 d after the peak in predicted risk, in agreement with the 3- to 14-d period between infection and the onset of illness in humans [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and the approximately 7-d delay between becoming infected and becoming infectious when a mosquito is initially infected with WNV [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The correlation of our predicted risk and human cases 14 d later was highly significant ( 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.80; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 8 biweekly accumulations from mid-June through October; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.009). Finally, our data-driven model suggests that had mosquitoes continued to feed on humans with the same probability that they did in June, human epidemics would have occurred at much lower intensity and there would have been few, if any, infections after mid-September (
