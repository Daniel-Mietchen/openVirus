<p>Approximately three quarters of human emerging infectious diseases are caused by zoonotic pathogens [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. For many of these diseases, nonhuman animals are the primary host and human infections are incidental and often dead-end in nature [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Nonetheless, these pathogens can have severe consequences for human health, due to high mortality rates, high incidence rates, or both [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â€“ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The factors that drive the spillover of these pathogens from other animals to humans determine the intensity of human epidemics [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For directly transmitted zoonotic pathogens, transmission to humans increases with the contact rate between infected animals and susceptible humans, whereas for vector-borne diseases, the feeding behavior and feeding preferences of the vector(s) play a key role in determining the force of infection [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, a critical step in the control of epidemics of zoonotic vector-borne pathogens is determining the feeding preferences of key vectors and how they change over space and time [
