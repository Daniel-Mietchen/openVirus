<p>We tested a fourth hypothesis, that epidemics are driven by a shift in mosquito feeding behavior from birds to mammals, as has been demonstrated for other mosquitoes in North America [

 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> in the New or Old World [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The most competent vertebrate hosts for WNV appear to be birds [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], whereas most mammals, including humans, are poorly competent hosts [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. If mosquitoes feed primarily on birds in the summer and then switch to humans in the fall, this may amplify both the intensity of the summer epidemic in mosquitoes and birds and later transmission of WNV to humans. To test this hypothesis and to understand the factors driving North American human WNV epidemics, we integrated data on the feeding behavior, population dynamics, and epidemiology of mosquitoes, birds, and humans in three regions across the United States.
