<p>West Nile virus (WNV) is a zoonotic pathogen that is maintained in an enzootic cycle primarily through transmission between viremic birds and ornithophilic (bird-biting) mosquitoes [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, during late summer and early fall, WNV also infects humans and other mammals and has caused repeated large-scale human epidemics in North America since it was first detected in New York City in 1999 [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It has caused over 20,000 reported cases, 770 deaths, and an estimated 215,000 illnesses during the past 7 y and is now the dominant vector-borne disease in North America [

 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. During the past 4 y, there were epidemics in North America of approximately 2,000 to 10,000 cases each, far larger than European epidemics, which have never exceeded 400 cases and occur infrequently [
