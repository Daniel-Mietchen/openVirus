<p>Three hypotheses have been put forth to explain the increased intensity of epidemics in North America. First, the strain of WNV introduced in North America has been shown to be more virulent to American crows 
 <italic>(Corvus brachyrhynchos)</italic> than one strain circulating in the Old World [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Second, North American birds had no previous exposure to WNV and the lack of acquired and evolved immunity may have increased the intensity of epidemics [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Third, North American 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Culex pipiens</named-content> mosquitoes, the dominant vector of WNV in the northeast and north-central United States, appear to be hybrids of the bird-biting “pipiens” form and human-feeding “molestus” form of Old World 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These three hypotheses are neither mutually exclusive nor exhaustive.
