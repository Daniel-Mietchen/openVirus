<p>Feeding shifts have two synergistic effects on the intensity of WNV transmission to humans. First, we have shown that the increase over time in the probability of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> feeding on humans results in a greater number of human WNV infections than if the mosquitoes fed on humans with the same probability as in early summer ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040082-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Second, feeding primarily on WNV-competent avian hosts during the amplification period of the epidemiological cycle maximizes the intensity of the epidemic in mosquitoes. If mosquitoes fed on humans in early summer with the same probability as that seen in late summer (approximately 0.30), the peak and mean prevalence of WNV in mosquitoes would be substantially reduced [

 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], due to the large number of wasted feedings on humans, which, like immune birds, are dead-end hosts [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In contrast, holding the probability of mosquitoes feeding on humans at its lowest level, 0.04 (as we modeled in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040082-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), has only a minor effect on WNV amplification. This is because mosquito WNV prevalences are already beginning to decline (possibly as a result of increased acquired immunity in juvenile birds) when mammals begin to make up an important fraction of the blood meals. Thus, the shift in feeding from competent hosts early in the season to humans later leads first to greater amplification of the virus as transmission intensifies between birds and mosquitoes and subsequently to an even greater number of human WNV infections.
