<p>Feeding shifts from birds to humans offer a broader and more direct explanation for the intensity of North American WNV epidemics compared to those in Europe than those previously proposed: hybridization of the “pipiens” and “molestus” forms of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the novelty of WNV for North American birds [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and the virulence of the introduced strain compared to an Old World isolate [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. First, although it is possible that the feeding shift we observed in 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> could be the result of increasing hybridization between the molestus and pipiens forms of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], this has yet to be demonstrated, and a shift due to robin dispersal is a more parsimonious explanation. In any case, increasing hybridization would offer an explanation only in areas where 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> is the dominant vector. In addition, a temporally invariant increase in feeding on humans by hybrid 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> as proposed [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] would have counteracting effects on mosquito and human WNV infections, as we have shown. Second, WNV epizootics occur in birds after the production of large numbers of naïve and susceptible offspring, so the acquired immunity of adults may play only a limited role in subsequent transmission. Third, the introduced strain of WNV appears to be more virulent compared to an Old World strain in American crows 
 <italic>(Corvus brachyrhynchos)</italic> [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], but not in more important amplification hosts such as house sparrows 
 <italic>(Passer domesticus)</italic> [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Finally, high vector competence of 
 <italic>Cx. tarsalis</italic> [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and increases in the abundance or WNV infection prevalence of more mammalophilic mosquito species may also contribute to WNV transmission to humans. However, the latter appears to be of limited importance in the northeast United States where the enzootic vectors appear to be responsible for more than 80% of human WNV infections [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].
