<p>In sum, although many factors influence WNV transmission to humans, our results suggest that feeding shifts occur across North America and offer a direct explanation for the greater number of human WNV infections compared to the Old World. More broadly, our findings show that shifts in mosquito feeding behavior are a geographically widespread phenomenon that intensifies epidemics of several avian zoonotic viruses including WNV, Western equine encephalitis virus, and St. Louis encephalitis virus [
