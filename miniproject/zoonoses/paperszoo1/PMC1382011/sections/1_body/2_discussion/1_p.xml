<p>Our data from the mid-Atlantic demonstrate a late-summer shift in the feeding behavior of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> from their preferred avian host, American robins, to humans. This shift offers an explanation for the late-summer timing and increased intensity of human WNV epidemics in the northeast and north-central parts of North America [

 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], where this species is the dominant enzootic vector and bridge vector [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We have also shown that WNV epidemics in the central and western parts of the United States are intensified by feeding shifts that escalate as robins and other WNV-competent avian hosts disperse and migrate following breeding. Finally, an important WNV vector in the southeast United States, 
 <italic>Cx. nigripalpus</italic> [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], also shifts from feeding primarily on birds in spring to an increasing fraction from mammals in later summer, although the cause for this shift is unknown [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Taken together, these data suggest that mosquito feeding shifts appear to be a continent-wide phenomenon that amplifies the transmission of WNV from birds to humans and other mammals.
