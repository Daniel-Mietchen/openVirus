<p>We collected field data at six sites in Maryland and Washington, D. C., from May through September 2004. The sites included three urban areas, the National Mall in Washington, D. C., northeast of the Watergate Hotel in Foggy Bottom, D. C., and west of Camden Yards in Baltimore, Maryland; two residential areas, Takoma Park, Maryland, and Bethesda, Maryland; and one park within an urban setting, Fort Dupont Park, D. C. Each site was approximately 1 km in diameter, with a relatively homogeneous percent forest cover and land use in the site and surrounding area. The sites span a distance of greater than 40 miles and are separated by 3 to 25 miles.</p>
