<p>We estimated the abundance of host-seeking 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes at each site using eight CDC light traps, baited with dry ice (CO 
 <sub>2</sub>). We ran these traps for two nights every 2 wk from May to September at each site and averaged abundance across the sites. To determine the species composition of 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes at our sites, which are difficult to identify morphologically [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], we used PCR on the internal spacer gene [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] to identify all engorged 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes to species and an additional subset of 40 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes at each site. We found that more than 90% of the 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes identified at each of the six sites were 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic>.
