<p>We estimated the abundance of birds using four- to six-point transects, six minutes in duration, performed at each site monthly from May through September and analyzed the data using Program Distance [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], which accounts for species' differences in detectability. We estimated the decline of American robin abundance ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040082-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) over time using a regression of the relative abundance of robins at each site on the Julian date. The changes in robin and total bird abundance were similar across the six sites.
