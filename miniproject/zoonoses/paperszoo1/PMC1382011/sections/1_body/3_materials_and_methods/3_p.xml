<p>We collected engorged mosquitoes from each site using CDC light and gravid traps and by collecting mosquitoes resting on vegetation with a large backpack-mounted aspirator. Blood meals were identified as avian, mammalian, or other following extraction of DNA from the engorged mosquitoes and PCR amplification of the cytochrome b gene as described and verified [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Hosts were identified to the species level by nucleotide sequencing of the amplified product using an ABI 3700 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, United States) with avian or mammalian forward and reverse primers [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Data were analyzed using the DNAStar software package (Madison, Wisconsin, United States) and sequence analysis was conducted using Blastn via the Internet. Only engorged mosquitoes identified as 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> were used in the feeding analysis. We obtained PCR product for 165 blood meals and DNA sequences for 148 of these.
