<p>Mosquitoes were tested for WNV RNA using real-time RT-PCR [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] in groups (pools) of 20 to 50 individuals. The WNV infection prevalence was estimated using maximum likelihood techniques [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and expressed as the WNV infection rate = 1,000 Ã— mosquito WNV infection prevalence.
