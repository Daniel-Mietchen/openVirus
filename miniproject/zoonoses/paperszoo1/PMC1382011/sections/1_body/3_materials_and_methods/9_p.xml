<p>To examine the temporal overlap between feeding shifts and human WNV epidemics in other parts of North America, we obtained data on temporal variation in feeding on birds and mammals for 
 <italic>Cx. tarsalis</italic> in Colorado [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and California [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We compared these patterns with data on the date of onset of illness and number of human cases of WNV in Colorado [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and California [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] in 2004. Finally, we compared these to periods of postbreeding dispersal and migration for robins in California [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and in four different habitats in Arizona [ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>â€“ 
 <xref rid="pbio-0040082-b049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].
