   <bold>Straight phylogenetic tree of variable region of the F-gene sequences (47–421 nt) of genotype VII NDV.</bold> The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1000 replicates is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) are shown next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset (Complete deletion option). Strains used in this study are marked with •. a-e text inside the parenthesis corresponds to the sublineage grouping.
