<p>Analysis of seven neutralizing epitopes located at positions 72, 74, 75, 78, 79, 157 to 171 and 343 of the F-protein showed a K to R amino acid substitution at position 78 in seven of the nine strains (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). These strains were JP/Ibaraki/SG106/99, JP/Ibaraki/IS5/02, JP/Chiba/BY103/01, JP/Ibaraki/IS2/02, JP/Miyagi/AGT/02, JP/Chiba/BY7/02 and JP/Fukushima/NYF-3/02. Furthermore, analysis of amino acid substitutions showed 13 point mutations in the variable region of the F-gene of the Japanese field strains (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Genotypic and subgenotypic-specific amino acid substitutions were also observed, which were consistent with the proposed theory of NDV evolution as reported previously [
