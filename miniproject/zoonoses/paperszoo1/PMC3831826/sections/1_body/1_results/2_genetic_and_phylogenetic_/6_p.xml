<p>No intragenic nor intergenic recombination events (Unique events = 0; Recombination signals = 0) were observed involving the field isolates using all the described methods. Analysis of the over-all mean evolutionary distance among the Japanese field isolates showed rates of 3.9×10
 <sup>-2</sup> [standard error (s.e) 0.01], 3.1×10
 <sup>-2</sup> (s.e. 0.01) and 2.0×10
 <sup>-2</sup> (s.e. 0.01) base substitution per site in the full F-gene, partial NP-gene and partial L-genes, respectively. In contrast, over-all mean evolutionary distance among the recent field strains (1999–2002) were 1.0×10
 <sup>-3</sup> (s.e. 0.001) base substitution per site for the F and NP-genes and zero base substitution for the L-gene. In addition, 25 sites in the F-gene of all field strains were observed to be under negative selection (p-value &lt; 0.05) (Table
