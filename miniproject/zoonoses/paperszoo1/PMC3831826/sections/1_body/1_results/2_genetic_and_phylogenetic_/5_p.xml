<p>F-gene nucleotide sequence of JP/Osaka/2440/69 was found to be closely related (98.5-99.2% nucleotide sequence identity) to isolates from the Middle East. The F-gene sequence of JP/Ibaraki/SM87/87 was closely related (96.3-100.0%) with isolates from Japan and China. All the other VIId isolates were highly similar (97.2-100.0%) to isolates from Japan, China and Taiwan and interestingly to a goose isolate from China (98.4-98.6%) (TableÂ
