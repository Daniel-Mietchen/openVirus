<p>Field NDV strains were observed to belong to two distinct genotypic groups (genotype VI and VII) using phylogenetic analysis of the complete coding sequence of the F-gene. Early isolates such as JP/Osaka/2440/69 and JP/Ibaraki/SM87/87 were genotype VI, while field strains isolated from 1999 onwards were from genotype VII (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis using the 3-prime portion of NP-gene and 5-prime portion of L-gene yielded the same tree topology and phylogenetic groupings (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Phylogenetic analyses at the subgenotype level using the variable region of the F-gene sequences revealed that JP/Osaka/2440/69 belongs to subgenotype VIa, JP/Ibaraki/SM87/87 to subgenotype VId and all the recent field isolates to subgenotype VIId (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).
