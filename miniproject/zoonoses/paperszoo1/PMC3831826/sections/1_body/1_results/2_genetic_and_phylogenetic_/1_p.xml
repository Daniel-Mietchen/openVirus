<p>A total of 1662 nucleotides encoding for 553 amino acid residues were identified in the complete coding region of the F-gene of all field strains. Six potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr where X is any amino acid except proline or aspartic acid) located at positions 85 to 87, 191 to 193, 366 to 368, 447 to 449, 471 to 473 and 541 to 543 were recognized. Twelve cysteine residues located at positions 25, 76, 199, 338, 347, 362, 370, 394, 399, 401, 424 and 523 were identified. Comparison of glycosylation sites and cysteine residues showed no changes in the amino acid sequence in all field strains, which may indicate that these sites were highly conserved.</p>
