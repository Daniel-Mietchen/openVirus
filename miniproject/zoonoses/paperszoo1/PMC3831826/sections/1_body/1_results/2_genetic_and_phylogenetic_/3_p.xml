<p>Phylogenetic analyses of nine field strains and 180 NDV strains from GenBank were performed by using contiguous nucleotide sequences of the F-gene, NP-gene and L-gene. Reference strains from GenBank were selected as representatives of nine of the 11 ND genotypes (genotypes I to XI) representing isolates from different regions of the world (FiguresÂ
