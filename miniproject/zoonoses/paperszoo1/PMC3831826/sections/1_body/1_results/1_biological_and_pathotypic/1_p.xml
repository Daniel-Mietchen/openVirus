<p>All suspected NDV isolates yielded a 766-bp product in the nested PCR amplification step. This confirmed that all isolates belong to Avian Paramyxovirus type-1 viruses. All strains exhibited mean death time (MDT) of 48 to 56 hours in embryonated chicken eggs. Intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) values ranged from 1.7 to 1.9 (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Nucleotide sequence analyses of the variable region of the F-gene (47–421 nt) showed that all isolates had multiple basic amino acids at its F0 proteolytic cleavage site (residues 112–117). Predicted amino acid sequence of the F0 cleavage site was 
 <sup>112</sup>RRQKR
 <sup>116</sup> at the F2 protein and phenylalanine (
 <sup>116</sup> F
 <sup>117</sup>) at the N-terminus of the F1 protein for all strains. These results indicated that all isolates were velogenic.
