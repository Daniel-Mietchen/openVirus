<p>Confirmed NDV strains were subjected to additional RT-PCR amplification to characterize the open reading frame of the F-gene sequences (4504–6295 nt of whole NDV genome), 3-prime end of the NP-gene sequences (16–783 nt of whole NDV genome) and 5-prime end of the L-gene sequences (13995–14719 nt of whole NDV genome). In brief, RT-PCR was performed by using SapphireAmp® Fast PCR Master Mix (Takara Bio), 5 uM of forward and reverse primers (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>) and cDNAs that were transcribed previously. Thermocycling conditions consisted of initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 98°C for 10 sec (denaturation), 55°C for 10 sec (annealing), 72°C for 10 sec (extensions) and final extension at 72°C for 2 min. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis with 1.2% agarose gel and purified by using QIAquick® Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The nucleotide sequences of PCR products were determined by Big Dye terminator cycle-sequencing kit version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) and an ABI Prism 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). DNA products were sequenced from both directions. The complete F-gene sequence for strain JP/Fukushima/NYF3/02 was obtained in our previous study.
