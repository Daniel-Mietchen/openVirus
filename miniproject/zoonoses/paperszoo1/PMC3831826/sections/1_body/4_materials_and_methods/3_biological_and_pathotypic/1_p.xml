<p>Biological and pathotypical characterization of isolates were performed using mean death time (MDT) in 10-days-old embryonated SPF chicken eggs and intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) in 1-day old chicks according to the protocols described in the OIE manual [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Confirmation of pathotypes was performed by nucleotide sequence analysis of the F0 proteolytic cleavage site (residues 112â€“117). Pathotypical data for strain JP/Fukushima/NYF3/02 were obtained in our previous study.
