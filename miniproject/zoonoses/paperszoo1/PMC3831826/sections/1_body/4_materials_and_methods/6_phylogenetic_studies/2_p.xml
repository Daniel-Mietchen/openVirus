<p>To determine the molecular epidemiological relationships of field strains, 180 NDV strains isolated from different regions of the world at different time periods were obtained from GenBank. These reference strains were representatives of all the different NDV genotypes and subgenotypes. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using MEGA version 4 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Phylogenetic trees of the variable region of the F-gene sequences (47–421 nt), complete coding region of the F-gene sequences (1–1662 nt), coding region of the 3-prime end of NP-gene sequences (1–622 nt) and coding region of the 5-prime end of L-gene sequences (5629–6333 nt) were constructed by the neighbor-joining method with the maximum composite likelihood substitution model at 1000 bootstrap replicates.
