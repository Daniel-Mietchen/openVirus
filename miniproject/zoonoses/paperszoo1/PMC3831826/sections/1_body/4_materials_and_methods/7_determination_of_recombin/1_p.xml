<p>Intragenic recombination events in the NDV nucleotide sequences were determined using RDP v3.44 program. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Seven different algorithms integrated in the program namely RDP, GeneConv, Bootscan, MaxChi, Chimaera, SiScan and 3Seq were applied to detect any putative recombination breakpoints and to estimate the occurrence of any recombination events within all the analyzed genes. Sequences with recombination events identified by at least two detection methods (p &lt; 0.01) were considered as true recombinants. Intragenic recombination events within the F-gene were also determined by comparing the tree topology of phylogenetic analyses using the variable region (47–421 nt) and complete coding region (1–1662 nt) of the F-gene. Intergenic recombination events were determined by comparison of topologies of the generated F, NP and L-gene phylogenetic trees.
