<p>Evolutionary distances were calculated using MEGA version 4 using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Codon positions included were the 1st + 2nd + 3rd + noncoding. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset (complete deletion option). Estimates of s.e. were obtained by a bootstrap procedure of 1000 replicates. Analysis of evolutionary selection profile was performed using Datamonkey
