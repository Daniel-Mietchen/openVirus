<p>Nested RT-PCR was performed to confirm the identities of suspected NDV strains. In brief, isolates were propagated once in 10-day-old embryonated SPF eggs. Viral RNA from infected allantoic fluids was extracted directly by using a QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK). Viral RNA was transcribed to cDNA by using random hexamers and Primescript® Reverse Transcriptase (Takara Bio-Inc, Shiga, Japan). cDNA was amplified by PCR as described previously [

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). Thermocycling conditions for the first and second PCR steps were as follows: prewarming at 94°C for 2 min (1 cycle), denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing at 50°C for 30 sec and extension at 72°C for 1 min. Amplification steps were performed for 35 cycles. The final extension was performed at 72°C for 30 sec (1 cycle).
