<p>Nine NDV strains isolated from commercial poultry farms with different spatial (Osaka, Ibaraki, Chiba, Fukushima and Miyagi Prefectures) and temporal distribution patterns (1969, 1987, 1999, 2001 and 2002) were used to investigate the molecular epidemiological relationships of ND outbreaks in vaccinated commercial poultry flocks in Japan. These strains were isolated by one to two passages of pooled infected tissues in 10-day-old embryonated specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken eggs. Infective allantoic fluids were harvested and kept in lyophilized form or in serum tubes and stored at −80°C until further use. All isolates used in this study were provided by Poultry Products Quality Control Co. Ltd. (Fukushima, Japan).</p>
