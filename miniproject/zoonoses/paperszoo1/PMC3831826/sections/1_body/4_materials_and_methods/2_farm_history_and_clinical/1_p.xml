<p>Records of management and farm history were obtained to characterize the clinical profile of nine suspected NDV strains (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The oldest strain was from Osaka Prefecture in 1969 (JP/Osaka/2440/69). This isolate was recovered from six dead layer birds that were submitted to the Osaka Veterinary Municipal Office for diagnosis. The flock was vaccinated with the live B1 vaccine in drinking water at 5–7 days of age and killed ND vaccine (Sato strain) at 25 days. The affected flock was around 80 days of age when the disease occurred. Mortality was reported to be around 60-70% but no data were given regarding observed clinical signs and production performance. The second strain was from a layer farm in Ibaraki Prefecture isolated in 1987 (JP/Ibaraki/SM87/87). Total population of affected farm was 33,360 birds in 12 open-type houses of 2,780 birds each. The disease was reported in one of the houses. The flock was vaccinated with the live B1 spray at 10 days of age, killed Ishii/B1 at 45 days, live B1 spray again at 60 days and killed Ishii/B1 again at 120 days. The disease occurred two months after the last vaccination at 180 days of age. The disease was characterized by gasping and 25% drop in egg production. Mortality was less than three percent. The third strain was from Ibaraki Prefecture in 1999 that was isolated from dead spent hens sent for diagnosis (JP/Ibaraki/SG106/99). The isolate was from an unknown farm raising spent hens for liquid egg production. No detailed farm information was obtained. Chickens submitted for diagnosis were approximately more than 700 days old. Necropsy findings were proventriculitis, hemorrhagic lesions in duodenum and petechiae in lymphocytic tissues. The fourth strain was from a replacement pullet farm in Chiba Prefecture isolated in 2001 (JP/Chiba/BY103/01). The disease occurred in a flock of 21,000 birds. The flock was vaccinated with the live B1 strain in drinking water at 4 and 10 days of age, live B1 spray at 28 days and killed Ishii strain at 45 and 90 days of age. It was reported that the killed vaccines were injected by hired professional vaccination staff that travel from farm to farms. Six days after last vaccination, the disease occurred characterized by gasping, nervous symptoms, leg weakness, twisting of neck and greenish diarrhea. Mortality was around 10%. The fifth strain was from a layer farm in Ibaraki prefecture isolated in 2002 (JP/Chiba/BY7/02). The affected farm had a population of 125,000 birds (five houses of 25,000 birds) and affected flock was around 25,000 birds (one house). The flock was vaccinated with the live B1 strain in drinking water at 10 days of age, live B1 spray at 24 days, killed Ishii strain at 45 days, live B1 spray again at 60 days and killed Ishii strain again at 95 days. The disease occurred at 110 days of age characterized by gasping, swollen face and infectious bronchitis (IB)-like respiratory signs and 20% drop in egg production without significant mortalities. Necropsy findings were necrotic ovarian follicles and necrotic catarrhal inflammation of the intestines. The sixth strain was from a layer farm located in Ibaraki prefecture in 2002 (JP/Ibaraki/IS5/02). The affected farm had a population of approximately 200,000 birds and the affected flock was around 41,000 birds. The flock was vaccinated with the live B1 spray at 10 and 28 days old, killed Ishii strain at 45 days, live B1 spray again at 60 days and killed Ishii strain again at 90 days. The disease occurred at 336 days of age characterized by mild respiratory signs such as gasping, seven percent decrease in egg production with no marked mortalities. The seventh strain was recovered from dead birds from a replacement pullet farm in Ibaraki prefecture in 2002 (JP/Ibaraki/IS2/02) that were submitted for diagnosis. Total farm population was around 10,000 birds. The flock was vaccinated with the live B1 spray at 10 days of age. The disease occurred four days after vaccination characterized by severe depression. The eight strain was isolated from a layer farm in Fukushima prefecture (JP/Fukushima/NYF-3/02). The farm had a population of around 120,000 birds and affected flock was approximately 16,000 layers. The flock was vaccinated with the live B1 spray at 10 and 28 days of age, killed Ishii strain at 45 days, live B1 spray again at 60 days and killed Ishii strain again at 90 days. The disease occurred around 532 days of age characterized by mild gasping, increase in soft-shelled eggs and eight percent decrease in egg production. Mortalities were minimal and within production standards. The ninth strain was isolated from a layer farm in Miyagi prefecture in 2002 (JP/Miyagi/AGT/02). The flock was vaccinated with the live B1 in drinking water at 10 days of age, live B1 spray at 24 days, killed Ishii strain at 45 days, live B1 spray again at 60 days and killed Ishii strain at 95 days. It was informed that the flock was kept in multiple age houses (six different flocks in one house). Disease occurred at 250 days of age characterized by gasping, greenish white diarrhea and 70% decrease in egg production. No marked mortalities were observed.
