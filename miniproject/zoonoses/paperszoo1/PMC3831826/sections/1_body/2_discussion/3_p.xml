<p>Records of management and farm history showed that NDV strains used in this study originated from farms with diverse geographical, temporal and disease profiles. It is noteworthy to emphasize that these farms were thoroughly vaccinated against NDV but they were still infected with the disease. Moreover, deduced amino acid sequence of cleavage site of the F-gene of all field isolates revealed the motif 
 <sup>112</sup>R-R-Q-K-R-F
 <sup>117</sup> indicating that all strains were velogenic. This was further confirmed by MDT and ICPI tests. These indicate that in spite of the regular use of inactivated and live vaccines, velogenic ND may still occur in vaccinated flocks. However, some affected birds showed only mild respiratory symptoms without significant mortalities and severe pathological lesions. In most flocks, only mild to moderate decrease in egg production was observed.
