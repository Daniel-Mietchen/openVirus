<p>Comparison among the recent Japanese field strains showed that these strains have high F-gene homologies (99.7-100%), which may indicate that these strains may have been epidemiologically related. Computation of the over-all mean evolutionary distance of the F-gene of these recent strains showed a substitution rate of 1.0×10
 <sup>-3</sup> (s.e. 0.001) base substitution per site in the span of 3 years (1999–2002). In contrast, over-all F-gene mean evolutionary distance in all field strains (1969–2002) was 3.9×10
 <sup>-2</sup> (s.e. 0.010) base substitution per site. Interestingly, the partial NP gene showed an almost same substitution rate (1.0×10
 <sup>-3</sup> and 3.1×10
 <sup>-2</sup>) while partial L-gene had the lowest rate of substitution (zero and 2.0×10
 <sup>-2</sup>). However, direct comparison among these substitution rates is not feasible because of incomplete sequence data in NP and L-genes in this study. In other reports, it was shown that among the NDV proteins, the F and P-protein have the highest rate of change (0.78-1.98×10
 <sup>-3</sup> and 0.78-2.32×10
 <sup>-3</sup> substitution/site/year, respectively) while L and NP-proteins have the lowest rate of change (0.59-1.44×10
 <sup>-3</sup> and 0.45-1.50×10
 <sup>-3</sup> substitution/site/year, respectively) [

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). No positive selection sites were identified. This is in agreement with the findings of other authors that over-all NDV proteins are under strong purifying and negative selection pressures [
