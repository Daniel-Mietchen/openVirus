<p>The seven remaining field isolates belong to VIId (FigureÂ 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Genotype VII is the most predominant NDV genotype that is responsible for most outbreaks in East Asian countries including Taiwan, Korea and China since the 1980s, constituting the fourth pandemic [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Also in Japan, the isolation of genotype VII viruses was reported previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Therefore, this genotype has been the most predominant NDV in recent outbreaks in Japan.
