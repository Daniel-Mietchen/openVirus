<p>A point mutation in the F-gene may have resulted to neutralizing epitope variants. However whether this mutation was part of adaptive mechanism of NDVs to evade the immune response to be able to infect vaccinated chickens is unclear or whether this mutation was actually the effect of selective immune pressure exerted on ND viral particles as a consequence of vaccination is also unknown. To understand how wild NDVs infect vaccinated chickens, this identified mutation may be useful for future site-directed mutagenesis studies.</p>
