<p>The earliest VIId viruses on record infected chickens from South Korea in 1995 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). These strains include Kr-279/95, Kr-146/95 and Kr-077/95. On the other hand, the earliest VIId NDVs that were reported from Japan were JP/Tokyo/96 from chickens and JP/Ibaraki-ph/97 from a pheasant (99.0% similar to one another), which might indicate that the two strains were part of an ongoing outbreak. Remarkably, JP/Tokyo/96 shared 99.0% sequence identity with GX-1/97, which was isolated from a chicken flock in Western China, FJ-2/99 from a fowl from China and GD/1/98/Go from a goose from China (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Remarkably, GD/1/98/Go was 98.4-98.6% similar with JP/Ibaraki/SG106/99 and all the other VIId field strains in this study. These findings may indicate that wild birds have played a role in the circulation of VIId viruses across the Far East Asian countries (Korea, Japan and China). A comparison of homologies with contemporary isolates showed that JP/Ibaraki/SG106/99 and all the other VIId field strains were highly similar (99-100%) with JP/Ibaraki/00. Interestingly, a p.K78R amino acid substitution in the F-protein of this strain was reported previously [
