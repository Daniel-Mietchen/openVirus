<p>Analysis of genotypic and subgenotypic substitutions in the hypervariable region of the F-gene showed findings that were in conformity with the proposed theory of NDV genetic evolution [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It was proposed that subgenotype VIa from the second pandemic probably evolved to VIc by production of a crucial p.S107T substitution and VId by production of p.S93T substitution; VIIb evolved from VIb via a VII-specific p.V121I substitution; VIIb evolved to become VIIa and VIIc through p.K101R substitution; and VIIc evolved to become VIId by the production of additional p.I52V and p.F314Y substitution [
