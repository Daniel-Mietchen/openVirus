 <italic>.</italic> Individual amino acids at 72, 74, 75, 78, 79 and 343 and a stretch of amino acids from residues 157–171 were identified to be critical for both structures and functions of the F-gene. In this study, nucleotide substitution in one of the fusion inhibition and neutralizing epitope (p.K78R) was identified in all of the seven VIId strains. 13 point mutations were also identified in the variable region of the F-gene. Comparison with sequence data from reference strains (n = 180) showed that among these mutations, p.K4I were conserved only in NDV strains originating from Japan while p.L21P, p.I52V, p.K78R and p.R101K were conserved in strains originating from the Far East Asia (Japan, China and Taiwan). These substitutions maybe used as crude molecular markers of geographic origins of NDVs.
