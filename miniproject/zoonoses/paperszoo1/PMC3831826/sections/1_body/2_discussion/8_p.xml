<p>Phylogenetic analyses on JP/SM87/87 showed that this strain belongs to VId ND viruses (FigureÂ 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). VId viruses together with VIb and VIc were responsible for the third panzootic, which were reported to be spread by pigeons. This strain shared 100% sequence identity with JP/Tochigi/85 and JP/Ibaraki/85, which may indicate that JP/SM87/87 was a product of the ongoing outbreak.
