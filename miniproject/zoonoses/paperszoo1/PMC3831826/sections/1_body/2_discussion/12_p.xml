<p>Phylogenetic analyses using the nucleotide sequences of NP gene, L-gene, complete F-gene coding sequence and variable region of the F-gene resulted to almost similar tree topologies. Surprisingly phylogenetic analysis using NP gene resulted to a clearer differentiation among field strains. These may indicate that NP and L-genes may be alternative methods to characterize NDVs given that like the F-gene, these genes are also involved in the dynamics of viral virulence, play important functional roles in the NDV replication cycle; and are also characterized by regions with high conservation necessary to identify homologies among strains but also characterized by regions with high variations necessary to identify specific variations between strains. Phylogenetic analysis of NP and L-genes in conjunction with the F-gene may also help detect possible natural or artificial recombination events.</p>
