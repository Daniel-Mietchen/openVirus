<p>ND remains a serious threat to commercial poultry even though intensive vaccination programs are being applied. In Japan, occasional outbreaks have been reported in commercial poultry mostly due to improper vaccination, immunosuppression due to infectious and non-infectious causes, and challenge by more velogenic viruses [

Knowing the genetic characteristics of wild strains of NDV affecting vaccinated poultry might give important insights on the possible origins, transmission mechanisms and infection routes of these viruses. Molecular and phylogenetic studies like this are important since these might lead to better understanding on how to prevent, control and manage future ND cases.
