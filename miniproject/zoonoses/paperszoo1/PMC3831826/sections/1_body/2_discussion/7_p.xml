<p>Phylogenetic analyses on the field strains using the variable region of the F-gene (47–421 nt) revealed that JP/Osaka/2440/69 belongs to genotype VIa (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). As reported previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], genotype VIa was responsible for the second ND panzootic that started in the Middle East during the 1960s and then spread to most countries around the world as a result of enormous trade and importation of captive caged birds and technological advances in air transportation. Interestingly, this isolate shared 100% sequence identity with JP/Narashino/68, which was isolated from a Japanese Blue Magpie. It is interesting to note that nucleotide sequence identity of Iraq/AG-68 was 98.5% similar while strains Kuwait/256/68, Lebanon/70 and Israel/70 were 98.7-99.2% similar with these Japanese strains. It is possible that JP/Narashino/68 was a foreign strain that was introduced to Japan from wild birds. JP/Narashino/68 and/or its progenitor might have been then spread to domestic chickens in Japan, leading to the isolation of JP/Osaka/2440/69 (100% similar) (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).
