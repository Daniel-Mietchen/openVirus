<p>Molecular characterization of NDV strains mostly considered the F-gene with particular emphasis given on the variable region (47–421 nt) because it codes for a number of functionally important structures such as signal peptide [amino acid (aa) 1–31], cleavage activation sequence (aa 112–116), portion of the fusion inducing hydrophobic region (aa 117–142) and it is characterized by both variable and conserved regions [
