<p>At present, limited molecular epidemiological data are available regarding the causes of ND outbreaks in vaccinated poultry farms. Knowing the molecular characteristics of NDV strains affecting commercial poultry in spite of vaccination might give important insights on the possible origins and genetic nature of these viruses which may help in formulating more effective ND prevention and control strategies. In addition, no studies have been performed yet investigating the classification of Japanese NDVs at the subgenotype level and if recombination events occur in Japanese NDVs. Knowing the subgenotype classification of NDVs and occurrence of recombination events are essential since these may provide a more direct understanding on the epidemiological relationship of Japanese NDVs with other strains from different parts of the world, which may help further elucidate the mechanisms of global and transcontinental dynamics of transmission and spread of this disease. Therefore in the present study, field strains of NDVs with different geographical and temporal distribution patterns that were isolated from vaccinated commercial poultry flocks in non-epidemic areas of Japan were analyzed. Sequence data were extensively compared with 180 NDV strains from different parts of the world from different time periods.</p>
