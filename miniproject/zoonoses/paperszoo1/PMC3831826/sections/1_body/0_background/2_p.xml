<p>NDV is an enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus with a helical morphology. Its genome has six open reading frames (ORF) in the order of 3′-NP-P-M-F-HN-L-5′. These genes encode for the following proteins: nucleoprotein (NP), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (L) respectively. During P-gene transcription, two additional non-structural proteins, the V and the W proteins, are also generated through RNA editing [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Class I NDVs, which have a genomic size of 15,198 nucleotides [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], are occasionally isolated from wild aquatic birds and domestic poultry and are mostly avirulent to chickens. Class II NDVs comprise the majority of virulent NDV strains and some avirulent NDV strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Class II NDVs are further subdivided into 11 genotypes (I-XI) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Early sublineages of Class II NDVs that occurred before the 1960s (genotypes I to IV) have a genomic size of 15,186 nucleotides, whereas late Class II NDV sublineages (genotypes VI to XI) have a genomic size of 15,192 nucleotides. Class II NDVs under genotype VI and VII are further subdivided into eight (a-h) subgenotypes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] proposed the creation of lineages and sublineages in classifying NDVs to make it possible to rapidly type future virus isolates on the basis of their nucleotide sequence and make inferences about their origins. They proposed that NDVs could be divided into six broadly distinct groups (lineages 1 to 6), where lineages 3 and 4 were further subdivided into four sublineages (a to d) and lineage 5 was further subdivided into 5 sublineages (a to e). Genotypes I and II correspond to lineage 1 and 2, while genotype III corresponds to sublineage 3a; genotype IV to sublineage 3b; genotype V to sublineage 3c; genotype VIII to sublineage 3d; genotype VIa and VIe to sublineage 4a; genotypes VIb, VIc and VId to sublineages 4b, 4c and 4d; genotypes VIIa, VIIb, VIIc and VIId to sublineages 5a, 5b, 5c and 5d; 5e to previously characterized genotype VII NDVs from Taiwan and a quarantine isolate in UK that formed a separate cluster from other lineage 5 NDVs; and lineage 6 represents a new NDV genogroup. Recently a novel lineage, provisionally named lineage 7 was reported in West and Central Africa [
