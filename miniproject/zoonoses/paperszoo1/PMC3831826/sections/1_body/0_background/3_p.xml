<p>Different NDV strains vary greatly in pathogenicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. NDV isolates can be broadly grouped into five pathotypes on the basis of clinical signs in infected chickens. ND may manifest as viscerotropic velogenic, neurotropic velogenic, mesogenic, lentogenic and asymptomatic enteric [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Other factors, such as host species, host immune status and age, environmental stress, coinfection with other organisms, viral dose and route of exposure, may also influence the severity of the disease [
