<p>This investigation showed that all field isolates from vaccinated commercial poultry were part of much bigger outbreaks affecting not only provinces or regions but even entire continents. To determine how commercial farms are being infected with NDV, the epidemiology of NDV in the whole of Japan and parts of Far East Asia was analyzed. This study showed that Japanese poultry was affected by at least four pandemics and that outbreaks were mostly characterized by co-circulation of genetically distinct virus lineages that were consistent with the predominant virus genotype circulating in a particular time period. Moreover, no distinct transition was observed from each pandemic. Aside from involvement of local strains, ND outbreaks in Japan were mostly due to virus transmission from infected wild birds either by international bird trade or migration patterns.</p>
