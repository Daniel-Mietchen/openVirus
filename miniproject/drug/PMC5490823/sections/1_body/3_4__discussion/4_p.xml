<p>We tested CDV, another drug with known activity against i.v. challenge with Ad, in the i.n. challenge model. As with VGCV, we found that prophylactic treatment with CDV mitigated body weight loss and decreased the virus burden in the lungs of Ad6-infected hamsters. However, CDV was less active than VGCV, even though we gave a very high, slightly toxic dose of the drug (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-09-00147-f006">Figure 6</xref>). While CDV-treatment significantly decreased body weight loss, the decrease in the virus burden in the lungs was not statistically significant, and the treatment did not mitigate the gross pathology observed in the lungs. Although we did not do a direct, head-to-head comparison of the two compounds, these data confirm our previous observation with the i.v. model that VGCV is more active against Ad infection.
