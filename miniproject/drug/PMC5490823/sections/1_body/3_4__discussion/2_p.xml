<p>Thus far, we and others have shown that several drugs were active against i.v. Ad5 infection [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, none of these drugs was effective against respiratory infection with the virus. The presumed reason for this inefficacy is that even in CP-treated animals, much of the pathology after intranasal infection with Ad5 is the result of the immune response to the input virus, inasmuch as we showed that a replication-defective, Ad5-based vector was nearly as pathogenic as Ad5. With the lower LD
 <sub>50</sub> of Ad6, we could decrease the input bolus of the challenge virus; and thus more of the observed pathology is caused by actual Ad replication and cytopathic effect. Consistent with this hypothesis, VGCV treatment of hamsters challenged intranasally with Ad6 significantly decreased body weight loss, inhibited the replication of Ad6 in the lungs, and mitigated the pathogenic effects of Ad6. This is the first time that we showed that an antiviral drug inhibits the replication of a human Ad in the lungs of immunosuppressed hamsters, and that this inhibition results in decreased morbidity.
