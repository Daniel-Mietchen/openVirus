<p>In some instances, Ad infection of healthy adults can cause serious illness; certain species D Ads cause epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, which can result even in blindness. Infection with some species B Ads is endemic among military recruits, causing severe acute respiratory disease (for Ad pathology, see [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). However, it is immunocompromised patients who suffer the most severe consequences of Ad infection. The defective immune systems of these patients cannot eliminate the virus, and thus the infection can lead to a serious, often life-threatening multi-organ illness. Pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients are especially threatened. The incidence of Ad infection is between 3% and 47% for these patients, and the mortality rate is very high [
