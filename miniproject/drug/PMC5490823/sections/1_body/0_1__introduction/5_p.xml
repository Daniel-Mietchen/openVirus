<p>Previously, we have shown that Ad6 (HAdV-C6), another species C human Ad, is capable of replicating in Syrian hamsters, and that it is more pathogenic than Ad5 [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. HAdV-C5 and C6 are 99% identical at the nucleotide level. However, there are important differences in the length of fiber shaft and the sequence of the hexon hypervariable regions that may influence the tropism and resulting pathogenicity of these viruses [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Here, we show that VGCV, and to a lesser extent CDV, are capable of inhibiting Ad6 replication and mitigating Ad6-induced pathology. For the first time, we also show that a drug is effective against respiratory challenge with Ad.
