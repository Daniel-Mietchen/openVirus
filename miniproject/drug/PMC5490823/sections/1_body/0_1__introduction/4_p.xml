<p>The development of such drugs was hampered by the lack of an adequate animal model to test their efficacy. To address this deficiency, we developed an animal model based on the permissive Syrian hamsters (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]), which is amenable for in vivo studies to test the efficacy of anti-adenoviral compounds [

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To mimic disseminated Ad infection in immunocompromised patients, the animals are immunosuppressed by cyclophosphamide [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and then are infected intravenously (i.v.) with Ad5. This route of challenge leads to rapid Ad replication in multiple organs, most significantly in the liver [

 <xref rid="B30-viruses-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The replication of the virus will lead to high virus burden and hepatocellular necrosis, and the animals will present with quantifiable pathology (mortality, body weight loss, elevation of serum transaminase levels, microscopic pathology) [

 <xref rid="B31-viruses-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], similarly to immunocompromised patients with advanced disseminated multi-organ Ad infections. We have demonstrated that the symptoms of Ad5 infection in hamsters can be mitigated or even reversed with the use of BCV [

 <xref rid="B26-viruses-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], valganciclovir (VGCV) [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], or CDV [
