<p>There were nine treatment-related deaths in the study, one in the Ad5-infected vehicle-treated group and eight in the Ad6-infected vehicle-treated group (

VGCV treatment prevented mortality in both the Ad5- and Ad6-infected VGCV-treated groups, and no deaths occurred in either of the uninfected groups. Hamsters in both of the Ad-infected untreated groups were losing weight from the onset of the study (
