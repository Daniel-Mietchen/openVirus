<p>Similarly to female hamsters, there were no treatment-related deaths in the study. Hamsters in the Ad6-infected groups lost weight with the same kinetics as Ad6-infected females (

At 3 days post challenge, three of the five sacrificed animals in the Ad6-Vehicle group presented with lung pathology (red mottled discoloration), while only one of the five Ad6-infected VGCV-treated hamsters displayed such pathology. At 7 days post challenge, all of the A6-infected vehicle-treated hamsters showed lung pathology. The pathology for the Ad6-infected VGCV-treated group was less severe, and no significant findings were noted for two of the 10 hamsters in this group. No significant lesions were noted in other organs for any of the animals at either sacrifice time point.
