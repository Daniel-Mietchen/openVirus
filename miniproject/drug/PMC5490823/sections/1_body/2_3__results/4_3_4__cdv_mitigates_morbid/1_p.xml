<p>CDV is another compound that is known to be active in the hamster model after i.v. challenge with Ad5 [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To assess whether CDV is effective against respiratory challenge with Ad6, we treated i.n.-infected hamsters with the drug. We used the known effective dose (37 mg/kg i.p. followed by 20 mg/kg doses three times weekly), starting the treatment one day before challenge. There were no treatment-related deaths in the study. Hamsters in the Ad6-infected groups were losing weight from the onset of the study (
