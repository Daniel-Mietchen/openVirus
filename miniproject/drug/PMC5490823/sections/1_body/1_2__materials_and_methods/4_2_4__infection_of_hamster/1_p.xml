<p>The animals were immunosuppressed using cyclophosphamide (CP) as described before [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. CP was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) at a dose of 140 mg/kg, and then at a dose of 100 mg/kg twice weekly for the duration of the study. After three injections of CP, Ad5 or Ad6 was injected i.v. via the jugular vein at a dose of 2 × 10
 <sup>11</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU)/kg for Ad5 or 2 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> PFU/kg for Ad6 in 200 μL of PBS under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. For the i.n. challenge, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane, and 1 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> PFU/kg of Ad6 in 100 μL of PBS was pipetted into the nostrils. For both routes of administration, control animals received PBS.
