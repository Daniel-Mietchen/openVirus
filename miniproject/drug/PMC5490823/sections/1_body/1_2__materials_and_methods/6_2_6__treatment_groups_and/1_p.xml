<p>For all experiments, there were groups infected with Ad5 or Ad6 that were either left untreated or were treated with VGCV or CDV. Uninfected (injected with virus vehicle only) groups that were treated with a drug or drug vehicle served as controls. The animals were randomized by body weight before the start of the study. All hamsters were observed and weighed daily. For the prophylactic studies, each group consisted of 15 hamsters. Five hamsters of each group were designated to be sacrificed at 5 days (for the i.v. challenge) or at 3 days (for the i.n. challenge) post Ad challenge. At necropsy, liver, lungs, and kidney (for the i.v. challenge) or lungs only (for the i.n. challenge) were collected. The virus was extracted from the collected organs and was quantified by 50% Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) assay in HEK-293 cells [

Serum was collected and assayed for liver transaminase levels (i.v. challenge only). The remaining 10 hamsters in each group were used for a survival study. Besides animals judged moribund by observation, we sacrificed all hamsters that lost more than 20% of their original body weight. The surviving hamsters were sacrificed at 14 days (i.v. experiment) or at 7 or 10 days (i.n. experiment) post challenge. For the therapeutic study, there were 10 hamsters in each group, and the study was conducted as a survival experiment, as described above.
