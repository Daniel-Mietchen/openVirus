<p>The optimization model is driven by a willingness-to-travel model, which was estimated from NHTS data. The nature and resolution of available data led to several simplifying assumptions. After fitting several decaying functions to the data, we chose a simple model that considers only the distance between oneâ€™s home ZIP code area and the nearest pharmacy ZIP code area, rather than, for example, a more complex gravity model that incorporates the attractiveness of a store (

 </xref> ). The national data did not specify health-related travel patterns. Texas NHTS data had coarser mileage bins, and represented only 1% of the nation-wide person-trips. Thus, we used national-scale data on all available travel categories (to earn a living, family/personal business, school/church, social/recreational, and miscellaneous), and included only travel by privately operated vehicles (because of the sparsity of data on public transportation and bicycles). We also approximated home ZIP code area distances to pharmacy ZIP code area distances by using great circle distances between the ZIP code centroids, rather than road travel distances between their street addresses, which can underestimate the distance an individual must travel. Finally, we approximated the underinsured and small ZIP code area populations by using methods described in the Data section.
