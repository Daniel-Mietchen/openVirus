<p>The primary control measures for pandemic influenza are antiviral medications and vaccines (

 </xref> ), as well as nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing measures, school closures, and hygienic precautions ( 
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>10</italic>
 </xref> ). Although the efficacy of influenza vaccines depends on factors such as patient age and virus type/subtype ( 
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>11</italic>
 </xref> ), these vaccines are arguably the best intervention strategy ( 
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>1</italic>
 </xref> ). However, because development and deployment of effective vaccines for a new influenza virus may take several months (

 </xref> ), antiviral drugs and nonpharmaceutical interventions are particularly critical for early pandemic control.
