<p>The optimization model we used identifies ZIP code areas for pharmacy-based distribution of SNS and state-cache antiviral drugs to maximize access in the target population (either underinsured or entire population). It is a facility-location type model (

We estimated this quantity by using our willingness-to-travel model for the distance between the home ZIP code centroid and pharmacy ZIP code centroid. For the distance to a pharmacy within the home ZIP code area, we used a correction factor based on the size of the ZIP code area (
