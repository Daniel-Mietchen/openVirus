<p>We considered 3 types of objective functions, all of which focus exclusively on the underinsured population in Texas: maximizing statewide access, maximizing access in small ZIP code areas (i.e., ZIP code areas with &lt;1,000 underinsured persons), and a hybrid that combines the first 2 objectives. For our hybrid optimization model, we first specified a percentage of all dispensing points to focus on small ZIP code areas ( 
 <italic>P</italic> ). Second, we optimized 
 <italic>P</italic> of all dispensing points solely for access in small ZIP code areas and recorded the access achieved in small ZIP code areas ( 
 <italic>A
  <sub>s</sub>
 </italic> ). Third, we started over and optimized all dispensing points by using the statewide objective function with the added constraint that the solution must achieve a minimum of 0.95 
 <italic>A
  <sub>s</sub>
 </italic> access in small ZIP code areas. This method simultaneously achieves near maximal coverage statewide and in small ZIP code areas.
