<p>We used National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data for 2009 ( 
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref> ) to estimate the distances persons are willing to travel in Texas to obtain antiviral drugs sufficient for a course of treatment during an influenza pandemic (model described below). We created a willingness-to-travel model, which follows an exponentially decaying distribution, by fitting the model to national-scale NHTS data for privately operated vehicle travel ( 
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>27</italic>
 </xref> ) ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> ). This included ≈330,000 person trips (83% of all person trips in the database), totaling 3.3 million miles, including ≈30,000 person trips originating in Texas. We made the simplifying assumption that health care–seeking behavior in Texas during an influenza pandemic will resemble national willingness to travel by privately operated vehicle for work, school, family, and social reasons. Although there are probably major differences in these estimates, we believe that this model conservatively underestimates actual accessibility of pharmacies during a pandemic.
