<p>However, the major chains did not reach the underinsured populations in the small ZIP code areas, even under the hybrid optimization that explicitly targets these hard-to-reach populations ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> , panel A). Independent pharmacies are essential to bridging this gap in coverage. The maximum access achieved by a 2-chain combination in small ZIP code areas is only 33% (Brookshire and Walmart) ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> ). Under the hybrid objective, optimized networks with &lt;500 dispensing points yield solutions for all major pharmacy chains plus independents that provided slightly lower statewide accessibility than the corresponding solutions for major chains ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> , panel B), in exchange for higher coverage in small ZIP code areas ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> , panel A). Of the 1,023 ZIP code areas with â‰¥1 pharmacy, 271 have only independent pharmacies. Of these pharmacies, 167 are in small ZIP code areas, and were typically selected when optimizing for access in small ZIP code areas, but not when optimizing for access statewide (
