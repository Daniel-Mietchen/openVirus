<p>A state might opt to limit the number of chains in the distribution network to simplify logistics. The pharmacy chains eligible for participation in Texas include Brookshire, Costco, CVS, HEB, Kmart, Kroger, Randalls, Sam’s Club, Target, Tom Thumb, United, Walgreens, Walmart, and independent retail pharmacies (henceforth independents). During the 2009 influenza pandemic, the Texas DSHS distributed antiviral drugs from the SNS and state cache through 6 major chains (Brookshire, HEB, Kroger, United, Walgreens, and Walmart), and independents. When we restricted the optimization to a few major chains, the resulting networks still achieved broad statewide coverage (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> ). For example, Walgreens alone was expected to achieve ≈75% coverage if it dispenses in all of its 490 ZIP code areas; CVS and Walmart followed close behind (located in 422 and 372 ZIP code areas, respectively). These 3 chains have the greatest presence in the state ( 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> ), but have highly overlapping geographic areas. Broad accessibility can also be achieved through a combination of smaller chains with geographic complementarity, for example, HEB and Kroger (in 189 and 167 ZIP code areas, respectively). Walgreens and Walmart overlap over half of their ZIP code areas (256), whereas HEB and Kroger overlap in only 30 ZIP code areas. However, the number of ZIP code areas alone is not predictive of access. For example, Brookshire has almost as many stores as Target (in 118 and 127 ZIP code areas, respectively), yet provides considerably less statewide access alone and in combination with other stores.
