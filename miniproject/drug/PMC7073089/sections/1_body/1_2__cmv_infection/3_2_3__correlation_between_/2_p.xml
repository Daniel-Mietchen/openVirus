<p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most common and devastating brain tumors in adults [
 <xref rid="B52-ijms-21-01376" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Previous studies showed that some malignant GBMs express the CMV-associated proteins including the immediately early gene-1 product and the lower matrix phosphoprotein 65 (pp65) which is encoded by unique long 83 (UL83) gene, and suggested that HCMV may play an active role in glioma pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="B53-ijms-21-01376" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. HCMV can induce GBM formation in vitro and in xenograft models. Detection of HCMV in GBM isolated from patients suggested viruses may either drive tumorigenesis or reactivate these tumors silently; however, there is no definite evidence on its ubiquity and its role in tumor formation [
 <xref rid="B54-ijms-21-01376" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In animal studies, murine CMV (MCMV) has been found to potentiate GBM growth in mice by increasing pericyte recruitment and angiogenesis because the set of proteins (secretome) secreted by MCMV-infected cells was changed [
