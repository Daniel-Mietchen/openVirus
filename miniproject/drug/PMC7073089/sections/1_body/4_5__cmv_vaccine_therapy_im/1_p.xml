<p>An effective vaccine would be highly valuable in reducing human morbidity and mortality in that many diseases and complications are associated with CMV infections. The development of a safe and efficacious CMV vaccine therapy or immune therapy is paramount to the public health. However, there is still no vaccine approved for CMV [

Activation of the immune system against tumor cells based on vaccine therapy/immunotherapy contribute to facilitate survival and suppress tumors. CMV has emerged as an immunologic target in GBM if tumor cells have been shown to express the CMV-associated proteins immediately early protein-1 and pp65 [
