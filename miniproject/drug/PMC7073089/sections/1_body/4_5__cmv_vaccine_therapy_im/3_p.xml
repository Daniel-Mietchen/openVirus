<p>Batich et al. evaluated pp65-specific cellular responses following dose-intensified temozolomide (DI-TMZ) with pp65- DCs and determined the effects on long-term progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) [

In this small randomized pilot trial, 11 patients with GBM received DI-TMZ and at least three vaccines of pp65 lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein mRNA-pulsed DCs mixed with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factors (GM-CSF) each cycle. They have previously demonstrated that targeting cytomegalovirus pp65 using DC can extend survival. Additionally, DI-TMZ and adjuvant GM-CSF induced tumor-specific immune responses in patients with GBM in another study. In this study, the results showed that pp65 cellular responses significantly increased following DI-TMZ cycle 1 and three doses of pp65-DCs. After DI-TMZ, the proportion and proliferation of regulatory T (Treg) cells were increased and continued to elevate in the following cycles. Median PFS and OS were 25.3 months and 41.1 months exceeding survival time, respectively. Though Treg cells were increased following DI-TMZ, patients receiving pp65-DCs demonstrated long-term PFS and OS, confirming their prior studies targeting CMV in GBM [
