<p>External guide sequences (EGSs), transcription activator-like effectors nucleases (TALENs) and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs)/Cas9 nuclease system potentially function as effective therapeutic approaches to treat brain diseases associated with CMV infections through designing a specific DNA or RNA sequence that target genes required for viral growth. Though CRISPR/Cas9 and TALENs are both promisingly effective approaches to limit HCMV replication, for successfully used in clinical application, it is required to have accurate modification of viral genomes for avoiding off-target mutation in humans.</p>
