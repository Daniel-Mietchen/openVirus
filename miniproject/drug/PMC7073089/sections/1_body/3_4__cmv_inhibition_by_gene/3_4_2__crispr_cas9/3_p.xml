<p>Gergen et al. designed two CRISPR/Cas9 systems which respectively contain three sgRNAs to target the HCMV UL122/123 gene critical for the regulation of lytic replication and reactivation from latency [

The singleplex strategy caused 50% of insertions and/or deletions (indels) in the viral genome were shown in U-251 MG cells, resulting in a decrease of immediately early protein production. The multiplex strategy cleaved 90% the immediate early gene and thereby inhibited their expression. The results revealed that viral genome replication and late protein expression were reduced by 90%. Hence, the multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 was able to target the HCMV UL122/123 gene specifically and inhibit viral replication efficiently [
