<p>Van Diemen et al. set out to combat both productive and latent HCMV infections using CRISPR/Cas9 to target genes essential for virus growth in cell culture [

They showed more effective inhibition of HCMV replication by targeting sgRNAs to essential viral genes UL57 and UL70 than the nonessential genes US7 and US11. The results indicated that the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be effectively targeted HCMV genomes as a potent prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral agent that may be used to block CMV replication and remove latent viruses. These new insights may allow the design of effective CRISPR/Cas9 to target HCMV during both productive and latent infections [
