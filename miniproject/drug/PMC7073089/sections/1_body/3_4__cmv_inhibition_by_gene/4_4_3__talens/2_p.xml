<p>Chen et al. constructed three pairs of TALEN plasmids (MCMV1-2, 3-4, and 5-6) to target the MCMV M80 and M80.5 overlapping (M80/80.5) sequence essential for capsid assembly and further virion synthesis to test their efficacy in inhibiting MCMV growth [

In cell culture, the plasmids could specifically target the M80/80.5 sequence and effectively block lytic replication either using lipofectamine or a specific lipoid NKS11 as transfection reagents when TALEN plasmid transfection was prior to the MCMV infection. In animal studies, the most specific pairs of TALEN plasmids (MCMV3-4) demonstrated its capacity to inhibit the replication and gene expression of latent MCMV in immunocompetent mice using nontoxic NKS11 as transfection reagents. By the quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, the injection of MCMV3-4 plasmids led to more significant reduction than the controls in the DNA copy number level of the immediately early gene-1 which was crucial to reactivate viruses from latency. The results suggested that TALENs potentially provided an effective approach to remove latent viruses in animals [
