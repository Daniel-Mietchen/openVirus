<p>Letermovir has been approved by the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the prophylaxis of CMV infections in patients [
 <xref rid="B62-ijms-21-01376" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The drug was tested in CMV infected patients and may be useful for other patients who had organ transplantation or human immunodeficient virus (HIV) infections [
 <xref rid="B63-ijms-21-01376" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. It has been clinically applied for CMV prophylaxis or treatment in hematopoietic stem cell recipients, thoracic organ recipients and lung transplantation recipients [

 <xref rid="B65-ijms-21-01376" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,
 <xref rid="B66-ijms-21-01376" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Letermovir has several advantages over conventional CMV antiviral agents such as administration orally, mild toxicity without myelotoxicity and nephrotoxicity [

 <xref rid="B68-ijms-21-01376" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], and targeting of the CMV terminase complex instead of CMV DNA polymerase without the possibility of cross-resistance with existing anti-CMV drugs [
 <xref rid="B68-ijms-21-01376" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Conventional anti-CMV drugs which target the UL54 DNA polymerase are limited in safety and efficacy because of their nephrotoxicity and viral resistance. In addition to less toxicity for kidney and bone marrow, the breakthrough of CMV treatment with letermovir is that it targets the CMV terminase complex rather than DNA polymerase, so that there is no risk to induce cross-resistance with current anti-CMV drugs. Consequently, letermovir is also promising to be used in the treatment of brain diseases associated with CMV infections.
