<p>Maribavir is a developing anti-HCMV compound which can be given orally. The drug targets the viral kinase UL97 which is crucial for the formation of viral teguments and assembly complexes for virion releasing [

However, it is not recommended to co-administer maribavir and ganciclovir because maribavir is an inhibitor of the UL97 enzyme which is needed for the anabolism of ganciclovir. Maribavir is commonly used when patients present with drug resistance (e.g., ganciclovir and valganciclovir) [

 <xref rid="B69-ijms-21-01376" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Additionally, it is likely to be a substitute for conventional anti-HCMV compounds because of its reduced haematotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, compared with ganciclovir and valganciclovir [
