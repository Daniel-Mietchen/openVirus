<p>CMV life cycle begins as a virion attaches specific receptors on the host cell surface. For a lytic pathway, following attachment of viral envelope glycoproteins to host cell membrane receptors, the virions enter host cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis and membrane fusion. The viral capsid breaks down to release DNA genome to take over host enzyme systems to make new virions. CMV express lytic genes to demonstrate a symptomatic infection in hosts [

In this pathway, CMV can exist in host cells persistently to have a latent infection, referring as the episomal latency in which viral DNA is episomal or tethered to host cell chromosomes in linear or lariat structures. The long-term latency in hosts is usually asymptomatic, though the primary infection is not necessarily asymptomatic. When CMV are stimulated by stresses or their hostâ€™s immune system is suppressed, the dormant viruses can reactivate to start producing viral progeny to cause illness, denoted as the lytic life cycle [

The reactivation of latent CMV can damage tissues to lead to organ diseases and may trigger indirect immunomodulatory effects to cause detrimental outcomes including increased mortality of patients and induction of graft rejection in patients undergoing organ transplantation [
