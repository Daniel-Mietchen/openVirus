<p>There are nine distinct human herpesvirus (HHV) species known to cause human diseases, including herpes simplex virus-1(HSV-1, HHV-1), herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2, HHV-2), varicella zoster virus (VZV, HHV-3), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, HHV-4), cytomegalovirus (CMV, HHV-5), roseolovirus (HHV-6A, HHV-6B, HHV-7), and Kaposiâ€™s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, HHV-8) [

 <italic>Herpesvirus</italic> in the family Herpesviridae (subfamily Betaherpesvirinae), and in the order Herpesvirales. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), the most studied CMV with a double-stranded DNA genome of about 230 kb, consists of envelope, tegument, capsid, and DNA core from outside to inside. Like all herpesviruses, HCMV encodes its genes in a highly coordinated transcriptional cascade and HCMV genes are expressed in an order as follows: (1) Immediate early genes, which encode regulatory proteins; (2) early genes, which encode enzymes for viral DNA replication; (3) late genes, which encode structural proteins for infectious viral particles (virions) assembly. HCMV may cause mild or subclinical diseases in healthy and immunocompetent adults; however, it can result in opportunistic infections in individuals whose immune system is compromised or immature [
