<p id="Par15">Previous studies have indicated LAM, LDT and TDF have great efficacy on decreasing MTCT rate of HBV. At first, we integrated RCTs with non-RCTs to perform an overcalled Bayesian network analysis for the comparisons among the above three agents. To avoid the risk of bias of individual agent effect on the results, we conducted the following meta-analysis to descript the efficacy of different agents initiated in different trimesters on preventing HBV vertical transmission. The pooled network plots were provided in Fig. S3. Compared to untreated group, LAM, LDT and TDF all had significant improvement to reduce HBV transmission (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Though no agent showed significant efficacy different from others (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), a strong trend toward significance was found in telbivudine and tenofovir, of which had the highest probability of being ranked the first- or second-best treatment for reducing MTCT of HBV (Figs. S4, S5). In addition, the detailed analysis indicated that the agents initiated either prior gestation 28 week or during 28–32 week were superior than control group on reducing MTCT rates, but no agent was clearly superior to others (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).
