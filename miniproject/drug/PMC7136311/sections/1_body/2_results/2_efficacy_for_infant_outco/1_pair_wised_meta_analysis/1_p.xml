<p id="Par12">We performed meta-analysis among pure RCTs and non-RCTs respectively, to obtain their specific grade evidence. Then we incorporated RCTs with non-RCTs data together for a pooled meta-analysis to find out the biased impact of RCTs or non-RCTs on the meta-analysis in the real world. We focused on the comparisons of following timing groups, including gestation ~ 28 weeks and gestation 28–32 weeks, and aimed to get a clear investigation about the optimal initial time point of AVT in reducing MTCT.</p>
