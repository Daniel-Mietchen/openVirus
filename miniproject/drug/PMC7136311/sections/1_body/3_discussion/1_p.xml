<p id="Par23">In this multiple-treatments meta-analysis of RCTs and nRCTs studies for the prevention of HBV viral MTCT, a comprehensive literature search was conducted with no restriction of publication date to ensure maximum coverage of existing studies. Two independent reviewers, Feng and Wu, conducted this research and included conference proceedings. The assessment of eligibility and data extraction were also performed in duplication by two independent reviewers. We subsequently contacted the authors of 5 other studies in which timing of agent application crossed gestation 28 weeks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], to obtain necessary data unable to get in original papers. However, we were not able to obtain required data from 3 studies that AVT was given on the timing of 24–32 and 24–36 week [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. We used a per-protocol analysis with a random-effects model to minimize the risk of MTCT that would be overestimated. Finally, we extracted and pooled maternal and infant outcomes, if reported, to provide a summary of safety data.
