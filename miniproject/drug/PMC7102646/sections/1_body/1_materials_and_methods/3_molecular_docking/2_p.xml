 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6NUR" id="ir0015" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6NUR</ext-link>) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural protein 5B (NS5B) RdRp (PDB ID: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:2XI3" id="ir0020" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">2XI3</ext-link>) were used as docking targets for comparison. A total of 24 compounds were tested against SARS-CoV-2, SARS HCoV, and HCV NS5B RdRps, namely, the four physiological nucleotides (GTP, UTP, CTP, and ATP), five approved drugs against different viral RdRps (Galidesivir, Remdesivir, Tenofovir, Sofosbuvir, and Ribavirin), 13 compounds currently in clinical trials against HCV NS5B RdRp (Uprifosbuvir, Setrobuvir, Balaprevir, MK0608, R7128, IDX-184, 2â€²C-methylcytidine, BMS-986094, YAK, PSI-6130, PSI-6206, R1479, and Valopectibine), and two negative control compounds that did not have affinity toward RdRp (Cinnamaldehyde and Thymoquinone). All of the compounds were prepared to be optimized in their active forms in physiological conditions [
