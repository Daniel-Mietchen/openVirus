<p id="p0045">The newly-emerged SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide gene (NC_045512.2) was retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nucleotide database [
 <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A homology model for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp was built using the Swiss Model web server [
 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We used the SARS HCoV solved structure (PDB ID: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6NUR" id="ir0010" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6NUR</ext-link>, chain A) as a template for building our model since it was the most sequelogous solved structure (97.08% sequence identity) to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. 6NUR is a SARS HCoV non-structural protein 12 (nsp12) solved structure (cryo-electron microscopy) with 3.1 Å resolution, which was deposited in the protein data bank in 2019 [
 <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Two web servers were used to examine the model: the MolProbity web server of Duke University, and the Structure Analysis and Verification Server (SAVES) of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) [
 <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Various types of software were used to judge the validity of the model, such as PROCHECK [
 <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], Verify 3D [
 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], PROVE [
 <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and ERRAT [
 <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], in addition to the Ramachandran plot of the MolProbity web server. After validation, the model was optimized (classical mechanical, using the MM3 force field) with assistance from the computational chemistry workspace SCIGRESS of Fujitsu [
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Model minimization was performed after the addition of missed hydrogen atoms to prepare for the docking study [
