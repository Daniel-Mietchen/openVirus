<p id="p0030">Based on its nucleotide sequences, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of 
 <italic>Betacoronaviruses,</italic> such as the SARS and MERS HCoVs [
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>]. Currently, seven different strains of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been reported, including the 229E and NL63 strains of HCoVs (
 <italic>Alphacoronaviruses</italic>), and the OC43, HKU1, SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 HCoVs (
 <italic>Betacoronaviruses</italic>) [

 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The SARS and MERS HCoVs are the most well-known and aggressive strains of coronaviruses, each causing approximately 800 deaths. According to the WHO, the mortality rates for SARS and MERS HCoV are 10% and 36%, respectively. [

 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>]. The next few months will reveal the mortality of the new virus; a nearly 4.1% mortality rate for a flanking viral spread may mean millions of deaths.
