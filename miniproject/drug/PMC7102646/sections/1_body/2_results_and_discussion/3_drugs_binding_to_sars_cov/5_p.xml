<p id="p0090">For the approved drug Ribavirin, the only interactions established upon docking were the 13H-bonds with W508, Y510, K512, C513, D514, N582, D651 (3), A653 (3), and W691 of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The same pattern was found for Tenofovir, but with a reduced number of H-bonds (5H-bonds with W508, D652, A653, W691, and E702), which was reflected in the binding energy values (−7.8 and −6.9 kcal/mol for Ribavirin and Tenofovir, respectively). On the other hand, Sofosbuvir formed 7H-bonds (W508 (3), K512 (2), A653, and W691) and two hydrophobic contacts (Y510 and D651) with the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.</p>
