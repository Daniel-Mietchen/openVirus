<p id="p0060">Based on the sequence identity between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS RdRps, the Swiss model constructed a valid, high-quality model. 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>(A) shows the cladogram representation of the phylogenetic tree for the RdRps of the seven human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, HKU1, OC43, MERS, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2). The distances between each sequence are indicated after the strain name. As shown in the cladogram, the SARS RdRp is the closest strain to the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the RdRps from the different strains of HCoV is shown in 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>(B). The SARS HCoV secondary structure (PDB ID: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6NUR" id="ir0025" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6NUR</ext-link>) is shown at the top of the MSA, while its water accessibility is found at the bottom (highly accessible residues are in blue, while buried residues are white). The active site residues (D255 and D256) are circled and marked in the MSA. As implied from the MSA, the active site is highly conserved and water accessible in all 7 strains of the human coronaviruses (the red highlighting indicates identical residues, while the yellow highlighting represents conserved residues). The region surrounding the D255 and D256 residues is also conserved and mostly surface accessible in all HCoVs.
