<p id="p0065">For SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, the percent sequence identity values against the SARS, MERS, OC43, NL63, 229E, and HKU1 HCoV strains were found to be 90.18%, 56.76%, 55.07%, 48.79%, 48.55%, and 48.16%, respectively. Therefore, SARS HCoV RdRp was determined to be the sequelogous strain to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, from which we could then build a reliable model. The complete nucleotide genome for SARS-CoV-2 was determined to have sequence identities of 89.12% and 82.34% with bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate 
 <italic>bat-SL-CoVZC45</italic> and SARS coronavirus 
 <italic>ZS-C</italic>, respectively.
