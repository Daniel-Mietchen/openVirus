<p id="p0070">The SARS-CoV-2 RdRp model (801 residues) was generated by homology modeling using the Swiss Model web server. The SARS HCoV RdRp (PDB ID: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6NUR" id="ir0030" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6NUR</ext-link>, chain A) was employed as a template. The model exhibited a very high (97.08%) sequence identity to the template, suggesting that an excellent model was obtained. Testing of the model validity was mediated by the Ramachandran plot (100% of the residues in the allowed regions, 97.5% in the most favored region), Verify-3D (89.9% of the residues had average 3D-1D scores â‰¤0.2), and ERRAT (overall quality factor of 95.9%).
