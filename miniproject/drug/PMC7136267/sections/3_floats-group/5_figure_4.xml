  <p>Cytotoxicity effect of the extracted pigments on human normal and cancer cells. (
   <bold>A</bold>) EC
   <sub>50</sub> and EC
   <sub>100</sub> (µg/ml) of pigment extract and the currently used chemotherapy agent (5-FU) towards the human normal cell line (Wi-38) and (
   <bold>B</bold>) their IC
   <sub>50</sub> (µg/ml) values against four human cancer cell lines. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Selectivity index (SI) of pigments against cancer cells compared with that of 5-FU. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Variation in the morphology of normal and cancer cells after treatment with the extracted pigments and 5-FU (magnification ×200). All data are expressed as the mean ± SE with significance (unpaired t-test analysis) at p-value &lt; 0.05*, &lt;0.005**, &lt;0.0005***.
