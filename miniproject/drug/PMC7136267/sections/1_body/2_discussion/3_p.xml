<p id="Par18">The prevention of cancer progression is a promising therapeutic strategy against cancer. MMP-9 plays critical roles in cancer pathologies, including tumour angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis and mediates the tumour microenvironment by remodeling the extracellular matrix and altering cell-cell interactions and the cleavage of cell surface proteins

 </sup>. We have therefore investigated the impact of the extracted pigment on MMP-9 and found that this pigment repressed 50% of MMP-9 activity at less than 0.5 µg/ml significantly more effectively than 5-FU did 50% inhibition at ~175 µg/ml. Resrearchers
