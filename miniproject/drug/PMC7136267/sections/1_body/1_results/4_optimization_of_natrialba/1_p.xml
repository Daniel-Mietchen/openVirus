 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> presents the design matrix, real variable levels and the response of each trial, where the response variable here was the concentration of pigment (g/L) determined by measuring the absorbance of the pigment at 350 nm. In this experiment, the value of the 
 <italic>determination coefficient R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> was 0.813 for pigment formation, indicating a high degree of correlation between the experimental and predicted values. To predict the optimal variable values, a second-order polynomial function was fitted to the experimental response results (nonlinear optimization algorithm; Y = 0.79123 + 0.15975X1 − 0.037187X2 − 0.001788X3 + 0.078305X1X2 + 0.149137X1X3 + 0.126206X2X3 − 0.121676X1

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the simultaneous effects of the three most significant independent factors on each response using three-dimensional graphs generated by Statistica 5.0 software. The presented data

 <bold>)</bold> shows that, a great interaction between pH and NaCl at high values and the maximum level of carotenoid synthesis appeared. However, the plot in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref> indicates that the curve had high values near the inoculum age axis, with a maximum response near its high values. This indicates that high NaCl and using an old culture were preferable for increased carotenoid synthesis by 
 <italic>Natrialba</italic> sp. M6, and it reached a maximum along the pH axis, indicating that old cultures with middle values of pH gave the maximum carotenoid yield

 <bold>)</bold>. Thus, the optimal values of the three factors, as obtained from the maximum point of the polynomial model, was recorded as 25 (%w/v) NaCl, pH 10.07 and an inoculum age of 11 days (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), with the predicted product concentration equal to 0.98227 g/L. Table
