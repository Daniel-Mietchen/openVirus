<p id="Par5">In this study, 37 microbial isolates were recovered from different sites of water and sediments from El-Hamra Lake, Wadi El-Natrun and have been categorized as archaea and selected for the subsequent work. All isolates were screened for production of some haloalkaliphilic biocatalysts, pigment, biosurfactant and other biochemical testes. Due to distinct characteristics for the isolate coded M6 concerning tested biochemical activities in comparison to other isolates (37); it was selected for completion of this work and subjected to molecular identification. Subsequently, the isolate was identified as 
 <italic>Natrialba</italic> sp. M6 and kept in GeneBank under accession number (ac: MK063890).
