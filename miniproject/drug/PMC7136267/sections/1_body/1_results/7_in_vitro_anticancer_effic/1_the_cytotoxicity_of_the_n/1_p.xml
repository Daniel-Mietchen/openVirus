<p id="Par12">The cytotoxic effect of the studied pigment was determined against normal human lung fibroblast cells (Wi-38) by estimating the pigment concentrations (EC
 <sub>50</sub> and EC
 <sub>100</sub>) at 50% and 100% cell viability. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref> illustrates that the EC
 <sub>50</sub> and EC
 <sub>100</sub> of the extracted pigment (85.14 ± 2.31 and 31.6 ± 0.96 µg/ml, respectively) were significantly higher than those of a currently used chemotherapy agent (5-fluorouracil, 5-FU, 10.28 ± 0.67 and 3.3 ± 0.48 µg/ml, respectively). This indicates that the extracted pigment was significantly (p &lt; 0.0005) safer than 5-FU towards human normal cells. However, 5-FU caused 50% cell death for Caco-2 (colon cancer line), MCF-7 (breast cancer cell line), HepG-2 (liver cancer line), and HeLa (cervical cancer cell line) cells at a dose (7.17–10.36 µg/ml) less than that (21.18–38.24 µg/ml) of the studied pigment

 <bold>)</bold>. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 5-FU against human cancer cells were higher than its safe dose (EC
 <sub>100</sub>), clarifying that the anticancer doses of 5-FU are toxic to normal cells. On the other hand, IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of pigment for human cancer cell lines did not obviously exceed its EC
 <sub>100</sub> limit. This was confirmed by the pigment having a higher selectivity index (SI &gt; 2) between normal and cancer cells than 5-FU does (SI &lt; 1.7)

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref> demonstrates the morphological changes (loss of spindle shapes) in pigment-treated human cancer cell lines (Caco-2, MCF-7, HepG-2 and HeLa) without any marked alterations in the shapes of pigment-treated normal cells (wi-38). In contrast, cell damage was observed in both normal and cancer cells treated with 5-FU, as shown in Fig.
