<p id="Par13">Apoptosis-dependent cell death was quantified by flow cytometric analysis of untreated and treated cells after nuclear staining with annexin and propidium iodide (PI). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A,B</xref> shows the flow cytometric analysis of the annexin-stained apoptotic cell population in pigment-treated cancer cells, which was 48.87–53.55%, contrasting the less than 39% population obtained with 5-FU. This suggests that the extracted pigment was more potent as an inducer of apoptosis in all tested cancer cells (Caco-2, MCF-7, HepG-2 and HeLa) than the reference chemotherapy agent 5-FU. For additional confirmation, the induction of apoptosis was also evaluated by dual nuclear staining with acridine orange and ethidium bromide using a fluorescence microscope. Green fluorescence indicates healthy viable cells, while yellow/orange and red fluorescence are signs of early and late apoptotic cells, respectively. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>, pigment-treated cancer cells mainly exhibited yellow, orange and red fluorescence, while 5-FU-treated cancer cells still demonstrated green fluorescence in four cancer cell lines. Moreover, the percentage of caspase 3/7 activation in pigment-treated Caco-2 cells relative to that of untreated cells (76.803%) indicates that this pigment is a more efficient caspase activator than 5-FU (40%, p &lt; 0.005)
