<p id="Par14">We detected the suppressor effect of the extracted pigment on one of the key proteases (MMP-9) involved in several cancer pathological processes, including invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>, our pigment had a lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> value than 5-FU for inhibiting MMP-9 (0.484 and 175.12 µg/ml, respectively). This result indicates that this pigment possessed a significantly higher inhibitory impact (p &lt; 0.0005) on MMP-9 than 5-FU. The antiviral activity of this pigment was assessed and compared with that of currently used drugs for HCV and HBV (sofosbuvir and lamivudine, respectively). Before the antiviral activity of the extracted pigment was measured, a safe dose was determined for the host cells of HCV and HBV (peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMCs) using the MTT assay. The safe doses (EC
 <sub>100</sub>) of the extracted pigment and standard antiviral drugs (sofosbuvir and lamivudine) were 436.73 ± 1.74, 1063.9 ± 141.46 and 1083.36 ± 11.15 µg/ml, respectively. The pigments and drugs were separately incubated (96 h) at these estimated doses with HCV- and HBV-infected PBMCs, and then the viral load was quantified by the fully automated Cobas Ampliprep Cobas TaqMan (CAP-CTM) analyser. As illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>, the pigment was able to completely eliminate HCV, and approximately 89.42% of HBV was cleared; in comparison, antiviral drugs cleared 96.14% of HCV (sofosbuvir) and 77.10% of HBV (lamivudine).
