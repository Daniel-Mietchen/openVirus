 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref> shows that the pigment inhibited HCV RNA- and HBV DNA-dependent polymerases by 50% at 21.65 ± 0.25 and 4.99 ± 0.13 µg/ml, respectively, in comparison with 59.87 ± 4.59 µg/ml (HCV) for sofosbuvir and 1.642 ± 0.49 µg/ml (HBV) for lamivudine. This result suggests that the tested pigment had a higher inhibitory effect on HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B) than sofosbuvir did (p &lt; 0.05). Meanwhile, this pigment revealed a lower suppressor impact on HBV DNA-dependent DNA polymerase than lamivudine did (p &lt; 0.05).
