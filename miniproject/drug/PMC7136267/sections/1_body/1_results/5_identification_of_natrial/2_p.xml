<p id="Par10">Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy NMR were carried out to elucidate the chemical structure of the partially purified pigment of 
 <italic>Natrialba</italic> sp. M6 
 <bold>(</bold>Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 <bold>)</bold>. The FTIR spectroscopic analyses revealed the presence of various chemical groups in the pigment, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>. The peaks appearing at 543.94 and 1020.38 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> correspond to C-Br and C-F stretching frequencies, respectively. A band at 1134.18 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> corresponding to C-OH was also detected. The peak at 1263.42 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is assigned to C-O-C. Meanwhile, peaks appearing at 1408.08 and 1454.38 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> correspond to CH
 <sub>3</sub> and CH
 <sub>2</sub> stretching frequencies, respectively. The strong peak at 1637.62 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is assigned to C=C alkene stretching, indicating the presence of some aliphatic compounds in this extract. The Raman spectroscopy analysis

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>
 <bold>)</bold> revealed the presence of three regions with two strong and weak signal intensities for orange carotenoids, with a strong band at 1380 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, which corresponds to the CH
 <sub>3</sub> umbrella mode, and a weak band at 1883 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, corresponding to C=C bonds. GC-MS analysis of the partially extracted pigment identified each chromatographic peak and a peak corresponding to the major C
 <sub>40</sub> carotenoid (C
 <sub>40</sub>H
 <sub>56</sub>O
 <sub>10</sub>) nephthoside 1,2′,3′,4′-tetraacetate, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>. In addition, LC-MS analyses revealed the presence of unlike components in the pigment which may be carotenoids
