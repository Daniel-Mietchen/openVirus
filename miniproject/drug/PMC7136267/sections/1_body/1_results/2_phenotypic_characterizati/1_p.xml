 <italic>Natrialba</italic> sp. M6 (under accession number ac: MK063890) is Gram-negative and forms small, round, smooth, orange-pigmented colonies after one week of incubation at 37 °C

 <italic>Natrialba</italic> sp. M6 is presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>, where a lag phase of 3 days was observed before the log phase began; the log phase extended to the 10
 <sup>th</sup> day, and then the stationary phase started. Eleven days later, the organism entered the death phase with a gradual reduction in cell dry weight; however, this was associated with an increase in the optical density (OD)

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>
 <bold>)</bold>. This is due to interfering the color of pigment (released outside due to cell death) with turbidity measurements (OD
 <sub>600nm</sub>) and water evaporation

 <bold>)</bold>. By this way the dry weight is considered an accurate measurable term to indicate the growth rather than OD.
