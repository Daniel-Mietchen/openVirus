<p id="Par38">The activity of MMP-9 was determined colourimetrically in the presence of serial concentrations of the tested pigment or 5-FU following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Abcam, UK). The percentage of inhibition of MMP-9 activity was calculated relative to control MMP-9 activity (in the absence of pigment and 5-FU), and IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (50% MMP-9 inhibition) were calculated by PRISM 6 (GraphPad Software Inc., CA, USA).
