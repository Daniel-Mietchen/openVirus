<p id="Par35">Normal human lung fibroblast cells (Wi-38) and a colon cancer line (Caco-2) were maintained as adherent cell cultures in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS). A human liver cancer line (HepG-2), breast cancer line (MCF-7) and cervical cancer line (HeLa) were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Lonza, USA). Human normal and cancer cells were seeded in 96-well cell culture plates. After cell attachment, serial concentrations of the extracted pigment or FU were added. After 48 h of treatment, all cells were incubated with MTT (10 mg/ml) for 3 h. Then, MTT solution was removed, DMSO was added, and the absorbance was read by a microplate reader at 590 nm

 </sup>. The effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) and safe dose (EC
 <sub>100</sub>) that cause 50% and 100% cell viability, respectively, and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) for the growth of the tested cancer cell lines were calculated by GraphPad InStat software. Moreover, the SI, defined as the ratio of the EC
 <sub>50</sub> for normal cells to that for cancer cell lines, was estimated. Furthermore, cellular morphological changes before and after treatment were examined using a phase-contrast inverted microscope (Olympus, Japan) with a digital camera and CellSense software.
