<p id="Par36">The human cancer cell lines Caco-2, MCF-7, HepG2 and HeLa were treated with pigment extract or 5-FU at their IC
 <sub>50</sub> dose. After 48 h of treatment, cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed with cold PBS and incubated with annexin V-biotin (Sigma, USA) and PI (Sigma, USA) for 15 min in the dark. After washing, the cells were incubated with streptavidin-fluorescein for 15 min, collected by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS. The cell death rates of the annexin- and PI-stained cell populations were detected using flow cytometry with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) signal detector (FL1) and a phycoerythrin emission signal detector (FL2), respectively. Additionally, the cell death-dependent anticancer activity of the pigment was assayed by two fluorescent nuclear stains (ethidium bromide and acridine orange dyes). The untreated and treated cancer cells were stained with these dual nuclear dyes and examined after 15 min using a fluorescence phase-contrast microscope.
