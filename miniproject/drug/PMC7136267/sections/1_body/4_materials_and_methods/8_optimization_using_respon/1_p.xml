<p id="Par28">After estimating the relative significance of independent variables, the most significant variables were selected for further determination of their optimal values. For this reason, Box-Behnken design (BBD), which is a response surface methodology, was applied

 </sup>. This optimization process involves three main steps: performing the statistically designed experiments, estimating the coefficients in a mathematical model, predicting the response and checking the adequacy of the model. The three significant variables elucidated for the M6 isolate were NaCl (X1), pH (X2), and culture age (X3). The polynomial equation for the three factors tuning pigment production was as follows: Y = β
 <sub>0</sub> + β
 <sub>1</sub>(X
 <sub>1</sub>) + β
 <sub>2</sub>(X
 <sub>2</sub>) + β
 <sub>3</sub>(X
 <sub>3</sub>) + β
 <sub>12</sub>(X
 <sub>1</sub>X
 <sub>2</sub>) + β
 <sub>13</sub>(X
 <sub>1</sub>X
 <sub>3</sub>) + β
 <sub>23</sub>(X
 <sub>2</sub>X
 <sub>3</sub>) + β
 <sub>11</sub>(X
 <sub>1</sub>)
 <sup>2</sup> + β
 <sub>22</sub>(X
 <sub>2</sub>)
 <sup>2</sup> + β
 <sub>33</sub>(X
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sup>2</sup>, where Y is the predicted response (pigment concentration); β
 <sub>0</sub> is a constant; β
 <sub>1</sub>, β
 <sub>2</sub>, β
 <sub>3</sub> and β
 <sub>4</sub> are linear coefficients; β
 <sub>12</sub>, β
 <sub>13</sub> and β
 <sub>23</sub> are cross product coefficients; and β
 <sub>11</sub>, β
 <sub>22,</sub> β
 <sub>33</sub> and β
 <sub>44</sub> are quadratic coefficients. Variable maximal predicted response and coefficient calculations were carried out using Microsoft Excel 2007. The low, middle and high levels of each variable were designated −1, 0 and +1, respectively.
