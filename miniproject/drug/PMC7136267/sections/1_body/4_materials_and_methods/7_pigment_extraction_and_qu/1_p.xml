<p id="Par27">Approximately 50 ml of the culture broth was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and 50 ml of distilled solution was added to the pellets and then kept at 4 °C overnight. A mixture of acetone-methanol (7:3 v/v) containing butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) (0.1% as antioxidant) was added to the pellets. Successive extractions were carried out until both solvents and cells were colourless, and they were then again centrifuged. The solvent was evaporated at 45 °C overnight, and the pigment was dissolved in 50 ml of acetone containing 0.1% BHT. Samples were wrapped with aluminium foil to protect them from light. The coloured extraction solution was analysed by scanning the absorbance in the wavelength region of 200–700 nm, and then the pigment was quantified by measuring the OD at the wavelength (λ
 <sub>350nm</sub>) with the highest absorption and using an absorption coefficient value of 2660
