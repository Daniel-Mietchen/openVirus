<p id="Par32">Separation and mass identification of the natural extract in methanol was done using LC-MS (Shimadzu, Japan). The separation was carried out using isocratic elution system with 100% MeOH (0.1% HCOOH) using C18 column maintained at 25 °C, while PDA detector (200 - 600 nm) was operated for the detection analysis. The separation unit is coupled to MS for mass identification of the separated compounds which was operated on the positive ionization mode in the range 100–2000 Da.</p>
