<p id="Par25">In this experiment, the archaeon (M6) was allowed to grow in 100 ml of the growth medium in a 250 ml conical flask. At time intervals, the OD was measured using a spectrophotometer. For dry weight determination, cultures were centrifuged, and cell pellets were washed twice with saline solution (0.9% (w/v) NaCl isotonic solution), centrifuged and dried at 105 °C until a constant weight
