<p id="Par41">The viral host cells and human PBMCs (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells) were seeded in each well of a 12-well culture plate. All wells except the negative control were incubated overnight with serum infected with either HCV (2.9 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> copies/ml, genotype 4a) or HBV (1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> copies/ml, genotype D) in RPMI-1640 medium in a CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and 95% humidity. Then, the infected medium was replaced with fresh RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS for positive control wells. For treated wells, this infected medium was exchanged with RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS and the tested extract or reference antiviral drugs at their EC
 <sub>100</sub>. After 96 h, the untreated and treated infected cells were quantitatively analysed for intracellular HCV and HBV using the fully automated Cobas Ampliprep Cobas TaqMan (CAP-CTM) analyser (Roche Diagnostics, USA).
