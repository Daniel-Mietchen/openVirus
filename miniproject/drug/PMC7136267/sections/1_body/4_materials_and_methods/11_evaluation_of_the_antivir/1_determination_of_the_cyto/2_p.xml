<p id="Par40">Human PBMCs were isolated from blood according to the Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation method and then counted and resuspended gently in RPMI medium containing 10% FBS to be 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/ml. Approximately 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> mononuclear cells were seeded in 96-well cell culture plates. Then, the cells were incubated with and without serial dilutions of the examined extract or currently used anti-HCV and anti-HBV drugs (sofosbuvir (“Sovaldi”) and lamivudine, respectively). After 96 h of incubation in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator, cell viability was determined using MTT, as described above, to estimate safe doses of the extracted pigment, Sovaldi and lamivudine.
