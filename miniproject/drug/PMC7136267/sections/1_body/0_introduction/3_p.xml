 <sup>th</sup> century focused on haloarchaeal carotenoids compared with carotenoids of other organisms. In addition, little information on the biological properties of haloarchaeal carotenoids is available, and there is an increasing need for new sources of such important bioactive compounds. Hence, after partial extraction of carotenoids produced by the haloalkaliphilic archaeon

 <italic>in vitro</italic> anticancer activity by investigating their potential for the induction of apoptosis-dependent cell death and for blocking matrix metalloprotease (MMP) 9-dependent cancer progression (angiogenesis and metastasis)

 </sup>. Additionally, we investigated the antiviral activity of these carotenoids by assessing their impact on hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA-dependent RNA and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA-dependent DNA polymerase-mediated viral replication. This evaluation will open the door for more research on the possible therapeutic applications of carotenoids as natural remedies.
