However, little information is available about the biological impacts of these archaeal metabolites. Here, carotenoids of <italic>Natrialba</italic> sp. M6, which was isolated from Wadi El-Natrun, were produced, purified and identified by Raman spectroscopy, GC-mass spectrometry, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, LC&#x02013;mass spectrometry and Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The C<sub>50</sub> carotenoid bacterioruberin was found to be the predominant compound. Because cancer and viral hepatitis are serious diseases, the anticancer, anti-HCV and anti-HBV potentials of these extracted carotenoids (pigments) were examined for the first time. <italic>In vitro</italic> results indicated that the caspase-mediated apoptotic anticancer effect of this pigment and its inhibitory efficacy against matrix metalloprotease 9 were significantly higher than those of 5-fluorouracil. Furthermore, the extracted pigment exhibited significantly stronger activity for eliminating HCV and HBV in infected human blood mononuclear cells than currently used drugs. This antiviral activity may be attributed to its inhibitory potential against HCV RNA and HBV DNA polymerases, which thereby suppresses HCV and HBV replication, as indicated by a high viral clearance % in the treated cells. These novel findings suggest that the C<sub>50</sub> carotenoid of <italic>Natrialba</italic> sp. M6 can be used as an alternative source of natural metabolites that confer potent anticancer and antiviral activities.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Biotechnology</kwd><kwd>Microbiology</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Halophilic archaea (haloarchaea) belong to the family Halobacteriaceae. This family includes a group of microorganisms that are able to live in hypersaline environments with high salt concentrations (up to 4&#x02009;M), such as solar salterns, salt lakes and salt deposits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Interestingly, these organisms have received increasing attention due to their ability to produce a plethora of compounds with potential applications in many fields of biotechnology, including salt-tolerant enzymes, biodegradable polyesters, exopolysaccharides, antimicrobial halocins, biosurfactants, and photon-driven retinal protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Most haloarchaeal species (e.g., <italic>Natrialba</italic>) can produce pigments, including carotenoids. <italic>Natrialba</italic> is an organism in our research that belongs to the Halobacteriaceae family. However, the genus has recently been reassigned to the novel family Natrialbaceae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. <italic>Natrialba</italic> sp. M6 is an extreme haloalkaliphile that grows at pH 10.0 and 20&#x02013;25% w/v NaCl and utilizes a wide range of carbohydrate and noncarbohydrate substrates.</p><p id="Par3">Carotenoids are lipid-soluble pigments that vary in colour between yellow, orange, and red. Carotenoids are classified based on the number of carbons in their backbones into the categories C<sub>30</sub>, C<sub>40</sub> and C<sub>50</sub>. Most carotenoids exist as a C<sub>40</sub> structure in different living organisms, including bacteria, archaea, fungi, algae, and plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, haloarchaea can produce C<sub>50</sub> bacterioruberin (BR), a rare carotenoid form that contains four hydroxyl groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. These pigments are divided into two major groups: xanthophylls (molecules containing oxygen), such as lutein and zeaxanthin, and carotenes (nonoxygenated molecules), such as &#x003b1;-carotene and lycopene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The presence of carotenoids in the membrane of archaeal cells may help cells adapt to hypersaline environments by acting as a water barrier and allowing ions and oxygen molecules to permeate through the cell membrane. Additionally, BR protects bacteria from damage under intensive light and against free radical- and UV-mediated oxidative DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Therefore, these carotenoids can stabilize archaeal cells under high osmotic and oxidative stresses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The biological function of carotenoids is mostly attributed to their antioxidant properties that protect cells from oxidative damage; consequently, they improve human health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">However, haloarchaeal carotenoids were first studied in the 1960s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Few studies during the last half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century focused on haloarchaeal carotenoids compared with carotenoids of other organisms. In addition, little information on the biological properties of haloarchaeal carotenoids is available, and there is an increasing need for new sources of such important bioactive compounds. Hence, after partial extraction of carotenoids produced by the haloalkaliphilic archaeon <italic>Natrialba</italic> sp. M6, we evaluated their <italic>in vitro</italic> anticancer activity by investigating their potential for the induction of apoptosis-dependent cell death and for blocking matrix metalloprotease (MMP) 9-dependent cancer progression (angiogenesis and metastasis)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Additionally, we investigated the antiviral activity of these carotenoids by assessing their impact on hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA-dependent RNA and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA-dependent DNA polymerase-mediated viral replication. This evaluation will open the door for more research on the possible therapeutic applications of carotenoids as natural remedies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Isolation, screening and molecular identification</title><p id="Par5">In this study, 37 microbial isolates were recovered from different sites of water and sediments from El-Hamra Lake, Wadi El-Natrun and have been categorized as archaea and selected for the subsequent work.
