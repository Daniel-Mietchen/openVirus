<p>The seroprevalence for CMV worldwide ranges from 60 to 100 % [

Symptomatic CMV infection in non-immunocompromised hosts has traditionally been considered to display a benign self-limited course of a disease that resembles EBV-IM syndrome. Similar to other herpes viruses, all primary infections resolve and enter into lifelong latency in which live viruses are sequestered in a non-replicative state. Persons with latent infection and intact immune systems have no symptoms but exhibit antibodies to CMV. Circulating lymphocytes, monocytes, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes may serve as the reservoir site of viral latency. The risk for intermittent reactivation is increased with immunosuppression [
