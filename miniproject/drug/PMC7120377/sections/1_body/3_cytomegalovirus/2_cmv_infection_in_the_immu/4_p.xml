<p>A special population afflicted by CMV disease consists of patients with preexisting inflammatory bowel disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. TNF-α and IFN-γ are frequently elevated in these patients and may promote reactivation of a latent CMV infection, which further promotes additional cytokine release, particularly of IL-6. This in turn leads to a vicious circle of exacerbation of the inflammatory bowel disease. This sequence of events may be observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease who have not recently received any steroid treatment. CMV colitis in patients with underlying inflammatory bowel disease has the potential to lead to severe complications including toxic megacolon, colovesical fistula, perforation, and peritonitis.
