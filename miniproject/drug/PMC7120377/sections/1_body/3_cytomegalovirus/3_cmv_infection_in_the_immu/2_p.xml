<p>CMV is the most common opportunistic viral infection in AIDS patients, causing retinitis, central nervous system infections, esophagitis, and colitis. CMV may also invade the hepatobiliary tract in AIDS patients, causing hepatitis, pancreatitis, and acute acalculous cholecystitis [

The presence of CMV retinitis, gastrointestinal disease, or viremia in AIDS patients increases the risk for a cholestatic syndrome caused by papillary stenosis and sclerosing cholangitis (AIDS cholangiopathy), which does not usually respond to antiviral therapy. Hepatitis is the most frequent organ-specific complication of CMV infection after liver transplantation, affecting 10 % of recipients and with a higher incidence among seronegative recipients than seropositive patients (26 % vs. 9 %, respectively). In these cases, infection occurs as a consequence of reactivation rather than primary infection [
