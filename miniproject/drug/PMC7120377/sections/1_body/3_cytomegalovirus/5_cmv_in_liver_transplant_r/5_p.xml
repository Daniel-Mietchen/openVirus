<p>CMV disease in liver recipients manifests with fever, bone marrow suppression, and organ-invasive disease. These direct clinical effects are classified as CMV syndrome (fever with myelosuppression) or as tissue-invasive CMV disease, which most often involves the gastrointestinal tract (CMV gastritis, esophagitis, enteritis, and colitis), although any organ may be involved. CMV hepatitis is common in liver transplant recipients compared to other solid organ transplant recipients and manifests with symptoms indistinguishable from acute allograft rejection [

The availability of sensitive tests for the rapid detection of CMV in the blood may obviate the need for a liver biopsy to differentiate CMV infection from rejection. However, in many cases, a liver biopsy is required to differentiate or demonstrate a coexistence of CMV disease and allograft rejection.
