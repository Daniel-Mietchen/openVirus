<p>Defects in innate and in CMV-specific cell-mediated immunity predispose these patients to severe infections. Mutations in innate immunity-associated genes increase the risk of CMV disease after liver transplantation. TLR2 expressed in innate immune cells senses the glycoprotein B of CMV, thereby signaling immune cells to produce cytokines and antiviral peptides. In a study of 92 liver transplant recipients, a genetic polymorphism in the TLR-2 gene was associated with a higher degree of CMV replication and a higher incidence of CMV disease. This polymorphism decreased the cellular recognition of CMV by TLR2-expressing cells. Programmed death-1 receptor expression and immune evasion genes have also been assessed as prognostic indicators of CMV disease following liver transplantation.</p>
