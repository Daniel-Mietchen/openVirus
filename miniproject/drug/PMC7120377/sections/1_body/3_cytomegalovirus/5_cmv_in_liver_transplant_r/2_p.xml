<p>Overall, 18–29 % of liver transplant recipients will develop CMV disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. A lack of preexisting CMV-specific immunity in CMV-seronegative recipients of liver allograft from CMV-seropositive donors (CMV D+/R−) exposes these patients to the highest risk of CMV disease and its complications (44–65 % in CMV D+/R− vs. 8–19 % in CMV-seropositive recipients, CMV R+) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. The incidence is reduced in liver transplant recipients who receive antiviral prophylaxis with valganciclovir or oral ganciclovir for the first 3 months following liver transplantation. CMV disease rates of 12–30 % in high-risk CMV D+/R− and less than 10 % in CMV R+ were reported in patients who received antiviral prophylaxis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. A recent randomized control trial showed that 200 days of prophylaxis are more effective than 100 days of therapy in high-risk (D+/R−) patients; however, this has yet to become a standard recommendation due to safety and cost [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. In individuals who received antiviral prophylaxis, CMV disease may occur 3–6 months after completing antiviral prophylaxis; hence, the term “delayed-onset” or “late-onset” CMV disease [
