<p>Allograft rejection can promote CMV reactivation and is a significant risk factor for CMV disease following liver transplantation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Cytokines released during acute rejection, particularly TNF-α, are potent activators of latent CMV. Therapy for allograft rejection, which involves intensification of the immunosuppressive regimen, further increases the risk of CMV disease. The risk of CMV disease after liver transplantation is associated in direct proportion with the degree of CMV replication, which is partly a function of “over-immunosuppression” [
