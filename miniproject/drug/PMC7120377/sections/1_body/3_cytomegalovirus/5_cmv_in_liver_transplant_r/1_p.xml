<p>CMV infection is a common complication following liver transplantation and contributes to morbidity and mortality in these patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. CMV evades the immune system resulting in a state of latency in several types of host cells. Cellular sites of viral latency become reservoirs of reactivation during periods of stress and cytokine release and serve as vehicles for transmission to susceptible hosts. Pharmacologically induced impairment of immune response to “endogenously reactivated” or “allograft-transmitted” CMV leads to febrile and tissue-invasive diseases in liver transplant recipients [
