<p>Primary varicella infection is usually benign with mild transient elevation in liver enzymes in up to 25 % of children; however, it can cause severe acute hepatitis and even ALF in immune-competent adults. In transplanted patients, primary infection can present with an aggressive liver disease [

Confirmation of diagnosis is made through isolation of VZV from skin lesions or from the affected organs. Liver biopsy often shows foci of coagulative necrosis and intranuclear inclusions with an inflammatory response [
