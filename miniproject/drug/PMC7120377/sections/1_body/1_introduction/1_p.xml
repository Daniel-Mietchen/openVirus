<p>Viruses other than the classic hepatotropic viruses, hepatitis A through E, may cause hepatic injury [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Among these are Epsteinâ€“Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), human herpes viruses (HHV) 6, 7, and 8, human parvovirus B19, and adenoviruses (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">12.1</xref>). The clinical presentation of infections with these viruses may be indistinguishable from that associated with infection with classic hepatotropic viruses. The presentation ranges from a mild and transient elevation of aminotransferases to acute hepatitis and liver liver failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These viruses should be considered as possible etiologic agents in patients who have acute liver injury and whose serologic markers for the classic hepatotropic viruses are not indicative of an active infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the present chapter, we review the clinical manifestations and the potential for immune-mediated liver injury associated with several of these viruses (see summary Table
