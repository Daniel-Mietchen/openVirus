<p>In immunocompromised hosts, HSV hepatitis has occurred during primary and, rarely, during recurrent infection, with a triad of fever, leukopenia and markedly elevated liver enzymes, as well as thrombocytopenia and a relatively mild increase in bilirubin [

It shows focal, sometimes extensive, hemorrhagic, or coagulative, necrosis of the hepatocytes with limited inflammatory response. Typical intranuclear inclusions (Cowdry type A) are often identified at the margins of the foci of necrosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of HSV DNA sequences by molecular techniques [
