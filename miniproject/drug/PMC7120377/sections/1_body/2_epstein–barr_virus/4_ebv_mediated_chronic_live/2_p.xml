<p>Chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV) may result from a disturbance in the host–virus balance and Th1/Th2 misbalance, and may be associated with an aggressive clinical course. CAEBV is defined by chronic severe illness, which begins as a primary EBV infection associated with elevated transaminases, abnormal EBV serology, suggestive histopathological features, and detection of viral genome in the liver tissue. Evidence of recurrent EBV reactivations, increased circulating EBV-specific CTLs, and increased CD38 B-cell expression, along with increased LDH levels, mild splenomegaly, and thrombocytopenia, can support the diagnosis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The mild form is characterized by intact immune control of B cells, relatively low viremia, and EBV-specific CTL expansion comparable to those of seropositive donors. Patients with iatrogenic, congenital, or acquired immunodeficiency are at increased risk for EBV-associated lymphomas and CAEBV. Immune senescence in the elderly is also associated with both reactive and neoplastic EBV-driven lymphoproliferative disorders. EBV may also trigger autoimmune hepatitis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and vanishing bile duct syndrome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. While the existence of acute mononuclear hepatitis during primary EBV infection is accepted, skepticism has been expressed as to the hypothesis that EBV causes chronic liver disease in immune-competent patients. EBV in this setting may be referred to as an “incidental virus,” reflecting a co-infection with other hepatotropic viruses that are a more likely cause of chronic liver disease or amplification of the EBV genome in circulating B cells that turn up in the liver [
