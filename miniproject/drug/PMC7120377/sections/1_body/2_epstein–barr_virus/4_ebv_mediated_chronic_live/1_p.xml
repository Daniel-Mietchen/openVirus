<p>Chronic EBV hepatitis in immune-competent patients was suggested in several studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, EBV was not detected in human hepatocytes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Specific latent antigens, as well as EBER transcripts, were detected in infiltrating CD8+ CTLs, implying that hepatocytes suffer from “collateral” damage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Chronic hepatitis might also be induced by a soluble Fas-ligand, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, and IFN-γ. Activated CD8+ cells are trapped in the liver via specific adhesive molecules expressed by Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. It is suggested that reactivation leading to liver damage can occur whether the infected lymphocytes are incidentally or intentionally in the liver.
