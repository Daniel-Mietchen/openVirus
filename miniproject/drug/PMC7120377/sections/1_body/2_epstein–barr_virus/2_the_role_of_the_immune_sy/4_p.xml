<p>Innate lymphocytes also play a role in resistance to EBV-associated malignancies. Mutations in SAP (signaling-lymphocyte activation-molecule-(SLAM)-associated protein) are associated with loss of EBV-specific immune control [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. During EBV latency, the virus develops mechanisms of immune escape from innate immunity-dependent mechanisms, including the inhibition of NK cell activation through EBV-induced gene 3 (EBI3) [
