<p>Imbalances in the equilibrium between the virus and the host’s immune system lead to the development of liver damage in EBV-infected patients. EBV can also be involved in the development of tumors such as lymphoproliferative disorders, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Burkitt’s lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In the context of EBV-related tumors, the expression of viral antigens by malignant cells makes them suitable targets for immune therapy. Infusion of EBV-specific CTLs has proved to be safe and effective and induces protective antiviral immunity, which is lacking in EBV-associated malignancy [
