<p>EBV reactivation associated with increased specific CTL-response to a lytic EBV epitope can lead to EBV-associated chronic hepatitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. EBV reactivation in these patients is based on an increased percentage of terminally differentiated CD28-CD27-CD8+ T cells, suggestive of chronic antigen stimulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Diminished expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD28 and CD27 compromises CD8+ reactivation, making cells more resistant to apoptosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A T-cell pool with low expression of CD28 and CD27 has low ability to control reactivation of virus and is a typical finding in an elderly group. Similar changes were found in younger patients under chronic CMV and EBV antigen stimulation [
