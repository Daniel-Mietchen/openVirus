<p>Early after primary viral infection, NK cells are thought to limit the viral burden until virus-specific T cells are able to eliminate the infection or maintain viral titers at low levels. Innate immunity uses several “pattern recognition” receptors to sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [
