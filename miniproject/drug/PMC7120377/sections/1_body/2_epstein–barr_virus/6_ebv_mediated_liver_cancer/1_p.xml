<p>EBV has been considered a major factor in the development of a wide range of cancers both in immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. EBV or infected cell clones can promote the replication of HCV and have been suggested to be involved in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). EBV-infected cells support HCV replication better than uninfected cells, suggesting that EBV may act as a helper virus to promote HCV replication in HCV-positive HCCs. A greater amount of EBV DNA was reported in HCV-positive HCC compared to HBV-associated HCC. In some studies, up to 30 % of liver cancers were found to harbor EBV DNA [
