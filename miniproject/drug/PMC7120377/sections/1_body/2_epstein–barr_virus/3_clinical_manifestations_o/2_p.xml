<p>Primary EBV infection takes place in the oropharyngeal region, to which the virus is conveyed by saliva droplets from infected individuals. Primary infection leads to transient viremia followed by a strong T-cell adaptive immune response that holds the infection latent in immunocompetent individuals [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. If infection is delayed to adolescence or adulthood, it can cause infectious mononucleosis (IM), a self-resolving lymphoid disorder largely resulting from an uncontrolled T-cell reaction directed against EBV-infected cells. In IM patients, EBV is exclusively found in B blasts that proliferate under the influence of latent genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Following resolution of the primary infection, EBV establishes a lifelong persistence in memory B cells in which the virus remains clinically silent. In this B-cell reservoir, viral expression is entirely repressed, a process described as “true latency.” Short episodes of spontaneous reactivation and consequent viral replication normally occur in healthy individuals [

Manifestations of liver involvement in immunocompetent hosts range from mild self-limiting acute hepatitis to occasional reports of fatal acute fulminant hepatitis. Abnormal liver blood tests are common in EBV infection and occur in up to 90 % of patients, but symptomatic hepatitis is rare [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The diagnosis is suggested by the presence of a lymphocytosis and/or splenomegaly [
