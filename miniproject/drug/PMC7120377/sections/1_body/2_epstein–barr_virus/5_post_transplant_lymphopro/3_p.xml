<p>The spectrum of PTLD ranges from polymorphic lymphocyte proliferation to high-grade life-threatening monoclonal lymphoma [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The interplay between the EBV life cycle and latency and non-viral factors determines the histology and clinical presentation of the disease. The majority of PTLD is of B-cell origin. EBVâ€™s in vitro transforming abilities, distinctive latency, and clonality within the malignant cells determine the biology of the disease [
