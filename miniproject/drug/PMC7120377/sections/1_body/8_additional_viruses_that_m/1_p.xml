<p>Several viruses may involve the liver as a part of an acute viral infection (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">12.1</xref>). This infection may manifest as mild hepatitis and rarely as severe hepatitis and liver failure, along with other severe manifestations such as hemorrhagic fever. Therapy is supportive with anecdotal reports supporting antiviral therapy. Patients with liver failure should be considered for urgent liver transplantation; however, this may be hindered by concomitant damage to other organs.
