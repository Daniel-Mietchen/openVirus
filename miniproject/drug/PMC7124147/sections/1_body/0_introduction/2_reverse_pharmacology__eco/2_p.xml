<p>Is there any possibility to reconcile these two worlds? Can and should research into medicinal plants take place in Western countries in order to use it as such? The way we see it is that we do not have a choice anymore. The health care systems in many Western countries are on the verge of collapse, and it appears that the capitalistic model and health care are not a good mix after all. A fast growing lack of trust and the extremely high costs involved are probably the main reasons. It has become too expensive, proven by the fact that many people in Western countries are already excluded from primary health care, simply because they cannot afford it. We have to find a way to reduce the cost of health care in Western countries. Expensive medicine is of course only one part of the overall cost of the health care system, but it is a good starting point. What needs to be done is to study the health care systems in non-Western countries and to apply our vast resources in Western countries into studying specifically the types of medicine that they use in order to provide and create an evidence-based, quality-controlled, inexpensive and effective medicine. We have to be clear that not all of the traditional medicines used in non-Western countries will work; there will be many failures, but there will (or might) also be big successes. One medicinal plant that should be studied in detail is 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> L. (Asteraceae) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">14.1</xref>). This medicinal plant has the potential to satisfy the current needs of both worlds but also has the potential to bring these two worlds closer together. It can yield single compounds that can be further developed into a drug—which it already did. It can also be used in the form of a medicinal plant as an inexpensive, effective treatment for life-threatening diseases in non-Western countries—which it already did. Our sincere hope is that this plant will one day even be used in Western countries as soon as the scientific evidence for its efficacy is provided. All we need to do is some in-depth scientific research, which at the moment is unfortunately not being supported in Western countries due to the aforementioned economic reasons. To address this, we have recently published a review paper dealing with the scientific complexities we face in studying this plant and recommended the logical next steps that should be taken (van der Kooy and Sullivan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2013</xref>). This chapter will therefore describe another important aspect of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">14.1</xref>) and the discovery of the remarkable anti-HIV activity of this plant. We will give a short introduction on the history of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic>, the biological activities associated with this plant, the reported antiviral activities and more specifically the anti-HIV activities of all compounds identified in the traditionally prepared 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> formulation. The potential impact of this discovery and the need to continue with this research will also be discussed.
