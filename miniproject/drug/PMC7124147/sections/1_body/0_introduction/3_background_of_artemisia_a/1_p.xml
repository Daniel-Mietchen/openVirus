 <italic>A. annua</italic> has been used for hundreds of years to treat various ailments, specifically those related to the treatment of intermittent fevers. This traditional use has been linked to malarial infections caused by the 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> parasite. From 
 <italic>A. annua,</italic> one active compound, a sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide called artemisinin has been identified and is currently being used, as artemisinin derivatives, as a first-line treatment for malaria (De Ridder et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2008</xref>). The traditional use of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> in the form of a tea infusion prepared from the dried leaves continues to be used in China and due to its apparent effectiveness has rapidly spread across the globe in recent times. Currently, it is being used all over the world as an inexpensive treatment for malaria, as opposed to the WHO-recommended artemisinin derivatives. The traditional use of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> has caused a large amount of controversy, and it is feared that resistance against artemisinin might develop because of the traditional use of the plant. There is however an opposing view that states 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> has been used for hundreds of years without resistance developing and only now since a single compound from this plant is being used, resistance has developed. The use of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> can however have important implications specifically for antimalarial treatments in developing countries, where the high cost of commercial drugs makes it practically inaccessible to many. It can also have important implications for Western countries where the general high cost of health care has already excluded many from receiving adequate treatment for disease. The common view on the use of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> supported by the WHO is relatively simplistic. In order to reach the prescribed doses of the main active compound artemisinin, they have concluded that artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) are the only way to approach the treatment of malaria (Mueller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2004</xref>; WHO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2012</xref>). This clash between Western-based drugs (e.g. artemisinin) and traditional medicines (medicinal plants e.g. 
 <italic>A. annua</italic>) has culminated in the publication of a Position Statement by the WHO on the use of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> for the treatment of malaria. The main recommendation in this statement was not to use 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> in any form including a tea infusion due to the low natural abundance of artemisinin in 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> (Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2006</xref> and WHO, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2012</xref>). For a full discussion on the traditional use of 
 <italic>A. annua,</italic> Hsu (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2006</xref>) should be consulted, and for a full discussion on the controversy surrounding the use of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> versus the WHO-recommended use of artemisinin derivatives, van der Kooy and Sullivan (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2013</xref>) should be consulted.
