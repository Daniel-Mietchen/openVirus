<p>There are however some problems relating to the use of artemisinin. The main problem is that it is a very fast-acting drug with a very short half-life. It therefore needs to be combined with a slower-acting drug in order to assure the effective elimination of all the parasitaemia. Another problem is the assurance of an adequate supply of artemisinin. Due to its complex chemical structure, the synthesis and/or semi-synthesis remains to be difficult, and therefore the main source of artemisinin remains to be isolation and purification from the 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> plant. Due to environmental and economic influences, the annual production of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> suffers from a boom and bust cycle with overproduction and low prices the one year to underproduction and high prices the next year. The cost of this Western-style treatment is also far too high for where it is usedâ€”predominantly in non-Western countries. In order to stabilise the global production of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> and the price of artemisinin, various approaches have been taken. To increase the yield of artemisinin in 
 <italic>A. annua,</italic> classical plant breeding techniques have been employed (Bartlet 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2010</xref>); the isolation and purification techniques are continuously being improved (Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2011a</xref>), and the chemical synthesis of artemisinin has been successful to some degree (Dietrich et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2009</xref>). It is of note that all of this research has taken place in Western countries and that the focus is on the single compound artemisinin. Another novel approach would be to identify a second active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in order to reduce the overall production cost of artemisinin (Lubbe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>). In order to do this, the traditional and current use of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> for diseases other than malaria was investigated.
