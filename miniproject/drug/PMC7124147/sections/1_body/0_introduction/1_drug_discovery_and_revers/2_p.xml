<p>There are alternative approaches in which these problems can partly be sidestepped. One such approach can be called reverse pharmacology. This relatively simple approach identifies traditional medicines (e.g. predominantly medicinal plants) that are known to be non-toxic in vivo. This is an extremely important aspect as most lead compounds identified during the normal drug discovery processes fail during clinical trials due to in vivo toxicity. If we identify medicinal plants that have been used and are still being used by thousands of people without any reports of toxicity, we have practically sidestepped this major problem. The second step in reverse pharmacology is to work our way back to the active compound(s) with the use of in vitro bioassays. We therefore start with the in vivo uncontrolled clinical trial followed by the in vitro identification of the active compound(s). One notable difference with the normal drug discovery process is that this system does not necessarily need in vivo animal studies to be conducted (however, the drug registration authority demands animal studies to be conducted before registration). The reverse pharmacology approach is however not without its shortcomings either. The main problem here is that in vitro bioassays are being used, leading to the same set off problems experienced with the normal drug discovery pipeline at this stage of the process. Some of the main problems with in vitro bioassays are as follows:

  <list-item>
   <p>They exclude the influence of human metabolism on the active compounds and will therefore not detect the so-called prodrugs. Prodrugs are compounds that are inactive in their natural form but are chemically altered during normal metabolism to become active.</p>

   <p>Bioassays are designed to identify compounds with a specific mechanism of action. It can for instance consist of a single enzyme (e.g. HIV integrase) or a specific life cycle stage of a parasite. Any active compound that does not bind to this enzyme or does not act against a specific life cycle stage might therefore be deemed inactive—A so-called false negative.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Bioassays do not test for important pharmacokinetic and dynamic aspects such as bioavailability. If the compound is not bioavailable in vivo, then the in vitro activity does not matter much (bioavailability can however be improved by encapsulation techniques).</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Bioassays normally make use of “foreign” organic chemicals or media that can react and thereby deactivate active compounds, leading to a large number of false negatives. Common compounds found in many plants can also react with these bioassay media constituents, making them active, leading to a large number of false positives.</p>
