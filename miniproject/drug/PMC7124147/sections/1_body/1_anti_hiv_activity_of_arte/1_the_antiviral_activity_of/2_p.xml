<p>Reports of other 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> species showing anti-HIV activity are limited to 
 <italic>A. caruifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>A. capillaris.</italic> Ma et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2001</xref>) identified four compounds from methanol extracts of 
 <italic>A. caruifolia,</italic> namely 
 <italic>N</italic>1, 
 <italic>N</italic>5, 
 <italic>N</italic>10-tri-
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaroylspermidine derivatives which showed around 70 % inhibition of HIV-1 protease at a concentration of 100 μg/mL. The three dicaffeoylquinic acid derivatives also isolated during this study did not show any appreciable activity against HIV-1 protease. However, Cos et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2008</xref>) reported that 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid did indeed show good activity against HIV integrase, although controversy remains around its potency and activity in vivo. In a metabolomic investigation of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> and 
 <italic>A. afra</italic>, coumaroylspermidine derivatives were not detected in either species tested (Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>). No other reports could be found that these compounds have been identified in 
 <italic>A. annua</italic>. Wu et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2001</xref>) concluded that the active anti-HIV components present in 
 <italic>A.</italic> c
 <italic>apilaris</italic> were the flavonoids isorhamnetin and arcapillin, as well as the coumarin derivative aesculetin.
