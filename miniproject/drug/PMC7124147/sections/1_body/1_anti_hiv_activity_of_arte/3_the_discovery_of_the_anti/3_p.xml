<p>We prepared tea infusions from nine 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> and one 
 <italic>A. afra</italic> sample according to van der Kooy and Verpoorte (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2011</xref>) and tested them against HIV according to Lubbe et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>). The plant material was collected from different parts of the world and in different years. The results indicated that the 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> tea infusions had IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of between 0.6 and 3.7 μg/mL and for the 
 <italic>A. afra</italic> infusion an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1 μg/mL (values corrected for variation in the positive control—Lubbe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">14.1</xref>). These results by themselves are quite remarkable in that Cos et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2008</xref>) reported that any single compound with an activity of below 25 μg/mL should be considered to have significant antiviral activity. We know that the tea infusion prepared from 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> consists of many compounds (Mouton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2013</xref>), making this chemically complex “extract” highly active against HIV. Furthermore, the activities of all the samples appeared to be relatively similar, indicating that the concentration of the active compound in the samples is probably very similar. Furthermore, the active compound appears to be stable for a number of years as the oldest plant sample tested was about 10 years old. These results answered our first question in that the 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> tea infusion does indeed exhibit good in vitro activity against HIV. We have to be careful in interpreting these results, and we have to keep in mind that in vitro bioassays suffer from some severe shortcomings as was discussed in the introduction of this chapter. The possibility exists that this result can be nothing more than a false positive. Unfortunately, only time will tell.
