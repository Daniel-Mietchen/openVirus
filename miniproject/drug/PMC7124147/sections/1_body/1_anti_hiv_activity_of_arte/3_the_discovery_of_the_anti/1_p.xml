<p>Keeping in mind the economic and political aspects surrounding the discovery and development of new drugs, we embarked on a non-funded project in order to study the possibility of reducing the price and the accompanying price fluctuations of artemisinin by identifying a second API in 
 <italic>A. annua</italic>. A reverse pharmacology approach was taken, which means that we had to find evidence that 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> is being used by thousands of people without any reports of toxicity. In many parts of the world, specifically in non-Western countries, people rely on traditional medicines as primary source for their health care needs (Farnsworth 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">1985</xref>). For a relatively new disease such as HIV, the identification of medicinal plants that work against these new diseases will therefore still undergo the process of trial and error. Nevertheless, the small-scale surveys conducted by Wilcox et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2011</xref>) and Noumi and Manga (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2011</xref>) revealed that HIV-infected patients had started to use 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> infusions for the treatment of HIV although the original treatment was intended for malaria. In both these surveys, the patients prepared a tea infusion from 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> either alone or with other plant species. Feedback from the non-governmental organisation Anamed also claimed that the herb is often used by HIV patients. This information is important in that we know that 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> is being used by thousands of people for the treatment of malaria without any toxicity reported thus far. In effect, a large uncontrolled clinical trial has been conducted exactly where it should take place, where the highest burden of HIV occurs. This has given us two important outcomes: The 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> tea infusion appears to be non-toxic and exhibits claimed in vivo anti-HIV activity. This is the first important step as toxicity is the biggest problem experienced in the drug discovery process. The next step in reverse pharmacology is to provide in vitro evidence that the traditional tea infusion does indeed have activity against HIV.
