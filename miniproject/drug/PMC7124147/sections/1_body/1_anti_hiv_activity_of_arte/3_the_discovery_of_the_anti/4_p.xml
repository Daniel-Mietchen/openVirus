<p>Another possible explanation for the anti-HIV activity is synergism between artemisinin and other compounds in the extract. With the inclusion of 
 <italic>A. afra</italic> (not containing artemisinin) and the observed activity of this sample, it appears that artemisinin had a very limited role to play, if any. We have shown (van der Kooy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2008</xref> and Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>) that these two species are chemically closely related with the major exception that artemisinin has not yet been detected in any 
 <italic>A. afra</italic> specimen. This was also one of the first reports that 
 <italic>A. afra</italic> possesses significant in vitro anti-HIV activity (Lubbe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>) and provides scientific evidence to the reports of Mulholland and Drewes (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2004</xref>) that patients given 
 <italic>A. afra</italic> in combination with standard HIV treatment reported improvement of symptoms compared to patients taking only standard HIV treatments. 
 <italic>Artemisia afra</italic> might therefore not only boost the immune system but may also have a direct activity against HIV.
