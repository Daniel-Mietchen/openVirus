<p>In vitro activity: Information regarding the in vitro anti-HIV activity of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> and artemisinin is rather limited. Chang and Woo (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2003</xref>) tested the methanolic extracts of 80 commonly used Korean medicinal plants against HIV in relation to virus—cell fusion inhibition. They used the syncytium inhibition assay, which is based on the interaction between the HIV-1 envelope and the cellular membrane protein CD4 on T-lymphocytes. Some inhibition was seen at the concentration tested (15.8 % ± 5.9), even though it was relatively low compared to some of the other 80 plants in the test series and therefore no other solvent extracts or fractions of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> were tested during this study. In reality, organic extracts are not used, but rather a tea infusion is brewed and administered. Various patents exist that cover the broad biological activity including the antiviral activity of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> in combination with other medicinal herbs (Zhang and Zhang
