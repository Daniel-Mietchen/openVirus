<p>In this chapter, we have highlighted some aspects regarding the drug discovery process and the severe shortcomings with our current approaches. This chapter is not about 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> but rather uses this medicinal plant as an example to illustrate some rather philosophical aspects in our approach to the general health care system in Western countries. The reverse pharmacology approach does indeed hold a key to a faster and more inexpensive development of new medicines, but in order for this approach to be fully developed and exploited, it will unfortunately take a lot of persuasion. The best way to persuade the powers that be is to provide the scientific evidence of the effectiveness of this approach. And this is just where the problem lies. It will only be supported once the evidence is provided, and in order to provide the evidence, it must first be supportedâ€”a classical catch 22.
