 <italic>Melilotosides</italic>: These relatively rare compounds did show good activity against the diarrhoea-causing pathogens 
 <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> and 
 <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 12.5 and 16.8 μg/mL, respectively), indicating that the traditional use of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> for the treatment of diarrhoea might be effective (Calzada et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2003</xref>). No reports could be found on their activity against HIV, although these compounds will be hydrolysed into their respective 
 <italic>o</italic>-coumaric acids in the digestive tract. The 
 <italic>o</italic>-coumaric acids have not yet been tested against HIV, but Zhuang et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2009</xref>) have reported that they exhibit some activity against the SARS virus.
