 <italic>Terpenoids</italic>: Artemisinin has been tested against various viruses. Efferth (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>) reported on the broad antiviral activity of artemisinin and its semi-synthetic derivative artesunate. Artesunate showed inhibition of HIV at levels of 600 nM, but no reports on the activity of artemisinin against HIV was given. Jung and Schinazi (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1994</xref>) reported on the anti-HIV activity of artemisinin, with EC
 <sub>50</sub> and IC
 <sub>50</sub> greater than 100 μM. Benedikt et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2005</xref>) have patented artemisinin and some of its derivatives against various viruses. In the patent description, the activity of artemisinin was given to be insignificant against HIV-1 and HIV-2. Lubbe et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>) found artemisinin to be inactive against HIV at a concentration of 25 μg/mL. We therefore have some conflicting reports on the activity of artemisinin against HIV probably caused by the different bioassays used.
