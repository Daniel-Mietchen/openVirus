<p>In our lab, we recently identified two new compounds in the tea infusion, 
 <italic>cis</italic>- and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-melilotoside, which was the first report of these compounds in any 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> spp. (Mouton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2013</xref>). FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">14.2</xref> illustrates the chemical structures of some of the compounds identified in the 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> tea infusion. Due to the limited chemical data, we do not yet know which compounds in the 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> tea infusion are responsible for the anti-HIV activity, and the possibility that it might be one of the 37 compounds already identified will be further discussed. We have to keep in mind that we are using in vitro bioassays, which will exclude any prodrugs being identified or any compound whose mechanism of action is different to that targeted in the bioassay. In this section, we will describe what is currently known on the anti-HIV activity of all the identified compounds to date.
