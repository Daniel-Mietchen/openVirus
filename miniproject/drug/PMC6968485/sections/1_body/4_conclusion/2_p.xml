<p>The solubility and the stability of AMF were poor. And literatures have reported that the bioavailability of AMF was very low 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. So in this experiment, the AMF-loaded TPGS/soluplus mixed micelles were prepared, and the properties of the micelles 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> were evaluated. The size of micelle was small and its physicochemical properties remained relatively stable within 60 d. In the cytotoxicity test, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of micelles to A549 cells was much smaller than that of monomers, which was about one-twelfth of that of monomers. And the cellular uptake was lower than that of AMF monomers due to the negative electricity on the surface of micelles and cell membranes. The metabolites of AMF monomer and AMF-loaded mixed micelles were also studied. A total of 34 metabolites of AMF monomer were detected. The main metabolic pathways were oxidation, oxidation and methylation, methylation and acetylation. In rats, AMF was metabolized mainly through the gastrointestinal tract and then discharged from the body. It was difficult to be absorbed into the blood and exert its pharmacological effect and its bioavailability was low. Nevertheless, AMF-loaded mixed micelles had 14 metabolites in rats, 11 in feces, 6 in urine, and 3 in plasma. The increase of metabolites in plasma and urine indicated that the bioavailability of AMF was improved. But it was difficult for AMF to be metabolized by intestinal flora and various enzymes after being encapsulated in micelles.
