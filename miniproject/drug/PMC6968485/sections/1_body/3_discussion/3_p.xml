<p>The CMC of different carrier ratios measured in the experiment were all low, and when the TPGS/soluplus was 1: 3, the CMC was the lowest, indicating that the mixed nanomicelles prepared at this ratio had good stability. AMF-loaded TPGS/soluplus mixed micelles exhibited good stability, which was determined by the structure of micelles. AMF could be wrapped by the two carriers in the core of the nanomicelles, which avoided the direct contact with the matrix and prevented the degradation of drugs by gastric acid and P450 enzyme. As a result, the drug could get into the blood to cycle in the form of micelles, and also delayed the release of drugs, to ensure that it can play a more effective pharmacological role (Torchilin,

Compared with large-size drugs, it can promote the absorption of poorly soluble drugs, significantly improve the absorption of drugs in the gastrointestinal tract, and reduce filtration of glomeruli to improve drug bioavailability (Wu et al.,
