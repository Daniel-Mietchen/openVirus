<p>By comparing the metabolites of AMF monomers with those of AMF-loaded micelles in rats, it was found that the metabolites of AMF monomers were mainly distributed in feces, 34 metabolites were found, only 3 metabolites were found in urine, and no metabolites were found in plasma and bile, which indicated that AMF monomers were difficult to enter blood, urine and bile. And most drugs passed through stomach, after intestinal metabolism, it was excreted 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> through feces, which proved once again that AMF monomers were water-insoluble and ester-insoluble compounds with very low bioavailability. Metabolites in micelles are also mainly distributed in feces, with 11 metabolites and no metabolites found in bile. However, three metabolites were detected in plasma and six in urine. This indicated that AMF could be absorbed into blood and urine or be absorbed more into the blood when it was prepared into micelles, and the metabolites could be detected. The wider distribution of metabolites indicated that more drugs can enter the blood circulation. Especially in plasma, there was a significant increase in metabolites, which reflected indirectly that the bioavailability of AMF was improved. However, the metabolites of micelles in feces were much less than those of monomers in feces, which illuminated that after encapsulated in micelles, it was difficult for the AMF monomers to be metabolized by enzymes and intestinal flora in the gastrointestinal tract, and they were directly excreted in the form of micelles, which also reflected that the stability of AMF-loaded micelles was good 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. In the metabolite analysis, not only a variety of AMF metabolites were identified but also the indirect response to the changes in bioavailability, which was killing two birds with one stone.
