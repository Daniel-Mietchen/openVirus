<p>In this study, AMF-loaded TPGS/soluplus mixed micelles showed higher cytotoxicity, which may be related to the toxicity of drug carrier TPGS to cancer cells. The anticancer activity of TPGS was reported to be associated to its apoptosis inducing properties by the generation of reactive oxygen species, which might be the reason for the toxicity of high concentration of blank micelles to cancer cells. It has been reported that the toxicity of soluplus-encapsulated drugs to cancer cells was significantly lower than that of TPGS/soluplus-encapsulated mixed nanomicelles (Bernabeu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), which suggested that TPGS played an important role in increasing drug toxicity. The cytotoxicity of the mixed nanomicelles was high, which may be related to the combined effect of carrier and drug encapsulation (Bernabeu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Ding et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).
