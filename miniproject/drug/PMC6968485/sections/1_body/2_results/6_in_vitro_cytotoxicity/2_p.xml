<p>A549 cells were commonly used in the study of cytotoxicity. In this study, the cell fatality rates were measured after incubated in different concentrations of AMF and AMF-loaded mixed micelles. The results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>. And the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of AMF and AMF-loaded mixed micelles calculated by GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) were 83.09 ± 0.65 μg/mL and 6.11 ± 0.74 μg/mL, respectively. As can be seen from the figure and the calculation results, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of AMF-loaded micelles was almost one-twelfth of that of AMF, indicating that AMF-loaded micelles have much greater toxicity to A549 cells than AMF. Therefore, it was speculated that AMF-loaded micelles had much higher lethality to cancer cells than AMF, and had the potential to treat cancer. At the same time, it can be seen that when AMF was at a lower concentration, the fatality rate of A549 cells was less than 0, which indicating that the low concentration of AMF had a small inhibitory effect on A549 cells, and the cells continued growing under conditions of sufficient nutrition, so the cell concentration showed an increasing trend, and the cell inhibition rate was less than 0.
