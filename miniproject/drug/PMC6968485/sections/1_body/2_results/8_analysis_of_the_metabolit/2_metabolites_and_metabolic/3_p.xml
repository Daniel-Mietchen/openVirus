<p>In the metabolism, metabolites were mainly distributed in feces, and none of them were found in bile or plasma, which indicated that the bioavailability of AMF was low. The main metabolic pathways were oxidation, methylation, oxidation and methylation, acetylation, hydrogenation. Oxidation is its main metabolic reaction, which is related to its antioxidant properties. The results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figure 7</xref>. No monoflavone was found in the metabolites of AMF, which indicated that the biflavones formed by C–C bonding had stable structure and were not easy to break into monoflavone, which was different from that conjugated by ether bond (Chen et al.,
