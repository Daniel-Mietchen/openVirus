<p>The AMF-loaded mixed micelles was stored at 4 °C for 60 d. Particle size, PDI, Zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency of micelle were determined and the clarity of the micelles was observed at 0 d, 15 d, 30 d, and 60 d. The results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. It could be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref> that there was no trend of polymerization between micelles, and Zeta potential did not change significantly. And the results of encapsulation rate indicated that it was difficult for micelles to self-degrade. From the appearance, micelle solution was still transparent and clear, without precipitation. The above results indicated that the AMF micelles could be kept relatively stable at 4 °C for a certain time.
