<p>The results of cellular uptake of AMF monomers and AMF-loaded TPGS/soluplus mixed micelles are shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref> indicates that the cell uptake of AMF-loaded mixed micelles was a time and concentration-dependent process. The cellular uptake of AMF monomers increased obviously with the extension of time in 1–6 h, and the cellular uptake of AMF-loaded TPGS/soluplus mixed micelles increased in 1–4 h, and remained almost unchanged in 4–6 h. Moreover, the cellular uptake of AMF-loaded TPGS/soluplus mixed micelles was significantly lower than that of AMF (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), which was due to the negative charge on the micelle and the negative charge on the outer surface of the cell membrane, resulting in a lower uptake of the micelle than that of the monomer.
