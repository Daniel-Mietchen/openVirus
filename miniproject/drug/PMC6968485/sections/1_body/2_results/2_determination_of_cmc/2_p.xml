<p>The CMC was used as an important indicator to evaluate the stability of micelles. In this experiment, the iodine hydrophobic probe method was used to determine the CMC. As a small hydrophobic molecule, the soluble iodine preferred located in the hydrophobic microenvironment of the copolymer, leading to the conversion of I
 <sup>-</sup> to I
 <sub>2</sub> in the solution. Therefore, the ultraviolet absorption of the solution changed, and it can be measured with an ultraviolet spectrophotometer. The measured mass ratios of TPGS and soluplus were 0: 4, 1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1 and 4: 0. Their CMC values are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>. It can be seen from the figure that the CMC values of different mass ratios were very low. When the mass ratio of TPGS and soluplus was 1: 3, the CMC value of the micelles was the lowest. Due to its low CMC, mixed micelles have high stability and the ability to maintain their integrity even when diluted in the blood circulation was relatively insensitive, and have a longer circulation time compared to surfactant micelles
