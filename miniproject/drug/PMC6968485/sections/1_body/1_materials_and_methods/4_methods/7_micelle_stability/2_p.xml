<p>To test the optimal formulation’s storage stability, the AMF-loaded TPGS/soluplus mixed micelles was stored at 4 °C for 60 d. Particle size, PDI, Zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency of the drug-loaded micelles were measured at 0 d, 15 d, 30 d and 60 d, respectively, and the clarification of the micelles was observed.</p>
