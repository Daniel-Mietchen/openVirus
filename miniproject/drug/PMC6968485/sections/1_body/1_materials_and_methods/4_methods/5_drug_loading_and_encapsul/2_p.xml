<p>The encapsulation efficiency (EE) and drug loading (DL) were determined by HPLC. A chromatographic column (ZORBAX SB-C18, 5 μm, 4.6 mm × 150 mm, Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) was used. The mobile phases were water (A, 0.1% of formic acid) and acetonitrile (B), and the flow rate was 1 mL/min. Gradient elution was adopted and the elution procedure was as follows: 35–45% B (0–10 min), 45–35% B (10–10.1 min), and 35% B (10.1–15 min). The sample was injected at a volume of 20 μL and the detection wavelength was 338 nm.</p>
