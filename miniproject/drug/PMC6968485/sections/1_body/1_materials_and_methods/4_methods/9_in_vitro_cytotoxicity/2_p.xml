 <italic>In vitro</italic> cytotoxicity of AMF-loaded TPGS/soluplus mixed micelles was determined using the CCK-8 assay. The cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5000 cells/well, and incubated 24 h to allow cell attachment. After 24 h, the original medium was sucked out. Then, the cells were incubated with AMF and AMF-loaded TPGS/soluplus mixed micelles of different concentration. The concentrations of AMF was ranged from 2000 μg/mL to 15.6 μg/mL, and AMF-loaded TPGS/soluplus mixed micelles ranged from100 μg/mL to 0.78 μg/mL. The cells were incubated for another 24 h. And then the medium was removed, fresh medium and CCK-8 (10 μL) were added and the cells were incubated for 2 h. Finally, the absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader, and each treatment was measured for three times (Bernabeu et al.,
