<p>The critical micelle concentration (CMC) is an important indicator for evaluating the stability of micelles. The lower the CMC, the more stable the nanomicelles. In this experiment, the CMC of AMF-loaded TPGS/soluplus mixed nanomicelles was measured using the iodine hydrophobic probe method and determined by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer. To prepare I
 <sub>2</sub>/KI standard solutions, 0.5 g of I
 <sub>2</sub> and 1 g of KI were dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water. Then different ratios of TPGS/soluplus solutions with a concentration of 0.00001–0.2% were prepared, and 25 μL of I
 <sub>2</sub>/KI standard solution was added to each sample. Next, the mixtures were equilibrated at room temperature for 12 h in the dark. Finally, the ultraviolet absorbance value of each variant polymer concentrations were measured at 366 nm by a UV spectrophotometer. Plot the absorption intensity against the logarithm of the polymer mass concentration. When the absorbance increased sharply, the concentration of the micelle carrier was equivalent to the CMC value of the nanomicelle (Zhao et al.,
