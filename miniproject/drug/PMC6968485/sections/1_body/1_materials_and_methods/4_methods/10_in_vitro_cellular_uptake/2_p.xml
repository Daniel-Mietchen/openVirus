<p>To evaluate the cellular uptake of AMF and AMF-loaded TPGS/soluplus mixed micelles, AMF collected from A549 cell was determined by HPLC. Briefly, A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at the density of 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well and allowed to attach for 24 h at 37 °C in CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The original medium was removed, and each well was washed with PBS for three times. Then AMF and AMF-loaded TPGS/soluplus mixed micelles were added at the concentration of 30 μg/mL and the cells were incubated for 1 h, 2 h, 4 h and 6 h, respectively. Untreated cells acted as control. At predetermined time-points, the medium was removed and the cells were rinsed with PBS. Then 0.25 mL trypsin was added to digest the cells. When the cells are digested, they were collected in EP tube and centrifuged at 157 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and the cells were resuspend with 200 μL PBS. The cells were broken with ultrasonic for 5 min and centrifuged at 21,380 × g for 10 min. AMF content in the supernatant was measured by HPLC method and the protein content was also determined using BCA protein assay kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. All experiments were repeated in triplicate (Bernabeu et al.,
