<p>The preparation of AMF-loaded TPGS/soluplus mixed micelles was carried out by membrane hydration method (Zhao et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Briefly, AMF (2 mg), soluplus (60 mg), and TPGS (20 mg) were dissolved in 20 mL methanol in a round bottom flask. Then, the solvent was evaporated by rotary evaporation to obtain a thin film. Subsequently, 8 mL water was added in the round bottom flask and hydration by ultrasonic for 1 h to obtain a clear micelle solution. After that, it was ultrasonic crushed for 5 min. Finally, the micelles were filtered with 0.22 μm filter membrane to remove unencapsulated drug. The blank micelles were prepared by the same method.
