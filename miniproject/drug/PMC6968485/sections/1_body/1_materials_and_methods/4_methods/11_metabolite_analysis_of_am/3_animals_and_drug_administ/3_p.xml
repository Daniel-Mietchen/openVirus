<p>The experimental rats were randomly divided into 12 groups with 3 rats per group (groups 1 and 2, the blank blood sample groups; group 3 and 4, the blank bile sample groups; groups 5 and 6, the blank urine and feces sample groups; group 7 and 8, the experimental blood sample groups; groups 9 and 10, the experimental bile sample groups; group 11 and 12, the experimental urine and feces sample groups). The volume of gavage was 16 mL/kg. The prepared AMF suspension was orally administered to 9 rats of groups 7, 9 and 11 at a dose of 100 mg/kg, and the prepared AMF-loaded TPGS/soluplus mixed micelles was orally administered to 9 rats of groups 8, 10, and 12 at a dose of 100 mg/kg (equal to the AMF). Groups 1, 3, and 5 were given aqueous solution of 0.5% CMC-Na, and groups 2, 4, and 6 were given blank micelle of the same concentration as the IGG-loaded micelle.</p>
