<p>UHPLC was performed on Shimazu’s ultra-high performance liquid chromatography system (Kyoto, Japan), which was equipped with a triple TOF™ 5600
 <sup>+</sup> MS/MS system (AB SCIEX, Redwood City, CA). The chromatographic separation was carried on Poroshell 120 EC-C18 (2.1 × 100 mm, 2.7 μm) with a Security Guard® UHPLC C
 <sub>18</sub> pre-column (Poroshell). The mobile phases were water (A, 0.1% formic acid) and acetonitrile (B), and the elution procedures were as follows: 2 0–36% B (0–5 min), 3 6–59% B (5–14 min), 59–73% B (1 4–18 min), 73–95%B (18–21 min), and 95% B (21–25 min). The flow rate was 0.3 mL/min and the injection volume was 2 μL. The column temperature was 40 °C, and the automatic injector temperature was 4 °C.
