<p>Mixed micelles are self-assembled micelles of two or more chemical materials and drugs with nano-size. Mixed micelles have many advantages over single micelles. First, they can encapsulate drugs in the core region to prevent degradation of drugs by external substances, such as gastric acid and cytochrome P450, resulting in the improvement of their stability (Nishiyama &amp; Kataoka, 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Chiappetta &amp; Sosnik, 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Second, these carriers are nanostructures formed by self-assembly of amphiphilic copolymers in aqueous media, exposing hydrophilic tails outside and hiding the hydrophobic head in the core region. Consequently, the solubility of hydrophobic drugs is increased (Moretton et al.,

 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). In addition, the mixed micelles range from 20 to 200 nm is large enough to avoid rapid elimination of renal tubules, and also small enough to penetrate blood vessels, enhance drug targeting and reduce toxicity to nonspecific organs. Besides, mixed micelles can also reduce adverse effects of drugs, increase drug loading and delay drug release, so they have been widely used in recent years, which has considerable research prospects (Bernabeu et al.,
