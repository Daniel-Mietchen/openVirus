<p>Recently, cancer is one of the most common lethal diseases in the world. The main treatment methods are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. But the treatment results are not completely satisfactory, the cure rate and the life quality of patients is low. In these days, researchers all over the word make every effort to develop new drugs that can treat cancer effectively. AMF is a biflavonoids composed of two molecules of apigenin by C–C bonds. Due to its low toxicity to normal cells and its anti-cancer effect, it is expected to have a better effect in the treatment of cancer. Because nanomedicines have good targeting and good solubility in the treatment of cancer, the preparation of nanomicelles with low toxicity to normal cells into nanomicelles can reduce side effects and enhance drug stability, prolong the release time and can also increases its targeting and toxicity to cancer cells (Wan et al.,
