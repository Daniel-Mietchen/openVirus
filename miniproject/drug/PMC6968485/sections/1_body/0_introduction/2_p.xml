<p>Ginkgo is a deciduous tree of ginkgo family and ginkgo genus. It is an ancient gymnosperm with a growth history of several hundred million years (Gong et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Ginkgo biloba leaves are rich in more than 200 kinds of compounds such as lactones, polysaccharides, flavones, organic acids and phenolic acids (Ude et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Biflavonoids as special flavonoids, their activities are higher than that of monoflavonoids in some aspects. Therefore, a more detailed study on biflavonoids has a good application prospect and significance. As a kind of biflavonoids in ginkgo biloba leaves, amentoflavone (AMF) has many biological activities, such as antioxidant (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Lee &amp; An, 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), anti-inflammatory (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), antifungal (Hwang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), antiviral (Coulerie et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), hypoglycemic (Su et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), anti-tumor (Guruvayoorappan &amp; Kuttan, 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), and inducing apoptosis (Pei et al.,
