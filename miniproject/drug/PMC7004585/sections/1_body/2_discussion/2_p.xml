 </sup> ETV showed a better efficacy than KS in reducing HBV replication and serum HBV-DNA level, while KS was more effective in reducing serum HBsAg, hepatitis B virus e antigen (HBeAg), and hepatitis B virus c antigen (HBcAg) level, which may explain the improved antiviral effect of KS combined with ETV. This systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of KS combined with ETV for CHB. In order to provide more references for the clinical treatment of CHB.
