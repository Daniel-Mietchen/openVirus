<p>More than 240 million people worldwide are suffering from chronic hepatitis B (CHB).

 </sup> Once antiviral therapy is initiated, patients with CHB need to take antiviral drugs for a long period of time, which may lead to related side effects and drug resistance. The mechanism of nucleos (t)ide analogues in the treatment of CHB is to inhibit viral replication and reduce serum Hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV-DNA) titer. However, its effect on reducing hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) transcription is very limited.

 </sup> Entecavir (ETV) is one of the preferred antiviral agents for antiviral therapy recommended in several guidelines.

 </sup> have shown that KS combined with other antiviral drugs have a better antiviral effect in reducing the level of serum virological indicators, improving drug resistance and delaying the progression of liver fibrosis. This meta-analysis aims to provide a basis for clinical treatment for CHB, and explore whether KS combined with ETV has the advantages of improving efficacy and reducing side effects in antiviral therapy for patients with CHB.
