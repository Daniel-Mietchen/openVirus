 </sup>. Of note, 12 to 24 hours post-treatment, the major inflammation symptoms decreased significantly with increased lymphocytes counts and blood oxygen saturation. Improved vital signs were also observed. Currently, although the exact underlying mechanisms are unknown, it is reasonable to speculate that the antibodies may bind the virus and prevent virus-host cell interaction, and therefore prevent infection. In addition, NK cells and other immune cells may also be involved in clearing the virus by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. However, the potential risks associated with plasma usage, including pathogen transmission and allergic reaction, should be considered, and therefore this strategy may only be applied for a clinical emergency following standardized procedures. On the other hand, specific immunoglobulin could be a better option for treating critically ill patients with SARS-COV-2 infection.
