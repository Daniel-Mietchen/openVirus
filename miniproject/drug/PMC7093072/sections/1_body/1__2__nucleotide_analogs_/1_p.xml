<p id="p-9">The first case of COVID-19 in the United States was confirmed on January 20, 2020, by qPCR assay with samples from the patientâ€™s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. Probes were based on genomic sequence of 2019-nCoV released by scientists from China. After the development of radiographic pneumonia, the patient was treated with remdesivir intravenously and almost all clinical symptoms resolved the following day
