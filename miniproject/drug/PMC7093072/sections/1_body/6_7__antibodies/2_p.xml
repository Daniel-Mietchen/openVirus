 </sup>. The German company Inflarx has developed a monoclonal antibody against the human C5a molecule. By specifically binding and inhibiting C5a-mediated biological functions, including the release of neutrophil chemotaxis and intra-cellular lysozyme, the antibodies can limit excessive inflammation without inhibiting immune function. Clinical trials on this antibody are now underway in China to potentially reduce both lung damage and death caused by sepsis infection
