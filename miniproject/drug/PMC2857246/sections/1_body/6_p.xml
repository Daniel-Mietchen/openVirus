<p>A widely administered protective vaccine is needed to prevent transmission and infection and preserve the efficacy of antiviral agents. Indiscriminant administration of these agents could support proliferation of antiviral resistance in pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus or an evolved variant. Appropriate use of antiviral chemotherapy is complex. Identifying the groups at high risk for serious illness for drug therapy and appropriate antiviral therapy in situations of co-circulation of seasonal and pandemic (H1N1) viruses with various susceptibility patterns needs elucidation. Without clear evidence-based guidance, a global public health disaster could occur if pandemic (H1N1) 2009 reemerges later this year with higher virulence or widespread antiviral drug resistance.</p>
