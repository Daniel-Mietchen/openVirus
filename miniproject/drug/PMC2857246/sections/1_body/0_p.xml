 <bold>To the Editor:</bold> The emergence of influenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in North America and associated illness and death suggest that humanity faces a dangerous threat. Viruses isolated from a sample of patients with confirmed cases in early phases of the outbreak demonstrated resistance to amantadine and rimantadine. At present, circulating viruses appear to be largely susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, although oseltamivir resistance has been observed in recent cases in Europe, Asia, and North America (

Such cases demonstrate that oseltamivir resistance can emerge in infected persons treated with oseltamivir. To date, all isolates tested have been susceptible to zanamivir.
