<p>The first viable oseltamivir-resistant human influenza viruses (H1N1) emerged and became prevalent in the United States and Europe in the 2007â€“08 influenza season, and prevalence of such viruses has continued in 2009. The potential for overuse of antiviral drugs, especially oseltamivir, to select for existing antiviral drug-resistant strains is unknown. Ecologic studies suggest a lack of association between prevalence of oseltamivir use and prevalence of oseltamivir resistance (
