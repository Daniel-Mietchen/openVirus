<p>Vaccines are being deployed in some well-resourced countries but are generally not available to the public. It appears that little if any protection is offered from previous seasonal influenza vaccines. In the spring of 1918, epidemiologic observations indicated the likely emergence and spread of another influenza virus (H1N1) that caused few deaths. However, later that year, transmission resurged and was associated in 2 waves with increased illness and deaths. We cannot predict whether the 2009 pathogen will follow a similar temporal pattern and evolve toward increased virulence. Even if vaccine development and delivery could be achieved within 6 months, an aggressive schedule, large supplies of vaccine against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 may not be available until late 2009.</p>
