<p>Cell viability is determined with the MTT (3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo (-z-y1)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide) method (Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110_3">2008a</xref>). Consecutive threefold serial dilutions (100 μl) of compounds/extracts and reference compounds are added to cell monolayers in replicates. Blank medium is used as a control. After 3 days of incubation at 37°C, 12 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) is added to each well. The plate is further incubated at 37°C for 3 h to allow the formation of the formazan product. After removal of the medium, 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is added to dissolve the formazan crystals. After 15 min, the contents of the wells are homogenized on a microplate shaker. The optical densities are then measured with a microplate spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 540 nm. The median cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) is calculated as the concentration of the tested sample that reduced the number of viable cells to 50% of the untreated control. The maximal non-cytotoxic concentration (MNCC) is defined as the maximal concentration of the sample that does not exert a cytotoxic effect and resulted in more than 90% viable cells.
