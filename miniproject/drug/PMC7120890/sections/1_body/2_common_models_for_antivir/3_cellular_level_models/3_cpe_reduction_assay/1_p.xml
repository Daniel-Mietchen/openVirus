<p>The antiviral activities of the test compounds/extracts are measured with the CPE inhibition assay (Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111_3">2008b</xref>). Viral suspension (200 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml, 100 μl) is added to each well of a 96-well plate containing a confluent cell monolayer. After incubation at 37°C for 2 h, the virus solution is removed, and 100 μl of consecutive threefold serial dilutions of the test compounds/extracts and reference compounds are added to each well, using the MNCC as the highest concentration. An infection control without samples is also included. The plates are incubated at 37°C in a humidified CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere (5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>) for 24 h, after which the CPE is assessed. The virus-induced CPE is scored as follows: 0  =  no CPE, 1  =  0–25% CPE, 2  =  25–50% CPE, 3  =  50–75% CPE, and 4  =  75–100% CPE. The reduction in virus multiplication is calculated as a percentage of the virus control (% virus control  =  CPE
 <sub>exp</sub>/CPE
 <sub>virus control</sub>  ×  100). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the CPE with respect to the virus control is estimated using the Reed–Muench method. The selective index (SI) is calculated as the ratio CC
 <sub>50</sub>/IC
 <sub>50</sub>.
