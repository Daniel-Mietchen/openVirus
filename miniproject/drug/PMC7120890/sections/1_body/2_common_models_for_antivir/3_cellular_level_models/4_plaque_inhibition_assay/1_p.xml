<p>For plaque inhibition assays, confluent monolayer MDCK cells cultured in a 6-well tissue culture plate (1  ×  10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) are infected with a mixture of approximately 500 PFU/ml of virus. After 60 min for virus adsorption, the solution is removed and the cells are washed twice with pre-warmed MEM medium, and replaced with overlay medium (DMEM containing 10 μg/ml trypsin, 1% low melting agarose, without serum), containing test compounds/extracts at different concentration. After incubating cultures for 2–3 days at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, monolayers are fixed with 4% formaldehyde solution for 30 min and the agarose is then removed by flowing water and stained with 1% (w/v) crystal violet solution. The plaques are counted by visual examination and percentage of plaque inhibition is calculated as relative to the control without samples. A required concentration to reduce the 50% plaque number (EC
 <sub>50</sub>), is calculated by regression analysis of the dose–response curves generated from these data (Song et al.
