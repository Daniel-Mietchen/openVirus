<p>Since the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I is very well characterized, it is used as a model in the experiments. Maintaining the same conditions as in radioactive labeling primer experiments (Tuske et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR03_3">2000</xref>; Lestienne et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR04_3">2003</xref>), it could be assessed in different settings for Klenow activity. Briefly, DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) is incubated with a plant constituent, 5′-fluorescein-end-labeled primer-template substrate (50 nM), 200 μM deoxynucleotide, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 5, 6, 7 or 8, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0, 10, 100 or 200 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> and 0, 50, 100 or 200 mM NaCl. Reaction mixtures are incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The reaction is quenched by the addition of stop solution (10 μl) (80% deionized formamide, 10 mM EDTA, pH 8, 1 mg/ml xylene cyanol, and 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue) heated to 90°C for 2 min and placed on ice. Products are resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gels in an automated ALF DNA sequencer (GE Healthcare). Analyses of the deoxynucleotide incorporation are carried out with Allelelinks software, version 1.0 (GE Healthcare).
