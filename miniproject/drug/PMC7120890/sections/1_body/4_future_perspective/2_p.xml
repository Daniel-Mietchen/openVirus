<p>Since an obvious number of plant extracts have showed positive results, it seems reasonable to conclude that there are probably many potential antiviral agents. Further characterization of the active ingredients will reveal useful compounds. Some of these compounds belong to a wide range of different structural classes, e.g. coumarins, flavonoids, tannins, alkaloids, lignans, terpenes, naphtho- and anthraquinones, polysaccharides, proteins and peptides. There may also be novel phytochemicals. Although large numbers of new compounds have been isolated from medicinal plants, only some have been marketed as pharmaceutical products. Several compounds have been or are undergoing various phases of clinical trials. The traditional use of some of the medicinal plants for the treatment of infectious diseases of viral origin, therefore, is justified. In conclusion, active phytochemicals will provide important information for the development of new medicinal plant products in controlling the threats posed by some pathogenic viruses.</p>
