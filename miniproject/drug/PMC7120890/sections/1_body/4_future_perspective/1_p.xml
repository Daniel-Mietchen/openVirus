<p>Not only the common viral diseases are still fatal, but new viral infections have emerged in worldwide in recent years. The currently available antivirals though effective are too expensive for most developing countries. Thus, the development of safe, effective and inexpensive antiviral drugs is among the top global priorities since many viruses are not yet curable and mortality rates are still high for example with HIV and hepatitis. Because of the tendency of viral mutation to drug-resistant forms, it is essential to continue the search for useful and novel natural antiviral agents, which can be expected to prolong the efficacy of drug therapy. Recently a lot of attention has been given to screening of various species of medicinal plants especially with antiviral activity (Asres et al.
