<p>The Tibetan herb 
 <italic>Potentilla anserina</italic> L. has been widely used in China for many thousands of years to treat hepatitis-B. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the ethanol extract of the rhizomes led to the isolation of a triterpenoid saponin (TS) that was determined to be 2

 <italic>α</italic>-trihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid 
 <italic>β</italic>-d-glucopyranosyl ester (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4_3" ref-type="fig">3.4</xref>; Zhao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR197_3">2008</xref>). Using models of HBV infection, this compound was evaluated for its effect on HBV antigene expression in the 2.2.15 cell line 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) activities in Peking ducklings 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (Zhao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR197_3">2008</xref>). Results showed that it could decrease the expression levels of HBsAg, HBeAg and HBVDNA in the 2.2.15 cell culture. The antiviral study 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> on Peking ducklings also demonstrated that this compound inhibits duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) DNA replication (Zhao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR197_3">2008</xref>).
