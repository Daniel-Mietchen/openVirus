<p>The ever increasing resistance of human pathogens to current anti-infective agents is a serious medical problem, leading to the need to develop novel antibiotic prototype molecules. In the case of viruses, the search for antiviral agents involves additional difficulties, particularly due to the nature of the infectious viruses. Thus, many compounds that may cause the death of viruses are also very likely to injure the host cell that haibours them. Natural products are increasingly appreciated as leads for drug discovery and development. Screening studies have been carried out in order to find antiviral agents from natural sources, and the extracts of traditional medicinal plants, marine organisms and fungi often show antiviral activities. The evidence indicates that there may be numerous potentially useful antiviral phytochemicals in nature, waiting to be evaluated and exploited. In addition, other plants, not previously utilized medicinally, may also reveal antivirals. Compounds from medicinal plants are of interest as possible source to control viral infection, which include flavonoids, alkaloids, polysaccharides, organic acids, essential oils, and others. Natural substances offer interesting pharmacological perspectives for antiviral drug development in regard to broad-spectrum antiviral properties and novel mechanisms of action.</p>
