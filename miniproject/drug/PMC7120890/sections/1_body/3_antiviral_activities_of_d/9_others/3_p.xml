<p>Recently, it was reported that emodin isolated from the roots of 
 <italic>Rheum tanguticum</italic> possess remarkable antiviral activity against HSV infection 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (Xiong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185_3">2011</xref>), and thus emodin is a promising agent in the clinical therapy of HSV infection. Besides, seven new homoflavonoid glucosides, pedunculosumosides A–G were isolated from the whole plant of 
 <italic>Ophioglossum pedunculosum</italic>, pedunculosumosides A and C exhibit modest activity of blocking HBsAg secretion with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 238.0 and 70.5 μM, respectively (Wan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178_3">2011</xref>).
