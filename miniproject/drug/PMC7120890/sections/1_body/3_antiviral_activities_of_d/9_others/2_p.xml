<p>Chrysophanic acid (1,8-dihydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone), isolated from the Australian Aboriginal medicinal plant 
 <italic>Dianella longifolia</italic>, has been found to inhibit the replication of poliovirus types 2 and 3 (
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>) 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7_3" ref-type="fig">3.7</xref>; Semple et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153_3">2001</xref>). The compound inhibited an early stage in the viral replication cycle, but did not have an irreversible virucidal effect on poliovirus particles. Chrysophanic acid did not have significant antiviral activity against five other viruses which were tested: Coxsackievirus types A21 and B4, human rhinovirus type 2 (
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>), and the enveloped viruses Ross River virus (
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>) and HSV-1 (
 <italic>Herpesviridae</italic>). Four structurally-related anthraquinones – rhein, 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone, emodin (3-methyl-1,6,8-trihydroxyanthraquinone) and aloe-emodin were also tested for activity against poliovirus type 3 (Semple et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153_3">2001</xref>). None of the four compounds was as active as chrysophanic acid against the virus. The results suggested that two hydrophobic positions on the chrysophanic acid molecule (C-6 and the methyl group attached to C-3) were important for the compound’s activity against poliovirus (Semple et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153_3">2001</xref>).
