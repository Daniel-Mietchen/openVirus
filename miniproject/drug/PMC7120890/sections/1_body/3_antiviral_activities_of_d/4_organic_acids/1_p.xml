<p>Besides, some natural organic acids also possess antiviral activities. Three caffe­oyl­quinic acid derivatives, namely 3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, 3,5-di-O- caffeoylquinic acid, and 3-O-caffeoylquinic acid isolated from traditional Chinese medicinal plant 
 <italic>Schefflera heptaphylla</italic> were investigated for their antiviral activity against RSV (see Fig.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104_3">2005</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105_3">b</xref>). 3,4-Di-O-caffeoylquinic acid and 3,5-di-O- caffeoylquinic acid exhibited potent anti-RSV activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.33 μM (1.2 μg/ml) and 1.16 μM (0.6 μg/ml), respectively, in a plaque reduction assay. The antiviral action of 3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid and 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid was specific against RSV, as they had no obvious antiviral activity against influenza A (Flu A), Coxsackie B3 (Cox B3), and Herpes simplex type one (HSV-1) viruses (Li et al.

Studies indicated that the dicaffeoylquinic acids could inhibit RSV directly, extracellularly, but only at much higher concentrations than seen in standard assays. Moreover, they could not inhibit RSV attachment to host cells, and could not protect HEp-2 cells from RSV infection at lower concentrations. The data suggest that the compounds exert their anti-RSV effects via the inhibition of virus–cell fusion in the early stage, and the inhibition of cell–cell fusion at the end of the RSV replication cycle (Li et al.
