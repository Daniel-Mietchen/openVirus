<p>The 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-viral activity has partially been demonstrated (Fusco et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55_3">2010</xref>). The 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment of polysaccharide extract from 
 <italic>Echinacea purpurea</italic>, a widely consumed botanical product, indicated that mice infected with WSN influenza A and treated with 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> polysaccharide extract had less weight loss than untreated mice but similar pulmonary viral titers. 
 <italic>Echinacea</italic>-treated mice had lower systemic and pulmonary KC and IL-10 levels and lower systemic IFN-Î³ levels following influenza infection. These suggest that 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> alters the clinical course of influenza infection in mice through modulation of cytokines and not direct antiviral activity
