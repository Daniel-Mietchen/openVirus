<p>As potential anti-HIV drug candidates, sulfated polysaccharides offer a number of promising features. Some polysulfates show a differential inhibitory activity against different HIV strains, suggesting that marked differences exist in the target molecules with which polysulfates interact. They not only inhibit the cytopathic effect of HIV, but also prevent HIV-induced syncytium (giant cell) formation. Furthermore, experiments carried out with sulfate samples of increasing molecular weight and with sulfated cyclodextrins of different degrees of sulfation have shown that antiviral activity increases with increasing molecular weight and degree of sulfation (Duarte et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181_3">2010</xref>; Karmakar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81_3">2010</xref>). A sugar backbone is not strictly needed for the anti-HIV activity of polysulfates because sulfated polymers composed of a carbonâ€“carbon backbone have also proved to be highly efficient anti-HIV agents

From studies on their mechanism of action, polysulfates appear to exert their anti-HIV activity by shielding off the positively charged sites in the V3 loop of the viral envelope glycoprotein (gp120), which is necessary for virus attachment to cell surface heparan sulfate, a primary binding site, before more specific binding occurs to the CD4 receptor of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cells (Huheihel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70_3">2002</xref>). This general mechanism also explains the broad antiviral activity of polysulfates against enveloped viruses. Variations in the viral envelope glycoprotein region may result in differences in the susceptibility of different enveloped viruses to compounds that interact with their envelope glycoproteins. The efficacy of sulfated polysaccharide against herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and -2) were demonstrated
