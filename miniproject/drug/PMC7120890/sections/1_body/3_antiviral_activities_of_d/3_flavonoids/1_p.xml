<p>Flavonoids are very common natural products widely existing in plant kingdom. Flavonoids, including genistein, catechins and so on, have been shown to reduce the infectivity of a variety of viruses affecting humans and animals, including adenovirus, HSV, HIV, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and rotavirus (Andres et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7_3">2009</xref>). Current results about the mechanisms of action underlying their antiviral properties suggest a combination of effects on both the virus and the host cell. Flavonoids have been reported to affect virus binding, entry, replication, viral protein translation, formation of certain virus envelope glycoprotein complexes and virus release (Andres et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7_3">2009</xref>). They also affect a variety of host cell signaling processes, including induction of gene transcription factors and secretion of cytoÂ­kines (Andres et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7_3">2009</xref>). Although enormous promising results were from 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, a few 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> results can partly confirm their 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy (Miki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127_3">2007</xref>). Flavonoids possess antiviral properties against a wide range of viruses under both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>conditions (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4_3" ref-type="table">3.4</xref> and Fig.
