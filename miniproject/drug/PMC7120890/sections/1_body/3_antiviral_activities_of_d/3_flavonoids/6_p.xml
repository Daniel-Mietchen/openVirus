<p>The flavonoid chrysosplenol C yielded from the green aerial parts of the Australian plant 
 <italic>Pterocaulon sphacelatum</italic> (Labill.) Benth. and Hook. f. ex F. Muell., which is a 4â€²-hydroxy-3-methoxyflavone, has the ability to inhibit the replication of rhinoviruses (Semple et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152_3">1999</xref>). While the antiviral activity of quercetin 3-rhamnoside (Q3R) from traditional Chinese medicine 
 <italic>Houttuynia cordata</italic> was evaluated using a cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction method, the assay results demonstrated that Q3R possessed strong anti-influenza A/WS/33 virus reducing the formation of a visible CPE. In addition, Q3R inhibited virus replication in the initial stage of virus infection by indirect interaction with virus particles. Therefore, these findings provide important information for the utilization of Q3R for influenza treatment (Choi et al.
