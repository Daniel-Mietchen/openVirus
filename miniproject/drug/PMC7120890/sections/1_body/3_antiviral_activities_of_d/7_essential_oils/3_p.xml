<p>The essential oil from 
 <italic>Santolina insularis</italic> was also inhibited virus replication against HSV-1 and HSV-2 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (Schnitzler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150_3">2008</xref>). Its antiviral activity was principally due to direct virucidal effects (De Logu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40_3">2000</xref>). Lemon balm oil, the essential oil of 
 <italic>Melissa officinalis</italic>, is capable of exerting a direct antiviral effect on HSV-1 and HSV-2. Considering the lipophilic nature of essential oils, which enable it to penetrate the skin, and a high selectivity index, essential oils might be suitable for topical treatment of herpetic infections (Schnitzler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150_3">2008</xref>).
