<p>There are some alkaloids which exhibit antiviral activities both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. The naphthoindozidine alkaloid, together with 7-demethoxytylophorine and 7-demethoxytylophorine N-oxide isolated from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>Cynanchum komarovii</italic>, had antiviral activities against tobacco mosaic virus (An et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5_3">2001</xref>). While the sophoridine is one of the active constituents extracted from Chinese medicinal herb, 
 <italic>Sophora flavescens</italic>, exhibited significantly antiviral activity against coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (primarily cultured myocardial cells) and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (BALB/c mice) by regulating cytokine expression, and it is likely that sophoridine itself, not its metabolites, is mainly responsible for the antiviral activities (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195_3">2006</xref>). While another alkaloid lycorine, isolated from 
 <italic>Lycoris radiate</italic> possesses anti-SARS-CoV activity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3_3" ref-type="fig">3.3</xref>; Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104_3">2005a</xref>).
