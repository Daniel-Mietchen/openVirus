<p>A total of 253 and 802 rapid test kit–positive samples were collected in Myanmar in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Of these, 64 isolates of subtype H3N2 were detected in 2007 and 211 in 2008. NAI susceptibility assay showed 1 (1.5%) isolate (A/Myanmar/M187/2007) with a zanamivir IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 59.72 nM, which was collected in August 2007, and 1 (0.5%) isolate (A/Myanmar/M114/2008) with a zanamivir IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 33.37 nM, which was collected in July 2008. These isolates respectively demonstrated a 53× and 30× reduction in zanamivir susceptibility (

On the basis of cycling probe real-time PCR assay, these viruses had an S31N mutation in M2, which confers resistance to amantadine. All subtype H3N2 viruses analyzed in this study remain sensitive to oseltamivir carboxylate (
