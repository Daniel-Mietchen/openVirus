<p>Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients with influenza-like illness at Sanpya Hospital in Yangon, Myanmar, and outpatient clinics affiliated with the Department of Medical Research (Central Myanmar) in Nay Pyi Taw. Rapid test kit–positive samples were sent to Niigata University, Japan, for subsequent analyses. Virus isolation and subtyping PCR were performed as previously described (

 </xref>). The NAI susceptibility test was performed by a fluorescence-based NA activity assay that measures the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) by using zanamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate (

 <underline>&gt;</underline>2 independent experiments. A sample was considered an extreme outlier if its IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was 10× higher than the mean values for sensitive strains with &gt;3 interquartile range from the 25th and 75th percentiles in the box-and-whisker plot analysis (
