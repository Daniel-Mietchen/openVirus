<p id="p0025">This work highlights the prospect of computer-aided, structure-based TCM drug discovery for the novel coronavirus pneumonia. These approaches helped to narrow down the large libraries of compounds into a subset in a relatively short time with limited resources; they also provided guidance for the future clinical use of TCM formulas. Although the potential is great, at the same time, we need to be fully aware of challenges and limitations faced by these tools. Computational prediction is a bridge between theory and experiment, and further research is needed. Inhibitory assays and crystallography should be performed to confirm the interaction of the herbal compounds with viral proteins and structures. It is worth noting that in a recent study to identify potent ebolavirus inhibitors, only two of the eight compounds selected by 
 <italic>in silico</italic> screening showed inhibitory properties, reflecting the limited reliability of the computational scoring functions 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The decoction of the selected 26 TCM herbs should be tested for their effectiveness and safety in both cell cultures and animal models. Eventually, TCM remedies should be evaluated in carefully designed clinical trials, either used alone or integrated with Western medicine, to cover the prevention, treatment and recovery of patients suffering from the novel coronavirus pneumonia. Before the release of successful clinical trial data, we shall keep cautiously optimistic. Lessons from a recent public panic buying spree, in which results from a preliminary study were announced and triggered irrational purchases overnight, should be heeded.
