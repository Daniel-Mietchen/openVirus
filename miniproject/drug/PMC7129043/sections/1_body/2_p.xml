<p id="p0015">Classically, whether a TCM remedy can be clinically used for viral infections depends on two aspects: 1) clinical symptoms and signs of the patient, and 2) the type of TCM remedy and its traditional indications. TCM formulas have been used in China over 2000Â years. According to their effectiveness, TCM remedies are divided into various types, each corresponding to a group of diseases. On the other hand, research has shown that many TCM remedies have antiviral ingredients. Selecting specific TCM formula through integrative methods based on both disease symptom and pathogen-directed cause will greatly increase the clinical potential. However, it is still a challenge to experimentally screen many TCM remedies for the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia in a short time.</p>
