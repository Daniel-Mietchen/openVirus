 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. (2017)</xref> used BLI to study neurotropic flaviviruses, which can severely damage the central and peripheral nervous systems, showing that viral RNA measured by qRT-PCR directly correlated with Rluc bioluminescence intensity in intracranially inoculated mice. HCoV-OC43, a respiratory CoV, could be a powerful tool for gaining new insights into the neurological manifestations and neurotropic mechanisms of other respiratory viruses. In the present study, our data demonstrated that rOC43-ns2DelRluc levels reflected HCoV-OC43-WT replication in the brain and its spread to the spinal cord of living mice, with bioluminescence intensity directly correlating with viral loads as measured by IFA and western blot and consistent with previous studies (
