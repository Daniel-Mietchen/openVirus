 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Morfopoulou et al., 2016</xref>); however, the mechanisms responsible for their dissemination and penetration in the host CNS remain unclear. Therefore, easily observable, living animal models are required to identify the mechanisms of HCoV infection in the CNS and enable the development of antiviral drugs for treating and preventing CoV infection and their associated severe CNS pathologies. Here, we used BLI to monitor HCoV-OC43 infection in real-time using the rOC43-ns2DelRluc reporter protein as a direct correlate of viral titer. We confirmed our previous observation by demonstrating that rOC43-ns2DelRluc possesses critical neurotropic and neuroinvasive properties after infection via the respiratory tract. Rluc, which is smaller than Firefly luciferase (Fluc), is useful for producing genetic fusions with other proteins, particularly for viruses with large genomes, such as like CoVs. Replacing 
 <italic>ns2</italic> with Rluc did not impair viral-replication kinetics, and we observed robust Rluc activity. Moreover, Rluc expression levels correlated well with viral replication in the infected CNS, revealing the dynamic infection process. Therefore, our results demonstrated that BALB/c mice infected with rOC43-ns2DelRluc could be a promising animal model for testing the efficacy of antiviral drugs to treat neurological symptoms. As expected, CQ, a widely used drug with well-known antimalarial effects, strongly attenuated HCoV-OC43 replication in the brain and prevented the infection from spreading to the spinal cord, consistent with a previous study (
