<p id="p0085">The brain and spinal cord dissected from rOC43-ns2DelRluc-infected mice and control mice at 6-days post-infection (dpi) were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and routinely sectioned to a thickness of ~5 μm. The sections were then permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min, blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated with primary antibodies, including anti-Rluc rabbit monoclonal antibodies, anti-NeuN antibodies and anti-MAP2 antibodies, at 4 °C overnight. Sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies, including Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (ab150077), Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) and Alexa Fluor 596-conjugated goat anti-chicken polyclonal antibodies at 37 °C for 1 h. After staining with 1 μg/mL 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min, the sections were covered with Permount, and images were captured by Operetta (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) with Columbus software or by a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope with LAS software (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany).</p>
