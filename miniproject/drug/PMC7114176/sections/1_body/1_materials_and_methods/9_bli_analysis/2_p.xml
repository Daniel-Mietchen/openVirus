<p id="p0090">rOC43-ns2DelRluc replication in mice was evaluated by BLI with an In Vivo F Pro (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany). Prior to imaging, rOC43-ns2DelRluc-infected mice were injected intraperitoneally with Renilla luciferase substrate (20 μg/g; Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and anaesthetized with isoflurane. After 5 min, mice were placed on a light-tight camera box stage under continuous anesthesia, imaged (acquisition time: 4 min), and the signals were quantified using Bruker molecular imaging software (Bruker).</p>
