<p id="p0070">Brain and spinal homogenates were separated by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were blocked with 5% skim milk at room temperature for 2 h and incubated with anti-OC43-N mouse polyclonal or anti-β-actin antibodies at 4 °C overnight. After washing with PBS with Tween-20, the membranes were incubated with anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000; KPL) or anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000; KPL) at room temperature for 1 h. Blots were scanned to detect infrared fluorescence using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA).</p>
