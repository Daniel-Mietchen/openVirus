<p id="p0115">To perform BLI of rOC43-ns2DelRluc

 <sub>50</sub> of rOC43-ns2DelRluc or HCoV-OC43-WT, monitored over time, and bioluminescence intensity was determined (

 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A), whereas no signals were detected in mice infected with HCoV-OC43-WT (data not shown). Moreover, when the ventral side of BALB/c mice was imaged, no replication was observed (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A and B). Surprisingly, no signals were detected in the brains of C57BL/6 mice until their death at 7 dpi; however, by this point we had removed their fur, which might have affected photon transmission from both the dorsal and ventral sides (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A and B). Because we confirmed rOC43-ns2DelRluc replication in various mice from both strains, the lack of signals in C57BL/6 mice could have been due to the low penetration and bioavailability of the Rluc substrate in the mice rather than a low viral titer in the CNS. These results indicted that BLI was readily visualized and could be used to quantify rOC43-ns2DelRluc replication and dissemination in the CNS of living BALB/c mice, suggesting this virus as a potential candidate for real-time imaging following inoculation.
