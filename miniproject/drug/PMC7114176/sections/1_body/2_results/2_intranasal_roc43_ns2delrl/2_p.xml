<p id="p0100">Previously, we constructed several recombinant Rluc-expressing HCoV-OC43-reporter viruses. One reporter virus (rOC43-ns2DelRluc) in which the 
 <italic>ns2</italic> gene was replaced by Rluc showed robust growth kinetics similar to those of HCoV-OC43-WT and high stability after multiple passages

 <sub>50</sub>) showed pathogenicity in BALB/c mice, which exhibited neurological symptoms identical to those caused by the parental virus after intracerebral inoculation (
