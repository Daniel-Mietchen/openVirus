<p id="p0125">To verify whether BLI of rOC43-ns2DelRluc-infected mice could be used to test the efficiency of antiviral drugs 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, CQ was administered to mice 2 h before viral inoculation (day 0; 30 mg/kg) and then administered daily according to a previous study of HCoV-OC43-WT (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Keyaerts et al., 2009</xref>). Mice were intracerebrally infected with 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of rOC43-ns2DelRluc, and bioluminescence intensity was measured daily (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> ). No signals were detected in mice treated with CQ, and all of them survived (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A, lower), whereas all mice receiving PBS displayed increased bioluminescence and died (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A; upper), demonstrating a significant difference relative to the individual controls (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B and C). Western blot analysis confirmed the difference in rOC43-ns2DelRluc replication between mice treated with or without CQ (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>D and E). These results showed that rOC43-ns2DelRluc-infected mice could be used as a sensitive 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> tool for testing the efficiency of antiviral drugs against HCoV-OC43 and compounds against a broad-spectrum of CoVs, particularly severe SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
