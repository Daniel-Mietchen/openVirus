<p id="p0040">Non-invasive imaging methods that can monitor viral replication in living animals are more convenient for the temporal and spatial investigation of viral dissemination and pathogenesis than conventional assays. Moreover, the same living animal can be monitored at different time points, thereby reducing the number of animals required to generate sufficient data. The use of recombinant viruses tagged with luciferase is less well studied but becoming increasingly popular. Previously, we used a recombinant Rluc-expressing virus based on the HCoV-OC43 backbone (rOC43-ns2DelRluc) to screen anti-CoV agents and antiviral host factors (

 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Woo et al., 2010</xref>). HCoV-OC43 causes only mild infection in humans but can cause severe CNS pathology in suckling mice and be manipulated in biosafety level 2 facilities. Moreover, rOC43-ns2DelRluc shows robust growth kinetics and identical virulence to the wild-type virus
