   <bold>Replication and dissemination of rOC43-ns2DelRluc in mice with different genetic backgrounds.</bold> (A) Detection of rOC43-ns2DelRluc in different tissues. Mice were inoculated intranasally with 10
   <sup>4</sup> TCID
   <sub>50</sub> rOC43-ns2DelRluc and sacrificed at 6 dpi. Tissue supernatants were analyzed for viral load by IFA (upper) in BHK-21 cells or real-time qRT-PCR (lower). Data represent three independent experiments and are shown as the mean ± standard deviation. (B) Immunofluorescence staining of infected and mock-infected mouse brains and spinal cords. (C and D) Double-staining for Rluc and neuron cells in brain and spinal cord sections. Mice were inoculated intranasally with 10
   <sup>4</sup> TCID
   <sub>50</sub> rOC43-ns2DelRluc and sacrificed at 6 dpi. Brain and spinal cord tissues were analyzed using Operetta (PerkinElmer) with Columbus software (B) or a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope with LAS software (C and D). Representative graphs are shown of various brain and spinal cord sections from rOC43-ns2DelRluc-infected BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice.
