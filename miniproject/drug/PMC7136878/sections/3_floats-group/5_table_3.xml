For patients with sepsis, empirical antibiotics should be administered within 1 hour of the initial patient assessment.</td>

The infusion time should be 1 hour at least. For patients with poor initial efficacy, additional doses can be added after 12 hours (the dose is the same as before), with a maximum of 2 cumulative times and a maximum of 800mg for a single dose. Allergic reactions need to be paid attention, meanwhile tuberculosis and other active infection is contraindicated.</td>
