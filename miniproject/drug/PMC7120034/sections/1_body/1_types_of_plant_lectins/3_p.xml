<p>Because of the tremendous diversity of carbohydrate-binding specificities among the plant lectins, some researchers classify them according to the small carbohydrate haptens they recognize, e.g., galactose-binding lectins or GlcNAc-binding lectins (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">5.1</xref>a). The specificity of a lectin is usually defined in terms of the monosaccharide(s) or glycosaccharides that inhibit lectin-induced agglutination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This specificity is usually determined by comparing sugars on the basis of the minimum concentration needed to inhibit hemagglutination. If the lectin-binding carbohydrate is present freely dissolved and at a sufficiently high concentration, it will compete with the red cell glycoconjugates for the lectin and agglutination will not take place.
