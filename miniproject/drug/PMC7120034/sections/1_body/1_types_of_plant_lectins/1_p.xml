<p>Plant lectins can be categorized based on their overall mature structure into merolectins, hololectins, chimerolectins and superlectins (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">5.1</xref>a). Firstly, merolectins are small monomeric lectins consisting exclusively of a single carbohydrate-binding domain. Due to their monovalent nature, they do not possess agglutinating activity, such as hevein isolated from the latex of 
 <italic>Hevea brasiliensis</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">5.1</xref>b shows the crystal structure of hevein with (4s)-2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. Next are hololectins, also exclusively built up of carbohydrate-binding domains but containing at least two such domains that are either identical or very homologous and bind either the same or structurally similar sugar(s), and most plant lectins are included in this subgroup. One example is Concanavalin A which is a tetrameric protein and binds specifically α-
 <sc>d</sc>-mannosyl and α-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucosyl residues (two hexoses differing only by the alcohol on carbon 2). A refined structure of Concanavalin A with mannose at 2.0 angstroms resolution is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">5.1</xref>b [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Another example is peanut (
 <italic>Arachis hypogaea</italic>) agglutinin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It is a 110-kDa, homotetrameric non-glycosylated protein (without RIP activity) and shows a specificity for the tumor-associated T-antigenic disaccharide Gal
 <italic>β</italic>1,3GalNAc. The third group is chimerolectins, which are fusion proteins consisting of one or more carbohydrate-binding domain(s) tandemly arrayed to an unrelated domain. An example of this is ricin, which can be classified as both lectin and type II ribosome inactivating protein (RIP) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">5.1</xref>b, ricin consists of two parts; an A chain (with N-glycosidase activity/RIP activity) and a B chain (hemagglutinating/lectin activity) with the B chain capable of binding different carbohydrates, such as β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose and β-
 <sc>d</sc>-galactose as shown in the figure. Lastly, superlectins are a type of chimerolectins which consist of at least two structurally different domains which recognize structurally unrelated carbohydrates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. For instance, TxLC-I is a superlectin isolated from tulip bulbs, and it consists of a mannose-binding domain and an unrelated GalNAc-binding domain. Since there is no crystal data on plant superlectin, the crystal structure of a superlectin purified from 
 <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic> (a Gram-negative bacterium), named BC2L-A, is used for demonstration (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">5.1</xref>b) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The N-terminal domain of BC2L-A is a novel TNF-α-like fucose-binding lectin while the C-terminal is a calcium-dependent bacterial lectin.
