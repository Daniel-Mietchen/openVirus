<p>Plant lectins have been and still are a subject of intense investigation. They have come a long way, since their first detection in plants as hemagglutinins, to their present status as recognition molecules with innumerable exciting functions and applications. As more plant lectins are isolated and further studies are conducted on the biological activities and mechanisms of action of lectins, the production of lectins can be improved and new applications of these lectins will be found or conceived. Lectins could be used as the next generation of medicines once research has contributed to their full understanding.</p>
