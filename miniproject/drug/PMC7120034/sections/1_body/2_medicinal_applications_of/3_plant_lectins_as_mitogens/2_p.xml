<p>The discovery of the first mitogenic lectin was made by Nowell in 1960, who found that the lectin of red kidney bean (
 <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic>), known as phytohemagglutinin (PHA), possessed the ability to stimulate lymphocytes to undergo mitosis [

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">5.1</xref> provides a few examples of plant lectins with mitogenic activity as such a lectin from the tuber of wild cobra lily [
