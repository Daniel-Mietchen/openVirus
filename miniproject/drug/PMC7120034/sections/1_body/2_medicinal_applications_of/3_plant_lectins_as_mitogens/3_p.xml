<p>Concanavalin A, a lectin from the Jack bean, is an important mitogen because, in contrast to PHA, its activity can be inhibited by low concentrations of monosaccharides, for example, mannose. This finding provided proof that mitogenic stimulation is the result of binding of lectins to sugars on the surface of the lymphocytes and was among the earliest demonstrations for a biological role of cell surface sugars [

Such properties make them useful tools for the isolation and characterization of polysaccharides and glycoconjugates, in cancer research, as diagnostic tools for the investigation of early cell-membrane alterations and carbohydrate changes that accompany neoplastic processes, and in immunological studies.
