<p>A lectin from blue green algae (CV-N) exhibited a broad range of antiviral activities. It has been shown that CV-N binds with high affinity to HIV envelope protein gp120 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] and also interacts with another surface glycoprotein, gp41 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. The specificity of CV-N, however, is not limited only to different strains of HIV and related retroviruses. CV-N inhibited the development of viral cytopathic effects of Ebola virus, binding to its surface envelope glycoprotein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] and also blocked influenza A and B strains by binding to the hemagglutinin surface glycoprotein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. The results of viral pretreatment studies indicated that CV-N directly neutralized both influenza A and B viruses, including both H1N1 and H3N2 strains. However, the CV-N resistant influenza virus strain A/PR/8/34 was completely resistant to any direct neutralizing activity. Results suggested that CV-N bound directly to and inactivated the viral particle, preventing subsequent infection, and that both the likely molecular target for CV-N and the basis of CV-N resistance resided in the viral particle [
