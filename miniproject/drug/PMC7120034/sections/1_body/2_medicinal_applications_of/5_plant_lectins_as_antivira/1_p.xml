<p>Compounds with antiviral activity are generally of great medical interest and different modes of pharmaceutical actions have been described. The antiviral activity of plant lectins can be based on several mechanisms. The surfaces of retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and many other enveloped viruses are covered by virally-encoded glycoproteins. Glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 present on the HIV envelope are heavily glycosylated, with glycans estimated to contribute almost 50Â % of the molecular weight of gp120. Agents that specifically and strongly interact with the glycans may disturb interactions between the proteins of the viral envelope and the cells of the host [
