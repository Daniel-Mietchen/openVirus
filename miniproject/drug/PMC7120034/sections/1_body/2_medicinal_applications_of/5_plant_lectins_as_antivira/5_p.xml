<p>Unlike the majority of current antiviral therapeutics that act through inhibition of the viral life cycle, lectins can prevent penetration of the host cells by the viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Antiviral lectins are best suited to topical applications and can exhibit lower toxicity than many currently used antiviral therapeutics. Additionally, these proteins are often resistant to high temperatures and low pH, as well as being odorless, which are favorable properties for potential microbicide drugs [
