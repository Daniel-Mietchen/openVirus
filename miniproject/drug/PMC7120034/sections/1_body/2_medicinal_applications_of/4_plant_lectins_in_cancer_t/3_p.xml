<p>Small glossy black soybean (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. An anti-tumor action mechanism of soybean lectins has been proposed involving the action of the lectins on tumor cell membranes, the reduction of tumor cell proliferation, the induction of tumor-specific cytotoxicity of macrophages, and apoptosis. Thus, tumor cells are more susceptible to attack by macrophages after treatment with lectins. Furthermore, lectins exert an immunomodulatory effect by altering interleukins production [
