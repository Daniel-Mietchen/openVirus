<p>HCV belonging to the family Flaviviridae signifies to be an entire global dilemma which parades the variability of genome translated into six genotypes and more than 80 subtypes. HCV has infected 200 million people worldwide [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], comprising of 9.6 kb positive sense genome. It encodes a single polyprotein precursor of 3010 amino acids having an internal ribosome entry site at 5' untranslated region (UTR), vital for the translation. This polyprotein precursor is co-translationally processed by cellular and viral proteases into three structural proteins (core, E1 &amp; E2) and seven non-structural proteins (P7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A &amp; NS5B) [
