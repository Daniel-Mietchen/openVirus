<p>ITMN-191 (R7227) is a peptidomimetic inhibitor of NS3/4A protease of HCV. ITMN-191 introverted a reference genotype 1 NS3/4A protein in a time-dependent manner, which is a characteristic of an inhibitor with a two-step binding mechanism and a low dissociation rate. Under pre-equilibrium circumstances, small quantity of ITMN-191 half-maximally inhibited the reference NS3/4A protease, but a 35,000-fold-higher concentration did not substantially restrain a group of 79 proteases, ion channels and transporters. Combinational therapeutic regime of ITMN-191 (R7227) is considered to be helpful in curing chronic hepatitis C [
