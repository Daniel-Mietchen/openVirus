<p>A class of anionic tetraphenylporphyrins is identified as explicit inhibitors of HCV replicons. 
 <italic>Meso</italic>-tetrakis-(3, 5-dicarboxy-4,4'-biphenyl) porphyrin is found to display 
 <italic>in-vitro </italic>antiviral activity against HCV genotype 1b replicons by targeting viral replicase but less proficient against the genotype 2a (JFH-1) replicon. Synergistic studies have shown that the combination of 
 <italic>Meso</italic>-tetrakis-(3, 5-dicarboxy-4,4'-biphenyl) porphyrin with BILN 2061 and with IFN-Î± was additive to synergistic which lead to almost 90% inhibition of HCV replication [
