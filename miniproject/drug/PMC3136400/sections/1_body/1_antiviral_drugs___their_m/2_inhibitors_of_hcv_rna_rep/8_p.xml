<p>Combinations of nucleoside analogues β-D-2'-
 <italic>C</italic>-methylcytidine (2'-
 <italic>C</italic>-MeC; NM-107) or β-D-2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-2'- 
 <italic>C</italic>-methylcytidine (2'-F-
 <italic>C</italic>-MeC; PSI-6130) with interferon-α 2b (IFN-α2b) plus ribavirin (RBV) were assessed in subgenomic HCV relicon. β-D-2'-
 <italic>C</italic>-methylcytidine (2'-
 <italic>C</italic>-MeC; NM-107) was the first nucleoside HCV inhibitor. Triple combination of valopicitabine (NM-283), the 3'-valine ester of β-D-2'-
 <italic>C</italic>-methylcytidine (2'-
 <italic>C</italic>-MeC; NM-107) along with IFN and RBV resulted in 70% decline in viral load, but NM-283 was interdicted due to gastrointestinal side effects [
