<p>The illustration of HCV replication is made possible by the development of HCV cell culture system. First HCV replicon was generated in human hepatome cell line (Huh-7) having genotype 1b subgenomic RNA along with 5' UTR, neomycin phosphotransferase gene (NPT), internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of encephylomyocarditis virus (EMCV)-HCV NS3-4A-4B-5A-5B-HCV 3' UTR. RNA replication, virus-host relations, screening of antiviral drugs and their mechanism are best studied by the replicon system [

Specifically Targeted Antiviral Therapy for hepatitis C (STAT-C) approach is now being currently used to develop drugs that basically target specific enzymes involved in HCV replication. STAT-C drugs such as polymerase and protease inhibitors are presently accessible only in different phases of clinical trials.
