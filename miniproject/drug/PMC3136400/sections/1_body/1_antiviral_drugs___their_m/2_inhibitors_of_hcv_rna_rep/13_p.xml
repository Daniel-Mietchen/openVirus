<p>25-hydroxychloesterol (25-HC) has been ascertained as anti-HCV agent by modifying the mevalonate pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Transcriptional profiling of 25-HC was executed on Huh-7 cells containing HCV replicons. Various sets of genes were up- and down regulated involved in the mevalonate pathway and instituted transcriptional changes resulting in the inhibition of HCV replication. The identified genes which may act as HCV markers are indirectly involved in the inhibition of HCV replication [
