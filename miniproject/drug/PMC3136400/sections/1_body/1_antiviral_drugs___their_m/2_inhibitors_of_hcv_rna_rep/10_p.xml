<p>Another newly discovered antiviral compound, clemizole, is found to exhibit influential antiviral activity against NS4B RNA binding and HCV replication by using luciferase reporter-linked HCV replication assay. Clemizole has succumbed high synergistic effects with various protease (VX950 &amp; SCH503034) and additive effects with polymerase inhibitors (NM283 &amp; HCV796). Furthermore, the clemizole-SCH503034 combination reduces the manifestation of resistance exclusive of bestowing cross-resistance [
