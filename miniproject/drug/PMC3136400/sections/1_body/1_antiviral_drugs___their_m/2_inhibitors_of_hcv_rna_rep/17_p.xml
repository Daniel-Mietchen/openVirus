<p>By doing 
 <italic>in-vitro </italic>resistance study of AG-021541, it is being demonstrated that AG-021541 is a novel dihydropyrone NNI of HCV replication. AG-021541 marks to hit HCV RNA polymerase at the thumb-base allosteric site. As resistance changes due to AG-021541 remained entirely susceptible to IFN and polymerase inhibitors targeting sections distinct from the AG-021541 binding site. Due to lack of cross resistance, combinational therapy of AG-021541 with other polymerase or nonpolymerase inhibitors would be significantly accommodating in future [
