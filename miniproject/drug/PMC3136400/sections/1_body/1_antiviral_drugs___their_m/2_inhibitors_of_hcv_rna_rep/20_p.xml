<p>P3 aza-peptide analogue (exhibiting anti HCV activity) of a novel HCV protease blocker (BILN 2061) has been synthesized. Anti HCV activity of newly synthesized derivative is shown to be less effective than the parent compound in HCV sub-genomic replicon assay. Configuration at P3 has interrupted the H-bond conformation which is necessary for the binding of compound to active site of HCV NS3 protease [

The extent of efficient inhibition activity is correlated with the length of carbon chain. Gem-dialkyl naphthalenone derivatives are found to be novel HCV polymerase inhibitors. By performing the modifications at carbon-1 of B ring, thriving results against HCV polymerase were attained in HCV sub-genomic replicons [
