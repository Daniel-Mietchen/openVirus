<p>HCV replication is instigated by the formation of replicase complex which is allied with intracellular membrane containing cellular proteins. Replicase complex consists of cleavage products of HCV polyprotein precursor especially NS3-5B which play an important role in replication. Along with these proteins and cis acting RNA elements, various host factors are also involved in HCV RNA replication [

RdRp activity is shown to be enhanced by interacting with cyclophilin B and viral factors such as NS3 and NS5A. A negative-strand copy of viral genome is primarily produced by NS5B RdRp.

Even though NS3 exhibits innate proteolytic activity, NS4A cofactor is required for the cleavage of polyprotein. Due to vague understanding of helicase enzymology, NS3 helicase is a hard-hitting target for drug designing [
