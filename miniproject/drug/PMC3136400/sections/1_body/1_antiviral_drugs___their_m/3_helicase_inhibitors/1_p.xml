<p>NS3 helicase plays an important role in unwinding of double-strand DNA and duplex RNA. DEAD box proteins belong to helicase superfamily 2 that facilitate mRNA splicing, mRNA export, translation, protein processing, RNA packaging into virions, mitochondrial gene expression and probably aid RNA-dependent RNA replication [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. DEAD-box stands for exceedingly conserved motif comprised of Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp. The two most striking targets on NS3 helicase are ATP and RNA binding sites while other distinctive facets may be utilized as target for drug development [
