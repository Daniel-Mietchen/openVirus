Fragment-based explorations were exploited to recognize triphenylmethane derivatives for other persuasive inhibitors. 3-bromo-4-hydroxyl substituted derivative masked HCV replication in the HCV replicon cells. For that reason, this inhibitor with structural novelty may act as a functional gibbet for the sighting of innovative HCV NS3 helicase inhibitors [
