<p>The most active chemical entity, 3, 5, 7-tri [(40-methylpiperazin-10-yl) methyl] tropolone inhibited RNA replication by 50% at an effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 46.9 μM, while the most competent one was 3, 5, 7-tri [(30-methylpiperidin-10-yl) methyl] tropolone having EC
 <sub>50 </sub>of 35.6 μM. These derivatives are the first helicase inhibitors that block replication of HCV with the capability of causing the emergence of resistant mutants [
