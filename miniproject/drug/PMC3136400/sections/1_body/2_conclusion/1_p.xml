<p>More importantly, it is crucial to appraise 
 <italic>in-vitro </italic>combinational therapy of small inhibitory molecules with standard regime to improve antiviral activity against HCV replication and infection. Therapeutic drugs against HCV may have the potential to put off the replication complex formation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>] and targeting to hormone receptors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. Accordingly, therapeutic regime for HCV have been insinuating in a novel trail with less side effects and more efficacy than standard therapy. Consequently, compounds that may change any mechanism of cell regulation which is provoked by HCV can have the propensity to alleviate the infection. Various inhibitors are now crossing the threshold in human clinical trials in different phases such as BILN 2061, ITMN 191, TMC 435350, MK 7009 (I &amp; II phase) and Î±-ketoamide (phase III) etc. For drug designing, main emphasis is made on three major targets but NS3 protease inhibitors are the most successful one. But unfortunately various drugs exhibit propensity to resistance emergence. In order to avoid such problem, there is a need to develop other potential antiviral drugs. So, natural products should be included especially in combinational therapy which may prove to be a better treatment option than standard therapy.
