 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], LPVr is proposed to treat COVID-19. LPVr is available in oral tablets and solutions. LPVr oral solution is more suitable for children with a body surface area less than 0.6 m
 <sup>2</sup> or those who are unable to swallow tablets. LPVr oral solution contains approximately 42% (v/v) ethanol and 15% (w/v) propylene glycol, which is not recommended in premature infants within 42 weeks and neonates within 14 days based on drug instructions in the USA [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Differences in age limitation maybe due to different excipients and the manufacture process used. The dosage regimen of LPVr was recommended as follows [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]: LPVr tablets (200 mg/50 mg): 12 mg/3 mg/kg every time for the children with 7–15 kg body weight (BW); for those with BW of 15–40 kg, 10 mg/2.5 mg/kg every time; for those with BW of 40 kg or more, 400 mg/100 mg can be administrated every time. LPVr tablets are administered twice daily for 1–2 weeks.
