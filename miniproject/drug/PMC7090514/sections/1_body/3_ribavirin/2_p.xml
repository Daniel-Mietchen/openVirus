<p id="Par8">Ribavirin should be used with caution in patients with abnormal liver function. In patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) below 50 mL/min, ribavirin is not recommended. In patients with serum creatinine (SCr) higher than 2 mg/dL, ribavirin should be discontinued. The most common adverse reactions of ribavirin in children include fever (80%), headache (62%), neutropenia (33%), fatigue (30%), etc. [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Large doses of ribavirin could cause decreased hemoglobin and serious heart damage. Children with heart diseases should be suggested to avoid using ribavirin. If necessary, ribavirin should not be given at a high dose and the hemoglobin and hematocrit should be closely monitored.
