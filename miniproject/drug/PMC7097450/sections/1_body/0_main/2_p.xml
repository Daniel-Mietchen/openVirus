<p id="Par3">The success of acyclovir provided encouragement in the early 1980s in the face of a new viral pathogen: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, then called LAV-1/HTLV-III), which was identified as the (then tentative) cause of AIDS, leading to an intensive search for inhibitors of this retrovirus. The most successful of the anti-HIV agents discovered in this early period, and also the first to be licensed for clinical use, was azidothymidine (AZT), which emerged from a screening effort of around 100 nucleoside analogues selected by Wellcome Laboratories and evaluated by the National Cancer Institute. Again, the selectivity of the inhibitory activity of AZT for a viral enzyme — HIV reverse transcriptase — compared with enzymes involved in DNA synthesis in normal cells provided a therapeutic window for its use.</p>
