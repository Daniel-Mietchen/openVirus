<p id="Par2">In the late 1970s, the discovery that acyclic nucleoside analogues, in particular acyclovir, could inhibit DNA replication of herpes simplex virus (HSV) at concentrations far below those that affect cellular DNA synthesis sparked a new era in antiviral chemotherapy. The underlying reason for the selectivity — that acyclovir is specifically converted to the active metabolite by an HSV-encoded thymidine kinase — was unexpected, but the potential for exploiting viral enzymes to develop potent and specific antiviral drugs was clearly demonstrated. Acyclovir subsequently became a successful treatment for HSV-1 and HSV-2.</p>
