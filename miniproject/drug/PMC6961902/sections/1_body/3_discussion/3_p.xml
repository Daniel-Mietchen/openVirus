<p>Our results showed that antiviral therapy could increase HBeAg seroconversion. Other meta analyses also showed the same results[

 <xref rid="pone.0227532.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Among the included trials, Tangâ€™s study[
 <xref rid="pone.0227532.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] made the results heterogeneous. The sample size of their trial was smaller, and we considered that the results were more likely to be biased. Serum HBV DNA is a sensitive quantitative index that could facilitate the monitoring of response to treatment. The National Institutes of Health Workshop proposed an arbitrary serum HBV DNA level of 10
 <sup>5</sup> copies/mL to differentiate chronic hepatitis B from an inactive carrier state. Another study claimed that 33% of patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis had HBV DNA levels that were persistently above 10
 <sup>5</sup> copies/mL[

 <xref rid="pone.0227532.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. According to these data, we considered that in terms of reflecting the disease condition, HBeAg clearance could replace serum HBV DNA to some extent. Two trials[
 <xref rid="pone.0227532.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0227532.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] included in our study mentioned serum HBV DNA as an outcome indicator, but they did not provide concrete values; they only described the numbers of patients that had a decrease in serum HBV DNA. For the above reasons, we did not evaluate the effect of drugs based on this indicator.
