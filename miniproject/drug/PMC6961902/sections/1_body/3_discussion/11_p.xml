<p>Several limitations in our meta-analysis should be considered. First, the quality of our analysis could be improved by a larger sample size and longer follow-up. Observational studies are not the best study design to answer intervention questions because of bias and confounding, the effects of which are unpredictable and may result in an overestimate, an underestimate, or true estimate of the effect. The limited number of studies available and patients enrolled in each study reduced the strength of our final conclusions. Second, dosage and treatment duration for drug administration and the follow-up duration might have influenced the clinical trial data. Third, patients enrolled in our study had a variety of renal lesion types. Because the clinical results of patients with renal puncture pathology are unavailable, no further subgroup analysis could be performed. Finally, trials in our meta-analysis were all in English and conducted in Asian countries and mostly limited to China. This geographic concentration is probably the reason for the high prevalence of HBV infection in these countries. As a result, our conclusions concerning the efficacy and safety of antiviral treatments may not apply to European or American patients.</p>
