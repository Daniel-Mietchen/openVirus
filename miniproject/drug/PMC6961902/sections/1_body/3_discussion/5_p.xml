<p>Antiviral drugs were initially intended to treat HBV infection, but the present findings proved these have a curative four major mechanisms: (1) HB immune complexes of macromolecules were deposited in the mesangial area and sub-endodermis, leading to different pathological types. One is circulating immune complexes of viral antigen and host antibody, and the other is in situ immune complexes involving viral antigens bound to glomerular structures[
