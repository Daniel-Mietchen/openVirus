<p>Human HBV is a small, enveloped, primarily hepatotropic DNA virus[
 <xref rid="pone.0227532.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. NAs can suppress viral replication by inhibiting the activity of HBV polymerase in the infected liver, but they cannot eliminate existing viruses or eradicate HBV cccDNA[
 <xref rid="pone.0227532.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. IFNs bind to cellular receptors and induce large numbers of genes termed IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISGs are multifunctional and can inhibit HBV replication at different stages: they can suppress cccDNA transcription and accelerate cccDNA decay, inhibit the activity of HBV enhancers, influence posttranscriptional control of HBV replication, and inhibit HBV nucleocapsid formation. Furthermore, IFNs can also activate antiviral enzymes and stimulate an immunomodulatory effect[
