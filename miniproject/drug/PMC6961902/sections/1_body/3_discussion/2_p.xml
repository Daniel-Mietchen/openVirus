<p>The effect of antiviral therapy on eGFR was not obvious. The first reason for poor efficacy was age because the standards for eGFR for adult patients and pediatric patients are not the same, so they are not suitable for combining together for analysis. Second, body weight and sex could affect eGFR, and the patients that were included may have been heterogeneous with respect to these indicators. In addition, antiviral drugs associated with nephrotoxicity, such as adefovir dipivoxil, tenofovir and IFNs, should also be taken into consideration. These are excreted through the kidney, and high concentrations of both the drugs and their metabolites can cause renal injury. Izzedine’s study[
 <xref rid="pone.0227532.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] demonstrated that adefovir dipivoxil (120 mg/d) could increase the serum creatinine level by 44 μmol/L in HIV-infected patients. Kara AV‘s study[
 <xref rid="pone.0227532.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] found that tenofovir could decrease the eGFR and that the change in eGFR was not statistically significant. The after sensitivity analysis also confirmed that Sun’s study[
 <xref rid="pone.0227532.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which chose lamivudine as an intervention, has a great influence on the heterogeneity. In addition, inconsistency of renal pathologic types may also be a factor. Wang et al[
 <xref rid="pone.0227532.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] performed a meta-analysis and decleared that NA monotherapy could protect renal function and preventing Scr (Serum creatinine) elevation. However, our results didn’t show significant improvement in renal function, especially under treatment of NAs.
