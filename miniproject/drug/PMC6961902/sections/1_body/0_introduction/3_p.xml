 <xref rid="pone.0227532.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] focused on the effects of antiviral treatment on HBV-GN but were completed before 2011. However, previous investigators did not provide details regarding to therapies, such as treatment for patients of different ages, antiviral drug selection or treatment duration. Standardized treatment guidelines that are personalized and appropriate for the current therapeutic regimen are lacking. Therefore, we performed an updated systematic review of clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of antiviral therapy for HBV-GN.
