<p>Six trials mentioned side effects during treatment, including 201 patients. Three studies were treated with IFNs (n = 95), and adverse events were encountered after approximately 3 months of therapy and were mainly flu-like illnesses and pains. Later, side effects appeared after 6 months of therapy were mainly psychiatric problems. The most common events were flu-like syndrome (50/95, 52.6%), fever (26/95, 27.3%), fatigue (27/95, 28.4%) and various kinds of pains (46/95, 48.2%), including myalgia (n = 30), headaches (n = 28), abdominal pain (n = 2) and arthralgia (n = 8). The above symptoms were not serious and subsided spontaneously or were relieved by analgesics. The psychiatric symptoms (21/95, 22.1%), such as anxiety and loss of interest (n = 6), insomnia (n = 8), depression (n = 4) and suicidal ideation (n = 3). These side effects disappeared quickly after reducing the dose of IFNs. Other symptoms were rare including anorexia, nausea, chills, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Compared with IFNs, the side effects in patients treated with NAs (n = 70) were fewer, and the adverse events observed in the remaining three trials seemed to be random with no specific symptoms mentioned.</p>
