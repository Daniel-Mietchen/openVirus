<p>Seven studies, involving 182 patients, evaluated the efficacy of antiviral therapy for HBV-GN. We evaluated the CR and total remission (CR+PR) rates after treatment with a fixed-effect model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227532.g002">Fig 2</xref>). There was no clinical and statistical heterogeneity in total remission of all trials (I
 <sup>2</sup> = 0%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.80), and the test for the overall effect was significant (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.00001). The total remission rate of proteinuria was obviously higher in the antiviral treatment group than in the control group in all studies (OR = 10.48, 95% CI: 4.60−23.89). The antiviral treatment significantly affected CR in all trials (OR = 11.64, 95% CI: 5.17−26.21). There was no heterogeneity between data sources in the CR of all trials (I
 <sup>2</sup> = 23%, P = 0.26). The χ
 <sup>2</sup> test of heterogeneity was not significant in the CR evaluation from the CCTs (I
 <sup>2</sup> = 9%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.36, OR = 8.47, 95% CI: 3.67−20.80). We conducted a sensitivity analysis of all studies (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227532.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Our analysis determined that the study by Sun’s study[
 <xref rid="pone.0227532.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and Panomsak’s study[
 <xref rid="pone.0227532.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] was the source of heterogeneity.
