<p>Treatment effects were calculated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess dichotomous outcomes. The mean differences (MDs) were used to evaluate the differences of continuous data. The standard deviation (SD) of changes were calculated according to the formula in Cochrane investigator's handbook 5.1.0, the value of correlation coefficient (Corr) was 0.5

 </bold>. A sensitivity analysis or subgroup analysis was used to discover heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed by Egger’s test and Begg’s test. All statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, England). The sensitivity analyses and publication bias assessment were performed using STATA 13.1 (Stata Corp., College Station, Texas, USA). When original data were not mentioned in the article but were found presented in reports and references as functional X-Y type scatter or line plots, Plot Digitizer 2.6.8.0 was used to digitize scanned plots of the functional data. Subgroup analyses were planned to explore potential sources of variability in the observed treatment effects. When possible, subgroup analyses were performed for clinical trial types, antiviral drug types, age and follow-up duration.
