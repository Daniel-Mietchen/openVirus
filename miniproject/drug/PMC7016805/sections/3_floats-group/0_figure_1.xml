  <p>RK-33 directly binds to DEAD-box helicase 3 X-linked (DDX3X) residue K230. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE of purified recombinant wild-type and K230E DDX3X. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Wavelength scans of 200–500 nm collected in the analytical ultracentrifuge on purified recombinant DDX3X alone (black) and 100 μM RK-33 (gray). Sedimentation velocity studies of RK-33 binding to (
   <bold>C</bold>) DDX3X or (
   <bold>D</bold>) DDX3X K230E. 
   <italic>c</italic>(
   <italic>s</italic>) distributions from fits to data collected at 290 and 410 nm were plotted as a function of 
   <italic>s</italic>
   <sub>20,w</sub> for DDX3X in the presence of 100 μM RK-33 at 290 nm (blue) and 410 nm (pink), 100 μM RK-33 alone (410 nm, gray) and DDX3X with an equivalent % dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (DDX3X alone, 290 nm, black). The residual plots are shown in insets. Data in (
   <bold>C</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>) are each representative of two independent experiments. (
   <bold>E</bold>,
   <bold>F</bold>) Calorimetry studies of RK-33 binding to DDX3X. RK-33 at (
   <bold>E</bold>) 50 μM and (
   <bold>F</bold>) 200 μM was injected into DDX3X (17 μM) in the sample cell. Data were fit to a one-site binding model. The stoichiometry deduced from data fitting to the two experiments was 1.05 ± 0.2, with a 
   <italic>K</italic>
   <sub>d</sub> of 33 ± 2 μM and Δ
   <italic>H</italic> of −19 ± 0.3 kcal/mol. Reported values represent the average of the two experiments, with average errors of the fits to the experimental data reported by Origin 7.0.
