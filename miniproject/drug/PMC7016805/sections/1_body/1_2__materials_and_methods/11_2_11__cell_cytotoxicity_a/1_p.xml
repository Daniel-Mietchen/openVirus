<p>Cell viability was determined by XTT (sodium 30-[1-[(phenylamino)-carbony]-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene-sulfonic acid hydrate) assay as previously described [
 <xref rid="B30-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], using XTT sodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and phenazine methosulfate (PMS, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Cells were treated the same as for the infection assay with increasing concentrations of RK-33, and XTT added 22 h later.
