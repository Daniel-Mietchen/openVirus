<p>BHK-21 (used for DENV-2) or Vero (used for RSV, hPIV-3, ZIKV and WNV) cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well and grown overnight in culture medium at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> prior to infection. The virus inoculum was removed and replaced with semisolid overlays of 0.8% aquacide II (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) in DMEM containing 2% FBS, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After 3–4 days, the cells were fixed with neutral buffered formalin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 2 h at room temperature, rinsed with tap water, and stained with 1% crystal violet for 10 min. The stain was removed by rinsing the cells with tap water, and the viral plaques were counted visually. Dose-response curves were plotted from the plaque number (plaque forming units (pfu)/mL) versus the logarithmic value of the concentrations of RK-33. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8 software. Outlier points were excluded.
