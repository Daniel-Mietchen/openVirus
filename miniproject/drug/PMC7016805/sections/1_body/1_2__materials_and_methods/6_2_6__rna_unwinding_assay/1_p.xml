<p>RNA binding assays were performed based on the protocol of Kim and Seo [
 <xref rid="B27-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], but with the modifications described below. The RNA substrate, based on a sequence previously shown to act as a DDX3X substrate [
 <xref rid="B28-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], comprised annealed partially complementary single-stranded (ssRNA) molecules synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IA, USA): a Cy5-labeled 15-nt RNA strand (5′-Cy5-
 <underline>CGUCUUUACGGUGCU</underline>-3′) and a 41-nt RNA strand, 5′-
 <underline>AGCACCGUAAAGACG</underline>GUAAAACAAAACAAAACAAAACAAAA-3′, where the duplex region is underlined). A 15-nt duplex with 26-nt 3′ overhang was generated by combining equimolar concentrations of the 15- and 41-nt RNAs in annealing buffer (60 mM KCl, 6 mM HEPES-pH 7.5, 0.2 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>) and heating to 95 °C before slowly cooling to room temperature. Reaction mixtures (20 μL) contained 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 15 fmol of duplexed RNA, 0.3 mM ATP in the presence of RK-33 (0–250 μM) or equivalent (2% (

Samples were electrophoresed on a 15% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5x Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE). Cy5-labeled RNA was visualized by fluorescence using a Typhoon 5 (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) and quantified using Image Studio Lite (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, USA). The percentage of unwinding was calculated using the formula (monomer/total) × 100, where “total” is the amount of monomer plus duplex.
