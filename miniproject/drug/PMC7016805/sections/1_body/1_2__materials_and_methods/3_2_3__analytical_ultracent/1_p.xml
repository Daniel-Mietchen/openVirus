<p>Sedimentation velocity experiments were conducted using an Optima Analytical Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) at a temperature of 20 °C. Protein was diluted in 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10% (

 <italic>v</italic>) glycerol, 1 mM TCEP and where relevant, 100 μM RK-33 or an equivalent % DMSO was added prior to centrifugation. In total, 380 μL of sample and 400 μL of reference solution were loaded into a conventional double sector quartz cell and mounted in a Beckman 8-hole An-50 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Samples were centrifuged at a rotor speed of 40,000 rpm and the data were collected continuously at multiple wavelengths (290 and 410 nm). Solvent density (1.0331 g/mL at 20 °C) and viscosity (1.385 cP at 20 °C), as well as estimates of the partial specific volume (0.7247 mL/g for DDX3X at 20 °C), were calculated using the program SEDNTERP (Durham, NH, USA) [
