<p>RK-33 is a REN, containing the imidazo[4,5-e][1,3]diazepine ring system that is known for its anticancer properties [

 <xref rid="B16-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. RK-33 has been suggested to target DDX3X based on coimmunoprecipitation studies and work examining DDX3X’s yeast orthologue Ded1p (~53% sequence identity) [
 <xref rid="B11-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Here, using AUC and ITC, we establish for the first time that RK-33 binds directly to DDX3X at low μM concentrations, likely within the Walker A motif that contributes to ATP-binding. Consistently, we also confirm using an ATPase assay and fluorescence-based RNA unwinding assay that RK-33 inhibits DDX3X’s ATPase and RNA unwinding activities at μM concentrations. Bol and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B11-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reported inhibition of helicase activity of yeast Ded1p at lower (nM) RK-33 concentrations. The basis of this difference in sensitivity is likely due to differences in the proteins themselves. The DDX3X used in this study lacked the C-terminal 82 residues that play a role in oligomerization, which is important for RNA duplex binding and DDX3X’s catalytic activity [

 <xref rid="B38-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], meaning that the nature of the RNA substrate differs for the two enzymes. This is also consistent with other studies showing marked differences in the efficacy of compounds against the same enzyme from a range of bacterial species [
