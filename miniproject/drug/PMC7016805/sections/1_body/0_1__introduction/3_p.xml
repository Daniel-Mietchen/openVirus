<p>The small molecule RK-33 (diimidazo [4,5-
 <italic>d</italic>:4′,5′-
 <italic>f</italic>]-[1,3]diazepine) is a ring-expanded nucleoside (REN) analogue [
 <xref rid="B9-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] that has been suggested to target DDX3X based on the observation that biotinylated RK-33 can immunoprecipitate endogenous DDX3X in cells, and that RK-33 can inhibit helicase activity of Ded1p, the yeast orthologue of DDX3X [
 <xref rid="B11-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. RK-33 has been reported to effect G1 cell cycle arrest [
