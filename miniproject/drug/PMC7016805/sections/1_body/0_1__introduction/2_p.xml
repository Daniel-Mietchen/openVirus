<p>DEAD-box helicase 3 X-linked (DDX3X) is a cellular adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)-dependent RNA helicase that hydrolyzes ATP to unwind duplex RNA, thereby remodeling RNA/RNA–protein complexes; these catalytic functions are attributable to highly conserved sequence motifs distributed over two recombinase A (RecA)-like helicase domains [

 <xref rid="B3-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, DDX3X has roles in all aspects of RNA metabolism including transcriptional regulation, pre-mRNA splicing, messenger ribonucleoprotein particle (mRNP) assembly, and mRNA export/translation [
