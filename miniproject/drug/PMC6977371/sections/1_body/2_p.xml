<p>The use of embryonated chicken eggs to study the susceptibility of influenza H3N2 virus to NAIs has been reported
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. The susceptibility of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses to oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), the active metabolite of oseltamivir phosphate, has also been demonstrated
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. The advantages of the use of embryonated chicken eggs are that these provide a live yet controlled host environment for the optimal interactions of the virus and the drug, and are also a cost-effective option before going for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. The HPAI H5N1 viruses cause 100 per cent mortality in embryonated chicken eggs, chickens being the compatible host. The objective of the present study was thus to assess embryonated chicken eggs as a model for studying the susceptibility of the HPAI H5N1 viruses to OC.
