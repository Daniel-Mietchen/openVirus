<p>The emergence of resistance among highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses to oseltamivir has been an increasing cause of concern among public health professionals
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. The virus has been known to infect humans associated with poultry
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and has caused &gt;159 outbreaks in poultry in different parts of India since 2006, with the most recent outbreaks in Odisha from January to September 2019, in which crows and backyard poultry birds died
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. There are four neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) antiviral drugs namely, oseltamivir phosphate, zanamivir, laninamivir and peramivir, of which oseltamivir phosphate and zanamivir are the two currently licensed NAI drugs used for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>; peramivir is licensed for use in the United States of America
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Recently resistance to the NAIs oseltamivir and zanamivir was reported among H5N1 viruses isolated in India
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Due to concerns regarding the emergence of resistance to antivirals and the possibility of human infections, it is imperative to carry out regular antiviral surveillance of HPAI H5N1 viruses.
