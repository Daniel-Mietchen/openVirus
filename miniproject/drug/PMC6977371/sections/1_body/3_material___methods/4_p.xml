 <italic>In ovo</italic> antiviral assays were carried out using 10 to 11 day old embryonated chicken eggs using the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> drug treatment method described previously
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Serial ten-fold dilutions of the virus (prepared in PBS) were mixed with an equal volume of 14 μg/ml of OC and incubated at 37°C for one hour. After incubation, 0.4 ml of this mixture was inoculated via the allantoic route, into 10 eggs per dilution. The untreated virus controls of corresponding dilutions were also inoculated into 10 eggs each. The eggs were incubated at 37°C for 72 h in a humidified incubator. The viability of the embryos was checked daily by candling. Eggs showing mortality were immediately transferred to 4°C. After completion of incubation, all eggs were chilled overnight at 4°C. The allantoic fluid was harvested from each egg, and HA assay was performed. EID
 <sub>50</sub> which is defined as the reciprocal of the dilution of virus per unit volume that results in positive HA titres in 50 per cent of the inoculated eggs and 50 per cent egg lethal dose (ELD
 <sub>50</sub>, defined as the reciprocal of the dilution of virus that results in death in 50% of the inoculated eggs) were calculated using the Reed and Muench method
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. For EID
 <sub>50,</sub> eggs showing HA titres ≥2 HA units were considered positive, whereas for ELD
 <sub>50</sub>, egg mortality within the 72 h after inoculation was the criterion for positivity.
