 <italic>Fluorescence-based NAI assay</italic>: The H5N1 viruses, H5N1-33487 and H5N1-4396, had mean IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.16 and 0.75 nM, respectively, which were in the normal inhibition range, indicating that the two HPAI H5N1 virus isolates were sensitive to OC. The control pH1N1 and H1N1 wild-type reference standard viruses showed mean IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.07±0.03 and 0.16±0.04 nM, respectively, whereas pH1N1 and H1N1 variant controls showed mean IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 46.45±1.32 and 42.92±3.06 nM, respectively. All values mentioned here are the means with standard deviations of at least four replicates.
