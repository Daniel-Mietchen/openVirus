<p>The eggs used in all the experiments were 10 day old at the time of inoculation and 13 day old at the time of completion of the experiment. Such experiments on less than 14 day old embryonated chicken eggs are considered at the borderline of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. It was shown that after amantadine addition in cell cultures infected with susceptible HPAI H5N1 viruses, there was an absolute reduction in HA titres, whereas the amantadine resistant viruses, which possessed the molecular signatures required for resistance, grew to positive HA titres
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Thus, parallels could also be drawn between such 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies and 
 <italic>in ovo</italic> experiments carried out in the present study. This was due to the observation that a significant reduction in the viral HA titres was seen after treatment with OC for the H5N1 viruses and oseltamivir sensitive wild-type control reference viruses; whereas, there was no significant reduction in variant-type control viruses, which were known resistant, thereby indicating that the embryonated chicken egg model was suitable for carrying out susceptibility studies.
