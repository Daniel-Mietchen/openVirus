<p>In a previous study, an influenza H3N2 virus was used to study the susceptibility to NAIs
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> wherein the survival rate of the embryos was used to judge antiviral efficacy. In the present study, it was expected that inhibition of mortality in embryonated eggs would be an appropriate measure to ascertain the susceptibility of HPAI H5N1 viruses to OC. Surprisingly, there was no significant drop in the ELD
 <sub>50</sub> after OC treatment. No protection was evident even after high doses of the drug were administered although significant reduction in the HA titres was observed. This disparity between the reduction in HA and EID
 <sub>50</sub> titres in contrast with the ELD
 <sub>50</sub> could be due to the reason that in eggs inoculated with the higher virus dilutions also, mortality was observed. Such eggs were however, negative for HA. This could be due to the possibility of the presence of virus titres below the limit of detection of the HA assay. Thus, for HPAI H5N1 viruses, in spite of mortality, monitoring a significant drop in HA titres was found more appropriate to assess the antiviral susceptibility. Therefore, it is important to standardize infectious virus titres and select the virus dilutions accordingly in antiviral susceptibility studies. As per our study, the virus dilution corresponding to 100 EID
 <sub>50</sub> was found suitable to be used in antiviral experiments.
