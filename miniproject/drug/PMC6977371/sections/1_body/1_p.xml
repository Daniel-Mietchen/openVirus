<p>Advanced molecular-based assays including Sanger sequencing, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), pyrosequencing and next-generation sequencing are used to determine genotypic mutations leading to resistance to adamantanes in influenza viruses. However, for the determination of susceptibility or resistance to NAI drugs, the fluorescence-based NAI assay and neuraminidase (
 <italic>NA</italic>) gene sequence analysis are considered the gold standard

 <italic>In vitro</italic> cell culture susceptibility studies have used Madin Darby Canine Kidney cells, whereas 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies include experiments in mice and ferrets. In ferrets, oseltamivir doses of 5.0 mg/kg twice daily had a significant impact on reducing the severity of the disease and survival
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Oseltamivir has also been known to prevent mortality in mice infected with lethal doses of HPAI H5N1 virus
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. For 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, a reduction in viral haemagglutination (HA) titres was considered as a measure of drug susceptibility
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. In addition to these methods, the use of 10 day old embryonated chicken eggs has been proposed as a model to study antiviral susceptibility of HPAI H5N1 viruses. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic> studies in mouse and ferret model provide more insight into the exact mechanism of drug resistance; however, ferrets are not easily available, expensive and require specialized housing facility. The embryonated chicken eggs, on the other hand, are easily available and cost-effective. The chick embryo is the standard host system for the propagation and isolation of avian influenza viruses
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Since the in ovo system (using embryonated chicken eggs) is considered to be at the borderline of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, both the parameters; embryo mortality, as well as the HA titres of the virus in the allantoic fluids of the eggs, were assessed as indicators of virus susceptibility to the drug.
