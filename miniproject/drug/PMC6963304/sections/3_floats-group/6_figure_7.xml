  <p>Germacrone reduces the production of PRV vaccine strain Barth K61. (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>) Vero (
   <bold>A</bold>) and PK-1 (
   <bold>B</bold>) cells were infected with PRV vaccine strain Barth K61 (MOI 0.1) for 1 h. The unbound virus particles were washed with serum-free DMEM, then medium containing 150 μM of germacrone was added. DMSO was used as a control. After 24 h of treatment, virus yielded in supernatants from infected cells was determined by TCID
