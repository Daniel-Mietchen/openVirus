<p>The approval of DAA for use in children is in progress in several countries but still not allowed in many countries. IFN-based therapies are still widely used for treating children worldwide. Although PegIFN plus ribavirin is approved for children with HCV infection (age ≥3 years), IFN treatment is no longer recommended for children in the DAA era except for a few with significant morbidity by rapid progression such as the occurrence of advanced fibrosis [

According to a recent guideline for HCV in children, anti-HCV IgG levels should be determined for all children (≥18 months of age) born to HCV-infected women, HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction should be considered in the first year of life for perinatally exposed children, and screening should be repeated after 3 years of age in cases of anti-HCV positive results (≥18 months of age). Liver enzymes should be checked at the initial appointment and then annually thereafter, and a severity assessment is required [
