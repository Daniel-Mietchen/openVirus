<p>The coding sequence of SARS-CoV nsp5-pp1a/pp1ab 3CL (chymotrypsin-like) protease (3CLpro) was obtained at the NCBI database (NP_828863.1). The catalytic domain of 3CLpro (M1∼T196) was synthesised chemically by Bioneer (Daejeon, Korea) and cloned into a bacteriophage T7-based expression 
 <italic>vector</italic>, pBT7. The plasmid DNA was transformed into 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) for protein expression. 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) cells were grown on Luria–Bertani (LB) agar plates containing 150 μg ml
 <sup>−1</sup> ampicillin. Several colonies were picked and grown in capped test tubes with 10 ml LB broth containing 150 μg ml
 <sup>−1</sup> ampicillin. A cell stock composed of 0.85 ml culture and 0.15 ml glycerol was prepared and frozen at 193 K for use in a large culture. The frozen cell stock was grown in 5 ml LB medium and diluted into 1000 ml fresh LB medium. The culture was incubated at 310 K with shaking until an OD
 <sub>600</sub> of 0.6–0.8 was reached. At this point, the expression of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro was induced using isopropyl-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 1 mM. The culture was further grown at 310 K for 3 h in a shaking incubator. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7650
 <italic>g</italic> (6500 rev min
 <sup>−1</sup>) for 10 min in a high-speed refrigerated centrifuge at 277 K. The cultured cell paste was resuspended in 25 ml of a buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 μg ml
 <sup>−1</sup> DNase I. The cell suspension was disrupted using an ultrasonic cell disruptor (Digital Sonifier 450, Branson, USA). Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 24,900g (15,000 rev min
 <sup>–1</sup>) for 30 min in a high-speed refrigerated ultra-centrifuge at 277 K.
