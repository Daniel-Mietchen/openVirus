<p>A flavonoid library consisting of 10 different scaffolds was also built (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). It contains five isoflavones, one isoflavane, 17 flavones, 11 flavonols, seven flavanols, seven flavanones, four flavanonol, one prenylflavonoid, nine chalcones and two unclassified flavonoids (

We applied the library to assay SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Using 64 flavonoids, an inhibitory effect of each compound at 20 μM was tested. Among them, herbacetin (3,4′,5,7,8-pentahydroxyflavone), rhoifolin (apigenin-7-O-rhamnoglucoside) and pectolinarin (5,7-dihydroxy 4′,6-dimethoxyflavone 7-rutinoside) were found to have prominent inhibitory activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>). The binding affinity data were plotted as log inhibitor concentration versus percent fluorescence inhibition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>). The three compounds showed the severely reduced fluorescent intensity and thus represented their SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitory activity. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated from the dose-dependent inhibitory curves of herbacetin, rhoifolin and pectolinarin. The measured values were 33.17, 27.45 and 37.78 μM, respectively. Since flavonoids are known to be aggregated through complexity and thus non-specifically inhibit various proteases, the assay in the presence of Triton X-100 was also performed

 </xref>. Before the examination, we tested the effects of Triton X-100 on the catalytic activity of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro. As shown in 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14756366.2019.1690480" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>, only a slight increase in catalyst activity was observed up to 0.1% Triton X-100. Therefore, the assay was performed at a concentration of 0.01% Triton X-100 with no significant interference detected.
