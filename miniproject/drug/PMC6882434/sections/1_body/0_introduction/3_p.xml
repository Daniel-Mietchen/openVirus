<p>In this study, we employed a proteolytic method to probe SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitory compounds. A synthetic peptide labelled with an Edans-Dabcyl FRET (Fluorescence resonance energy transfer) pair

 </xref>. However, a molecular level study has not been reported for SARS-CoV. Therefore, we performed the proteolytic assay with flavonoids followed by an induced-fit docking experiment with top hits. With the results, we tried to deduce a structural and functional relationship of flavonoids crucial to binding with SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The information can be applied to develop synthetic compounds with better affinities.
