<p>The assay and docking result indicates important conclusions. At first, flavonoids have a wide range of binding affinity to SARS-CoV CLpro due to their hydrophobic aromatic rings and hydrophilic hydroxyl groups. Second, the presence of carbohydrate groups influences severely to the binding affinity and mode of the chromen-4-one moiety. Third, Triton X-100 is critical to reduce false-positives and overestimates. Based on the result, the strategy to cope with SARS targeting SARS-CoV 3CLpro can be newly designed. A further study is going on to make derivatives which lead to better inhibitory compounds based on this study.</p>
