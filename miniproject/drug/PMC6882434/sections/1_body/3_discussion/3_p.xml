<p>The glide scores of rhoifolin and pectolinarin were –9.565 and –8.054, respectively. They belong to the flavone family. Interestingly, their binding modes are different from those of the above three flavonols. Rhoifolin and pectolinarin possess α-
 <sc>l</sc>-rhamnopyranosyl β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside and 
 <sc>l</sc>-mannopyranosyl β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside, respectively. The additional bulky carbohydrate groups are attached to 7-position of the chromen-4-one scaffold. As a result, the hydrogen bond formed between the 7-hydroxyl group and the backbone of Ile188 was abolished. In addition, the bulky groups require a large space to reside in. Therefore, these carbohydrate groups occupy the S1 and S2 sites and the chromen-4-one moieties locate in the S2 and S3′ sites, unlike the above three flavonols. The better affinity of rhoifolin may be due to orchestrated binding through S1, S2 and S3' sites.
