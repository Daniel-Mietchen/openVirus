Therefore, researches targeting these viruses have been required. Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been rising targets of some flavonoids. The antiviral activity of some flavonoids against CoVs is presumed directly caused by inhibiting 3C-like protease (3CLpro). Here, we applied a flavonoid library to systematically probe inhibitory compounds against SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Herbacetin, rhoifolin and pectolinarin were found to efficiently block the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The interaction of the three flavonoids was confirmed using a tryptophan-based fluorescence method, too. An induced-fit docking analysis indicated that S1, S2 and S3&#x02032; sites are involved in binding with flavonoids. The comparison with previous studies showed that Triton X-100 played a critical role in objecting false positive or overestimated inhibitory activity of flavonoids. With the systematic analysis, the three flavonoids are suggested to be templates to design functionally improved inhibitors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>SARS-CoV</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV 3CLpro</kwd><kwd>flavonoid</kwd><kwd>FRET</kwd><kwd>inhibitory compounds</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">DHS</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2018R1D1A1B07050942</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Research Foundation of Korea</named-content><named-content content-type="funderidentifier">10.13039/501100003725</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Ministry of Education, Science and Technology</named-content><named-content content-type="funderidentifier">10.13039/501100004085</named-content></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Basic Science Research Programmes, 2018R1D1A1B07050781 to DHS and 2018R1D1A1B07050942 to MK, funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea grant granted by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Republic of Korea (MEST).

CoVs, along with Artierivirdae and Roniviridae, belong to the Coronaviridae family in the order Nidovirales. These CoVs can infect various hosts, including avian, swine and humans. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) represent a major group of CoVs associated with various respiratory diseases from common cold to serious pneumonia and bronchiolitis<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>. Today, HCoVs are recognised as one of the fastest-evolving viruses derived from their characteristic high genomic nucleotide replacement rates and recombination<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the first confirmed atypical pneumonia in China's Guangdong province, has spread to several countries. The most common symptoms of SARS include coughing, high fever (&#x0003e;38&#x02009;&#x000b0;C), chills, convulsions, headaches, dizziness and progressive radiographic changes of the chest and lymphopenia<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>. The severity of the disease shows a death rate of about 3% to 6%, although this rate could rise up to 43% to 55% for senior citizens older than 60 years<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>. The primary epidemic of SARS was eventually controlled, but a SARS CoV-like virus was detected in Chinese bats<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>. Besides, a recent pandemic of middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by a novel coronavirus MERS-CoV raises fear of possible recurrence of SARS or related dangerous diseases<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>. Since there is no vaccine and effective therapy for these viral infections, developing anti-SARS drugs against future outbreaks remains a formidable challenge.</p><p>SARS- and MERS-CoVs genomes contain two open reading frames ORF1a and ORF1b translated to two respective viral polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab by host ribosomes. ORF1a encodes two cysteine proteases, a papain-like protease (PLpro) and a 3C-like protease (3CLpro). While PLpro cuts the first three cleavage sites of its polyprotein, 3CLpro is responsible for cleavage of the remaining 11 locations resulting in release of a total of 16 non-structural proteins (nsp) in both SARS- and MERS-CoVs. The homodimeric form of 3CLpro is active in the presence of substrates. The crystal structures of both 3CLpros showed that each monomer is composed of three structural domains: domains I and II form a chymotrypsin-like architecture with a catalytic cysteine and are connected to a third C-terminal domain via a long loop<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>. In the proteolytic site, all 3CLpros prefer glutamine at P1 position and leucine, basic residues, small hydrophobic residues at P2, P3 and P4 positions, respectively<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>. At P1&#x02032; and P2&#x02032; positions, small residues are required. However, P3&#x02032; position shows no strong preference. Since the autocleavage process is essential for viral propagation, 3CLpro is a good drug target for anti-coronaviral infection.</p><p>In this study, we employed a proteolytic method to probe SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitory compounds. A synthetic peptide labelled with an Edans-Dabcyl FRET (Fluorescence resonance energy transfer) pair<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> was used to search SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitory compounds against a flavonoid library. Recent studies showed that flavonoids have antiviral activity in some viruses including SARS-CoV<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13&#x02013;17</sup></xref>. However, a molecular level study has not been reported for SARS-CoV. Therefore, we performed the proteolytic assay with flavonoids followed by an induced-fit docking experiment with top hits. With the results, we tried to deduce a structural and functional relationship of flavonoids crucial to binding with SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The information can be applied to develop synthetic compounds with better affinities.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0003"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>The coding sequence of SARS-CoV nsp5-pp1a/pp1ab 3CL (chymotrypsin-like) protease (3CLpro) was obtained at the NCBI database (NP_828863.1).

Tryptophan was well known to emit its fluorescence. Therefore, if tryptophan is positioned adequately in proteins, the change of fluorescence intensity can reflect the binding state of chemicals and be used to judge interaction between proteins and chemicals. The SARS-CoV 3CLpro contains one tryptophan residue (Trp31) at the catalytic domain. Its backbone lines up at the entrance of the active site. Therefore, its fluorescence change can reflect environmental variation of the active site. The catalytic domain of SARS-CoV 3CLpro used in this study displays a fluorescence peak at 340&#x02009;nm after the tryptophan excitation wavelength of 290&#x02009;nm. We monitored the change of the fluorescence intensities depending on the presence or absence of all flavonoids. Since each compound in the flavonoid library was almost non-fluorescent under the experiment condition, a change of fluorescence intensity reflects interactions between the catalytic domain and chemicals.

In particular, they belong to a type of plant secondary metabolites with a polyphenolic structure widely found in fruits and vegetables. They have miscellaneous reciprocal biochemical and antioxidant effects associated with various diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25&#x02013;27</sup></xref>.

Intriguingly, some flavonoids also have antiviral activity<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref>. Specifically, apigenin, luteolin, quercetin, amentoflavone<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref>, quercetin, daidzein, puerarin, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, gallocatechin gallate<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> and kaempferol<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> were reported to inhibit the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Therefore, the antiviral effect is presumed to be directly linked to suppress the activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro in some cases. However, the systematic analysis using various scaffolds of flavonoids was not reported. In order to find the best scaffold to inhibit the function of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, an assay with various flavonoid derivatives classified in 10 scaffolds was built and performed. Among them, the best compounds were one flavonol, herbacetin and two flavones, rhoifolin and pectolinarin. In the current assay method including 0.01% Triton X-100, the three flavonoids showed the better inhibitory activity than the previously reported flavonoids as mentioned above<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28&#x02013;30</sup></xref>.

It is worthwhile to note that amentoflavone, the most effective flavonoid inhibiting SARS-CoV 3CLpro<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref>, did not effectively function in the presence of 0.01% Triton X-100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig id="F0005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>The effect of Triton X-100 on flavonoids.

The glide scores of three compounds were &#x02013;9.263, &#x02013;8.526 and &#x02013;8.930, respectively. The tendency of the glide scores is matched with the binding affinity of the compounds. The comparison of the predicted binding modes of three complex structures showed critical factors governing their binding affinity. In common, they share the kaempferol motif. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>, the phenyl moiety of kaempferol occupies the S1 site of SARS-CoV through a hydrogen bond with Glu166. In contrast, the chromen-4-one scaffold of kaempferol locates in the S2 site. In herbacetin, total of four hydrogen bonds are formed within a distance of 2.33&#x02009;&#x000c5; in the S2 site. Especially, the major binding force was driven by the presence of the additional 8-hydroxyl group which plays a critical role in binding with Glu166 and Gln189. These bindings are predicted to confer a good glide score of herbacetin. In contrast, the binding modes of morin and kaemperol become different due to the absence of above two hydrogen bonds due the lack of the 8-hydroxyl group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>). The absence also induces the change nullifying the hydrogen bond formed by the 5-hydroxyl group of the chromen-4-one scaffold with Asp187 observed in herbacetin. Though there is a new hydrogen bond formed through the 3-hydroxyl group, it may not enough to overcome the loss of binding capacity induced by the 8-hydroxyl group. This survey shows the importance of the 8-hydroxyl group at the strong binding affinity of herbacetin.</p><p>The glide scores of rhoifolin and pectolinarin were &#x02013;9.565 and &#x02013;8.054, respectively. They belong to the flavone family. Interestingly, their binding modes are different from those of the above three flavonols. Rhoifolin and pectolinarin possess &#x003b1;-<sc>l</sc>-rhamnopyranosyl &#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside and <sc>l</sc>-mannopyranosyl &#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside, respectively. The additional bulky carbohydrate groups are attached to 7-position of the chromen-4-one scaffold. As a result, the hydrogen bond formed between the 7-hydroxyl group and the backbone of Ile188 was abolished. In addition, the bulky groups require a large space to reside in. Therefore, these carbohydrate groups occupy the S1 and S2 sites and the chromen-4-one moieties locate in the S2 and S3&#x02032; sites, unlike the above three flavonols. The better affinity of rhoifolin may be due to orchestrated binding through S1, S2 and S3' sites.</p><p>The assay and docking result indicates important conclusions. At first, flavonoids have a wide range of binding affinity to SARS-CoV CLpro due to their hydrophobic aromatic rings and hydrophilic hydroxyl groups. Second, the presence of carbohydrate groups influences severely to the binding affinity and mode of the chromen-4-one moiety. Third, Triton X-100 is critical to reduce false-positives and overestimates. Based on the result, the strategy to cope with SARS targeting SARS-CoV 3CLpro can be newly designed. A further study is going on to make derivatives which lead to better inhibitory compounds based on this study.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have created a library of flavonoids to systematically investigate SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitory compound by a FRET method. Using the library, a number of flavonoids with a wide range of inhibitory activity were detected. Intriguingly, inhibitory activities of some flavonoids were turned out to be artificial when triton X-100 was treated. Herbacetin, rhoifolin and pectolinarin were the best inhibitory compounds against SARS-CoV 3CLpro in the flavonoid library. The binding of the flavonoids was independently demonstrated by a tryptophan-based fluorescence method. In order to predict the flavonoid scaffolds needed to interact with the catalytic site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, an induced-fit docking study was performed and analysed. The presence of additional 8-hydroxyl group of herbacetin was expected to be critical to acquire its high binding affinity around the S1 and S2 sites. The occupation of the S1 and S2 sites by carbohydrate groups of rhoifolin and pectolinarin was anticipated to be another way of getting high affinity to SARS-CoV 3CLpro in glycosylated flavonoids. This study suggests that the biochemical assay combined with the docking prediction may be useful to develop better inhibitory flavonoid derivatives from various flavonoid scaffolds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM4187"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" xlink:href="IENZ_A_1690480_SM4187.zip" orientation="portrait" id="d37e122" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="s0011"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Lai</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Cavanagh</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group>
