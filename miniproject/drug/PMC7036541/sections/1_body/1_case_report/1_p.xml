<p>A 64-year-old woman presented to our Dermatology Department in April 2011 with a 2-year history of progressive erythematous scaling eruption which first arose on her breasts as asymptomatic erythematous macules and patches and gradually spread to her neck, trunk, abdomen, and thighs. Her medical history included a blood transfusion in 1970 and a positive anti-HCV test by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) in 2007. She had a history of hypertension and over several years had been sequentially treated with nicardipine hydrochloride, amlodipine besilate, and candesartan cilexetil. Because her blood pressure control was poor, her medication was changed three times in recent years (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Treatment with the latter was the only medication she reported and it was discontinued 2 months prior to presentation. She reported no personal or family history of autoimmune disease or drug eruptions. In January 2009, she had been started on combination therapy of PEG-IFNÎ±-2b plus ribavirin administered subcutaneously to treat progressive liver disease, but treatment was discontinued 2 months later, in March 2009, due to a persistently elevated serum level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), despite a reduction in HCV RNA level. Three months later, in June 2009, she noticed macules on her breasts, but she could not rule out the possibility that the eruptions had developed prior to the administration of therapy.
