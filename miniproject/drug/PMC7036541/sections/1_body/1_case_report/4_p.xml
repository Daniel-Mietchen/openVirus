<p>Due to the possibility that her skin lesions had been a reaction to candesartan cilexetil, she was asked to avoid this medicine, and amlodipine besilate was re-administered to control her hypertension. However, a few days later on amlodipine besilate, her skin lesions worsened again (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>), so amlodipine besilate was discontinued. By 8 weeks later, in August 2011, the skin lesions had disappeared. During those 8 weeks, she received no treatment for hypertension. Since her blood pressure was high (165/110), the patient consented to start oral atenolol daily. Thereafter, the patient's course was complicated by additional recurrences of erythematous macules in precisely the same sites on the breasts, approximately a few days after she had begun taking atenolol. Three or 4 oval lesions appeared at previously involved sites on the breasts, but some previous sites on the neck and posterior legs showed no sign of recurrence. During several flare-ups of erythematous macules, HCV RNA and ALT levels fluctuated considerably. However, as the recurrences that appeared within a month of starting treatment with atenolol gradually subsided, HCV RNA levels increased. Thus, there was a clear inverse correlation between recurrence of the plaques and HCV RNA levels.
