<p>Physical examination at the time of presentation revealed widespread reddish-gray macules of varying sizes with fine scales that were occasionally erythematous but never elevated. These macules were located on her neck, trunk, abdomen (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), bilateral antecubital fossa, and posterior legs. Over most of her body, these macular processes were confluent. Histopathologic examination of a biopsy specimen from erythematous macules on the breast demonstrated a superficial, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with a vacuolar interface change, exocytosis and pigment incontinence in the papillary dermis, compatible with parapsoriasis en plaque.
