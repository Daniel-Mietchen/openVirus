<p>This report is the only known attempt to correlate HCV viral load with the occurrence of FDE lesions using time-dependent analysis of HCV-RNA levels. We observed a strong inverse correlation between the development of FDE and HCV viral load, suggesting that HCV-specific immune responses may be involved in the pathogenesis of HCV-associated skin diseases.</p>
