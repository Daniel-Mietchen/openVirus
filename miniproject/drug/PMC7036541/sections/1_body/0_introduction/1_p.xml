<p>Although it has been reported that hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be pathogenic for several skin diseases [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], it is unclear whether HCV 
 <italic>per se</italic> or hepatitis treatment agents cause these diseases. Although recently developed interferon (IFN)-free therapies for HCV shorten the treatment duration and alleviate sustained virologic responses [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], pegylated IFN (PEG-IFN) concomitant with ribavirin is used in patients with HCV genotype 1b [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and, as IFN is known to affect the cytokine cascade [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], adverse effects of treatment with IFN plus ribavirin are attributed to IFN. Accordingly, since IFN can stimulate macrophages to produce IL-15, which activate anti-viral CD8 and natural killer cell responses [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], we hypothesized that adverse events in patients treated with these agents were IFN-induced immune responses not effects of HCV 
 <italic>per se</italic>. If adverse events in HCV-infected patients were sustained HCV-specific immune responses, development or exacerbation of such events should be temporarily associated with decreased HCV viral load.
