<p>In this issue of 
 <italic>Clinical Infectious Diseases</italic>, Zhao and colleagues report on a clinical phase 1/2 study of preemptive ATC therapy after allogeneic haploidentical stem cell transplantation, and on data from a humanized mouse model [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The results indicated that early ATC was safe and lowered the risk of late or persistent CMV infection compared to a high-risk control group. However, CMV infection in the setting of stem cell transplantation is a complex problem in which many factors play a role. Even though no single factor will determine the outcome, a concise discussion of the elements will reveal a pattern, within which the added value of the study by Zhao can be estimated.
