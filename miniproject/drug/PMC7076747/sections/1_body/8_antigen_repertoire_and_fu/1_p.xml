<p>The antiviral effect of ATC depends on the composition, which is determined by the production protocol. Until now, the number of different protocols used roughly equals the number of studies done. In a nutshell, early studies used tetramer-based selection and extensive in vitro stimulation, resulting in terminally differentiated, effector CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, which serve to temporarily bridge a period with low immunity [

 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cells targeting a broader antigen repertoire and proliferating in vivo [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14–18</xref>]. The trade-off between effector function and replicative potential of T cells has been demonstrated [
