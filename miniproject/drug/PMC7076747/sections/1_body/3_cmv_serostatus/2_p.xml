 <sup>+</sup> recipients are not eligible for studies with donor-derived ATC, although they have the highest risk of CMV infection and disease [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The risk is high because the graft only contains undifferentiated progenitor cells that still need to undergo thymic programming to naive CMV-specific T cells, but no memory pool that can rapidly expand if so required. To overcome this problem, use of third-party ATC “off the shelf” or production of CMV-specific T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic cells were studied [
