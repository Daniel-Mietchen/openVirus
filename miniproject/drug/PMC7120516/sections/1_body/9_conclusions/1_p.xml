<p>Pharmacogenomics is providing a miraculous opportunity to bring change in clinical practices, medicine, and health due to upcoming researches in to this field. It also helps in minimizing toxicity and adverse effects by correlating newly found resistance mutations with historical antiretroviral use, which could be of interest to clinicians in planning subsequent antiretroviral regimens for patients who have undergone a range of treatments. If the molecular diagnostic tests can be made less expensive, it will make able to give more imperative therapy against viral disease as AIDS/HIV and hepatitis which are currently giving an enormous economical burden. However, for this to happen, there will need to be major technological improvements in our ability to sequence or screen genomic DNA to assess an individualâ€™s genome in the context of population data. Extensive population-based studies will be required to evaluate the phenotypic significance both acute and long term of genomic variation, at the level of individual variants and combinations of variants. Clinical trials must be carried out with the goal of identifying the outcomes of various combinations of genomic, expression-based, metabolomic, and proteomic data to arrive at complete clinico-genomic profiles predictive of disease risk and drug response. All these efforts jointly open a new ray of hope for a miraculous change in the history of medicine for people suffering from viral diseases.</p>
