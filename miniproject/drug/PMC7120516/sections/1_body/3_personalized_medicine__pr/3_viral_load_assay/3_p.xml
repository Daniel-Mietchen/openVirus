<p>The amplified products from this nucleic acid-based method can be electrophoretically analyzed and fluorescently visualized in real-time pattern. For single-molecule identification, nonspecific fluorescent dye such as SYBR Green can be chosen; currently our clinical pharmacology laboratory uses this approach. High-fidelity DNA polymerase is different from Taq polymerase in their exonuclease activities: the former has 3′–5′ exonuclease activity or proofreading function; the latter has 5′–3′ exonuclease activity. These differences are differentially employed in real-time visualization of PCR-amplified products. The Taq polymerase is used in TaqMan technology, whereas real-time visualization of assays using the mutation-sensitive on/off switch mediated by the high-fidelity DNA polymerase depends on molecular beacon or FRET. The molecular beacon structure can have target-independent sequences and be designed at the 5′ end of primers. The molecular beacon can have a mix of target-specific sequences in its loop and target-independent sequences in its hairpin. This mixed beacon adds one short fragment to be identified and thus helps to enhance the specificity of the assay. Similarly, the combination of the mutation-sensitive on/off switch and the FRET technology also adds additional sequence fragments under discrimination test. The mutation-sensitive on/off switch offers high sensitivity and specificity in nucleic acid identification/mutation detection. Its combination with fluorescent real-time visualization makes it a highly competitive technology in developing both qualitative and quantitative assays for HIV infection.</p>
