<p>Pharmacogenomics examines the influence of genetic variability on drug efficacy or toxicity by correlating gene expression or single-nucleotide polymorphisms with patient outcomes. The PREDICT study (Mallal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2008</xref>) showed that the presence of the allele HLA-B5701 is highly predictive of an HSR to ABC. Positive and negative predictive value was 60 and 100 %, respectively. The used of a genetic tests for HLA-B5701 led to a reduction in ABC-related HSR to &lt;1 % in the ARIES trial (Squires et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">2008</xref>), compared to a rate of between 4 and 8 % seen in other trials not using HLA screening. This is the first example of a clinical use of genetic screening in HIV disease management to get widespread approval. Other potential mutation at position 516G &gt; T in CYP2B6 signals a longer half-life and increased levels of efavirenz (Haas et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2004</xref>). Other haplotypes within CYP2B6 have been associated with a longer half-life for nevirapine (Chantarangsu 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2009</xref>). The genetic variant associated with Gilbert’s disease, UGT 1A1*28, has been identified as part of a haplotype of four UGT1A variants spanning three genes at the UGT1A gene locus (Lankisch et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2006</xref>). Initial assessment performed in a small cohort of patients with TDF-associated renal dysfunction identified a single substitution at position of 1,249 of MRP2 gene as being potentially associated with the side effect (Izzedine et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2006</xref>).
