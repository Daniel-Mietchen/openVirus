<p>There are around 40 antiviral compounds in clinical use targeting various viral diseases (over half of these drugs are being used in the treatment of patients with HIV infection), while there is no treatment for most acute infections, such as the ones that cause severe illnesses, including hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, and even cancer. Most of the available drugs are of limited efficacy and cause severe side effects (Dykxhoorn and Lieberman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2006</xref>). HIV protease, which cleaves Gag and Gag–Pro–Pol polyproteins at ten varied sites necessary for the maturation of virus (Kohl et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">1988</xref>), is a major therapeutic target for antiviral drugs. In the last 20 years, structure-based drug discovery efforts have led to the development of nine approved competitive active site protease inhibitors (PIs). These inhibitors are the most potent anti-HIV drugs and essential components of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (Bartlett et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2001</xref>). The development of drug resistance is a major reason for the failure of protease inhibitor therapy. The virus accumulates many mutations within the protease that prevent PIs from binding to the protease. More than half the residues within the protease mutate in different combinations and lead to drug resistance (Wu et al.
