<p>The purpose of resistance testing is to make available the information to assist in the selection of the antiretroviral regimen(s) and more likely achieve and maintain viral suppression. All guidelines come to the result that HIV drug resistance testing should be performed when a HIV-infected person enters into clinical care, whether he is treated immediately or not. The aim of this strategy is to detect chances of transmitted resistance as maximum as possible. In HIV-infected individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy, resistance testing should be performed in the presence of virological failure. To ensure adequate performance of resistance testing, HIV-1 RNA levels should be at least 1,000 copies/ml at the time of testing, although guidelines agree that resistance testing could be also attempted in individuals with HIV-1 RNA levels between 500 and 1,000 copies/ml. However, in this last group of patient, the chances of amplifying HIV-1 sequences are markedly lower. Drug resistance testing might also be helpful when managing suboptimal viral load reduction. However, this is less clear because the addition of, or switch to, new antiretroviral drugs could be helpful to achieve viral suppression. Importantly, given that drug resistance mutations wane after treatment interruption, drug resistance testing in the setting of virological failure should be performed while the patient is taking his/her antiretroviral drugs or within 4 weeks after discontinuing therapy.</p>
