<p>Thus, current emerging techniques like sequencing, microarray, and real-time PCR revolutionized the modern concept of medicine, i.e., well-known as personalized medicine concept where treatment will be based on individualsâ€™ genome composition as well as genetic makeup of infective agents (strains). One important aspect of personalized medicine is patient-to-patient variation in drug response. Pharmacogenomics addresses this issue by seeking to identify genetic contributors to human variation in drug efficacy and toxicity in viral diseases. Here, we are going to discuss current updates, success, and challenges of this field, which has evolved from studies of single candidate genes to comprehensive genome-wide analyses, and thus, this new field will ultimately open new vistas to understand the better management against the fatal viral diseases, so more effective personalized clinical treatment strategies may be developed.</p>
