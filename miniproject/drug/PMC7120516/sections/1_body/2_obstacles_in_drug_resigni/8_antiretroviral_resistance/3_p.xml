<p>These tests have limited sensitivity for the detection of minority variants in the viral population, so detection of non-B subtypes may be limited for some tests, and last but not least these results require expert interpretation. In addition, a genotype test can be used to generate a predicted phenotype, referred to as a virtual phenotype. With the virtual phenotype, the viral sequence (genotype) is entered into a database consisting of paired genotypes and phenotypes in order to derive an estimated phenotype. More recently, some investigators have employed newer techniques, such as allele-specific PCR, single-genome, and ultra-deep sequencing, to assess the role of minority HIV variants that harbor drug resistance, but are not detectable by current standard genotypic or phenotypic assays (Hirsch et al.
