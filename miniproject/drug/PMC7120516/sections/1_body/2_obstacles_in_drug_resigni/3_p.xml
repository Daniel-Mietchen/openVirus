<p>Drug resistance is defined, in a clinical setting, as the point at which administration of the drug can no longer safely treat the disease state due to an induced change in the drug target or an inability of the drug to reach the target. With an antimicrobial agent, clinical resistance occurs when the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the drug, for a given microbial strain, exceeds that concentration of drug that can safely be administered. Resistance to a drug can arise by (1) mutation of the gene (or gene cluster); (2) by acquisition of extrachromosomal DNA, or a transposable plasmid, that carries the resistance gene or genes; (3) upregulation of the target; or (4) upregulation of an efflux mechanism. One study has recently suggested (Peet 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2010</xref>) an approach to combating drug resistance that involves the selection of resilient drug targets (Lefebvre and Schiffer 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2008</xref>) that are evolutionally constrained and the development of robust drugs (Nalam and Schiffer 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2008</xref>) that are less susceptible to the development of resistance. Importantly, antiviral chemotherapy is plagued by the rapid development of drug resistance strains, resulting from the high rate of replication of viruses combined with the low fidelity with which they replicate their genomes.
