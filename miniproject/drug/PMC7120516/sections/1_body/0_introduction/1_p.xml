<p>Infectious diseases like viral are the number one cause of premature death in the world. A large number of antiviral drugs are used clinically, but their effectiveness is being eroded by the development of resistance and concerns over safety. Research in this area has led to fundamental discoveries, which have helped our understanding of the reasons why individuals differ in the way they handle drugs and ultimately in the way they respond to drugs, either in terms of efficacy or toxicity. However, not much of this knowledge has been translated into clinical practice, most drug–gene associations that have some evidence of clinical validity have not progressed to clinical settings. Advances in genomics since 2000, after exploration of the human genome, have provided us with unprecedented opportunities to understand variability in drug responses and the opportunity to incorporate this into patient cure. The needs for newer and safer antiviral drugs remain continued. Nowadays an explosion in genome sequencing of both viral pathogens and their human host is helping us to understand the complex interactions involved in the infection process. The pharmaceutical industry is exploiting this information to identify better targets for treating viral diseases and to improve understanding of patient responses to a drug so-called pharmacogenomics. Common human diseases caused by viruses include the common cold, the flu, chickenpox, and cold sores. Serious diseases such as Ebola, hepatitis, and AIDS are also caused by viruses. Many viruses cause little or no disease and are said to be “benign.” The more harmful viruses are described as virulent. Viruses cause different diseases depending on the types of cell that they infect. Some viruses can cause lifelong or chronic infections where the viruses continue to reproduce in the body despite the host’s defense mechanisms, as it is common in hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and HIV infections.</p>
