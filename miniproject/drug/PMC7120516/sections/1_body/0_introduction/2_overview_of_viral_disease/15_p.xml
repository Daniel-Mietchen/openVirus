<p>Most swine influenza viruses (SIVs) do not cause disease in humans. However, some countries have reported cases of human infection with SIVs. Most of these human infections have been mild and the viruses have not spread further to other people. The H1N1 virus that caused the influenza pandemic in 2009â€“2010, thought to have originated in swine, is an example of SIV that was able to spread easily among people and also cause disease.</p>
