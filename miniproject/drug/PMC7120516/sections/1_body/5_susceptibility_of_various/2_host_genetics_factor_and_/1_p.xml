<p>While it is well known that carcinogenic human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the causal agents of cervical cancer, HPV infections are extremely common relative to rare cancer incidence, indicating that many infections spontaneously resolve (Schiffman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">2007</xref>) or persist without progression. Host genetic factors may play a role in cervical carcinogenesis and are thought to influence who develops persistent HPV infection and perhaps who further progresses to cancer (Czene et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2002</xref>; Hemminki and Chen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">1999</xref>; Hemminki et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2002</xref>; Carrington et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2005</xref>). The roles of host genetic factors and other cofactors associated with cervical cancer are summarized in Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">28.5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">28.6</xref>. As discussed by Safaeian et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">2012</xref>), it is particularly very interesting because the stepwise pathogenesis of the disease has been extensively studied. From its initiation through HPV infection at the cervical transformation zone, and subsequent steps related to viral persistence, progression to precancer, and invasion (Schiffman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">2007</xref>), the same or different factors can be associated with each step toward pathogenesis. The role of nongenetic cofactors in persistence and progression has been well studied, but there are fewer studies on the host genetics role on the pathogenesis of cervical cancer.
