<p>Highly active antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1, although resulting in dramatic suppression of viral replication, has also furnished a strong selective force for the emergence of drug-resistant variants. Here, the distribution of polymorphisms can be extreme. For example, examination of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and HIV-1 protease structural variant databases (Variome™ modules) established by Structural Bioinformatics (SBI;
