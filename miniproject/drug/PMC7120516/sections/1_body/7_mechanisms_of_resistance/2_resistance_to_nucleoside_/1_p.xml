<p>Nucleoside analogues and nucleotide analogues (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab13" ref-type="table">28.13</xref>) block the synthesis of viral DNA by reverse transcriptase enzyme. After phosphorylation by cellular kinases, these compounds are incorporated by reverse transcriptase into the nascent chain of viral DNA. Because these drugs lack a 3â€² hydroxyl group, no additional nucleotides can be attached to them, and the synthesis of viral DNA is arrested. Two distinct mechanisms are involved in HIV resistance to these drugs: impairment of the incorporation of the analogue into DNA and removal of the analogue from the prematurely terminated DNA chain.
