<p>The HIV protease cleaves large polyprotein precursors at specific sites, releasing the structural proteins and enzymes necessary for the assembly of infectious viral particles. In the absence of a functional protease, viral particles are produced, but they are immature and are not infectious. The protease of HIV is a symmetrically assembled homodimer with a central, symmetric, substrate-binding cavity. Detailed knowledge of the structure of this domain and of the structure of the natural protein substrates of the enzyme has led to the design of specific inhibitors whose chemical structure mimics that of the viral peptides that are normally recognized and cleaved by the protease (Roberts et al.
