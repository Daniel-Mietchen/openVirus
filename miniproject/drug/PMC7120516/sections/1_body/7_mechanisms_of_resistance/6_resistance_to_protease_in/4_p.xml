<p>Remarkably, resistance to protease inhibitors can also be promoted by mutations in some of the natural viral substrates of the protease (Mammano et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">1998</xref>). Characteristic substitutions of amino acids near cleavage sites of the gag polyprotein have been identified that can increase the level of resistance and the replicative capacity of the virus by facilitating cleavage under conditions in which the amount of active enzyme is suboptimal or improving the ability of proteases containing resistance mutations to interact with the substrate.
