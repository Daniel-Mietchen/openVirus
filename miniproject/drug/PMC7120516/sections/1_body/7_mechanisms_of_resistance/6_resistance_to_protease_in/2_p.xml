<p>These compounds display a strong affinity for the active site of the HIV protease and inhibit the catalytic activity of the enzyme in a highly selective manner. Resistance to protease inhibitors is the consequence of amino acid substitutions that emerge either inside the substrate-binding domain of the enzyme or at distant sites (Molla et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">1996</xref>) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab13" ref-type="table">28.13</xref>). Directly or indirectly, these amino acid changes modify the number and the nature of the points of contact between the inhibitors and the protease, thereby reducing their affinity for the enzyme (Hong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2000</xref>; Prabu-Jeyabalan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">2002</xref>). As an example, the common resistance mutation V82A reduces the size of an amino acid residue in the protease that is more important for binding most inhibitors than for binding the natural viral protein substrate (Prabu-Jeyabalan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">2002</xref>).
