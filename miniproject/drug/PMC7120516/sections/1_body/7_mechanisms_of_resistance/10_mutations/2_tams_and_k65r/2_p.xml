<p>In essence, NRTI resistance is the sum of two mechanisms: (1) their ability to alter drug binding or incorporation, through the mechanism described in the beginning of this section, plus (2) their ability to alter the excision of drug from the nascent DNA chain. The 65R mutation impedes both drug binding and primer excision.</p>
