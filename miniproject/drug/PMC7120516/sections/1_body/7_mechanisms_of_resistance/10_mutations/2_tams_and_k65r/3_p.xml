<p>In effect, variants harboring both K65R and TAMs still considered to be a rare occurrence can have surprising effects. Many TAMs are in the “fingers” domain of the polymerase, which makes up the deoxynucleotide triphosphate binding site. In turn, TAMs interfere with proper function of the enzyme. Because K65R impedes primer excision, it is believed to sensitize HIV to NRTIs affected by TAMs, most notably zidovudine. It has also been noted that TAMs can reverse some of the effects of K65R on drug binding and incorporation; there are data suggesting that concurrent zidovudine use can prevent the emergence of the K65R mutation though the mechanism responsible for this has not yet been elucidated.</p>
