<p>Perhaps the best-known reverse transcriptase mutation is M184V, which is known to cause high-level resistance to lamivudine and emtricitabine. However, there have been studies suggesting that high-level resistance to lamivudine does not necessarily mean that the drug is rendered worthless. An example of this phenomenon can be found in a clinical trial of partial treatment interruptions conducted by Dr. Steven Deeks and his colleagues (Deeks et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2003</xref>). This study focused on a cohort of HIV-positive individuals who had a history of excellent treatment adherence, had drug-resistant viremia (greater than 400 copies/ml), and were experiencing a documented treatment-mediated benefit (e.g., a viral load below and CD4+ cell count above pretreatment levels). The patients either stopped their PI(s) or their NRTIs to determine the selective effects of these two drug classes in terms of maintaining the less-fit virus. One more study discontinued lamivudine in four highly treatment-experienced patients with no viable alternative treatment options and evidence of the M184V mutation while on a regimen consisting of at least three antiretrovirals (Campbell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2003</xref>). Six weeks after stopping lamivudine, HIV RNA levels increased an average of 0.6 log10 copies/ml above baseline, even though the M184V mutation remained detectable in virus from all patients. This basically showed us that, even in the presence of the M184V mutation, lamivudine was still contributing to HIV RNA suppression. Reversion of M184V to wild type occurred in all four patients between 6 and 14 weeks, accompanied by an additional average increase in viral load of 0.3 log10 copies/ml. Upon resuming lamivudine therapy, the M184V mutation reappeared within 8 weeks in all four patients. The COLATE trial was an open-label trial involving 131 patients experiencing virologic failure while on a lamivudine-containing regimen (Dragsted et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2004</xref>). In switching to another regimen, approximately half of the patients were randomized to continue lamivudine therapy, with the remaining patients randomized to discontinue lamivudine treatment. Forty-eight weeks later, there were no significant differences between the two groups.
