<p>Reviewing some recent work in the area of thymidine analogue mutations, a review study results explained that certain TAMs tend to occur together but that others are rarely found together in the same virus. For example, the M41L/L210W/T215Y pathway is a common TAM pattern and is associated with high-level resistance to zidovudine and with cross-resistance to other NRTIs, including tenofovir and abacavir. In contrast, the D67N/K70R/K219Q pathway isolate is a less common TAM pattern and is associated with a lower fold resistance than the M41L/L210W/T215Y cluster. It was also showed that T215F mutation rarely appears in the reverse transcriptase of viruses also harboring the L210W mutation or the M41L mutation (Kuritzkes 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2004</xref>) and the divergent TAM pathways (Hu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2004</xref>). In a nutshell, these studies found that isolates carrying the T215Y mutation replicated more efficiently than isolates harboring the 215F mutation. With incorporation of the L210W mutation into isolates harboring the T215Y mutation, viral fitness was substantially reduced. Conversely, with the incorporation of the K70R mutation into isolates harboring the T215Y mutation, there was a substantial growth advantage in the presence of zidovudine (Hu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2004</xref>). Thus, it was concluded that T215Y pathway is more common and confers higher-level resistance to zidovudine and other NRTIs, whereas viruses carrying T215F have lower replication capacity and are poorly fit. With respect to the K70R mutation, it confers a significant advantage to HIV in the presence of zidovudine and that this mutation plays a much larger role in the development of zidovudine resistance than is usually considered (Kuritzkes 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2004</xref>).
