<p>Single mutations rarely produce complete resistance to antiretroviral drugs, although the M184V mutation in reverse transcriptase, which results in complete resistance to lamivudine, is an exception to this rule. Single mutations in the hydrophobic pocket of reverse transcriptase also provide strong resistance to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, but the viral strains in patients in whom regimens using these drugs are failing often incur additional mutations, suggesting that the level of resistance provided by single mutations is not optimal (Hanna et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2000</xref>). Resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors through the accumulation of thymidine analogue mutations or Q151M complex mutations and resistance to protease inhibitors are always gradual processes, leading to progressive increases in the level of resistance (Mammano et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2000</xref>). Nonetheless, even after several mutations have accumulated in the HIV protease and reverse transcriptase sufficient to produce patent treatment failure, resistance may not have reached maximal levels, and additional mutations, associated with increases in resistance, can occur even in the absence of any changes in treatment (Barbour et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2002</xref>). Indeed, the development of complete resistance may represent an exception. Because resistance mutations can impair viral replicative capacity, the solution adopted by the dominant viral population may entail making concessions in terms of resistance. Efforts are being made to evaluate the antiviral activity retained by individual drugs in the face of resistance mutations. Such knowledge may help in the treatment of patients infected with viruses that express resistance to multiple classes of drugs, since keeping HIV under some pharmacologic pressure may reduce its pathogenic potential.
