<p>Cross-resistance, defined as resistance to drugs to which a virus has never been exposed, results from mutations that have been selected for by the use of another drug. Cross-resistance is always restricted to drugs within a given class of antiretroviral agents but all three classes of antiretroviral drugs are affected. Early in the evolution of resistance to nucleoside analogues or protease inhibitors, viruses may have only a low level of cross-resistance to alternative agents within each of these two classes of drugs (Richman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">1990</xref>). Nevertheless, these strains may need to add only one or a few additional mutations to this preexisting scaffolding for high-level cross-resistance to develop. Therefore, in patients infected with strains that have low levels of cross-resistance, the switch to apparently active alternative drugs can be accompanied by rapid selection for highly resistant variants, at the expense of minimal evolutionary changes (Dulioust et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1999</xref>). Resistance is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon and generally increases over time (Richman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">1990</xref>; Barbour et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2002</xref>; Ross et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">2000</xref>).
