<p>HIV-1 enters target cells through an intricate sequence of interactions between the HIV envelope glycoprotein (gp) complex (gp120â€“gp41) and specific cell-surface receptors (Kilby and Eron 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2003</xref>). The early steps in this process allow gp41, the fusogenic component of the complex, to interact with the cell membrane, thereby tethering the virus to its target. The membranes of the virus and target cell are then brought into close proximity, fostering their fusion, by further rearrangement of gp41. In this step, a distal hydrophobic region of gp41, HR2, folds onto a more proximal hydrophobic region, HR1, effectively shortening the molecule. Enfuvirtide, a 36-aminoacid peptide derived from HR2, destabilizes this process by binding to HR1 and blocks the infectivity of HIV-1. Viral resistance to enfuvirtide usually results from mutations located in a stretch of ten amino acids within HR1 (Rimsky et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">1998</xref>). Interestingly, changes in amino acids in gp41 outside HR and even changes in gp120 appear to be associated with significant differences in the susceptibility of the virus to enfuvirtide. These mutations or polymorphisms probably explain the remarkably wide range of natural susceptibility to enfuvirtide among HIV-1 strains (Derdeyn et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2001</xref>; Reeves et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2002</xref>) and could participate in the evolution of acquired resistance to enfuvirtide.
