<p>Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are small molecules that have a strong affinity for a hydrophobic pocket located close to the catalytic domain of the reverse transcriptase. The binding of the inhibitors affects the flexibility of the enzyme, thereby blocking its ability to synthesize DNA. The mutations that are selected for after the failure of treatment with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are all located in the pocket targeted by these compounds, and they reduce the affinity of the drug (Esnouf et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1997</xref>; Hsiou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2001</xref>). Because of subtle differences in the interaction between various nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and the hydrophobic pocket, however, the mutations that emerge most frequently are somewhat drug dependent (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab12" ref-type="table">28.12</xref>). Resistance to nevirapine is often associated with the Y181C mutation, but other mutations, such as Y188C, K103N, G190A, and V106A, also occur. Initial resistance to efavirenz is generally characterized by the K103N mutation, but the Y188L mutation is also seen.
