<p>Removal of the nucleoside analogue from the terminated DNA chain is associated with a group of mutations commonly termed “thymidine analogue mutations” (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab12" ref-type="table">28.12</xref>). Mutations from this group are most frequently selected for after the failure of drug combinations that include thymidine analogues, such as zidovudine and stavudine, but they can promote resistance to almost all nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, including tenofovir (Larder and Kemp 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">1989</xref>; Picard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2001</xref>). These mutations occur gradually, and their order of emergence can vary. Thymidine analogue mutations promote resistance by fostering ATP- or pyrophosphate-mediated removal of nucleoside analogues from the 3′ end of the terminated DNA strand (Meyer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">1999</xref>). ATP and pyrophosphate, which are abundant in normal lymphocytes, do not participate in the DNA-polymerization reaction, but the structure of a reverse transcriptase expressing thymidine analogue mutations facilitates their entry into a site adjacent to the incorporated analogue (Chamberlain et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2002</xref>). In this position, ATP or pyrophosphate can attack the phosphodiester bond that links the analogue to DNA, resulting in removal of the analogue. Interestingly, the efficiency of this process, also known as “primer rescue,” can be significantly decreased by the presence of other mutations in reverse transcriptase, a phenomenon that has been best described in the case of the M184V mutation (Larder et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">1995</xref>). As a consequence; M184V slows the selection of thymidine analogue mutations by thymidine analogues (Picard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2001</xref>) and may slightly increase the residual antiviral activity of some nucleoside analogues in spite of the presence of thymidine analogue mutations.
