<p>Point substitutions in the S gene are of particular interest because they affect the immunogenicity of HBsAg, especially the determinant (against which neutralizing antibodies are raised). In an effort to explain the effects that mutations in one region exert, both locally and on linearly distant epitopes, the original two-loop model of the 
 <italic>a</italic> determinant (positions 124–147) (Carman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1990</xref>), with disulfide bridges between amino acids 124 and 137, has recently been replaced by the cysteine web model of the MHR (positions 100–160 or 169) of the S protein (Carman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1990</xref>). The current model still takes account of potential disulfide bridges but additionally supposes cysteines 107, 137, 138, 139, and 149 to be located in a webbed structure in the viral envelope. Two loops (107–137 and 139–147) are external to the virion and probably in opposition, and there is another tight loop between amino acids 121 and 124. The whole MHR is divided into five antigenic regions, named HBs1 (up to position 120), HBs2 (120–123), HBs3 (124–137), HBs4 (139–147), and HBsS (148–169). There are indications that the loops formed by HBs2 and HBs4, respectively, are spatially close. This mutant was found in studies in Singapore, Italy, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Brunei (Hsu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">1997</xref>).
