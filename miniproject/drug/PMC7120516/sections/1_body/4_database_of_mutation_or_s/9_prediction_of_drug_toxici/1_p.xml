<p>SNP detection has been used to predict adverse events in antiretroviral therapy in patients with HIV infections (Abo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2012</xref>). The potential clinical value of the pharmacogenetics approach for predicting drug toxicity will be uncovered as more candidate polymorphisms are discovered. The application of genotyping strategies to predict antiretroviral drug efficacy has recently emerged in a variety of clinical settings. Genotype resistance testing of HIV isolates has demonstrable clinical use and provides a way to assist therapeutic decision making in patients whose HIV RNA levels are rising (Klein et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2009</xref>). Moreover, HIV viral load testing has served as the major guide to the selection and maintenance of antiretroviral therapy (Sagreiya et al.
