<p>The core promoter plays a central role in HBV replication and morphogenesis, directing the transcription of both pregenomic RNA and precore mRNA. It overlays the 3′ end of the X gene and the 5′ end of the preC/C gene. Sequence variation in the core promoter is limited because of its pivotal role in viral replication. The double mutation, A to T transversion at 1762 and G to A transition at 1764, is often present in patients with chronic hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and fulminant hepatitis and less often in asymptomatic carriers, in immunosuppressed patients, and in carriers without HBV markers (Kramvis and Kew 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">1999</xref>). Mutants are inextricably bound to an evolution to chronicity and may be important in hepatocarcinogenesis, development of fulminant hepatitis, or an asymptomatic course. The clinical importance of HBV surface antigen variants has been the subject of several reviews (Carman
