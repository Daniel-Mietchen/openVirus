<p>The development of printed and spotted genomic microarrays has enabled the rapid accumulation of new information concerning gene mutation and expression in human. Microarrays can be used to gene mutations and SNPs as well as provide rapid screening information regarding mRNA expression. Transcriptional profiling has the ability to generate hundreds of thousands of data points requiring sophisticated and complex information systems necessary for accurate and useful data analysis
 <italic>.</italic> This technique has generated a wealth of new information in the drug and biomarker target discovery and pharmacogenomic drug efficacy testing.
