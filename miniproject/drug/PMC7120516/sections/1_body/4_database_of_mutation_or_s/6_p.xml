<p>The X gene protein exhibits numerous activities affecting intracellular signal transmission, gene transcription, cell proliferation, DNA repair, and apoptosis (Arbuthnot et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2000</xref>). An eight-nucleotide deletion at the 3′ end of the gene and within the core promoter/enhancer II (CP/ENII) region (positions 1770–1777) (Fukuda et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1996</xref>) and a 20-nucleotide deletion at 1752–1772 (Okamoto et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">1994</xref>) study have been described in HBsAg- and HBeAg-negative patients. These deletions have been shown to downregulate the preC promoter, and this may be the reason for the suppression of HBV protein secretion.
