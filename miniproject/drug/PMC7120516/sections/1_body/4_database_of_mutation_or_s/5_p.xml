<p>Mutations of the polymerase gene may be associated with resistance to the therapeutic effects of nucleoside analogues and with viral persistence (Ono-Nita et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">1999</xref>). Lamivudine (2,3-dideoxy-3-thiacytidine) is a potent inhibitor of RNA-dependent DNA polymerase of HBV, irreversibly blocking reverse transcription and inhibiting viral replication. It thus effectively reduces viral burden in chronic HBV carriers. Long-term treatment with lamivudine may, however, lead to resistance as the result of the generation of mutations that disrupt the YMDD (tyrosine, methionine, aspartate, and aspartate) locus in the C domain of the polymerase gene (Ling et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">1996</xref>). The mutation consists of either a methionine to valine (M552V) or a methionine to isoleucine (M552I) substitution. Both mutations result in amino acid substitutions in codons 195 and 196 in the overlapping S gene. Lamivudine-resistant variants may also have a leucine to methionine (L528M) change in the B domain, occurring often in association with the M552V mutation and rarely with the M552I mutation (Chayama et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">1998</xref>). The L528M substitution has no effect on the amino acid sequence of the S gene. Replication efficiency of the YMDD mutant is less than that of wild-type virus and, after cessation of treatment, the wild-type virus re-overtakes the mutant. Lamivudine-resistant viruses remain functional and pathogenic. Famciclovir is the prodrug of penciclovir, an acyclic deoxyguanosine analogue. Penciclovir inhibits DNA-dependent as well as RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. It has similar therapeutic effects to lamivudine and is responsible for the emergence of mutants usually involving the B domain of the polymerase gene. However, mutants resistant to famciclovir appear to be less common than those induced by lamivudine (Pichoud et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">1999</xref>).
