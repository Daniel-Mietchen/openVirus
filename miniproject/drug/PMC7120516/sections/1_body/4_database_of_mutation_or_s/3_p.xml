<p>Mutations and SNPs in HBV also studied in details as the most frequently observed precore mutation is a G to A transversion at nucleotide 1896. This substitution introduces a translation stop codon (TAG) in the distal precore gene and prevents expression of the preC/C fusion protein that functions as a precursor of HBeAg (Carman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1989</xref>). Less common precore mutations resulting in HBeAg negativity include initiation codon mutations (at positions 1814 or 1815), a nonsense mutation at 1874, a missense mutation at 1862, and frame shift mutations (Kramvis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">1997</xref>). The 1896 stop codon mutant is often present in patients with chronic active or inactive hepatitis and in asymptomatic carriers in Mediterranean and Oriental countries (Lee et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">1996</xref>). A mutation at 1899, which may occur in association with the 1896 mutation or other mutations that are associated with HBeAg negativity, is another mutation that improves the stability of by providing an additional Aâ€“T(U) base pair (Kramvis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">1997</xref>). The 1896 stop codon mutation is also present in a high proportion of patients with fulminant hepatitis B, an observation that initially suggested a causal role for the mutant (Maruyama et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">1998</xref>). The core gene contains both humoral and cytotoxic T-cell epitopes (Bertoletti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1991</xref>). Mutations within immunodominant cytotoxic T-cell epitopes may be exploited by viruses to evade protective immune responses critical for viral clearance. Deletions of the core gene have been reported in immunocompromised and Oriental patients with chronic hepatitis B or hepatocellular carcinoma (Yuan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR187">1998</xref>). These deletions almost always involve loss of B- and T-cell epitopes and may confer a selective advantage on the virus by evading immune surveillance.
