<p>In a recent candidate gene study, Welzel and colleagues investigated the association between genetics and HCV treatment response with a focus on the IFN-alpha pathway (Welzel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">2009</xref>). They genotyped 56 SNPs along the IFN-alpha pathway in 1,051 patients in the Hepatitis C Long-term Treatment Against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) trial, utilized TaqMan® assays (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with analysis on the ABI 7900HT platform (Applied Biosystems), and focused on European Americans (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">2009</xref>). Participants with fibrosis score 3 had not previously responded to IFN treatment with or without RBV, had a Child–Turcotte–Pugh score of less than seven, and were treated with peg-IFN and RBV for 24 weeks and then up to 48 weeks if undetectable at week 20. Recent study by Welzel and colleagues, they examined the SNPs in genes encoding IFN-alpha, the IFN-alpha receptor, and JAK/tyrosine kinase/STAT 1 and 2, all part of the signal transduction via the JAK–STAT pathway; IFN-alpha-induced genes with antiviral properties, including adenosine deaminase/eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2A-alpha kinase 2/NFKB1/myxovirus resistance 1/2′5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1; as well as interferon regulatory factor (Welzel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">2009</xref>). In a recent study, Ke and colleagues (2010) extended the previous research and applied both ANN algorithms and logistic regression with feature selection to predict IFN-alpha and RBV treatment outcomes using genetic factors. The cohort of 523 CHC patients was original to the previous study by Lin (
