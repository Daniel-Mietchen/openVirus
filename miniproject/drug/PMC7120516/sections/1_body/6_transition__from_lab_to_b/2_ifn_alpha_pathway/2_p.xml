<p>In addition to rapid patient-specific drug-resistance phenotyping for the management of antiretroviral therapy, structural pharmacogenomics can be used for the prediction of clinical trial outcomes. By computationally analyzing the interaction of a putative drug with a sampling of the polymorphism structural repertoire that a new drug will encounter in the clinic, it is possible to predict the binding effectiveness of a new drug before the initiation of expensive clinical evaluation in patients. This is a straightforward application and extension of the recently reported successful computational prediction of drug resistance phenotypes for HIV-1 protease on a patient-by-patient basis (Shenderovich et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">2003</xref>). The interaction and movements of side chains in individual polymorphism structures in response to drug binding can be computed, for example, comparison of the computed structural changes upon drug binding with the observed changes in the corresponding X-ray crystallographic structure (Hong et al.
