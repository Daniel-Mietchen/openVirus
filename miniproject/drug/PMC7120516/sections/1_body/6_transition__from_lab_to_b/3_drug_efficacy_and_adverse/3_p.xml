<p>Adverse events (AEs) play a major role in determining adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and adherence is perhaps the most significant determinant of a regimen’s success (d’Arminio Monforte et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2000</xref>). While randomized, controlled clinical trials are the gold standard for evaluating the efficacy of drugs, they may underestimate short-term toxicity in the general clinic population because of the desire of the subjects to stay in the trial and the support from the trial staff in enabling them to do so. Long-term toxicities may be missed because of the often younger age of the subjects in clinical trials and because the relatively short-term duration of these trials may not detect toxicities with a low prevalence rate; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab11" ref-type="table">28.11</xref> shows the adverse effects associated with different classes of antiretroviral. AEs of antiretroviral drugs can be usefully divided into short- and long-term toxicities and also by the class of agent used.
