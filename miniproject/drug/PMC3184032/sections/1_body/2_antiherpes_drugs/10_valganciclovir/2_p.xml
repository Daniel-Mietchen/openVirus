<p id="P42">Valganciclovir exerts its antiviral activity in the form of ganciclovir-triphosphate, which inhibits viral replication by serving as a competitive substrate for CMV DNA polymerase. Valganciclovir was first approved by the FDA for treatment of CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS.

 </sup> For immediate sight-threatening lesions, valganciclovir is used in combination with an intravitreal ganciclovir implant. Valganciclovir is also used for preventing CMV disease in high-risk CMV donor-positive/recipient-negative recipients of kidney, heart, or kidney-pancreas transplants.

 </sup> In the United States, valganciclovir is not approved for preventing CMV disease in liver recipients because of a higher incidence of tissue-invasive CMV disease in patients who received valganciclovir vs oral ganciclovir prophylaxis. In other countries, valganciclovir is used for preventing CMV disease in all solid organ transplant recipients. It has recently gained approval for the prevention of CMV disease in pediatric heart and kidney transplant recipients. It can also be used to preemptively treat asymptomatic CMV infection in transplant recipients.

 </sup> Valganciclovir was recently demonstrated to be as effective as IV ganciclovir for treating mild to moderate CMV disease in transplant recipients.
