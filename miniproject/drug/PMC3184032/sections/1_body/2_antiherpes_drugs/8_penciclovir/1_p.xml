<p id="P34">Penciclovir is an acyclic guanine analogue that is chemically similar to acyclovir. Because it is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, it is only available as topical therapy for mucocutaneous herpes. For systemic use, penciclovir has been reformulated into the oral prodrug famciclovir.</p>
