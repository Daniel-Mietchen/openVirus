 </sup> Intravenous (IV) acyclovir provides excellent tissue and fluid penetration, including the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), whereas oral acyclovir provides modest bioavailability of 15% to 30%. Bioavailability is improved with the use of valacyclovir, the valyl ester formulation of acyclovir. Acyclovir is excreted by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion.
