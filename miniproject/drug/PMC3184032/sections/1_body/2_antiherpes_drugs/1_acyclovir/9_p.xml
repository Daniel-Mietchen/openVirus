<p id="P13">Acyclovir is generally well tolerated. However, IV acyclovir may cause reversible nephrotoxicity in 5% to 10% of patients because of intratubular precipitation of acyclovir crystals. Acyclovir crystalline nephropathy is more common when acyclovir is given as a rapid infusion (reaching serum concentrations &gt;25 Î¼g/mL)

 </sup> Adequate hydration, a slower rate of infusion, and dosing based on renal function may reduce this risk. Reversible neurologic symptoms such as delirium and seizures may occur rarely in elderly people and those with renal impairment; this toxicity has been associated with high serum acyclovir concentrations
