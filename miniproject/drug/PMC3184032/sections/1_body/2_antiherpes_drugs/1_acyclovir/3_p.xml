<p id="P7">To exert antiviral activity, acyclovir 
 <italic>must</italic> be converted to acyclovir-triphosphate; this process is initially catalyzed by viral thymidine kinase (TK) and subsequently by human enzymes. Acyclovir-triphosphate serves as a competitive substrate for viral DNA polymerase, and its incorporation into the DNA chain results in termination of viral replication.
