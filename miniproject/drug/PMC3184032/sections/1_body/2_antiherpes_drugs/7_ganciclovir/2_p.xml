<p id="P29">Ganciclovir undergoes triphosphorylation to become active, with the initial monophosphorylation catalyzed by UL97-encoded kinase and subsequently by cellular kinases. Ganciclovir triphosphate inhibits viral DNA synthesis through competitive incorporation during viral DNA synthesis, thereby leading to DNA chain termination. In vitro, it is 10 times more potent than acyclovir against CMV and EBV and is just as effective as acyclovir against HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV.
