<p id="P4">Most diseases caused by viral pathogens are self-limited and do not require specific antiviral therapy. Other than therapies targeting the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), currently available antiviral drugs in the clinical setting target 3 principal groups of virusesâ€”the herpes, hepatitis, and influenza viruses. This review article is structured to discuss antiviral therapeutics on the basis of these 3 major antiviral categories, with the caveat that some drugs discussed in these sections possess other potential applications, such as ribavirin for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and cidofovir for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and other DNA viral infections. Nucleos(t)ide analogues for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) may also possess anti-HIV properties, but their clinical utility for the treatment of HIV will be discussed in a separate article in this symposium. Experimental and novel therapies that have not reached clinical application will not be reviewed.</p>
