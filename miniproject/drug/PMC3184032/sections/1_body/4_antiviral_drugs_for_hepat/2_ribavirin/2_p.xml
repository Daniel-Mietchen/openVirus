<p id="P66">The mechanism of action of ribavirin is known to be diverse but is not completely understood. It may be a competitive inhibitor of cellular enzymes because its antiviral activity is reversed by guanosine. Its triphosphorylated form, ribavirin triphosphate, is a potent competitive inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, influenza virus RNA polymerase, and mRNA guanylyltransferase. As a result of this competitive inhibition, intracellular guanosine triphosphate pools are markedly reduced and viral nucleic acid and protein synthesis are inhibited. Ribavirin does not alter viral attachment, penetration, or uncoating, nor does it induce IFN production.</p>
