<p id="P71">In addition to IFN, several nucleos(t)ide analogues are available for the treatment of CHB (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). With the exception of telbivudine, these drugs possess anti-HIV properties, serving as inhibitors of the HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The specific mechanism of their anti-HBV property is through competitive inhibition of HBV DNA polymerase. Because of their anti-HIV properties, it is highly recommended that CHB patients considered for treatment with these drugs be tested for HIV infection, and monotherapy with these drugs should be avoided for HIV-infected patients to reduce the risk of HIV resistance. Hepatitis B virus may also develop resistance to these drugs, usually after prolonged exposure, and this risk may be reduced by a strategy of combination antiviral therapies. The exact duration of anti-HBV treatment is not defined, and HBV relapse often occurs after discontinuation of treatment. Severe exacerbation of hepatitis may also occur on discontinuation of these drugs; hence, monitoring for hepatotoxicity should be performed after stopping treatment. Lactic acidosis may occur with nucleos(t)ide analogues, and the drugs should be withdrawn if there is a rapid increase in ALT levels, progressive hepatomegaly or steatosis, or acidosis.
