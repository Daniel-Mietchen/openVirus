 <bold>Tenofovir.</bold> Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate diester analogue of adenosine monophosphate, is considered one of the most potent anti-HBV drugs. In oral form, it is rapidly absorbed and converted to tenofovir, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 1 to 2 hours.

 </sup> Oral bioavailability, which is only 25% in the fasting state, can be enhanced when taken with a high-fat meal. The terminal elimination half-life of tenofovir is 12 to 18 hours, and it is excreted mainly by active tubular secretion and glomerular filtration.
