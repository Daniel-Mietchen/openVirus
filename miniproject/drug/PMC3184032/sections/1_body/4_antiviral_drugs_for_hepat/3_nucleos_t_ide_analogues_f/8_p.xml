<p id="P78">Adverse effects of entecavir are generally mild and include headache, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, and insomnia. Entecavir has a high barrier to resistance and requires at least 3 mutations for phenotypic resistance. Entecavir resistance requires a baseline rtM204V/I and rtL180M mutation plus either rtT184S/A/I/L, rtS202G/C, or rtM250L. Among nucleoside-naive patients, the rate of entecavir resistance is less than 1% after 5 years, but patients with preexisting rtM204V/I have a higher rate of entecavir resistance (51%) after 5 years.
