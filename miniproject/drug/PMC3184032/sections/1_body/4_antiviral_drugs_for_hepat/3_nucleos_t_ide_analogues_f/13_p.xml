 <bold>Telbivudine.</bold> Telbivudine is a synthetic thymidine nucleoside analogue. Unlike other anti-HBV drugs, telbivudine has no activity against HIV. Oral telbivudine is well absorbed and achieves peak plasma concentrations after about 3 hours. It is mainly excreted by glomerular filtration, with a terminal elimination half-life of 30 to 50 hours.
