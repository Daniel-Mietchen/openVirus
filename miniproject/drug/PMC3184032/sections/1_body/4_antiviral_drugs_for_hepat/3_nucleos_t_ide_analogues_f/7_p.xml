<p id="P77">The mechanism of action of entecavir is somewhat unique because it inhibits 3 specific functions of the HBV DNA polymerase: priming of the HBV DNA polymerase, reverse transcription of the negative strand from the pregenomic mRNA, and synthesis of positive-strand HBV DNA.

 </sup> Entecavir is approved for the treatment of CHB, at a dose of 0.5 mg orally once daily for nucleoside treatmentâ€“naive patients, and a dose of 1 mg orally once daily for patients with a history of HBV viremia while receiving lamivudine, those with lamivudine- or telbivudine-resistant mutations, and those with decompensated liver disease.

 </sup> In randomized trials of HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients, entecavir demonstrated better outcomes than lamivudine, with improvement in histologic responses, higher percentages of HBV DNA suppression, and normalization or improvement of ALT levels.
