<p id="P61">For patients coinfected with HIV and HCV, the rate of intolerance to a combination regimen of IFN-α and ribavirin is higher and the rate of sustained virologic response (SVR) lower than in patients infected with HCV alone.

 </sup> The APRICOT study reported an SVR rate of 40% for patients treated with peginterferon-α plus ribavirin, compared with 20% for those treated with peginterferon-α monotherapy, and 12% for those treated with IFN-α plus ribavirin.

 </sup> A lower SVR rate to combination peginterferon-α plus ribavirin therapy was observed in patients coinfected with HCV genotype 1 (29%) than with HCV genotypes 2 and 3 (62%).

 </sup> Guidelines for the management of HIV and HCV coinfection have been published recently.

 </sup> In general, the guidelines recommend combination therapy with peginterferon-α and ribavirin for 48 weeks.
