<p id="P95">Boceprevir (800 mg 3 times daily) was approved by the FDA as the first HCV protease inhibitor for the treatment of CHC, specifically for genotype 1; it should be combined with peginterferon and ribavirin. The most common adverse effects of boceprevir are flulike illness, fatigue, nausea, dysgeusia, and anemia.

 </sup> The addition of boceprevir nearly doubled the rate of anemia compared with the use of standard peginterferon and ribavirin therapy, with many patients requiring the use of erythropoietin.
