<p id="P91">The current standard treatment of CHC is peginterferon-α in combination with ribavirin for 24 weeks (for HCV genotype 2 or 3) or 48 weeks (for HCV genotype 1). The major aim of treatment is to achieve SVR, which is defined as undetectable HCV RNA at 24 weeks after completion of treatment. A combination regimen of peginterferon-α and ribavirin results in SVR rates between 38% and 46%, and the rate is even lower among black patients. Hence, major efforts have been made to develop novel therapies for CHC. Recently, 2 serine protease inhibitors were approved as novel therapies for CHC due to genotype 1 infection. The addition of serine protease inhibitors to the backbone therapies of peginterferon-α and ribavirin will emerge as the standard of care for the HCV genotype 1 infection, both in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients.</p>
