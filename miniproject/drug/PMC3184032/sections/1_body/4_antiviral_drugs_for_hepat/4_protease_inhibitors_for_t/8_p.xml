<p id="P98">Collectively, these studies indicate that the addition of telaprevir to standard peginterferon-ribavirin therapy can significantly improve SVR rates in treatment-naive patients infected with HCV genotype 1 and in those who did not benefit from initial treatment with peginterferon-Î±-2a and ribavirin. As a result of these findings, the FDA approved telaprevir (750 mg 3 times daily) for this treatment indication. The most common adverse effects are anemia, neutropenia, leukopenia, and rash.

 </sup> Rashes can be mild to severe, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms have been reported. Telaprevir therapy should be discontinued if these dermatologic complications occur, especially in cases of severe rash or even mild to moderate rash if accompanied by systemic symptoms. The mechanism underlying rash development is unknown.
