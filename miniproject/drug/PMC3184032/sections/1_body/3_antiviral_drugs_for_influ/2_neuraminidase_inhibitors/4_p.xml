 </sup> account for oseltamivir resistance. Surveillance conducted during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic detected sporadic and infrequent incidence of oseltamivir-resistant pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus. All resistant viruses had neuraminidase mutations (most commonly H275Y mutation) that conferred resistance to oseltamivir, but not to zanamivir.
