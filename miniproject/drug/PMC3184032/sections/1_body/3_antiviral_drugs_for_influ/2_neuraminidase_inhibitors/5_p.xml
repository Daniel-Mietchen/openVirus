 </sup> Inhaled zanamivir produces high concentrations in the respiratory tract where influenza virus infection occurs. About 4% to 20% of inhaled zanamivir is absorbed systemically, producing peak serum concentrations at 1 to 2 hours. The absorbed drug is not metabolized and is excreted unchanged in the urine, while the unabsorbed drug is excreted in the feces.
