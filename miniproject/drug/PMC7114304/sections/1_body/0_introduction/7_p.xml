<p id="p0030">However, the vast majority of viruses use RNA capping. With the ongoing deciphering of viral RNA capping machineries, a true diversity of mechanisms, partners, and pathway organizations which invariably leads to the same RNA structure are progressively being uncovered. This diversity and its differences from the cellular RNA capping machineries are drawing a lot of attention for antiviral drug design.</p>
