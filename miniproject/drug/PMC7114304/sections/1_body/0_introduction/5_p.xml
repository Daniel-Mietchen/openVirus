<p id="p0020">Because of its coupling to RNA transcription, RNA capping is mainly a nuclear process, although some RNA re-capping events are suspected to occur in the cytoplasm (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="b0400" ref-type="bibr">Schoenberg and Maquat (2009)</xref>). Viruses generally replicate in the cytoplasm, causing there to be a time-window during which viral RNAs are synthesized but not yet capped. Virus and cell co-evolution has generated a number of cellular pathways and proteins involved in sensing the presence of viral RNAs. The absence of RNA cap as well as the presence of double stranded RNA are strong tokens for a viral infection. These RNA species, alone or together, are detected as “non-self” RNA by cellular sensors triggering an innate cellular immunity response (
