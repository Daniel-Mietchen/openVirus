<p id="p0005">In the eukaryotic cell, RNA capping is a co-transcriptional event consisting of a chemical modification of the nascent mRNA 5′-end. Since the early 70s, viruses have played a pivotal role in the discovery and structural characterization of the RNA cap (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ), as well as in the mechanistic elucidation of the RNA capping pathway. Incidentally, virus families for which these discoveries were made (
 <italic>Reoviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Poxviridae</italic>) use an RNA capping pathway that turned out to be the same as that of their eukaryotic hosts. Soon after these discoveries, other virus families were found to deviate substantially from this ‘conventional’ pathway (see below).
