 <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> order, also referred to as negative-strand (âˆ’) non-segmented (NNS) RNA viruses comprises major human pathogens such as rabies virus (
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>), measles virus (
 <italic>Paramyxovirinae</italic>), bornavirus (
 <italic>Bornaviridae</italic>) and Ebola/Marburg viruses (
 <italic>Filoviridae</italic>). RNA capping is achieved by the multifunctional L protein, which carries both RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and RNA cap synthesis activities. Shortly after the discovery of the RNA cap and conventional capping pathway, it was observed that the VSV L protein (

 <xref rid="b0350" ref-type="bibr">Ogino and Banerjee, 2010</xref>) were shown to perform a similar reaction and presumably follow the same RNA capping pathway.
