<p id="p0170">Most effort for antiviral design has been made for RSV, for which a sizeable market exists. Interestingly, two compound families having submicromolar activities (IC
 <sub>50</sub>  = 21–200 nM) have been described (

 <xref rid="b0445" ref-type="bibr">Sudo et al., 2005</xref>) that target the L protein. The most potent compounds of respective series have been used to elicit resistance and the resistance mutation map to an L region or domain consistent with the presence of the PRNTase. Although the PRNTase was discovered after the publication of these compounds, mechanistic studies clearly indicated that the guanylylation step was the actual target of the compounds. For RSV, only two products are approved for antiviral therapy or prevention: a monoclonal antibody (Palivizumab, Synagis) and ribavirin (

 <xref rid="b0490" ref-type="bibr">Vigant and Lee, 2011</xref>). The latter served as a control compound with moderate antiviral effect in the discovery of PRNTase inhibitors, but the precise mechanism of action of ribavirin (i.e., capping, error catastrophe, IMP dehydrogenase, or else (
