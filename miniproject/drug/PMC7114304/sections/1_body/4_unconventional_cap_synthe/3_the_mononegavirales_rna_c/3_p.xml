<p id="p0165">This discovery adds a novel enzyme to the process as the pathway involves a unique L-encoded GDP polyribonucleotidyltransferase activity (PRNTase), which forms a covalent enzyme-p-RNA intermediate involving a phosphoamidate bond. A conserved catalytic histidine is present in a “HR” motif instead of lysine used by conventional GTases (

 <xref rid="b0345" ref-type="bibr">Ogino and Banerjee, 2007</xref>) by a yet-unknown NTPase is then transferred to the 5′-monophophorylated viral mRNA 5′-end covalently attached to the PRNTase. Interestingly, the methylation sequence also is different from the conventional pathway sequence. The RNA cap is first methylated at the ribose 2′-O position of the first nucleotide followed by the guanine N-7 position, generating an RNA cap-1 structure. No crystal structure is available yet to guide drug design against these unique enzymes. The PRNTase should be considered as a prime target, perhaps more amenable to antiviral design than the more common MTase fold.
