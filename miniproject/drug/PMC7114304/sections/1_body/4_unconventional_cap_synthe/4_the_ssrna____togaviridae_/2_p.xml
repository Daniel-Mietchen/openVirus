<p id="p0175">The 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> (ss(+)RNA viruses) as exemplified by some alphaviruses (Semliki Forest virus, sindbis virus and chikungunya virus) synthesize their cap-0 structure through another non-conventional mechanism (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The enzymes presumably involved in the capping pathway are poorly characterized and their crystal structures are not yet available. Nevertheless, it is likely that capping begins with N-7-guanine methylation of a GTP molecule by the nsp1 N-7 MTase. This methylation is seemingly followed by the formation of a covalent m
 <sup>7</sup>GMP–enzyme complex involving a conserved histidine catalytic residue (
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Ahola et al., 1997</xref>). The N-7-methylation of GTP seems to precede the formation of the enzyme–GMP complex, since the guanylate intermediate is not observed in the absence of AdoMet (

 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Ahola et al., 1997</xref>). Whereas the m
 <sup>7</sup>GMP transfer onto the 5′ end of viral RNA was not yet formally demonstrated, it is expected that the 5′ end of viral RNA bears a diphosphate. The hydrolysis of the β–γ phosphate bond at the 5′ end is mediated by the nsp2 RTPase domain (

 <xref rid="b0320" ref-type="bibr">Magden et al., 2001</xref>) were reported to share properties with alphavirus N-7 MTases and GTases. Interestingly, Sindbis virus and Semliki Forest virus were reported more than 30 year ago to contain additional methyl groups attached to the exocyclic N2 of the cap structure (

 <xref rid="b0475" ref-type="bibr">van Duijn et al., 1986</xref>). The role of this methylation in virus replication is still unknown, but it is reminiscent to 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine (TMG) cap that is found on non-coding eukaryal RNAs such as small nuclear (sn), small nucleolar (sno) RNAs, and telomerase RNA (
