<p id="p0155">The first indication for the existence of deviations from the conventional viral RNA capping pathway came in the early 1970s, around the time of the discovery of the RNA cap structure. Since then, it has been demonstrated that vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, Mononegavirales) and alphaviruses (
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>) can synthesize a viral RNA cap that is identical to a cellular RNA cap, albeit through two completely different mechanisms. 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> do not proceed further than synthesizing a cap-0 structure, which remains an interesting enigma since many members of this family productively infect both insects and mammals.
