<p id="p0195">A fourth example of cap snatching has recently been described in

 <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">Fujimura and Esteban, 2011</xref>). However, in this case the Totivirus L-A transfers only m7GMP snatched from cellular mRNA. Hence, this mechanism lies somewhere between alphaviruses, which transfer m7GMP acquired from GTP, and “conventional” cap-snatching viruses described above, which transfer longer capped RNA oligonucleotides. As an additional similarity to alphaviruses, the Totivirus L-A cap-snatching enzyme makes a covalent m7GMP-enzyme intermediate through a histidine residue (
