<p id="p0090">Amongst the different families of viral RTPases, very few inhibition studies have identified potentially interesting compounds (
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). In that respect, the least neglected RTPase is cvRTP1, from the DNA 
 <italic>Paramecium bursaria Chlorella</italic> virus 1. Not surprisingly, phosphate analogues (see 
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, RTPase inhibitor I and II, also vanadate) are weak inhibitors, with no “drug-like” properties (
 <xref rid="b0455" ref-type="bibr">Takagi et al., 2003</xref>). The family of 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> NS3-like enzymes may have greater value, since in addition to the RTPase activity they habour two other activities (helicase and NTPase). The RTPase active site is super-imposable to the NTPase active site, which provides energy to unwind dsRNA. Suppression of the RTPase/NTPase activity abrogates helicase activity, therefore, it is likely that bi-functional inhibitors will be discovered in the near future (
 <xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">Lescar et al., 2008</xref>). One example for this approach has been a study of the inhibitory potential of purine analogues (one structure in 
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, RTPase inhibitors III) that are expected to inhibit all three activities (
