<p id="p0100">Very few compounds have been described that could provide a useful start for drug design. In the case of DNA viruses, the enzyme shares structural and functional similarities to the ligase protein superfamily, raising potential difficulties in achieving selectivity inside the host cell. The pyrophosphate analogue foscarnet (a phosphonic acid derivative (
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, GTase inhibitor I)) has been shown to inhibit the reaction, not surprisingly since the reaction produces pyrophosphate (
 <xref rid="b0440" ref-type="bibr">Souli√®re et al., 2008</xref>). In the case of several viral families the GTase is still unknown (coronaviruses, flaviviruses). In the flaviviruses, the GTase activity might be expressed by the N-terminal domain of protein NS5 carrying also other related RNA capping activities (MTases, 
 <xref rid="b0520" ref-type="bibr">Issur et al., 2009b</xref>). Therefore, structural and mechanistic studies may provide efficient drug leads targeting several activities at once as it is the case for Ribavirin, a guanine nucleotide analogue, targeting GTase and MTase (
