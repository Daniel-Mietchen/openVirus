<p id="p0120">VP39 protein of VV serves as reference for 2′-O MTase structures. It is a single-domain protein with a typical α/β fold (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> 2′-O MTase II). This structure has all the features of the canonical core domain. The catalytic residues of 2′-O MTases are defined by a conserved tetrad motif K-D-K-E located at the interface of SAM-binding cavity and the substrate-binding cleft (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, 2′-O MTase II). VP39 exhibits a hydrophobic pocket, at the end of the RNA binding cleft, which presents aromatic side chain residues involved in stacking the capped RNA.
