<p id="p0105">The last step of the cap formation consists in the methylation of the cap by RNA cap methyltransferases (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, MTase). The N-7 position of guanine is methylated by the N-7 MTase and the first nucleotide of the RNA transcript is further methylated at the ribose 2′-OH position by 2′-O MTase (see 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). 
 <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-
 <sc>l</sc>-methionine (SAM) is the methyl donor for both the N-7 and 2′-O methylations, generating 
 <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-
 <sc>l</sc>-homocysteine (SAH) as a by-product. The two methylations are either done by specific proteins (or domains) (
 <italic>Poxviridae, Coronaviridae, Reoviridae</italic>) or by one single protein (or domain) (
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>).
