<p id="p0115">The N-7 MTase of vaccinia virus (VV) serves as structural and reference model of N-7 MTases. The activity is carried by the complex of the C-terminal domain of protein D1 and protein D12. Both the domain of D1 and D12 present the characteristic core α/β fold of the MTase family (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, N-7 MTase I), but the D12 protein lacks a proper SAM binding site and does not show any activity on its own. In contrast, it stimulates the MTase activity of D1 by 30- to 50-fold. D12 does not affect the extent of substrate binding to the catalytic subunit. Rather, it has an allosteric role increasing the affinity for ligands as well as increasing the overall stability of the complex. Recently, similar finding have shown that the SARS 2′-O MTase activity harbored in protein nsp16 is stimulated by a small regulatory protein nsp10 (
