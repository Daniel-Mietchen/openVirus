   <italic>Viral RNA capping pathways.</italic> Mammalian viruses, with the exception of ssRNA(+) pestiviruses and ssRNA(+) hepaciviruses, use strategies to chemically modify their mRNA 5′-ends through either covalent attachment of a protein (
   <underline>V</underline>iral 
   <underline>P</underline>rotein 
   <underline>g</underline>enome-linked, VPg, for ssRNA(+) -
   <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, -
   <italic>Caliciviridae</italic>, and -
   <italic>Astroviridae</italic>), or covalent attachment of an RNA cap structure (all other viruses). When possible the viruses were divided by red dashed lines according to the nature of their viral genome (single stranded, double stranded, DNA, or RNA), and virus families and genera are written in italics. Three virus orders (ssRNA(+) 
   <italic>Nidovirales</italic> and ssRNA(−) 
   <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> and 
   <italic>Multinegavirales</italic> (ssRNA(−) and ambisense RNA) are shown in bold and underlined. Enzymes and mechanisms are indicated along arrows leading to Cap-RNA. Small letters “v” ahead of the enzyme name indicate that the enzyme is of viral origin. The list of presented families is non exhaustive and used as an example.
