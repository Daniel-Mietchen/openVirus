<p>In the case reported here, increasing the dose of peritoneal dialysis and retention time still could not alleviate the clinical symptoms. Acyclovir and valacyclovir are both soluble and low-protein-bound drugs. In terms of the effectiveness of valacyclovir, a single hemodialysis for 6 h can remove about 60% of the drug, while it is considered to have poor clearance by peritoneal dialysis. On the other hand, case reports suggested that peritoneal dialysis with continuous perfusion of super-dose peritoneal dialysis solution can promote the clearance of valacyclovir[

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Studies have shown that in patients with normal renal function, 89% of valacyclovir can be cleared from the urine in the form of acyclovir after 2.5-3.3 h, while the half-life of the drug is extended to 14-20 h in patients receiving CAPD for uremia (4 Ã— 2 L exchange dose), and only 5.27 mL/min (0.355 L/h/1.73 m
 <sup>2</sup>) can be cleared by peritoneal dialysis[

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. After a 6-h hemodialysis, the hemodialysis clearance rate of acyclovir is up to 113 mL/min and the plasma drug concentration can be reduced by 61.6%. Therefore, hemodialysis is at least 20 times better than peritoneal dialysis in terms of clearance effect. Based on the large differences in clearance rates between the two dialysis methods, it is suggested to switch peritoneal dialysis to hemodialysis to increase the effect of drug clearance[

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Nevertheless, when neurotoxicity occurs, the expected improvement of neurotoxicity by hemodialysis may be delayed, even for a few days. Kageyama et al[
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] reported a 75-year-old hemodialysis male who presented with hallucinations, dysarthria, and psychotic symptoms after intravenous acyclovir with reduced dose, which further indicates that the dose adjustment of these drugs is difficult and needs to be comprehensively individualized. CRRT has a good effect on clearing drugs with middle-and-large molecular weight or high protein binding rate. Meanwhile, valacyclovir and acyclovir are soluble and have a low protein binding rate, but there is a lack of literature on the efficacy of CRRT in clearing acyclovir and valacyclovir.
