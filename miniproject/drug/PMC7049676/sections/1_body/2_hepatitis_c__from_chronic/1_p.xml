<p>Of the viral hepatitides, none has seen as much transformation in available pharmacologic treatment options as for chronic HCV, which has been viewed previously as a chronic infection with only modest cure rates (sustained virologic response [SVR] up to 63%) with interferon‐based therapies.
 <xref rid="hep41480-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> However, now it has become a disease with multiple, well‐tolerated, finite therapies with SVR rates greater than 95% across nearly all patient and viral characteristics. Availability of such treatment has altered the landscape of patient populations who are able to receive treatment, as well as which patients should have access to these safe, effective treatments.
