<p>Hepatitis C remains one of the most prevalent chronic liver diseases in the United States and beyond, but the infected population is shifting toward a younger, treatment‐naïve population without cirrhosis. The estimated worldwide anti‐HCV antibody seropositivity is 100 million people, with viremia in 71 million.
