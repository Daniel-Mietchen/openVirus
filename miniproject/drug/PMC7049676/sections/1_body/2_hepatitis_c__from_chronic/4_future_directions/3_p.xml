<p>Specialty care access is another area for future consideration in the optimization of HCV care, and expansion of the provider pool who provide antiviral therapies would increase the capacity for HCV treatment. Alternative models of HCV care have been reported with DAA therapies provided by non‐hepatology providers. Studies of non‐hepatologist‐driven HCV care has reported success in treating infected patients when led by nurses,

This will become increasingly important as systems consider alternative payment models to increase therapy access, such as the “Netflix model” of subscription payment to drug companies adopted by Louisiana,
