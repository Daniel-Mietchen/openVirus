<p>DAA‐treatable populations have expanded to include those with end‐stage renal disease, coinfection with HBV or human immunodeficiency virus, and pediatric populations. However, some populations are still in need of further research. For example, DAA therapy in pregnant women is still not currently recommended and more data are needed regarding the safety and efficacy to prevent vertical transmission. Beyond maternal‐to‐child transmission risk, pregnancy may be the only time when patients have access to continuous care, thus being a potential opportune time to receive treatment. Additionally, guidance for treatment for those with acute HCV infection (occurring in the first 6 months of infection) has recently changed to recommend treatment in these patients after diagnosis and without a waiting period to assess for viral clearance.
 <xref rid="hep41480-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> If DAA treatments become more cost‐effective in the future, future research in optimal treatment regimen and timing may become useful in preventing acute HCV infection from progressing to chronic infection, and minimizing comorbidity resulting from acute infection and transmission with horizontal spread.
