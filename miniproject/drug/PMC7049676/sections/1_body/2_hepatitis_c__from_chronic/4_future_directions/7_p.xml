<p>Finally, as large numbers of patients achieve HCV cure, further knowledge will be needed of post‐SVR management, particularly regarding who need closer monitoring. Although patients with cirrhosis will still require indefinite subspecialty care, determination of surveillance of those with advanced fibrosis is not clear. For example, there is a question regarding the need for surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma in these patients, and one study reported the cost‐effectiveness of surveillance in those with cirrhosis, but not in those with F3 fibrosis.
