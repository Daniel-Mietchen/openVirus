<p>Improvements in HBV vaccination strategy is one key to reducing disease burden. Universal vaccination programs in hyperendemic regions, such as the one implemented in 1984 for infants in Taiwan, have been associated with reduced HBV carrier and liver cancer rates.

In a recent, large, phase 3, multicenter, randomized, blinded, active‐controlled trial of healthy patients, Heyward investigated a two‐dose regimen (given at 0 and 4 weeks) of HBsAg‐1018 (HEPLISAV‐B), a vaccine containing HBsAg combined with a toll‐like receptor 9 agonist adjuvant designed to improve vaccine immunogenicity.

This vaccine was approved in 2018 for all persons aged 18 years or older for vaccination against HBV.
