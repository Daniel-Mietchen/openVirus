<p>Clarification of treatment endpoints based on patient serological status may allow more clarity of treatment goals when developing drugs targeting multiple pathways in the viral replication pathway. Although the ideal goal would be to halt all forms of HBV replication (termed “sterilizing cure” or “virologic cure”), this may be unrealistic due to the persistence of viral covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the liver, and with it the risk of reactivation with immunosuppression event after treatment completion. A recent consensus conference for HBV treatment endpoints provided guidance for HBV treatment endpoint goals in therapeutic drug design, including “functional cure,” whereby after a finite course of therapy, HBV DNA is not detectable and HBsAg loss has persisted for 6 months following treatment. “Partial functional cure,” defined as detectable HBsAg but persistently undetectable HBV DNA 6 months after treatment, is considered an intermediate goal for antiviral therapies.
