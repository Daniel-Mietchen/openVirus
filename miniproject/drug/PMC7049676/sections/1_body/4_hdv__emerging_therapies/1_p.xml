<p>HDV is a defective RNA virus that requires HBsAg expression as an envelope protein to mediate viral entry and complete its life cycle. HDV infection presents as either HBV‐HDV coinfection or HDV superinfection in those with chronic HBV infection. HBV‐HDV coinfection is considered among the most severe forms of viral hepatitis, with risk of developing acute liver failure as well as higher risk for development of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and mortality compared with HBV infection alone.
