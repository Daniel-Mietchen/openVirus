<p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an enveloped, positive strand RNA virus member of the genus 
 <italic>Hepacivirus</italic> of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. The HCV genome consists of an RNA molecule of approximately 9.6 kb in size containing a single open reading frame flanked by structured 5′ and 3′ un-translated regions. An internal ribosome entry site directs the translation of a polyprotein precursor that is cleaved by cellular and viral proteases into 10 proteins (core, E1, E2, p7, NS2, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, NS5a, and NS5B) (reviewed in reference

 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Alter1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and given the chronic nature of the infection it is expected that the number of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma will increase in the coming years.
