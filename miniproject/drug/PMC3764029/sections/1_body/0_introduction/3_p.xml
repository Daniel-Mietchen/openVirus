<p>In order to study the cross-resistance of HCV to ribavirin and other antiviral drugs that could have a mechanism of action similar to that of ribavirin, we tested the ability of a J6/JFH1 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Lindenbach2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> HCV derived ribavirin resistant mutant, HCV-RR 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Feigelstock1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, to grow in the presence of the pyrimidine analog 5-Fluorouracil and the nucleoside analog 2′-C-Methylcytidine in Huh7D cells (a Huh7 cell derivative more permissive to HCV replication) 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Feigelstock2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. 5-Fluorouracil is broadly used in the clinic to treat cancer 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-MaletMartino1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> including HCV associated hepatocellular carcinoma 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Uka1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. 5-Fluorouracil displays mutagenic activity leading to viral extinction in different RNA viruses including LCMV, VSV, EMCV, and FMDV when grown in tissue cultured cells 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Moreno1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and a similar lethal mutagenic effect has also been observed for ribavirin on several viruses including poliovirus 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Crotty1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, coxsackievirus B3 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Graci1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, FMDV 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Airaksinen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, West Nile virus 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Day1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, GB virus B 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Lanford1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, and Hantaan virus 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Severson1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. It has been shown that ribavirin also has a mutagenic effect on HCV, increasing its mutation rate in cultured cells 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Brochot1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Kanda1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and in vivo 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Hofmann1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Lutchman1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Deep sequencing has recently revealed that ribavirin exerts mutagenic activity in chronic HCV infected patients by facilitating G to A and C to U nucleotide transitions 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Dietz1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. 2′-C-Methylcytidine, the active component of the experimental anti-HCV pro-drug valopicitabine 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Pierra1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Pierra2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, has been tested in HCV clinical trials and shown to be a potent HCV inhibitor in patients 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Kwong1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Godofsky1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Reddy1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and chimpanzees 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Carroll1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. 2′-C-Methylcytidine inhibited HCV RNA replication in the replicon assay and inhibited the HCV RNA polymerase 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> in cell-free biochemical assays 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-LePogam1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. It has also been shown that ribavirin antagonizes the in vitro anti-HCV activity of 2′-C-Methylcytidine 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Coelmont1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, suggesting an interaction between the two drug pathways.
