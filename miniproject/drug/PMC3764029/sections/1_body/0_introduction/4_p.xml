<p>In this study we show that an HCV mutant resistant to ribavirin is more resistant than parental J6/JFH1 to 5-Fluorouracil, but is not more resistant than parental J6/JFH1 to 2â€²-C-Methylcytidine. These results indicate that ribavirin resistant viruses could have elevated resistance to other inhibitors, highlighting the importance of combination drug selection for HCV treatment, and shedding light toward the understanding of the mechanism of action of ribavirin and HCV resistance to this drug.</p>
