<p>In this study we compared the growth of an HCV ribavirin resistant mutant (HCV-RR2) to the growth of its parental J6/JFH1 virus in the presence of two antiviral drugs: the mutagenic pyrimidine 5-Fluorouracil and the nucleoside analog 2′-C-Methylcytidine. We show that HCV resistant to ribavirin is more resistant to 5-Fluorouracil but is not more resistant to 2′-C-Methylcytidine (

We confirmed the 5-Fluorouracil resistant phenotype of HCV-5FU viruses by infecting naïve cells and showing that they can grow even in a concentration of 3 µg/ml 5-Fluorouracil (
