<p>In order to find out if 5-Fluorouracil resistant viruses acquired mutations, viral RNA from HCV-5FU-1-P6 and HCV-5FU-2-P6 was extracted, reverse transcribed, amplified by PCR, and sequenced. We obtained the sequence for HCV-5FU-1-P6 from nucleotide 80 through nucleotide 9460. In the coding region, HCV-5FU-1-P6 acquired 33 nucleotide substitutions (relative to HCV-RR2), 10 of which encoded amino-acid changes that were located in the core, E1, E2, P7, NS5a, and NS5b proteins (

 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Feigelstock1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. No mutations were found in the non-coding regions. HCV-5FU-2-P6 was partially sequenced and showed a sequence that was identical to the HCV-5FU-1-P6 sequence.
