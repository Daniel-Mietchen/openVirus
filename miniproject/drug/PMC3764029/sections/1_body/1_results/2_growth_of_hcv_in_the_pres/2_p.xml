<p>In another experiment, J6/JFH1 and HCV-RR2 were grown in the presence of no drug, 250 µM ribavirin, 1.5 µg/ml 5-Fluorouracil, or 1.25, 2.5 or 5 µM 2′-C-Methylcytidine (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074027.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Both viruses grew in the presence of no drug. HCV-RR2 grew in 250 µM ribavirin, while J6/JFH1 did not. HCV-RR2 grew to titers that were more than 1 log higher than J6/JFH1 in 1.5 µg/ml 5-Fluorouracil. J6/JFH1 grew in the presence of 1.25 µM 2′-C-Methylcytidine, while HCV-RR2 did not. None of the viruses grew in 2.5 and 5 µM 2′-C-Methylcytidine. This result confirms the differential sensitivity of J6/JFH1 and HCV-RR2 to 5-Fluorouracil and 2′-C-Methylcytidine.
