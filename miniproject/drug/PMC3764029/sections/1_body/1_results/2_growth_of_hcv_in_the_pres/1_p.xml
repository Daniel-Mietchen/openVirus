<p>In order to test sensitivity of an HCV ribavirin resistant mutant to 2′-C-Methylcytidine, parental J6/JFH1 and HCV-RR2 were grown in zero, 0.31, 0.62, 1.25, and 2.5 µM 2′-C-Methylcytidine as described above for 5-Fluorouracil. Virus growth was assessed by immunofluorescence (not shown) and by titration of virus present in the supernatants from each passage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074027-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Both viruses grew similarly in medium containing 0, 0.31, 0.62, and 1.25 µM of 2′-C-Methylcytidine. At a concentration of 2.5 µM of 2′-C-Methylcytidine, parental J6/JFH1 grew to titers of more than 10
 <sup>2</sup> ffu/ml and 10
 <sup>3</sup> ffu/ml by passage 3 and 4, while HCV-RR2 was extinguished after passage 2. This result indicates that HCV-RR2 is more sensitive to 2′-C-Methylcytidine than parental J6/JFH1 after passaging in medium containing 2.5 µM of 2′-C-Methylcytidine.
