<p>In this report, we show that a ribavirin resistant mutant of HCV has differential sensitivity to other antiviral drugs when compared to its parental virus. This suggests that mutations that are responsible for HCV resistance to ribavirin can be involved in the sensitivity to other drugs, implying that common antiviral mechanisms and common mechanisms of defense could be used by and against different drugs. This could be clinically important for drug selection, since an interferon-free regimen containing ribavirin for the treatment of HCV infections seems currently plausible. We isolated a mutant resistant to the potent mutagen 5-Fluorouracil. This mutant when grown without 5-Fluorouracil can replicate to parental levels. Analysis of the mutations responsible for the 5-Fluorouracil resistance phenotype may aid in understanding the mechanism of action of 5-Fluorouracil and other antivirals against HCV.</p>
