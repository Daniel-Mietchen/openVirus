<p>Huh7D cells grown in 48-well plates were mock infected or infected with the indicated viruses at a moi of 0.01. At 5 to 7 hours post infection, medium was replaced with 500 µl of medium containing the indicated amount of 5-Fluorouracil (Sigma) or 2′-C-Methylcytidine (USBiological). At 7 days post infection, 200 µl of the supernatants were used to inoculate naïve Huh7D cells that were seeded the day before, and at 5 to 7 hours post infection medium was replaced with 500 µl of medium containing the corresponding concentration of corresponding drug. The rest of the supernatants were stored at −70°C. This procedure was repeated for the indicated number of passages. HCV antigen was detected in the remaining monolayers by immunofluorescence and HCV titers were obtained from the supernatants as described below.</p>
