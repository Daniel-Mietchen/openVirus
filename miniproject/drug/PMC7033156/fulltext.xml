Moreover, patients with chronic hepatitis C have a higher risk of haematological malignancies than general population. An electronic alert system was developed to promote screening of hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) in patients starting haematological therapies. The system included screening and linkage to care and a request for testing in those without data. From March, 2017 to March, 2018 data from 420 consecutive patients with haematological diseases were included. At first prescription before the alerts, the HCV and HBV screening rate was 60.5%. Following the alerts, an additional 115 were screened, increasing the overall screening rate to 87.9%. Anti-HBc alone was detected in 57, anti-HCV in 13, and HBsAg in 2 patients. Overall, 68% of patients with any viral hepatitis markers were previously not know, and the impact was particularly important for anti-HBc detection (47/57 unknown). Nucleoside analogues were prescribed in 28 (49.1%) anti-HBc-positive and the 2 HBsAg-positive patients. Prospective follow-up with HBV DNA and HBsAg testing showed no cases of HBV reactivation. An estimated 1.2 HBV reactivations were avoided as consequence of the alert system. In summary, an electronic alert system increased viral hepatitis screening in patients receiving haematological treatment and led to improvements in the management of these patients, including avoided HBV reactivation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Hepatitis B</kwd><kwd>Hepatitis C</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100005564</institution-id><institution>Gilead Sciences (Gilead)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GoSHAPE European programme grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riveiro-Barciela</surname><given-names>Mar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Viral infection by hepatitis B and C plays an important role in patients with haematological malignancies. Individuals with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, (i.e., HBsAg-positive), and even those with resolved infection (HBsAg-negative/anti-HBc-positive) are at risk of HBV reactivation when receiving chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, especially those treated with rituximab-containing regimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The importance of HBV screening lies in the potential severity of HBV reactivation, ranging from asymptomatic HBV DNA elevation to the development of acute liver failure with an extremely high mortality rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, which results in a poorer prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. To prevent reactivation, it is important to determine the HBV status prior to immunosuppressive therapy to identify individuals who will benefit from HBV prophylaxis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, the rate of testing for viral hepatitis in the haematological population is relatively low. The reported HBV screening rate in patients with haematological malignancies in a large study in a US cancer centre was as low as 66% over a 7-year period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In this line, data from Spain have shown the beneficial impact of an electronic alert system for physicians prescribing biological drugs, to remind them of the possibility of HBV reactivation. In one study, the HBsAg screening rate rose from 47% to 94% and anti-HBc screening from 30% to 85%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">As to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, there is a well-established association between this condition and the development of lymphoma, with a reported risk 60% higher in HCV-infected individuals than in uninfected controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma are the most commonly linked malignancies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In view of the high prevalence of HCV in haematological patients and the potential risk of HBV reactivation in this population, we developed an electronic alert system (EAS) to increase the screening rate in patients with haematological malignancies undergoing specific therapy. This application is linked to the hospital prescription software and requires introduction of the patients&#x02019; HBV (HBsAg and antiHBc) and HCV serology results every time a new therapy scheme is prescribed. The data are transferred by e-mail to the Liver Department, which facilitates referral of individuals with positive serology and requests testing in patients without this information. The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of the EAS in the first year of its implementation on the rate of HBV and HCV screening in patients with haematological malignancies undergoing specific therapies. In addition, the estimated number of HBV reactivations avoided as a result of the EAS was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients&#x02019; baseline characteristics</title><p id="Par5">The study included 420 consecutive patients with haematological diseases.

The importance of the EAS lies in the diagnosis of previously unknown viral hepatitis markers, particularly HBV. In our cohort, 80% of the 57 patients with anti-HBc were diagnosed following the alert provided by the EAS. This prompted the start of antiviral prophylaxis in half the patients, which avoided an estimated 1.2 cases of HBV reactivation.</p><p id="Par15">Alert systems focusing on HBV have been described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In the present study, addition of HCV to the test panel in our EAS was also found to be useful for diagnosing new cases of chronic hepatitis C, which led to the start of treatment with direct-acting antiviral agents and sustained virological response. Currently, considerable effort worldwide is devoted to promoting HCV screening programs (including microelimination programs in targeted populations) to achieve elimination of the virus. Implementation of an EAS, mainly in those at high-risk such as haematological patients, could be a useful step toward eliminating HCV in hospitals.</p><p id="Par16">Since emergence of the FDA warning on HBV reactivation in patients receiving anti-CD20 drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, the risk of this occurrence in haematological patients undergoing chemotherapy or targeted therapies has been extensively studied. The hazard depends on the underlying disease and therapy scheme, but mainly on HBV status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Hence, testing for viral hepatitis markers before starting these drugs is vital to identify patients at risk of HBV reactivation, who may be candidates for antiviral prophylaxis. In this regard, the use of alert systems has been explored to improve screening rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Sampedro <italic>et al</italic>. reported that use of a computerized physician order entry-based system for patients treated with biologic agents led to a screening rate for HBV markers greater than 85%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, a value comparable to the overall percentage of testing in our cohort after the EAS alerts. Another important differential aspect of our EAS is its link to the Hepatology Department, which facilitated linkage to care in patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and the request for viral markers in patients without this data.</p><p id="Par17">The results of this real-world study bring to light the differing perception of viral hepatitis risk depending on the patient&#x02019;s therapeutic regimen and underlying malignancy. It is well-established that rituximab-containing regimens, mainly rituximab with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP), are strongly linked to a high risk of HBV reactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, in recent years other chemotherapy schemes, such as those for multiple myeloma, have also been associated with a risk of HBV reactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In our cohort, the malignancy associated with the lowest screening rate was CML. The risk of HBV reactivation associated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors has been scarcely explored, and although it is considered to be moderate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, the increasing use of these drugs has led to a recent rise in the reported cases of reactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">This observational study was carried out in the first year of EAS implementation, with prescription of antiviral prophylaxis left to the discretion of the treating haematologist in patients testing positive only for anti-HBc. This design also provided interesting data on the awareness of physicians regarding the risk of HBV reactivation in this population. In our cohort, and in line with current international guidelines, most patients prescribed anti-CD20-containing regimens received prophylaxis, including all patients with follicular lymphoma. However, our data indicated an alarmingly low concern about reactivation risk in anti-HBc-positive patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors or schemes including corticosteroids. Apart from R-CHOP and anti-CD20-containing regimens, the risk of HBV reactivation in anti-HBc-positive hematological patients is poorly stratified, especially concerning the latest approved drugs. In the case of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, although a few case reports have shown a risk of HBV reactivation, including development of acute liver failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, only one retrospective study including 10 anti-HBc-positive patients assessed this potential hazard. No cases of HBV reactivation were found after a mean follow-up of more than 3 years, despite an absence of antiviral prophylaxis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In our cohort, although the concern for screening was low in the population receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors (62.5%), the complete testing data showed 17 anti-HBc-positive individuals. Among these, 12 (70.6%) did not receive prophylaxis and there were no cases of reactivation during the first year of therapy.</p><p id="Par19">Regarding the prevalence of viral hepatitis, 3.2% of patients tested anti-HCV positive, a value 3 times higher than the 0.99% recently reported from the same area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Only 2 of the anti-HCV-positive patients had a detectable viral load. These findings can be explained by the fact that several anti-HCV-positive liver transplant recipients with PTLD had already achieved sustained virological response. As was expected, the prevalence of HBsAg and anti-HBc was similar to previously reported values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">Our study has some limitations. As antiviral prophylaxis for HBV was prescribed at the discretion of the treating haematologist, its use was not homogeneous in the cohort. However, this factor resulted in interesting data regarding the concern for HBV reactivation in real-world daily clinical practice according to the underlying haematological condition and therapy prescribed. Moreover, usefulness of this alert system could be extrapolated to other specialties that prescribe immunosuppressant drugs such as oncology, rheumatology or dermatology.</p><p id="Par21">In conclusion, the use of an electronic alert system had a positive impact on the viral hepatitis screening rate in patients receiving haematological therapy. This, in turn, led to an improvement in the management of these patients, with diagnosis of previously unknown cases of chronic viral hepatitis and possible avoidance of HBV reactivations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par22">An EAS was developed to remind physicians of the need for HBV and HCV testing in certain patients. The EAS was linked to the hospital&#x02019;s prescription software and requested HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HCV results when specific haematological drugs were prescribed. The physician was informed about the potential risk of HBV reactivation and the need to refer the patient to a hepatologist according to the scheme summarized in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. In patients testing HBsAg or antiHBc positive and those with unknown status, the system automatically sends an e-mail to the Hepatology Department with the patient&#x02019;s coded data. Furthermore, to facilitate the physicians&#x02019; work and achieve relevant data, 3 preconfigured blood tests were created: one to complete the study of HBsAg-positive individuals (<italic>Code 520</italic>, which included a haemogram, biochemistry, clotting, quantitative HBsAg, HBV DNA, HBeAg, anti-HBe, anti-hepatitis D virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology, and anti-HCV), another for anti-HBc positive or unknown serological status (<italic>Code 527</italic>, including HBsAg, anti-HBc, HBV DNA, and anti-HBs titers), and a third for those with detectable HCV RNA (<italic>Code 528</italic>, haemogram, biochemistry, clotting, HIV serology, and HCV genotype). Whenever a new treatment schedule was prescribed, the computerized system requested the patient&#x02019;s viral hepatitis status if it had not been previously introduced. If data were lacking and viral hepatitis screening had not been performed within the first 3 months after the therapy prescription, the viral hepatitis panel was added to the patient&#x02019;s next scheduled blood test.</p><p id="Par23">Prior to implementation of the EAS, Haematology Department physicians underwent training sessions to highlight the importance of hepatitis B and C screening, the rationale to set up this system and to inform about the functioning of the EAS. During the first year of the system, this prospective, observational study was carried out to evaluate the performance of the EAS according to the following items:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par24">Number of patients whose viral hepatitis status was checked after the EAS warning.
