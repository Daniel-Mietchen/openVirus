<p id="Par14">Implementation of an electronic alert system had a positive impact on the viral hepatitis screening rate in haematological patients receiving specific therapies, with an increase from 60.5% to 87.9% of patients. The importance of the EAS lies in the diagnosis of previously unknown viral hepatitis markers, particularly HBV. In our cohort, 80% of the 57 patients with anti-HBc were diagnosed following the alert provided by the EAS. This prompted the start of antiviral prophylaxis in half the patients, which avoided an estimated 1.2 cases of HBV reactivation.</p>
