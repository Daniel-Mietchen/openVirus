<p id="Par17">The results of this real-world study bring to light the differing perception of viral hepatitis risk depending on the patient’s therapeutic regimen and underlying malignancy. It is well-established that rituximab-containing regimens, mainly rituximab with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP), are strongly linked to a high risk of HBV reactivation
