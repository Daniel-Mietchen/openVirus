<p id="Par16">Since emergence of the FDA warning on HBV reactivation in patients receiving anti-CD20 drugs
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>, the risk of this occurrence in haematological patients undergoing chemotherapy or targeted therapies has been extensively studied. The hazard depends on the underlying disease and therapy scheme, but mainly on HBV status

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. Hence, testing for viral hepatitis markers before starting these drugs is vital to identify patients at risk of HBV reactivation, who may be candidates for antiviral prophylaxis. In this regard, the use of alert systems has been explored to improve screening rates

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. Sampedro 
 <italic>et al</italic>. reported that use of a computerized physician order entry-based system for patients treated with biologic agents led to a screening rate for HBV markers greater than 85%

 </sup>, a value comparable to the overall percentage of testing in our cohort after the EAS alerts. Another important differential aspect of our EAS is its link to the Hepatology Department, which facilitated linkage to care in patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and the request for viral markers in patients without this data.
