<p id="Par6">At the first prescription, the serological panel was completed in 254 (60.5%) patients. The screening rate clearly differed according to the type of treatment. The highest rates of completed panels were in patients receiving anti-CD20-containing regimens (69% vs 55%, p = 0.002) or therapy for multiple myeloma (69% vs 59%, p = 0.075); a very low rate was seen in relation to tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (29.7% vs 66%, p &lt; 0.001). The haematological malignancy also had an impact on screening (p &lt; 0.001), with the highest percentage of completed panels seen in patients with primary cerebral lymphoma, DLBCL, and Burkitt’s lymphoma (100%, 83.3%, and 80%, respectively) and the lowest in those with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) (16.2%).</p>
