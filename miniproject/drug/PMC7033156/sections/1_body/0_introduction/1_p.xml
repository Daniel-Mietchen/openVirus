<p id="Par2">Viral infection by hepatitis B and C plays an important role in patients with haematological malignancies. Individuals with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, (i.e., HBsAg-positive), and even those with resolved infection (HBsAg-negative/anti-HBc-positive) are at risk of HBV reactivation when receiving chemotherapy

 </sup>. The importance of HBV screening lies in the potential severity of HBV reactivation, ranging from asymptomatic HBV DNA elevation to the development of acute liver failure with an extremely high mortality rate

In this line, data from Spain have shown the beneficial impact of an electronic alert system for physicians prescribing biological drugs, to remind them of the possibility of HBV reactivation. In one study, the HBsAg screening rate rose from 47% to 94% and anti-HBc screening from 30% to 85%
