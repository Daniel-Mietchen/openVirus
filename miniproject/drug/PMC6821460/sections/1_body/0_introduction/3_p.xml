<p>This study was designed to determine the extent to which single-cell analysis of antiviral agents can contribute to our understanding of antiviral therapeutics relative to traditional approaches. We describe a microfluidics device that can be used to produce complete dose-response curves. We have used this device to compare three mechanistically distinct classes of antiviral agents: a PV polymerase inhibitor [2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-methyl-adenosine (2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-Me-A)], a PV protease inhibitor (rupintrivir), and two heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors [geldanamycin (GA) and ganetespib (GS)]. We find that single-cell analysis distinguishes these classes of inhibitors. We suggest that addition of single-cell analysis to the existing paradigm for preclinical development of antiviral therapies may have the potential to identify leads with limited potential for development of resistance.
