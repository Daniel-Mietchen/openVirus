<p>As a part of a study evaluating PV infection dynamics on the single-cell level, we observed that a chain-terminating antiviral ribonucleotide selectively eliminates the most-fit members of the viral population (
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>7</italic>
 </xref>). This class of antiviral agent has always been touted as having a high barrier to resistance (
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>8</italic>
 </xref>). The typical explanation for this high barrier is that amino acid substitutions in the active site of the viral RNA polymerase conferring resistance to the antiviral ribonucleoside also impair the specificity and/or efficiency of incorporation of natural ribonucleotides (
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>9</italic>
 </xref>). Elimination of the most-fit members of the viral population by an antiviral agent requires that resistance emerges from the surviving, low-fitness members of the population, which would ultimately require restoration of fitness for the population to survive the myriad mechanisms of host restriction (
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>10</italic>
 </xref>). Restoration of fitness may be the insurmountable barrier precluding the development of resistance to chain-terminating antiviral ribonucleotides.
