<p>As observed previously, viruses with the highest yields (maximum) and fastest rates of replication (slope) were sensitive to 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-Me-A (fig. S6B) (
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>7</italic>
 </xref>). An efficient polymerase is likely required to replicate fast and to the highest levels. Such a polymerase might be expected to use the antiviral nucleotide better, leading to extinction of this population of viruses. These same members of the viral population were sensitive to rupintrivir (fig. S6C). In this case, at concentrations equivalent to or lower than the IC
 <sub>50</sub>, binding is driven by the concentration of the protease target, which would be highest in cells replicating fastest and to the highest levels. GA only affected a subset of 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-Me-A and rupintrivir-sensitive members, those with a fast rate of replication (fig. S6D). This observation is quite interesting in that fast rates of replication in our assay mean fast rates of translation to produce GFP. Chaperones like HSP90 would be expected to be most useful under these conditions. A comparable analysis using the start point and infection time provided an even greater distinction between the three classes of antiviral agents studied herein (fig. S6, E to G). Most noteworthy was the observation that rupintrivir retarded the time it took to establish infection and to complete replication (fig. S6F). This observation may reflect the role of the protease in promoting replication by cleaving cellular antagonists of the virus lifecycle.
