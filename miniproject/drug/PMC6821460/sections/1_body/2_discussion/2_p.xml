<p>With this perspective in mind, it is not surprising that our previous evaluation of an antiviral ribonucleotide using a single-cell approach revealed the unexpected finding that the most-fit members of the viral population were most susceptible to this class of compounds (

This observation left one major unresolved question: Do all effective antiviral therapeutics target the same subpopulation of viruses or do unique signatures exist for distinct mechanistic classes of antiviral therapeutics? Addressing these questions is the central objective of this study.
