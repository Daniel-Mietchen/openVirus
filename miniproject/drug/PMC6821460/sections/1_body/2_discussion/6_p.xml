<p>This study is among the first to analyze a range of antiviral therapeutics on viral infection dynamics at the single-cell level. The resolution afforded by this approach is unprecedented when compared with other cell-based approaches, which only provide a measure of efficacy. Given the substantial effort required to go from compound to mechanism using the traditional experimental paradigm, the ability of single-cell analysis to inform mechanism should make this approach a welcome addition to the drug discovery and development toolbox. It is not uncommon for analogs to be synthesized during the drug development process that lose specificity or even function by a different mechanism of action; single-cell analysis has the potential to reveal changes such as these at the start of the analysis instead of much, much later in the development process. Last, although we have used antiviral agents to demonstrate the power of single-cell analysis, use of this technology and approach will be applicable to the discovery and development of any class of therapeutics that can be assessed in cell culture.</p>
