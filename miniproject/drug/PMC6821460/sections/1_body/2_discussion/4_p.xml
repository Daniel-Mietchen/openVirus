<p>The three classes of antiviral therapeutics chosen target a viral polymerase (2â€²-
 <italic>C</italic>-Me-A; fig. S2), a viral protease (rupintrivir; 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), or a host factor, HSP90, [GA (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and GS (fig. S4)]. Our data analysis pipeline emphasizes five phenomenological parameters with correlates to traditional parameters for assessment of the viral lifecycle. The major finding of this study is that each class of antiviral therapeutics exhibited a unique signature with respect to the five phenomenological parameters measured. We used the absolute value of the difference of each parameter in the presence and absence of the antiviral agent to visualize the signature for the antiviral agent and compare one antiviral agent to another (fig. S6A). It was possible to use PCA to stratify the different therapeutic classes (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Both GA and GS overlapped by PCA despite their substantial differences in structure and efficacy (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Drug combinations, which failed to affect establishment of infection, exhibited synergy when single-cell parameters were monitored (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>).
