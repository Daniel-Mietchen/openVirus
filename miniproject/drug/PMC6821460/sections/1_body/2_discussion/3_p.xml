<p>Our first-generation microfluidic device for on-chip investigation of viral infection dynamics relied on cell density as the mechanism to achieve isolation of single cells in wells of the device, an approach which leaves most wells of the device empty (

 </xref>). We have redesigned the device to add physical cell-trapping structures to each well. The outcome of which is the ability to achieve single-cell occupancy of ~90% of the ~6000 wells of the device (
