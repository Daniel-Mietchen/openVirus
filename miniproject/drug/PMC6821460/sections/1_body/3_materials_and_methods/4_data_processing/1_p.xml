<p>Infected and uninfected cells were counted manually to calculate the percentage of infection. A customized MATLAB script was used to extract the fluorescence intensity and background intensity for each microwell in each fluorescence image. (Fluorescence intensity âˆ’ Background)/background was calculated to represent the relative intensity. Meanwhile, wells containing two or more infected cells and showing autofluorescence or out-of-focus signals were manually excluded. As a result, the fluorescence intensity of each infected single cell over time could be obtained. With a customized package of R, the maximum, slope, infection time, start point, and midpoint were derived for each data curve, as described previously (

 </xref>). For comparison of different experiments, the intensities were further normalized to uniformize the mean values of the maximums for the no drug groups (2.00 arbitrary units in this work). To visualize the distributions, as in fig. S2 and elsewhere in the manuscript, we calculated the cumulative distribution function from the raw data, then calculated the first derivative, and smoothed it using Savitzky-Golay smoothing. The area under each curve was normalized to 1.
