<p>To generate enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)–tagged PV used in this work, pMo-EGFP-PV-WT plasmid was linearized with Apa I and purified using the QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Netherlands). With the linearized plasmid as the template, viral RNA was transcribed at 37°C for 5.5 hours in a 20-μl reaction medium containing 350 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 32 mM magnesium acetate, 40 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM spermidine, 28 mM NTPs, linearized DNA (0.025 μg/μl), and T7 RNA polymerase (0.025 μg/μl). After removing magnesium pyrophosphate in the mixture by centrifugation for 2 min, RNA concentration was measured by scanning the gel at fluorescence mode with a Typhoon 8600 scanner (Promega, USA). Then, 5 μg of viral RNA was used to transfect HeLa cells cultured at 37°C by electroporation. Virus was harvested by three repeated freeze-thaw cycles, centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min, and suspended in 0.5% NP-40. For purification, the supernatant was mixed with 1 volume of 20% PEG-8000 (polyethylene glycol, molecular weight 7000~9000)/1 M NaCl solution and incubated overnight at 4°C. After centrifugation at 8000
