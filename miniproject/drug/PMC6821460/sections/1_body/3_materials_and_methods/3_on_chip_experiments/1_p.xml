<p>For each group, 2 Ã— 10
 <sup>5</sup> HeLa S3 cells were cultured with drug-containing medium for 1 hour. Then, the cells were centrifuged, resuspended in PBS, and mixed with EGFP-PV at the MOI of 0.5 PFU per cell. After shaking at 140 rpm for 30 min, the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in media with corresponding treatments. With a PHD ULTRA Syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus), the cell suspensions were infused to the inlets of a microfluidic device for trapping of single cells for 5 min. A pressure of 30 psi was applied to the valves to isolate the microwells.
