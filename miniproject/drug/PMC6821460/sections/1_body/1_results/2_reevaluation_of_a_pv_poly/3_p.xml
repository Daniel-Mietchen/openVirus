<p>A major advantage of the single-cell platform is that the effect of a drug on the viable population can be determined. To analyze the single-cell data, we use five phenomenological parameters extracted from each time course (fig. S2C). These parameters are maximum fluorescence observed, which correlates to yield of genomic RNA; slope at the time of half-maximum fluorescence, which correlates to replication speed; infection time, which, to a first approximation, is the time it takes for an infection to go from start to finish akin to the virus generation time; start point, which is the earliest time in which fluorescence can be detected; and midpoint, the time of half-maximum fluorescence. This analysis leads to a collection of data points for each parameter value measured in each cell. Instead of displaying the primary data in a scatter plot (fig. S2, D and E), we display and analyze the curve derived from the first derivative of the cumulative distribution function from the raw data (fig. S2E). Our statistical analysis uses an unpaired two-tailed 
 <italic>t</italic> test to determine if a significant difference exists for the means of a given parameter under two experimental conditions. In these experiments, the area under the curve defining each distribution has been normalized to one for ease of comparison. We do not attempt to interpret a difference in the “fine” structure of the distributions.
