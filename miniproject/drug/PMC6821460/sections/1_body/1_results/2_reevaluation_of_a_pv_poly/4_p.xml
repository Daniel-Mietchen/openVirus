<p>Using this data analysis pipeline to evaluate outcomes in the absence and presence of 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-Me-A (50 μM), we observed a statistically significant difference in the mean values for the maximum (fig. S2F) and slope (fig. S2G) parameters without a statistically significant change in the mean values for the remaining parameters (fig. S2, H to J). Tabulation of the data and statistical analysis for this experiment are provided in table S1. These observations reproduce outcomes presented by us previously using the first-generation device (

 </xref>). The mean values for maximum and slope parameters were reduced substantially in the presence of 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-Me-A. The observed between-cell variability in response to 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-Me-A treatment can be attributed to multiple factors, including speed and/or fidelity of the viral polymerase, the capacity for the nucleoside to be converted to the nucleoside triphosphate (NTP), among other possibilities.
