<p>Our initial foray into single-cell analysis of PV infection dynamics used cell density to control single-cell occupancy of wells of a microfluidic device (

 </xref>). What this means practically is that most wells are empty. Reducing the number of events monitored by a mere factor of two takes us below the number of events required for statistical analysis of the data. Acquisition of a dose-response curve was therefore impossible using this first-generation device.
