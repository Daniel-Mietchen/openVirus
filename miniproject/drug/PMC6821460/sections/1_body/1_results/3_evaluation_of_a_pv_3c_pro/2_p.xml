<p>We measured the impact of rupintrivir on the establishment of PV infection in HeLa S3 cells (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was 8.0 ± 4.0 nM, which agrees with values (5 to 40 nM) measured using conventional plaque assays (

 </xref>). We analyzed the single-cell data obtained at all concentrations (table S2) but focused only on the concentrations approximating the IC
 <sub>50</sub> and 2 × IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 10 and 20 nM, respectively, to emphasize trends in the data. At both concentrations, we observed a statistically significant difference compared with the control for all parameters: maximum (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), slope (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), infection time (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), start point (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>), and midpoint (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). This outcome with rupintrivir is distinct from that above with 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-Me-A. We conclude that not all antiviral agents interfere with the viral population in the same manner or at the same stage(s) of the lifecycle reflected by the parameters determined by monitoring the kinetics of fluorescence produced by GFP reporter virus.
