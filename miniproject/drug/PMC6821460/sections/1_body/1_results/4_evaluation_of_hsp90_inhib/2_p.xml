<p>We have used GA because it is a potent inhibitor of HSP90 (nanomolar range) that is active against PV (

 <sub>50</sub> value of 30 ± 8 nM (

 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>23</italic>
 </xref>). Because infection is monitored by eGFP, which requires virus entry, genome replication, and genome translation, interference with any of these steps would lead to a reduction in the number of eGFP-positive cells. It is clear, however, that translation and folding of eGFP are not altered in the presence of the highest concentration of GA used in this experiment (fig. S3).
