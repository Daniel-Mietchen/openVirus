<p>Analysis of the single-cell data is presented in table S3. The mean of the distribution of values for the maximum parameter did not change in the presence of GA (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), in contrast to the inhibitors targeting viral proteins. Observation of a statistically significant difference in the distribution of the values for the infection time parameter was concentration dependent (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). A statistically significant difference for the mean of the distributions for the remaining parameters was observed at concentrations corresponding to the IC
 <sub>50</sub> and above (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C, E, and F</xref>). A third signature of antiviral action is therefore revealed with GA.
