<p>Our evaluation of three classes of anti-PV drugs revealed three unique signatures based on changes to the phenomenological parameters used to describe infection dynamics (fig. S6). We reasoned that principal component analysis (PCA) might provide an even more robust approach to compare datasets using our five parameters. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, PCA resolves each class of inhibitor from the other, as well as from outcomes in the absence of drug. The mechanistically related, but chemically distinct, inhibitors of HSP90 cluster by PCA (see GA and GS in

 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). An additive combination is defined by the vector bisecting the parallelogram defined by the experiment in the absence of either drug (control) and the experiments in the presence of each drug alone (

 <italic>C</italic>-Me-A–GA combination was synergistic, with the position indicating that the combination delays the start point and retards the infection time. We conclude that single-cell analysis of antiviral therapeutics can provide not only information on the efficacy of a drug but also information on the mechanism of action and synergy of combinations of antiviral therapeutics. This experimental paradigm should have a transformative impact on the drug development process.
