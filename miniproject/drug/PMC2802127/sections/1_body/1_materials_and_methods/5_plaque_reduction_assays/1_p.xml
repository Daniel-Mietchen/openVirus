<p>Virus stocks were diluted in cold Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and six-well trays containing confluent monolayers of Vero cells were infected with 200 μL/well of virus (to yield 150–250 PFU/well). Test compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 10 mg/mL, and diluted in overlay medium (DMEM containing 2% FBS and 0.25% methylcellulose) singly or in combination. After one hour of adsorption at 37°C, the viral inoculum was removed, and cells were overlaid with 2.5 mL of medium. Each test compound concentration or combination was tested in duplicate wells. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 36–48 hours, and plaques were counted. The percent plaque reduction was calculated based on the number of plaques obtained in the absence of drugs. Antiviral activity is expressed as EC
