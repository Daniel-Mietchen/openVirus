<p>Recently we reported that an inhibitor/substrate of HSV types 1 and 2 (HSV-1, HSV-2) thymidine kinases, viz. 2-phenylamino-9-(4-hydroxybutyl)-6-oxopurine (HBPG) demonstrated potent antiviral activity in experimental models of HSV reactivation and encephalitis in mice.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-dddt-3-289">6</xref> The lack of activity of closely related analogs suggests the possibility that HBPG owes its antiherpetic activity in the animal models, at least in part, to its conversion to phosphate forms 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. We now report the unexpected finding of additivity and possible synergism between HBPG and antiherpes drugs against HSV encephalitis in mice, most significantly with ACV.
