<p>Recent published estimates of the incidence of neonatal herpes range from one per 3,500â€“5,000 births
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-dddt-3-289">3</xref> to three per 10,000 births or 1,200 cases per year in the US.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-dddt-3-289">5</xref> Often this results because of massive exposure of the neonate to virus (usually HSV type 2) shed in the birth canal. The infected newborn may experience localized skin and ocular lesions, viremia, and localized central nervous system lesion development, usually starting within six days of birth. If infection results in disseminated disease, central nervous system (CNS) disease occurs in up to 50% of the infants and can result in 75% mortality. For the survivors of CNS involvement, the outcome is bleak, with psychomotor retardation in 50% to 75% of the survivors.
