<p>The thymidine kinase inhibitor/substrate HBPG was effective in protecting mice from death caused by infection with HSV-1 and HSV-2. The compound is intermediate in potency between ACV and PFA, the current drugs used to treat human cases of herpes encephalitis and neonatal herpes. The basis for activity of HBPG was first thought to involve inhibition of thymidine kinase in the CNS, given that neurons already contain low levels of precursors of DNA synthesis. Because HBPG is an efficient substrate for the viral TK
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-dddt-3-289">6</xref> it is also possible that the monophosphate or triphosphate of the compound is the active form. However, both the monophosphate and triphosphate of HBPG were weak inhibitors of the viral (HSV-1) DNA polymerase (Focher, unpublished observations) that is the target of nucleoside analogs as their triphosphates. If direct inhibition of thymidine kinase was the mechanism of antiencephalitic activity of HBPG, the compound would be expected to antagonize the activity of ACV. Indeed, this is just what is found in plaque reduction assays of HSV infected proliferating cells (see above and Spadari and Wright).
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-dddt-3-289">14</xref> HBPG, however, was found unexpectedly to be additive or even synergistic with ACV against HSV-1 encephalitis (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-dddt-3-289">3</xref>), suggesting a mechanism of interaction 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> that is different from simple antagonism expected of competitors for TK. Several studies have explored antiherpes combinations active against different viral targets. For example, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor potentiated activity of ACV,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-dddt-3-289">16</xref> These findings are consistent with the synergism observed when antiviral activities are directed against independent targets.
