<p>The observation that HBPG exerts a protective effect two days after infection indicates that the drug penetrates the CNS in a therapeutically effective concentration and may reduce viral replication both before and after the development of encephalitis. Questions remaining to be answered include: Exactly how many viral particles reach the CNS? How much replication must occur to induce encephalitis? What is the concentration of HBPG in the CNS using the reported dose schedule? Is the combined drug therapy acting primarily outside the CNS? Is a significant component of the protection mediated in the CNS? Based on the disastrous consequences of CNS infection by HSV in encephalitis and neonates and our encouraging results indicating that mice can be protected against CNS infection by HBPG and a combination of HBPG and ACV, we believe that further study is warranted.</p>
