<p>Combinations of HBPG with the standard antiherpes drugs increased survival of mice with HSV-1 and HSV-2 encephalitis over the expected results for simple additivity (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-dddt-3-289">Table 2</xref>). Using the ED
 <sub>50</sub> values for each drug from 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dddt-3-289">Table 1</xref> and the assumption of parallel dose-response curves, addition of the fractions of the ED
 <sub>50</sub> of each was used to predict results of dosing of the combinations, assuming simple additivity of responses, ie, essentially a limited isobologram approach.

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-dddt-3-289">Table 3</xref> summarizes the results for several combinations. The results strongly suggest that HBPG and ACV are synergistic in their effect on HSV-1 encephalitis. For example, the expected survival of HSV-1-infected animals given 100 mg/kg HBPG + 50 mg/kg ACV was 64%, but the combination gave 100% survival. HBPG and CDF also appeared synergistic against HSV-1, but not against HSV-2 encephalitis. No conclusions can be drawn about the combination of HBPG and PFA. Although suggestive, the data are insufficient to prove whether any combinations are synergistic or additive.
