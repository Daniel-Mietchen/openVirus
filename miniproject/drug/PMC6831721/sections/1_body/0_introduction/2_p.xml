<p>The advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-based gene editing (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Doudna and Charpentier, 2014</xref>) has provided exciting new opportunities for genetics-based strategies to control these diseases. In particular, it has greatly accelerated the development of “gene drive” systems, capable of biasing inheritance in their favor, and thereby spreading desired genes and fitness loads into a population (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Esvelt et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Champer et al., 2016</xref>). Two distinct strategies for applying this technology to mosquitoes are: i) “population suppression,” in which the gene drive system induces a fitness load or sex bias, thereby suppressing (and potentially eliminating) mosquito populations as it spreads, and ii) “population replacement,” in which the gene drive system is used to bias inheritance in favor of linked effector genes that render them unable to transmit a pathogen. The disease-susceptible vector population is thereby replaced with a disease-refractory one over the course of several generations. While exciting progress has been made on the population suppression approach in mosquitoes (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Hammond et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Kyrou et al., 2018</xref>), we focus on the population replacement strategy in this review, as the population suppression approach targets the vector population directly rather than the vector-pathogen interaction.
