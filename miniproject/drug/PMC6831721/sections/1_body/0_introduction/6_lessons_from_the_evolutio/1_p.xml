<p>Antimalarial drugs provide a well-studied example of the evolutionary response of a mosquito-borne pathogen to selective pressure. Vector-borne pathogens alternate between their mosquito and human hosts; for antimalarial drugs, the suppressive effect is applied in the human host, while for disease-refractory genes, the suppressive effect is applied in the vector. For antimalarial drugs, efficacy is determined by their dosage and bioavailability, coverage level, and drugs used in combination. The efficacy of a disease-refractory gene will be determined by its expression level, timing, stability, and prevalence in the mosquito population; these are further influenced by the integration site, other effector genes present and synthetic elements included on the construct.</p>
