<p>We review the disease-refractory effectors designed to date to target the malaria parasite 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> transmitted by 
 <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, and arboviruses transmitted by 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, including DENV serotypes 1â€“4, CHIKV, and ZIKV. Studies of pathogen resistance in response to synthetic antipathogen effectors have been limited to the laboratory, and conducted only over small time scales. Consequently, there is limited direct evidence for resistance to these technologies in the pathogen population. We therefore discuss lessons learned from the evolution of resistance to anti-pathogen drugs and potential implications for effector resistance management, emphasizing resistance concerns and design considerations that may mitigate pathogen escape variants. We discuss integrated control strategies that may decrease pathogen resistance to antipathogen effectors, including reducing the pathogen population size with traditional vector control measures or wide-scale distribution of antimalarial drugs, both of which could be used prior to and/or during a release. We conclude with a discussion of the target product profile (TPP) for gene drive systems intended for vector-borne disease control, with emphasis on the time span that the effector genes should be prevalent and functional in the vector population.
