<p>All of these approaches are based on small RNAs, and to prevent the evolution of viral escape variants, high target coverage of the viral genome is required. Indeed, some viruses have been shown to replicate to high enough titers that they can overcome an RNAi response (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">McFarlane et al., 2014</xref>), and engineering efforts must ensure that high viral replication is not an evolutionary consequence. The rigorous target sequence conservation required in parts of the small RNA-targeting sequence, and the high mutation rate of RNA viruses, have resulted in the rapid development of resistance to other RNAi technologies (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Buchman et al. (2019b)</xref> was to use eight separate small RNAs to target 6â€“10 conserved protein-coding genes in the ZIKV genome, reducing the possibility of escape mutants.
