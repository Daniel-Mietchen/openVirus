<p>A recent approach taken to target multiple serotypes of DENV (1-4) utilized a broadly neutralizing scFV (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Buchman et al., 2019a</xref>), reducing viral infection and dissemination of all four major serotypes of DENV. Another approach to minimize the emergence of escape mutants is to use small antiviral hammerhead ribozymes to increase the number of sites being targeted in the viral genome. This was used by

 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2016</xref>). Error-prone activities of RNA polymerase provide opportunities for viruses to escape from ribozyme catalysis (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Scherer and Rossi, 2003</xref>); however this can be overcome by using antiviral group-I introns, and by targeting conserved sequences in arboviruses (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Carter et al., 2015</xref>). As discussed above, these designs must consider the high mutation rate and large size of viral populations, or viral “quasispecies”, and the implications of these features on viral resistance to effector genes. That said, off-target effects of small antiviral RNAs may help to reduce the risk of escape mutants, despite the heightened diversity of viral quasispecies (
