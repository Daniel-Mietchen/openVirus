<p>We also exclude from consideration 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> for population replacement in this review (i.e., replacing a vector population with a 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-transfected one), as 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated pathogen-blocking is induced by an endosymbiotic bacterium rather than an effector gene, and the mechanism of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced pathogen-blocking is not yet well understood. The evolutionary tug-of-war between 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and pathogens is certainly relevant though, and worthy of a review in its own right. 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> functions similarly to a gene drive system in spreading through a population, and has been shown to reduce vector competence for multiple arboviruses (

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aliota et al., 2016</xref>). The mechanism of pathogen-blocking likely involves multiple pathways and competition for resources (

 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Koh et al., 2019</xref>), though early evidence is mixed about whether natural selection favors enhanced or reduced pathogen-blocking by the endosymbiont (
