<p>Upon implementation, routine monitoring will be integral to preventing the spread of pathogen resistance to effector genes. Early detection through regular monitoring allows alternative effectors to be introduced into the vector population and/or alternative vector and disease control interventions to be put in place to minimize the selection and further spread of effector resistance. To aid in these efforts, accurate rapid assays for pathogen susceptibility to effector genes will be extremely useful, as will a pipeline of alternative anti-pathogen effector genes, and a resistance management strategy including geographical considerations informed by spatial modeling.</p>
