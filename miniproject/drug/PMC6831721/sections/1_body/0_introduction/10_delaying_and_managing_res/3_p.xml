<p>Reducing the size of the pathogen population by other means is complementary to the design of robust effector genes, and provides an additional rationale for maintaining an integrated vector and disease control program. The simple rationale is that, if the pathogen population is smaller, then there will be less opportunities for effector resistance to emerge. For malaria, additional approaches to reduce the parasite burden at the population level include: i) vector control methods, such as the distribution and use of insecticide-treated nets and spraying of walls with insecticides, and ii) the distribution of antimalarial drugs (ACTs), either when cases present at health facilities, or through some variety of mass drug administration. A range of novel vector control interventions are also becoming available to further reduce vector densities (

 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Kiware et al., 2017</xref>) and pathogen strain evolution, will allow the relative contributions of these complementary strategies to be assessed in future modeling studies. Data to inform these models is limited at present; however initial impressions may be gained by including sensitivity analyses, and will improve as further data is obtained, for instance, pertaining to pathogen population size and genetic diversity.
