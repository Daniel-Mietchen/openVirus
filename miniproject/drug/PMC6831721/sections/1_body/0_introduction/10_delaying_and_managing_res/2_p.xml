<p>Prevention or slowing of the emergence of effector resistance is the first step to ensure effectors are effective components of population replacement strategies. This has two dimensions: i) increasing the evolutionary hurdle required by the pathogen to evolve resistance to the effector gene, and ii) reducing the size of the pathogen population to reduce the rate of resistance emergence (

 </xref>). Most of the discussion thus far has focused on the former. Strategies to increase the evolutionary hurdle include: i) using multiple effectors that attack the pathogen at multiple sites on its genome and/or multiple stages of development (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Buchman et al., 2019b</xref>), and ii) ensuring that the effectors used are effective at substantially reducing pathogen transmission, and in a wide range of individuals representing the genetic diversity of the species. As mentioned earlier, a crucial goal is to prevent selection of escape mutants with a higher viral or parasitic load. This must be true across the species range of the vector, as ambitious population replacement strategies aim to introduce disease-refractory genes on a potentially continental scale, and hence the effector genes must be robust to pathogen evolution on a similar scale.
