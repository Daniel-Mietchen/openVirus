<p>The malaria life cycle is complex and antimalarial effector genes could target the parasite at several stages of development in the mosquito, including: i) mosquito ingestion of gametocytes from human blood, ii) microgametocyte and macrogametocyte coalescence, iii) ookinete and oocyst formation, iv) rupture and sporozoite release into the midgut, and v) sporozoite migration to the salivary glands (

Theoretically, any stage in this life cycle can be targeted; but the ookinete/oocyst life stage is a particularly attractive target, as it represents a population bottleneck for malaria parasites in the mosquito. The most effective antimalarial effector genes will likely target the parasite at multiple life stages.
