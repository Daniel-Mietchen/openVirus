<p>Malaria-refractory genes and other putative effector strategies to target malaria parasites at various developmental stages are reviewed by Carballar-Lejarazu and James (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Carballar-Lejarazú and James, 2017</xref>). These include cellular melanization mechanisms that occur in nature and inactivate the malaria parasite by encapsulating it in the midgut (

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2012</xref>), blocking receptors that the parasite recognizes and requires in order to pass through the midgut or salivary glands through genetic engineering (
