<p>Evolution of resistance to antiviral effectors is to be expected in the event that population replacement technologies are implemented to combat 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>-transmitted arboviruses. Mosquitoes have evolved numerous systemic, small RNA-mediated immune defense mechanisms against viral infections that drive adaptation of viral counter-defenses. Notably, viral-associated immune suppression has been identified in laboratory studies of CHIKV infected mosquitoes and mosquito cell lines (

 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). Presumably, similar viral counter-defenses could be developed against antiviral effectors. In prominent disease vectors, such as 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, the immune response is not adequate to prevent the replication and dissemination of arboviruses, and consequently allows systemic infections that lead to arboviral transmission to vertebrate hosts. One future approach to antiviral effector design could be to enhance natural mosquito immunity. Another approach could be to circumvent viral evasion mechanisms in order to support viral clearance (
