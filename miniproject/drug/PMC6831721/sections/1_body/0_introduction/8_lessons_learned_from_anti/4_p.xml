<p>A multitude of clinical and laboratory-based examples exist of similar RNA viruses evolving drug resistance despite mitigative design considerations. For instance, a multi-target approach did not prevent rapid viral resistance to ribavirin (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Beaucourt and Vignuzzi, 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Debing et al., 2014</xref>), an antiviral drug that targets and mutates RNA viruses at multiple sites and time points during the viral replication cycle (

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Crotty et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, when target site mutations have a high fitness cost, RNA viruses such as influenza have been shown to develop compensatory mutations to improve their fitness (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bloom et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Behera et al., 2015</xref>). Compensatory mutations have also been identified in other RNA viruses, notably increasing replication efficiency in large-deletion, replication-deficient CHIKV strains in both primate and mosquito cell cultures (
