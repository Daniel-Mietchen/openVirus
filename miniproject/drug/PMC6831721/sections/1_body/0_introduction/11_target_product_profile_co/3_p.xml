<p>Which TPP we are aiming for dramatically influences several minimal properties of the drive system including: i) for homing-based drive systems, the rates of accurate homology-directed repair and generation of homing-resistant alleles, ii) the rates of mutational loss of the gene drive system and/or effector genes, and iii) the rate of pathogen evolution in response to the effector genes, among other properties. Here, we limit our attention to the latter property regarding pathogen evolution; however, all are essential to achieve the desired entomological and/or epidemiological endpoints. To be effective in achieving wide-scale disease control and potentially elimination through reduced pathogen transmission in a range of vectors representing the genetic diversity of the species, multiple effectors that attack the pathogen at multiple genomic sites and/or stages of development will need to be included (
