  <p>Schematic of the life cycle of 
   <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. The complete life cycle takes place in two organisms: 
   <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes and humans. A female mosquito ingests micro- and macro-gametocytes (I) in blood from an infectious human, which then fuse into diploid zygotes (II). Zygotes develop into ookinetes (III) that penetrate the midgut epithelium and grow into oocysts. Sporozoites (IV) multiply inside oocysts and escape into the hemolymph to migrate to the salivary glands. This process takes 10â€“18 days (the extrinsic incubation period). When an infected female mosquito feeds again, sporozoites are released with saliva into the human bloodstream. In humans, sporozoites migrate from the blood into liver cells where they mature, multiply, and develop into merozoites (VI). When merozoites rupture from liver cells, they infect and multiply in erythrocytes (VII). This starts cycles of synchronous erythrocyte infection/rupture typical of malaria fever (VIII). Some merozoites develop into gametocytes (IX), which can be ingested by a female mosquito, and the cycle begins again.
