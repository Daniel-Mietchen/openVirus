  <p>Crystal structure of inhibitor 
   <bold>26</bold> shown as sticks with carbon atoms in yellow (oxygen in red, nitrogen in blue) in complex with matriptase, presented with a transparent surface in green (PDB, 4O97) (Goswami et al. 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2014</xref>). Important matriptase residues within the active site are shown with carbon atoms in green and are labeled. Water molecules in direct contact to the inhibitor are provided as red spheres, polar contacts as dashed lines in black
