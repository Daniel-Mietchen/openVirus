  <p>Model of TMPRSS2 in complex with inhibitor 
   <bold>21</bold>. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Structure of inhibitor 
   <bold>21</bold> (stick model with yellow carbon atoms, nitrogen in blue, oxygen in red, chlorine in green) bound into the active site of TMPRSS2, shown with its surface in gray. The 2,4-dichloro-biphenyl-3-sulfonyl residue is directed toward the distal S3/4 pocket above Trp215 indicated by a yellow surface. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Polar interactions of inhibitor 
   <bold>21</bold> in the active site of TMPRSS2 are shown as dashed lines in black; important TMPRSS2 residues are shown with carbon atoms in green
