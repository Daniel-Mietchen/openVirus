<p id="Par91">So far, only inhibitors addressing viral proteases have been approved for the treatment of certain virus infections. A huge arsenal of excellent inhibitors against host proteases has been developed in the past for treatment of chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, risk of thrombosis, inflammatory ailments, and cancer, but only few of them reached the clinic. Despite loss of patent protection, many of these failed inhibitors or their analogues could still be suitable for short-term treatment of acute life-threatening infectious diseases, without being hampered by side effects that might develop after long-term application. One of the most important prerequisites for successful drug development is the identification of a valid target. For some virus infections, the relevant host proteases have been identified, in other cases there are still uncertainties, and further basic research on target identification is needed. Since proteases usually belong to families of similar enzymes which substitute each other, a broad-spectrum inhibitor could be tolerable or even advantageous for the special treatment of infectious disease, although selective drugs are usually preferred for most applications to minimize side effects. Ideally, host protease inhibitors should be used in combination with additional drugs. This strategy should improve the antiviral efficacy and allow the use of reduced concentrations, thereby minimizing side effects. The development of effective and tolerable host protease inhibitors will hopefully expand the arsenal of antiviral drugs in the future.</p>
