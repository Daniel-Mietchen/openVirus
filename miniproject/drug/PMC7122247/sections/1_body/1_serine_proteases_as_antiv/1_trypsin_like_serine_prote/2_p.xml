<p id="Par34">The human genome encodes for approximately 70 different trypsin-like serine proteases, which cleave after a single basic residue, preferably after arginine in P1 position (Schechter and Berger 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">1967</xref>). Few of them, like matriptase or TMPSS13 (MSPL), strongly prefer substrates with additional basic residues in the non-primed region close to the cleavage site, e.g., in P4 and/or P3 position. The full-length enzymes can strongly differ in their molecular weights due to the presence of specific protein domains. However, all of them possess a relatively similar catalytic domain of approximately 225â€“230 amino acids with a strong structural homology to chymotrypsin of the subfamily S1A of serine proteases. This facilitates a common numbering of the residues within the catalytic domain with respect to chymotrypsin(ogen) used throughout this chapter. So far, crystal structures are available for ~25 different trypsin-like serine proteases. In most cases, the structures have only been determined for their catalytic domains, and their knowledge is normally sufficient for a rational structure-based design of active-site-directed inhibitors. The protease domain of the trypsin-like serine proteases consists of two six-stranded barrel domains, held together by several transdomain straps. The residues Ser195, His57, and Asp102 of the catalytic triad are located at the junction between these two barrels. All trypsin-like serine proteases contain a negatively charged aspartate residue at the bottom of their S1 pocket responsible for accepting substrates and inhibitors with basic P1 residues.
