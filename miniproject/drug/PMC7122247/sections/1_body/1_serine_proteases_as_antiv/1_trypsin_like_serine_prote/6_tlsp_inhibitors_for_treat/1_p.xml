 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> contain two surface glycoproteins, the receptor-binding protein (HN, H, G) and the fusion protein F. In contrast to the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>, where fusion of the viral membrane with host cell membrane occurs in the endosome, the activated F protein of many paramyxoviruses induces fusion of the virus envelope and the plasma membrane. The F
 <sub>0</sub> precursor of human parainfluenza virus 1 (HPIV-1) is cleaved at a monobasic sequence typical for TLSPs (DNPQTRâ†“FFGAV) (Diederich and Maisner 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2007</xref>). HPIV-1 causes respiratory infections, such as croup, especially among young children. In principle, some of the above-described inhibitors could also be suitable for the treatment of HPIV infections. With other paramyxoviruses, such as measles virus and mumps virus, F
 <sub>0</sub> is activated by furin, whereas F
 <sub>0</sub> of Nipah virus is cleaved by cathepsin L. Consequently, furin or cathepsin L inhibitors should be suitable for the treatment of these virus infections.
