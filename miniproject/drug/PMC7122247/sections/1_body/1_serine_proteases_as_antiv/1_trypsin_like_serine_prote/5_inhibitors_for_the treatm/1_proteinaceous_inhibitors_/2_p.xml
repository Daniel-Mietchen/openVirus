<p id="Par38">Trasylol was intravenously used for many years to reduce perioperative bleeding during open heart surgery but was withdrawn from market in 2008 when it became clear that it was associated with increased numbers of deaths as compared to treatment with standard antifibrinolytics (Fergusson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2008</xref>). As nonhuman protein, it may cause hypersensitive reactions during cardiac surgery, although the risk for anaphylactic reactions at first-time exposure is very low (&lt;0.1%) but might increase to ~2.7% after reexposure (Levy and Adkinson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2008</xref>). However, the application of aprotinin against influenza in form of an aerosol at significantly lower doses should minimize side effects (Zhirnov et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR209">2011</xref>). In addition, an aprotinin variant with stronger kallikrein and similar plasmin inhibition has been developed, which exhibits a reduced immunogenicity in chimpanzees (Apeler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2004</xref>). Antiviral potency against influenza was recently also demonstrated with the endogenous proteinaceous inhibitor hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor 2 (HAI-2) (Hamilton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2014</xref>). HAI-2 and HAI-1 are type 1 transmembrane proteins both containing two Kunitz domains, which inhibit numerous trypsin-like serine proteases including hepatocyte growth factor activator, matriptase (Szabo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR187">2008</xref>), hepsin, trypsin, and prostasin (Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2017</xref>). Sunflower trypsin inhibitor SFTI-1 (
 <bold>2</bold>), a bicyclic 14-mer, provides also an excellent scaffold for the design of serine protease inhibitors (Luckett et al.
