<p id="Par50">So far, no crystal structure of TMPRSS2 is available in the protein data bank. Therefore, we have generated a homology model of TMPRSS2 in complex with inhibitor 
 <bold>21</bold> using SWISS-MODEL (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://swissmodel.expasy.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://swissmodel.expasy.org</ext-link>/) (Biasini et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2014</xref>). The model was superimposed with the crystal structure of inhibitor 
 <bold>21</bold> in complex with thrombin (PDB, 4E7R (Hammami et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2012</xref>)) and subsequent deletion of the thrombin structure. The inhibitor was energy minimized in the active site of TMPRSS2 using the software Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2016</xref>). The model shows the expected polar contacts known from numerous crystal structures of sulfonylated 3-amidinophenylalanines in complex with trypsin (Renatus et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">1998</xref>), uPA (Zeslawska et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR206">2000</xref>), and matriptase (Steinmetzer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">2006</xref>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">11.10</xref>). The benzamidine binds to Asp189, Ser190, and Gly219 at the bottom of the S1 pocket, whereas the backbone amide NH and carbonyl oxygen of the P1 3-amidinophenylalanine make a short antiparallel β-sheet-like interaction with Gly216, and one sulfonyl oxygen binds to the NH of Gly219. It should be noted that in complexes with the substrate analogue inhibitors 
 <bold>10</bold>–
 <bold>17</bold>, this Gly216 is addressed by the backbone NH and carbonyl of the P3 residue, which indicates a completely different binding mode of this inhibitor type.
