<p id="Par45">Due to a similar architecture of the S1 pocket in most trypsin-like serine proteases, it is challenging to achieve a pronounced selectivity for individual proteases within this inhibitor scaffold, although compound 
 <bold>10</bold> is a relatively selective matriptase inhibitor (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> = 26 nM) and shows reduced affinity against the clotting proteases thrombin (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> = 300 nM) and factor Xa (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> = 570 nM) (Maiwald et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2016</xref>). The potency of this inhibitor type can be further enhanced by elongation with a suitable P4 residue, preferably a sulfonyl group, whereas one of its oxygen atoms interacts with the amide NH of Gly219. For inhibitors containing a 
 <sc>d</sc>-configured P3 residue, the N-terminal coupling of a benzylsulfonyl group induces a turn-like inhibitor backbone conformation when bound to the target, in which the N-terminal benzyl group binds in a shallow subpocket adjacent to the S1 site and comes in close van der Waals contact to the P1 phenyl ring (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">11.7</xref>) above the Cys191-Cys220 disulfide bridge. Inhibitor 
 <bold>11</bold> is a somewhat selective fXa inhibitor (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> = 3.5 nM (Schweinitz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">2006</xref>)) due to the presence of glycine in P2 position but inhibits also trypsin and matriptase with inhibition constants of 10 nM and 130 nM, respectively.
