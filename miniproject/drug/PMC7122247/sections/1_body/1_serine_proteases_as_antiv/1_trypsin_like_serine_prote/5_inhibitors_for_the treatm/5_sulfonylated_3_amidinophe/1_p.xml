<p id="Par49">Suitable scaffolds for non-covalent inhibitors of trypsin-like serine proteases are the tertiary amides of sulfonylated 3-amidinophenylalanines, which were originally developed for the inhibition of trypsin, thrombin, or uPA and further used for the design of matriptase inhibitors (Steinmetzer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">2006</xref>; Stürzebecher et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">1997</xref>). With some exception, this class of compounds provides relatively broad-spectrum inhibitors targeting numerous trypsin-like serine proteases. The uPA inhibitor 
 <bold>18</bold> (Stürzebecher et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">1999</xref>) (WX-UK1, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">11.9</xref>) in combination with the 5-fluorouracil prodrug capecitabine reached clinical development for tumor therapy (Setyono-Han et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">2005</xref>). Moreover, an orally available formulation in form of its hydroxyamidino prodrug mesupron (
 <bold>19</bold>) has also reached clinical phase II studies (indication pancreas and breast cancer). This suggests that this 3-amidinophenylalanine inhibitor type is suitable for drug development. Otherwise, compound 
 <bold>18</bold> is only a moderate inhibitor of numerous trypsin-like serine proteases including matriptase with 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> values close to 0.5 μM. Its sterically demanding and rigid triisopropyl-phenylsulfonyl (Tips) group cannot fully occupy the distal binding pocket above Trp215 in the usual way (Setyono-Han et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">2005</xref>; Stürzebecher et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">1999</xref>). A significantly improved and selective matriptase inhibition (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> = 3.8 nM) was achieved with inhibitor 
 <bold>20</bold>. Its N-terminal β-alanyl-amide targets the distal S3/4 pocket and is most likely involved in cation-π interactions to Trp215 and Phe99 of matriptase (Steinmetzer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">2006</xref>). However, the tribasic and strongly polar character limits the membrane permeability and bioavailability of this compound. Therefore, the number of basic groups was stepwise reduced and provided compound 
 <bold>21</bold> (MI-432) containing an N-terminal substituted biphenyl-3-sulfonyl group. This analogue inhibits matriptase and TMPRSS2 with similar inhibition constants of 2 nM and 0.9 nM, respectively (Hammami et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2012</xref>; Meyer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2013</xref>). It is also a relatively potent thrombin inhibitor (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> = 20 nM) but poor inhibitor of HAT (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> = 1.7 μM). Replacement of its C-terminal amino group by an urea portion provided the monobasic analogue 
 <bold>22</bold> (MI-462) (Hammami et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2012</xref>) (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> = 5.1 nM for matriptase and 630 nM for thrombin). Compounds 
 <bold>20</bold>–
 <bold>22</bold> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">11.9</xref>) reduced the propagation of various LPAIV strains with monobasic HA cleavage sites in infected cells (Baron et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2013</xref>; Meyer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2013</xref>). For instance, treatment with 50 μM of compound 
 <bold>21</bold> inhibited the multiple cycle replication of IAV H3N2 and H1N1 strains in Calu-3 cells (Meyer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2013</xref>), in which TMPRSS2 was identified as the major HA-cleaving protease (Böttcher-Friebertshäuser et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2011</xref>).
