<p id="Par65">The 45-kDa proteinase inhibitor 8 (PI8) was the first reported furin inhibitor, which is not a serpin reactive-site mutant. PI8 belongs to the group of ovalbumin-type serpins, containing two furin recognition sequences within its R336-N-S-R-C-S-R342 segment. The inhibition of furin by PI8 consists of two steps, starting with the rapid formation of a loose complex and followed by the slow isomerization to a stable complex. The overall
