<p id="Par70">We have developed a new peptidomimetic lead structure for basic PCs by incorporation of decarboxylated arginine derivatives in P1 position. Starting from the agmatine compound Phac-Arg-Val-Arg-4-Agm (
 <bold>33</bold>, 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> = 78 nM, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">11.16</xref>) or the equipotent noragmatine analogue, the approximately 100-fold more potent 4-Amba inhibitor 
 <bold>34</bold> has been prepared (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">11.16</xref>). It inhibits furin with a 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> value of 0.81 nM and PC1, PACE4, and PC5 with similar efficacy but has reduced potency against PC2 and PC7 (Becker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>) and negligible affinity against the trypsin-like serine proteases thrombin, factor Xa, and plasmin. Further modification of the P3 position by 
 <italic>tert</italic>-leucine or penicillamine provided inhibitors with enhanced potencies (Becker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2011</xref>; Hardes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2015</xref>). A considerably improved affinity was achieved by incorporation of basic P5 residues (Becker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2012</xref>). The most potent analogue 
 <bold>36</bold> (MI-1148, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">11.17</xref>) contains a 
 <italic>para</italic>-guanidinomethyl substitution at the P5 phenyl ring and inhibits furin with a 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> value of 5.5 pM (Hardes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2015</xref>). These inhibitors have a similar selectivity profile, as described for analogue 
 <bold>34</bold>, and also inhibit PC4 in the low picomolar range. To the best of our knowledge, these compounds are the most potent synthetic inhibitors of furin-like PCs. Some of these compounds enabled the determination of crystal structures in complex with human furin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">11.17</xref>) (Dahms et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2014</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2016a</xref>; Hardes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2015</xref>). A nearly identical binding mode was found for an analogous inhibitor containing the P5 guanidinomethyl substitution in meta-position (Dahms et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2014</xref>). The antiviral efficacy of inhibitor 
 <bold>36</bold> and/or of its P3 Val analogue MI-701 (Becker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2012</xref>; Hardes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2015</xref>) was extensively studied in cell culture infected with numerous furin-dependent viruses. A significant antiviral effect was found with HPAIV H5N1 and H7N1 strains (Hardes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2015</xref>; Lu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2015</xref>) and with canine distemper virus (CDV), which belongs to the 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> and is closely related to measles virus (Hardes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2015</xref>). Moreover, both inhibitors reduced the replication of Semliki Forest and chikungunya virus, both belonging to the alphaviruses, where furin cleaves the precursor protein p62 in the TGN (Hardes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2017</xref>). An antiviral effect was also found against flaviviruses like West Nile and dengue-2 virus (Kouretova et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2017</xref>) and, for MI-701, also against Borna disease virus (Lennartz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2016</xref>). Furthermore, both compounds strongly protected cells against anthrax, Shiga, and diphtheria toxin (Becker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2012</xref>; Hardes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2015</xref>).
