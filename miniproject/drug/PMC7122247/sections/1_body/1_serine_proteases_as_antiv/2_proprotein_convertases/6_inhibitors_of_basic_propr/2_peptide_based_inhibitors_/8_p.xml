<p id="Par74">Another attempt to synthesize potent PC inhibitors is based on the monocyclic sunflower trypsin inhibitor SFTI-1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">11.2</xref>) (Fittler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2015</xref>). Therefore, the SFTI-1 backbone was used as a starting point for several modifications like the implementation of a furin cleavage motif and truncation of the inhibitor. The most potent compound (
 <bold>41</bold>) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">11.1</xref>) of this series inhibits furin in the low nanomolar range (
