<p id="Par64">Additional furin inhibitors were designed by mutation of the homotetrameric glycoprotein α
 <sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin (α
 <sub>2</sub>-M), which is found in high concentrations in human blood. It is a potent broad-spectrum protease inhibitor with a unique inhibition mechanism. After protease mediated cleavage in the so-called bait region, the internal S-esters hydrolyze and trigger a conformational change of α
 <sub>2</sub>-M. The protease is enclosed by α
 <sub>2</sub>-M and sterically shielded from its substrates (Barrett and Starkey
