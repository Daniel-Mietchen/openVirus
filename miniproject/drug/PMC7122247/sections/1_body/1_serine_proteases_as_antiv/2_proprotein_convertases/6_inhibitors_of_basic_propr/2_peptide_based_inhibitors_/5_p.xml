 <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">11.16</xref>) containing a β-turn inducing enediynyl amino acid moiety was prepared. The amino and carboxyl groups of this unusual amino acid were coupled to peptide sequences around the cleavage sites within the prodomain of furin. This compound inhibits furin with a
