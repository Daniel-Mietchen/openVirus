<p id="Par61">A common approach for protease inhibitor development is the optimization of natural inhibitors by mutation of their inhibitory recognition loops. The α1-antitrypsin Portland (α1-PDX) is a bioengineered serpin-type inhibitor containing the furin-adapted sequence R355-I-P-R358 instead of A355-I-P-M358 in its inhibitory loop. α1-PDX inhibits furin with a

 <sub>i</sub> value of 0.6 nM in a slow tight-binding manner and is supposed to act as suicide substrate, yielding an inactive enzyme (Jean et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">1998</xref>). It also inhibits PC1 (

 <sub>i</sub> = 260 nM) and PC5 (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> = 2.3 nM) but has reduced potency against PC2, PC7, and PACE4 (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> &gt;1000 nM). Its expression in cells blocked the processing of HIV gp160 as well as measles virus fusion protein and, thus, inhibited virus spread (Anderson et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200">1995</xref>). Based on the reactive loop of α1-PDX, numerous mini-PDX peptides have been prepared. These acyclic- or disulfide-bridged cyclic 30-mers inhibit furin with
