<p id="Par67">The second group of inhibitors comprises various peptides and peptidomimetics. Due to their relatively high molecular weight, negligible oral bioavailability, and stability problems, these compounds are not the first choice for drug development. Nevertheless, numerous injectable peptides are used in therapeutic applications (Vlieghe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR197">2010</xref>). The first potent PC inhibitors were the irreversible substrate analogue chloromethyl ketones (CMK), which covalently bind to the enzyme (Garten et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">1989</xref>; Hallenberger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">1992</xref>). The most widely used basic PC inhibitor is the commercially available derivative Dec-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-CMK (

 <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">11.15</xref>), which targets all of the known furin-like PCs in the nanomolar range (Garten et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">1994</xref>; Jean et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">1998</xref>). In cell culture, it blocks the furin-catalyzed cleavage of HIV gp160 into gp120 and gp41. Furthermore, the first crystal structure of furin was obtained when it was complexed with this inhibitor (Henrich et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2003</xref>). However, CMKs are not suited for further development. In vivo studies with the thrombin inhibitor 
 <sc>d</sc>-Phe-Pro-Arg-CMK revealed a very short half-life &lt;5 min (Hanson and Harker 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">1988</xref>). The same P4-P1 segment of the CMK
