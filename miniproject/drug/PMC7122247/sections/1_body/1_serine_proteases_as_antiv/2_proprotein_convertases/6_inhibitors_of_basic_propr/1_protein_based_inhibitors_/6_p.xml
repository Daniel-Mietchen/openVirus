<p id="Par66">Recently, several specific nanobodies against furin have been described (Zhu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR212">2012</xref>). These nanobodies are dromedary-derived single-domain antigen-binding fragments. A crystal structure of one of these nanobodies in complex with furin and an additional active-site inhibitor reveals that they do not directly bind to the active site (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">11.14</xref>) (Dahms et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2016b</xref>). Nevertheless, some of these nanobodies inhibit furin-mediated cleavage of diphtheria toxin by a noncompetitive mechanism (

 <sub>i</sub> values of approximately 25 μM) and the activation of anthrax toxin (Zhu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR212">2012</xref>). Obviously, they block the cleavage of larger proteinaceous substrates by steric hindrance.
