<p id="Par79">One approach to find new nonpeptidic furin inhibitors is the testing of compounds from natural sources. An example of this attempt is the screening of the chemical constituents of the medicinally used plant 
 <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic>. Derived from the major component andrographolide 
 <bold>51</bold>, several semisynthetic compounds have been tested. The most potent derivative is the andrographolide-trisuccinate pyridinium salt
