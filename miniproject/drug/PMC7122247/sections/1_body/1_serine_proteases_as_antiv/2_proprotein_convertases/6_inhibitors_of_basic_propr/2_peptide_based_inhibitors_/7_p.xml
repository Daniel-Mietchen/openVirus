<p id="Par73">The inhibitory potency against furin could be further enhanced with poly-arginine derivatives, found by a positional scanning of combinatorial 
 <sc>l</sc>- and 
 <sc>d</sc>-hexapeptide libraries (Cameron et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2000</xref>). Hexa-
 <sc>d</sc>-arginine (

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">11.1</xref>) inhibits furin and PC5 with 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> values around 200 nM in the same range, whereas it is less active against PC1 and PC7. The elongated analogue nona-
 <sc>d</sc>-arginine-amide (D9R-amide, compound 
 <bold>40</bold>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">11.1</xref>) possesses a significantly improved inhibition constant of 1.3Â nM. In contrast to the analogous 
 <sc>l</sc>-peptide, which was cleaved by furin, the 
 <sc>d</sc>-configured D9R-amide was found to be fully stable (Cameron et al.
