<p id="Par76">Small molecules are the most promising candidates for drug development, because they have a better chance for oral bioavailability and should be better suited to address intracellular targets. Nevertheless, only a few nonpeptidic PC inhibitors have been reported; most of them possess moderate potency. The only efficacious derivatives were obtained within a series of guanidinylated 2,5-dideoxystreptamine derivatives; the most potent analogue 
 <bold>43</bold> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig19" ref-type="fig">11.19</xref>) inhibits furin and PC5 with inhibition constants of 6 and 4Â nM, respectively, whereas its affinity against PACE4 and PC7 is reduced (Jiao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2006</xref>). Derivative 
 <bold>44</bold> (1n) enabled the determination of a crystal structure in complex with human furin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig18" ref-type="fig">11.18</xref>) (Dahms et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2017</xref>). Surprisingly, two inhibitor molecules bind close to the active-site cleft. The first molecule (with carbon atoms in green) binds to the S4 and S2 sites of furin, without addressing its S1 pocket. The binding of the second molecule (shown with carbon atoms in yellow), which does not form strong polar contacts to furin, could be an artifact caused by the unusually high inhibitor concentrations used during crystallization.
