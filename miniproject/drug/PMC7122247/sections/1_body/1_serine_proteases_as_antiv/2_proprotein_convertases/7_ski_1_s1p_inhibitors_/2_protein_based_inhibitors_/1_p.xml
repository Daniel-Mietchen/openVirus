<p id="Par82">The concept of mutation and thereby optimization of natural serine protease inhibitors for a new target was also applied for the development of SKI-1/S1P inhibitors (Maisa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2009</xref>; Pullikotil et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">2004</xref>). Instead of the multibasic furin cleavage site, the SKI-1/S1P-specific motif (R/K)-X-X-(L/T)↓ (Seidah and Chretien 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">1999</xref>) was introduced. The overexpression of the α1-AT RRVL variant was found to inhibit both CCHFV (Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus) and LASV glycoprotein maturation. Blocking of arenavirus GPC processing had a strong antiviral effect in suppressing cell-to-cell spread and formation of viral particles. Micromolar concentrations of the wild-type prosegment of SKI-1/S1P were needed to inhibit the enzyme in vitro. A prosegment with the amino acid exchange R134E was the most potent mutant inhibiting the cleavage of CCHFV preGC (Pullikotil et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">2004</xref>).
