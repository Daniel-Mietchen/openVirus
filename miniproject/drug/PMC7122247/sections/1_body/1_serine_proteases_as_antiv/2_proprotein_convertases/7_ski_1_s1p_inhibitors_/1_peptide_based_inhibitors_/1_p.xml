<p id="Par80">In analogy to the CMK inhibitors against furin-related PCs, irreversible inhibitors for SKI-1/S1P were prepared (Pasquato et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2006</xref>). The substrate analogue backbone was derived from the cleavage site of the Lassa virus (LASV) glycoprotein IYISRRLL. Based on this sequence, a 4-mer (Dec-RRLL-CMK; 
 <bold>53</bold>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">11.20</xref>), a 6-mer (Dec-ISRRLL-CMK), and a 7-mer (Dec-YISRRLL-CMK) were synthesized. Interestingly, the 4-mer shows in vitro a 250-fold higher potency compared to the longer derivatives, whereas in cell culture experiments, all inhibitors are almost equipotent. The CMK derivatives were able to block the infection of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and chimeras of LCMV containing the LASV glycoprotein.
