For PACE4, a lethality of 25% was observed in knockout mice at embryonic day 14. In contrast, PC1- and PC2-deficient mice are viable but have several neuroendocrine peptide processing defects, and PC7 knockout mice show a loss of anxiety. The knockout of PC4 leads to infertility especially in male mice, whereas PCSK9 deficiency leads to lower plasma cholesterol levels.
