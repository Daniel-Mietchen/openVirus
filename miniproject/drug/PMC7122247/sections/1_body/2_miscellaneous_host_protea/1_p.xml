<p id="Par86">Numerous viral surface proteins are cleaved by endosomal cysteine proteases. The papain-like cathepsin L activates the Ebola virus (EboV) glycoprotein (GP) (Chandran et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2005</xref>) or Nipah virus F protein (Diederich et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2008</xref>), and despite contradictory reports, cathepsins might be also involved in the GP activation of some coronaviruses (Zhou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR211">2015</xref>). In contrast to the majority of serine protease inhibitors, most cysteine protease inhibitors achieve potency by a covalent modification of their target enzymes, which can be reversible or irreversible (Siklos et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">2015</xref>). Only a few basic examples of typical cysteine protease inhibitors will be provided in this paragraph. Classical warheads leading to a relatively specific irreversible inhibition of cysteine proteases are the epoxysuccinates, vinylsulfones, and allylsulfones, whereas chloromethyl and diazomethyl ketones react with both the cysteine and serine proteases. The archetypal epoxysuccinate E-64 (
 <bold>59</bold>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig22" ref-type="fig">11.22</xref>) was isolated from 
 <italic>Aspergillus japonicus</italic> and forms a thioether bond with the active-site cysteine (Hanada et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">1978</xref>). It is a nonselective inhibitor of nearly all cysteine cathepsins, with the exception of cathepsin C (Turk et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">2012</xref>). Many analogues of E-64 have been prepared by replacement of its leucyl-agmatine segment. The more hydrophobic ethyl ester prodrug E-64d (
 <bold>60</bold>) reached clinical phase III trials (Satoyoshi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">1992</xref>). Peptidic vinylsulfones represent an additional class of widely used cysteine protease inhibitors, including numerous cathepsins. The active-site cysteine attacks the Michael acceptor like vinylsulfone and becomes irreversibly alkylated. For instance, cathepsins L and B are very rapidly inactivated by inhibitor 
 <bold>61</bold> with second-order rate constants (

 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively (Palmer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">1995</xref>). A considerable inhibition of EboV GP and SARS-CoV S-protein cleavage was observed for close analogues in cell culture, like compound 
 <bold>62</bold>. However, this compound was completely inactive in a lethal SARS-CoV mouse model (Zhou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR211">2015</xref>). A considerably slower inactivation of cathepsin B (
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>obs</sub>/[I] = 9.2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> M
 <sup>−1</sup>s
 <sup>−1</sup>) and other cysteine proteases was found by the allylsulfone 
 <bold>63</bold> and numerous analogues, indicating a reduced electrophilicity of the allylsulfone segment (Fennell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2013</xref>). Peptidic chloromethyl or diazomethyl ketones (Powers et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2002</xref>) are also very effective in vitro cysteine protease inhibitors. However, they suffer from instability in vivo and often from low selectivity.
