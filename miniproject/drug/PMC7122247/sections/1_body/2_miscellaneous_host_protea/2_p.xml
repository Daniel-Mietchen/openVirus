<p id="Par87">Similar as done in the field of serine protease inhibitors, α-keto-derived cysteine protease inhibitors have been prepared, including α-ketoacids (
 <bold>64</bold>), α-ketoesters (
 <bold>65</bold>), and α-ketoamides (
 <bold>66</bold>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig23" ref-type="fig">11.23</xref>). The ketone moiety of these analogues is attacked by the active-site cysteine leading to a covalent but reversible thiohemiketal complex. Additional examples are summarized in a recently published review (Siklos et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">2015</xref>). Probably the most promising warhead for the development of covalent reversible cysteine protease inhibitors is the nitrile group. Nitriles react with the active-site cysteine forming a thioimidate adduct. A myriad of peptidic nitrile inhibitors have been prepared (Frizler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2010</xref>), for instance, compound 
 <bold>67</bold> inhibits cathepsins L and B with 
 <italic>IC</italic>
 <sub>50</sub> values of 20 nM and 1.8 nM (Greenspan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2001</xref>). A potency considerably enhanced by four to five orders of magnitude could be achieved by the replacement of the Cα carbon in P1 position with nitrogen. For instance, the resulting azanitrile 
 <bold>68</bold> binds to cathepsin L with a 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> value of 74 pM and possesses a similar picomolar potency against cathepsins S and L (Löser et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">2008</xref>). The cathepsin K inhibitor odanacatib 
 <bold>69</bold> reached clinical phase III development, but its development was recently cancelled due to side effects. Moreover, completely nonpeptidic nitrile derivatives have been developed, such as compound 
 <bold>70</bold> that inhibits cathepsin L with a 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> value of 2 nM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig23" ref-type="fig">11.23</xref>).
