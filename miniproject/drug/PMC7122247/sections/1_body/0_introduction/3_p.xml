<p id="Par32">In the following sections, numerous examples for the antiviral activity of inhibitors mainly addressing human serine proteases will be provided. In addition, structural aspects of the protease-inhibitor complexes will be discussed. Although first approved inhibitors of ACE and thrombin have been discovered long before the target structures have been determined, all subsequent successful developments in the field of protease inhibitors were strongly supported by the availability of crystal structures, which is an important prerequisite for a rational structure-based drug design.</p>
