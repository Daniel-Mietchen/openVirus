<p>This model makes several assumptions due to need for simplification or lack of data. Parameter values concerning prophylactic vaccines are based on preliminary assumptions since the effectiveness and duration of protection of such a vaccine were not known at the time of publication. In addition, the game theoretical model is a simplified representation of how individuals weigh their preferences; additional factors may influence the decision making process in real populations. The model does not include memory of past sexual encounters with specific individuals, or sexual network structure. Although the model includes age structure, there may be other heterogeneities that could influence results such as variable sexual activity levels, or social and cultural group identification. The model assumes that individuals who are offered unprotected sex increase their estimate of HIV prevalence in the population. This was motivated by studies that address risk factors and psychological determinants of behavior in HIV+ individuals
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, showing that engaging in US is more frequent in HIV+ individuals. As such, since this is a relatively homogeneous and closed group with distinct norms and practices, we assume that individuals offered unprotected sex assume the other individual has a higher chance of being HIV+. However, in other populations, the opposite might be true.
