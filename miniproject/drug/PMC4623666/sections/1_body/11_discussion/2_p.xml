<p>As a result of these other feedback loops, both HIV prevalence and the rate of unprotected sex acts with HIV+ actors, per HIVâˆ’ individual decrease under both HAART and prophylactic vaccines, despite the effects of HAART and vaccine optimism. However, the decline is not as significant as it would have been if compensatory behavior did not emerge after the interventions. At other parameter values, HIV prevalence can increase as a result of the interventions. For example, we observed that when the effect of HAART optimism is sufficiently high, making the utility of unprotected sex sufficiently attractive, then HIV prevalence could actually rise under HAART (

Also, for both HAART and the vaccine, if individuals over-estimate the population coverage of the intervention, they will tend to interpret unprotected sex offers as evidence of HAART optimism or vaccine protection, rather than HIV+ status, which can have damaging consequences (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures S7, S13</xref>). Finally, if vaccine protection wanes after 10 years, then the burden of HIV incidence may simply be shifted to older age groups, which would necessitate booster programs.
