<p>We conclude that the behavioral pathways that are activated by introducing interventions are more complicated and numerous than the simple picture of potentially problematic or counter-productive behavioral responses usually suggests, and the pathways could be beneficial as well as harmful. Evaluations of the impact of HAART and potential prophylactic vaccines on risk perception and behavior should adopt a whole-population viewpoint regarding the effects of the intervention. This includes considering feedbacks that the interventions may introduce by altering dynamics of interaction between actors and their risk perception, population demographics (HIV prevalence), how these factors interact, and how they vary over time and across different age groups.</p>
