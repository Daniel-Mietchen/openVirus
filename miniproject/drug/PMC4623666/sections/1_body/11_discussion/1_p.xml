<p>This model illustrates how interventions, such as HAART and prophylactic HIV vaccines, can influence individual risk perception and behavior through multiple pathways. These interventions may result directly in HAART or vaccine optimism, since they may alter the utilities or perceived risks for an HIV− person interacting with someone who is offering unprotected sex. However, they also confer protective effects through other pathways. The first pathway is that optimism itself may increase the offers of unprotected sex, which can increase the perceived infection risk in the population and make some HIV− individuals more cautious than they would otherwise be. A second pathway occurs through disease dynamics: interventions reduce HIV transmission and prevalence, which increases the proportion of HIV− individuals in the population. This, in itself, protects HIV− individuals since any given sexual encounter is more likely to be with another HIV− individual, and hence the number of unprotected sex acts with HIV+ actors per HIV− individual decreases. At baseline parameter values, the decrease in per capita unprotected sex acts due to a changing composition of the population is a net decrease, i.e. the effects of changing population composition are outweighed by any increase due to optimism. We note that this is not a simple outcome of herd immunity, since individuals can choose protected sex or unprotected sex.</p>
