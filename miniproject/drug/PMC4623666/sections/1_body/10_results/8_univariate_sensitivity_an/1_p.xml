<p>Increasing the population coverage of HAART (

 <italic>b</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub>, increases slightly, at baseline parameter values (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). Increasing the transmission rate (
 <italic>τ</italic>) increases the HIV prevalence, and the perceived infection risk among HIV+ individuals, but has no effect on the perceived infection risk among HIV− individuals (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). This occurs due to the structure of the game and the utilities assigned to the available actions (See 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Section</xref> Understanding the evolution of 
 <italic>b</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub>-values). Finally, increasing the utility associated with protected sex (
 <italic>U</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>PS</italic>
 </sub>) makes it more attractive, and decreases HIV prevalence as well as perceived infection risk among both HIV+ and HIV− individuals (
