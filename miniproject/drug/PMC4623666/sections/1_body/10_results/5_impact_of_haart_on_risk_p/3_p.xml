<p>However, two other pathways partially counteract the effect of HAART optimism. On account of Equation

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c,e</xref> versus 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). The increase in perceived infection risk has a protective effect on the population, by making HIV− individuals more likely to believe the other actor is HIV+ (since more US offers are being made). Additionally, on account of fewer new infections, a gradual but significant expansion of the HIV− population occurs over time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4(c)</xref> versus 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2(c)</xref>). This growth in the HIV− population exceeds the expansion of the HIV+ population (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4(d)</xref> versus 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2(d)</xref>), resulting in a net reduction in HIV prevalence. This means that any given encounter is more likely to be with an HIV− person than an HIV+ person. As a result, for younger age classes, and across all age classes on average, the per capita rate of US between HIV+ and HIV− actors falls to an equilibrium value that is below the baseline scenario with no HAART, although in older age groups it falls to a level that remains above the baseline scenario with no HAART. Hence, in the long run, HAART results in less US being practiced by HIV− individuals on average, but not for older individuals. Both protective pathways tend to decrease the per capita number of unprotected sex acts between HIV+ and HIV− individuals in the long term, so that the transient spike in the per capita rate of US between HIV+ and HIV− actors due to HAART optimism is followed by a gradual decrease.
