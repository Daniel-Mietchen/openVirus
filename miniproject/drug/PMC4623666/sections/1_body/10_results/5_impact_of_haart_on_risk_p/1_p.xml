<p>Parameters for the baseline HAART scenario appear in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. HAART decreases the transmission rate and thus reduces the incidence of new HIV cases. However it also increases the lifespan of HIV+ individuals, such that the net impact of HAART is a small net increase in the number of HIV+ individuals in the population (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Significant reductions in the number of HIV+ individuals in the 15–39 year old age range due to reduced incidence are offset by significant increases in the number of HIV+ individuals in the 40+ age range due to longer lifespans and delayed age at infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). As a result of reduced transmission rates, the number of HIV− individuals grows considerably, causing a decrease in overall HIV prevalence (
