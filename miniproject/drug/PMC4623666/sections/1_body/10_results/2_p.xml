<p>We investigate changes in the population caused by HAART or prophylactic vaccines by comparing the dynamics with and without the interventions.The simulations are run to equilibrium before an intervention is introduced. Because the model is necessarily complicated on account of exploring multiple potential feedbacks on perception and behavior, we focus on the impact of these interventions separately and do not investigate scenarios where both are applied, leaving this to future work.</p>
