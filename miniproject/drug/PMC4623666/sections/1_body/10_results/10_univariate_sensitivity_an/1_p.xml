<p>For higher values of 
 <italic>k</italic>, such that individuals under-estimate population vaccine coverage, the perceived infection risk increases since individuals interpret US offers as evidence of HIV+ status. This causes HIV prevalence to decrease significantly compared to baseline, since PS becomes more attractive than US under such circumstances (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S11</xref>). On the other hand, lower values of 
 <italic>k</italic> mean individuals over-estimate population vaccine coverage, such that perceived infection risk decreases instead of increasing, and HIV prevalence declines only slightly compared to pre-vaccine prevalence (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S12</xref>). Hence, underestimation of population vaccine coverage can significantly reduce the effectiveness of prophylactic HIV vaccination programs, due to the tendency to accept US more often. These observations are borne out across a range of value for 
 <italic>k</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S13</xref>). Also, changes in 
 <italic>k</italic> have a greater effect for prophylactic vaccination than for HAART (
