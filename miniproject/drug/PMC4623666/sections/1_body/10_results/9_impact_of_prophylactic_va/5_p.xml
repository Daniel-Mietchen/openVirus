The decline in younger age categories reflects the significantly diminished number of HIV+ individuals in those age categories: there are simply not enough HIV+ individuals for per capita rates of US between HIV+ and HIV− actors to increase. In older age categories, the increase in per capita unprotected sex by HIV− individuals is caused by the increased population size of HIV+ individuals, due to the waning of protection from the vaccine.
