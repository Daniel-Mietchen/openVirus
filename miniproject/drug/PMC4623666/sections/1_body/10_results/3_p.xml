<p>We explore how these changes depend on model parameters governing vaccine and treatment coverage, vaccine efficacy, duration of protection, risk perception parameters, and transmission rates. The interventions are implemented at year 50 of the simulation in all figures, by which time the population has reached equilibrium. We also vary the utility associated with a sexual act, the value of which contributes to the decision making process. Model outcomes include population sizes, HIV prevalence, the perceived probability that the other person is HIV+ (which we hereafter refer to simply as “perceived infection risk”), and per capita number of unprotected sex acts (US) (i.e. US acts per HIV− individual, providing a gauge of risky behavior before and after interventions), broken down by age and HIV status. Baseline parameter values and utilities appear in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref> respectively. We use these parameter values in all simulations except when stated otherwise.
