<p>The parameter 
 <italic>k</italic> controls whether individuals over-estimate or under-estimate the amount of HAART coverage in the population. When 
 <italic>k</italic> &gt; 1 (respectively 
 <italic>k</italic> 
 <italic>&lt;</italic> 1), individuals underestimate (respectively, over-estimate) the amount of coverage. This has implications for whether they think the other actor is HIV+ or not. If individuals underestimate HAART coverage (
 <italic>k</italic> &gt; 1), then offers of US are more likely to be interpreted as meaning the other actor is HIV+, rather than being an HIV− person exhibiting HAART optimism, meaning their perceived prevalence of HIV will increase. Hence, they opt for protected sex, causing a decrease in HIV prevalence. This is indeed what is observed in simulations: as 
 <italic>k</italic> increases, HIV prevalence decrease (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). However, the average 
 <italic>b</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub>-value also decreases, since a decrease in HIV prevalence also causes a decrease in US offers. Hence, the decrease in US offers is offset by an increase in the likelihood that they are interpreted as evidence of HIV+ status, if individuals under-estimate HAART coverage in the population. The opposite happens for 
 <italic>k</italic> &lt; 1.
