<p>The partner selection model is based on a previous agent-based model used to explore the coevolution of risk perception, partner selection, and HIV transmission
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. In the present model, individuals in an age-structured core group population (1) engage with others, (2) decide whether to have protected or unprotected sex based on their own status, the perceived probability that the other person is HIV+, and utilities, as modified by the presence of HAART and vaccines, and (3) may transmit the infection if they have unprotected sex. The model is outlined in the Methods Section.
