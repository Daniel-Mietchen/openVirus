<p>The model represents HIV transmission and partner selection dynamics in a core group of individuals with higher partnership turnover, such as a core group of MSM. This was motivated by studies such as Gomes do Espirito Santo 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, that describe how the clients of male sex workers can act as a bridge for HIV transmission to the general population
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Sex workers and their clients are also the target of many prevention initiatives, which is why such groups were chosen as our main focus. The model is based on a previous agent-based partner selection model
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. The previous model is a simplified representation of the co-evolution between risk perception and HIV prevalence, within a homogeneous population of MSM over a relatively short amount of time. Individuals are randomly paired and, while aware of their own status, are unaware of their partnerâ€™s status. The game they play represents a strategic interaction between the individuals, wherein utilities are weighed and an outcome, dependent on how an interaction has progressed, is chosen.
