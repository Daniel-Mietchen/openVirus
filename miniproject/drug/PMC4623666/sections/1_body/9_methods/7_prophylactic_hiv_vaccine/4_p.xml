<p>The duration of protection for an efficaciously vaccinated individual is taken from a normal distribution with a mean 10 years and a standard deviation of 3 years. Vaccines are tested 5 and 10 years after being vaccinated and if the test indicates that their vaccine protection has ceased, the individual will change their utility back to that of an HIV− individual, otherwise they will continue with the utility of a vaccine-protected HIV− individual. At 15 years post-vaccination, individuals assume they are no longer protected and revert to the utility function of an unprotected HIV− individual. As no HIV vaccine currently exists, our testing assumption is based on practice associated with the Hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects against a dangerous sexually transmitted infection, and for which individual immunity after vaccination is tested in some jurisdictions
