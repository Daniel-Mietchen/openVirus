<p>Vaccine scheduling recommendations depend on various factors, including epidemiological, social, and health economic factors. Our assumption for HIV vaccine program design was based on experience with the HPV vaccine, which was first made available in 11â€“15 year olds
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. The reason for this is that the HPV vaccine is prophylactic (similarly to our assumed HIV vaccine) and thus, by definition, only protects susceptible persons, not infected persons. Hence, it is more efficient to vaccinate age groups where the proportion of susceptible individuals is highest, so vaccination is not wasted on individuals who are already infected. The model does not however, incorporate catch-up programs which would likely be rolled out in older age classes.
