<p>Much of the previous literature on HIV transmission and behavioral modelling focuses on population responses to interventions based on single mechanisms, such as exploitation of herd immunity. Here, our objective is to understand how populations can respond to the introduction of interventions through multiple mechanisms (pathways). We develop an agent-based model to explore the impact of coevolution of risk perception, sexual behavior, and HIV transmission dynamics in the context of prophylactic vaccines and HAART. Our model captures the interaction between the sexual partner selection process (as it depends upon time-evolving individual risk perception) and HIV disease dynamics, and how both respond to the introduction of HAART and prophylactic vaccines. Our objective is to explore potential mechanisms that may either lead to, or prevent, the development of policy resistance against those interventions. Each individual uses a utility function to decide whether to practice protected sex (PS), unprotected sex (US), or no sex (NS) with the other individual they are interacting with. (Utility is an abstract measure of preference that individuals can use to compare and rank different possible outcomes). This approach helps identify how decisions are formed, and how interactive decision-making between HIV+ and HIVâˆ’ individuals helps determine spread of HIV. We introduce heterogeneity into the model in the form of age structure, allowing us to explore age-specific effects. With a more informed understanding of how risk perception evolves, and how it reacts to the introduction of HAART and prophylactic vaccines in a population, we can better understand the changes in behavior associated with new treatment options. We use the model to shed light on the complex nuances of HAART optimism and vaccine policy resistance.</p>
