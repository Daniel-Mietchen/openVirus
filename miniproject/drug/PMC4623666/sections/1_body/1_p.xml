<p>However, implementing treatment and prevention programs may have unintended consequences. Interventions like HAART that delay progression to AIDS may reduce the fear of living with HIV/AIDS (so-called ‘HAART optimism’). This in turn may cause individuals to choose riskier sexual behaviors, thereby increasing HIV transmission more than would have been the case if sexual behavior did not change due to HAART

Alternatively, both prophylactic vaccines and HAART may reduce HIV prevalence, which in turn may also cause some individuals to become complacent about their risk of infection and thus increase their risky sexual behavior, thereby also increasing HIV transmission. Both types of responses are examples of ‘policy resistance’, where the population’s response to an intervention tends to undermine the intervention
