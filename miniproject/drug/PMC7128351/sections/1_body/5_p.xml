 <italic>Scutellariae Radix</italic> (
 <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic> root, Skullcap) has also been used successfully, which is a crude drug frequently used in TCM clinical prescriptions. Currently, more than 180 prescriptions containing 
 <italic>Scutellariae Radix</italic> are included in the latest version of Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2015). 
 <italic>Scutellariae Radix</italic> is commonly used to treat diseases such as trachoma hepatitis, hypertension, acute respiratory infection, acute gastroenteritis, infantile diarrhea, vomiting during pregnancy and other diseases [
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Meng Xiangrui et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] demonstrated that Qingfei Decoction (QFD, containing 
 <italic>Scutellariae Radix</italic>, 15 g/each, twice/day) combined with ulinastatin is effective in the treatment of severe pneumonia, which could increase serum TNF-alpha level and procalcitonin (PCT) expression. For a 10-day treatment, both the observation group and control group were given ulinastatin based on the conventional treatment, and additional QFD was given to the observation group. The effective rate of the observation group reached 93.4 % which is significantly higher than the 83.5 % measured in the control group, with a significance of χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 4.360, P = 0.037. The adverse event rate in the observation group was 4.4 (4/91), which was significantly lower than 13.2 (12/91) in the control group, with a significance of χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 4.390, P = 0.036. In an 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment, Zhi Hai-Juan et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] reported the therapeutic effects of major flavonoids-enriched chemical components extracted from 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> root (FESR) on acute lung injury induced by influenza A virus. They also concluded that the underlying action mechanism might be closely associated with anti-inflammatory, antiviral and anti-complementary properties of FESR.
