During the treatment, the control group was given arbidol and ambmxol hydochloride, and the treatment group was treated with TQG combined with arbidol and ambmxol hydochloride. The report found statistically significant difference between the two groups after 15 days of treatment: the absolute value of lymphocyte was up-regulated in the treatment group when compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.05), and C-reactive protein was down-regulated in the treatment group when compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the clinical effective rate of the treatment group could achieve to 89.20 % when compared with that of control group 69.44 % by the TCM syndrome index.
