OA-8, OA-9, OA-10 and OA-11 were newly synthesized derivatives. Figure S2: OA-10 inhibits IAV PR8 (H1N1), H9N2 and H3N2 replications in A549 cells. Figure S3: OA-10 does not block IAV binding to A549 cells. Figure S4: Amino acid sequence alignment of the full-length HA proteins between strains of A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) and A/Duck/Guangdong/99(H5N1).
