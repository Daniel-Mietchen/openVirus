  <p>HA is a potential target of OA-10. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Comparisons of the behaviors of OA-10 vs. antisera against H5 HA in inhibition of H5N1 IAV-induced aggregation of chicken RBCs. OA-10 partially blocked H5N1 virus adsorption to chicken RBCs at concentrations ≥40 µM. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Characterization of the affinity between OA-10 and HA protein using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Inhibition of OA-10 on HA-mediated chicken RBCs hemolysis using arbidol as the positive control.
