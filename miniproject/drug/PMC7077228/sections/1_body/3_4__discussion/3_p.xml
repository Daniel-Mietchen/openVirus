<p>To investigate the binding intensity of OA-10 with HA, SPR analyses were conducted. SPR data showed that OA-10 interacted with HA strongly with KD of 2.98 × 10
 <sup>−12</sup> M (

To study the possible binding site, docking simulation analyses were performed, by which a highly conserved hydrophobic cavity at the HA1-HA2 interface in the HA stem region was identified as the possible binding site of OA-10. The binding cavity is formed by residues of the two HA subunits, including Gly20, Val18, Trp21, Lys38 and Ile45 in HA2, and His38 in HA1, which was previously reported to be one of the critical regions responsible for the conformational changes in HA2 at low pH [
