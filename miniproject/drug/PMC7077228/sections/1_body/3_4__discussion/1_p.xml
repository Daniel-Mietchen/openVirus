<p>In the present study, OA-10, a newly synthesized oleanane-type triterpene, exhibits significant antiviral activity against highly pathogenic H5N1 IAV replication with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 14.0 μM in A549 cell cultures. The in vitro cytotoxicity of OA-10 is quite low, with a CC
 <sub>50</sub> of more than 640 μM and a selective index of more than 45. OA-10 also exhibits similar inhibitory effect on other IAV subtypes including PR8, H3N2 and H9N2, with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 6.7 to 19.6 μM. The time course inhibition study indicates that OA-10 exerts its antiviral effect during early stages of viral infection post binding to cell surface receptors. SPR analyses demonstrate that OA-10 interacts with HA protein strongly. The inhibition of OA-10 on H5N1 IAV induced hemolysis of chicken RBCs at low pH confirms interaction of OA-10 with HA subunit HA2. Furthermore, computer-aided molecular docking analysis suggested that OA-10 might bind to the interface of HA1 and HA2 in the HA stem region, which was known to undergo significant rearrangement during membrane fusion [
