<p>The inhibitory effects of compounds on virus-induced hemolysis at low pH were determined by a procedure described previously by Basu et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Briefly, chicken RBCs were washed twice with PBS and resuspended to 2% (vol/vol) in PBS and stored at 4 °C until use; 100 µL of compound diluted in PBS was then mixed with an equal volume of H5N1 IAV (10
 <sup>8</sup> PFU/mL) in a 96-well plate. After incubating the virus-compound mixture at room temperature for 30 min, 200 µL of 2% chicken RBCs (pre-warmed at 37 °C) was added. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for another 30 min. To trigger hemolysis, 100 µL of sodium acetate-acetic acid buffer solution (0.5 M, pH 5.2) was added and mixed with the RBC suspension. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for another 30 min for HA acidification and hemolysis. To separate unlysed RBC from the lysed ones, plates were centrifuged at the end of incubation at 1200 rpm for 6 min; 300 µL of the supernatant was transferred to another flat-bottom 96-well plate. The OD
 <sub>540</sub> was read on a microtiter plate reader. IC
 <sub>50</sub> is defined as the compound concentration that generates 50% protection on chicken RBCs lysed by virus.
