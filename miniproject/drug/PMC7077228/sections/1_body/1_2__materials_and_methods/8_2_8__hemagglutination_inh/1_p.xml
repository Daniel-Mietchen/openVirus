<p>The inhibitory activity of OA-10 on HA-mediated hemagglutination of chicken red blood cells (RBCs) was assessed by an HAI assay. Briefly, 25 µL of A/Duck/Guangdong/99(H5N1) (4 hemagglutination units) was incubated with 25 µL H5 standard antiserum (H5 antiserum were provided by the Veterinary Technology Center of South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China) or OA-10 at indicated concentrations for 30 min at RT. Then, 50 µL chicken RBCs (0.5%) in saline solution were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The plates were taken images at 45 degree inclination for recording hemagglutination and the fluidity of deposited RBCs.</p>
