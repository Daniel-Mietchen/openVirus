<p>We next investigated whether OA-10 was able to inhibit HA-induced chicken RBC hemolysis at a low pH [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. To trigger hemolysis, the virus-cell suspension was acidified (pH 5.2) to initiate HA subunit HA2 conformational changes that lead to the lysis of chicken RBCs and their hemoglobin release. Arbidol, a licensed antiviral agent against IAV infection in Russia and China, was demonstrated to inhibit IAV replication by binding to HA2 in acidic condition and used as a positive hemolysis inhibitor control in this study [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f005">Figure 5</xref>C, as expected, arbidol showed hemolysis inhibition with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 51 µM. Interestingly, OA-10 more potently inhibited HA-induced hemolysis in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 26 µM. Taken together, these results show that OA-10 interacts with HA2.
