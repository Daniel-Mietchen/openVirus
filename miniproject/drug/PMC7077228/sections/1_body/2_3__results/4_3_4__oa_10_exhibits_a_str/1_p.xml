<p>To investigate the interaction of OA-10 with HA, we studied the affinities of OA-10 with HA by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). A recombinant HA protein from virus strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) was used as representative HA of H5N1 IAV strains, because the amino acid sequence identity of the full-length HA proteins between A/Vietnam/1203/2004 strain and A/Duck/Guangdong/99(H5N1) strain used in above antiviral assay was 97.0% (
