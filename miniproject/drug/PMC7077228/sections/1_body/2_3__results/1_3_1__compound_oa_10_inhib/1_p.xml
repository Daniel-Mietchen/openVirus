<p>Chemical structures of oleanane acid (OA-0) and its 11 derivatives, including four new derivatives, are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00225">Figure S1 of the Supplementary Material</xref>. The cytotoxicity of OA-0 and its derivatives on A549 cells was first evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiozol-2-yl)-3,5-dipheryl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. For each compound, CC
 <sub>50</sub> value, the concentration required to reduce normal cell viability by 50% after 24 h of compound treatment, was determined, as shown in 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00225-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Derivatives OA-1, OA-2, OA-4, OA-5, OA-7, OA-8 and OA-9 exhibited greater cytotoxicity on A549 cells with CC
 <sub>50</sub> ≤ 20.5 µM, while other derivatives and oleanolic acid exhibited less cytotoxicity with CC
 <sub>50</sub> ≥ 31.1 µM. Noticeably, OA-10 showed the least cytotoxicity with CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 640 µM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). DMSO (0.4%, used as solvent) did not exhibit detectable cytotoxicity on A549 cells
 <bold>.</bold> No obvious cytotoxicity was observed for OA-10 at concentrations ≤ 80 µM after 24, 48 or 72 h of treatment, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f001">Figure 1</xref>C. Thus, 80 µM of OA-10 was selected as the maximum concentration for further studies.
