<p>The antiviral activities of synthesized OA derivatives against H5N1 IAV were evaluated via relative nucleoprotein (NP) expression level (%) detected by immunofluorescence microscopy at 24 hpi. The initial results showed that OA-0 and the 11 derivatives exhibited various antiviral activities against H5N1 IAV infection (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00225-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). It was found that OA-0 and all other derivatives except OA-6 significantly reduced H5N1 IAV infection in A549 cells with EC
 <sub>50</sub> ≤ 14.2 µM, while OA-6 showed the lowest antiviral activity with EC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 86.6 µM. However, most of the effective derivatives, including OA-1, OA-2, OA-3, OA-4, OA-5, OA-7, OA-8, OA-9 and OA-11, exhibited high cytotoxicity on A549 cells with CC
 <sub>50</sub> ≤ 31.1 µM, while OA-0, OA-10 and OA-11 showed relatively lower cytotoxicity on A549 cells with CC
 <sub>50</sub> ≥ 60.0 µM. Most interestingly, OA-10 showed significant inhibition on H5N1 IAV replication in a dose-dependent manner in concentrations ranging from 20 to 80 µM (EC
 <sub>50</sub>: 14.0 µM) with very low cytotoxicity, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f001">Figure 1</xref>B,C. Among the 12 evaluated compounds, OA-10 showed the highest select index (SI &gt; 45). Thus, OA-10 was selected for further studies.
