<p>To explore whether OA-10 possesses a broad inhibitory effect on different IAV subtypes, three other IAV strains (PR8, H9N2 and H3N2) were evaluated using IFA and A549 cells at 24 hpi. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00225">Figure S2A</xref> and 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00225-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, OA-10 also exhibited significant inhibitions on PR8 (EC
 <sub>50</sub>: 6.7μM), H9N2 (EC
 <sub>50</sub>: 15.3 μM) and H3N2 (EC
 <sub>50</sub>: 19.6 μM) replications.
