<p>The described effects of dsRNA are realized not only in infected cells, but also in cells subjected to malignant transformation. As it has been shown in several mouse and human cell lines, TLR3 agonists inhibit growth of tumor cells through two main mechanisms: suppression of proliferation and induction of apoptotic death [
