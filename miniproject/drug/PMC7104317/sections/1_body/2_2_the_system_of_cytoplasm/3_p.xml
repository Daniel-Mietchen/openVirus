<p>There is a specificity in dsRNA recognition by individual sensors of this family. For example, RIG-1 recognizes single-stranded RNA with a double-stranded component containing terminal 5'-triphosphate, as well as relatively short (from 21 to 27 nucleotides) dsRNA formed due to action of activated RNase L [

Since partially complementary sequences in the 5' and 3' domains, containing dsRNA with 5'-terminal triphosphates, are characteristic of the “panhandle” structure—a double-stranded fragment of the negative-strand RNA virus genome, this mechanism seems to provide recognition specificity of dsRNA of such viruses as influenza A, rabies, measles, by the given sensory molecule [
