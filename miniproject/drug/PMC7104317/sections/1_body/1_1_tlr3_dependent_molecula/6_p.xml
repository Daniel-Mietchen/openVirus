<p>In the case of the first signaling pathway, TRAF3 binds to TANK (or related peptides NAP1 and SINT-BAD), which, in turn, interact with TBK-1 and/or IKKε kinases; the activated kinases phosphorylate IFN-regulating factors 3 and 7 (IRF-3, IRF-7). In the nucleus, phosphorylated IRFs bind in the region of the IFN promoters with NF-κB and ATF-2/c-jun factors; this results in the attraction of cofactors, RNA polymerase II and initiation of interferon genes transcription.</p>
