<p>Human TLR3 is a type I transmembrane receptor with a molecular mass of 125 kDa, which has several structural domains: the extracellular or ectodomain (ECD), the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic signal domain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The structural basis for TLR3 interaction with dsRNA is the extracellular variable domain. The TLR3 ectodomain has a horseshoe shape; it contains N- and C-terminal leucine-rich repeat domains (LRR). The transmembrane domain consists of a single alpha helix. The cytoplasmic signaling domain contains a highly conserved sequence of approximately 200 residues homologous to the intracellular domain of the IL-1Î² receptor, and therefore called the Toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. This signaling domain is involved in the interaction of an activated receptor with adapter components of the intracellular signaling pathways.
