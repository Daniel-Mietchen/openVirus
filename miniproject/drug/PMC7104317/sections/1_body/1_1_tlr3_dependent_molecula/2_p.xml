<p>In the inactive state, TLR3 is a monomer, its activation occurs as a result of dimerization in response to dsRNA binding [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Crystal structure analysis of the complex consisting of two TLR3 ECD and dsRNA has shown that each ectodomain binds dsRNA molecules at two non-glycosylated sites located at opposite ends of the TLR3 horseshoe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Despite the fact that receptor ectodomain binding to dsRNA is rather weak, the dimeric complex is highly stable due to intermolecular contacts in the TLR3 ECD C-terminal domains.
