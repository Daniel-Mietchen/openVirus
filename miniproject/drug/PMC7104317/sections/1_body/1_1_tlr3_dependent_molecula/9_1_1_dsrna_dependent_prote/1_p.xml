<p>Protein kinase R is a dsRNA-dependent IFN-induced Ser/Thr protein kinase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In a non-phosphorylated state PKR is associated with ribosomes; a small part of the PKR is present in the nucleus. A key step in PKR activation is dsRNA binding to two structurally similar N-terminal motifs of the enzyme molecule, dsRBM1 and dsRBM2, followed by subsequent PKR autophosphorylation. After activation PKR phosphorylates a number of proteins, including alpha subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2); this has important consequences for the cell cycle. Phosphorylated eIF-2 binds to eIF-2B, thus causing the inhibition of the eIF-2B catalyzed reaction and protein synthesis (
