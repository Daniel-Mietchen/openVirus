<p>Experimental and clinical studies have shown that dsRNA can be used as an adjuvant to modulate and optimize the antigen-specific immune response. Evaluation of the parameters of the innate immune response after administration of PolyI:PolyC stabilized by poly L-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose (PolyICLC) to volunteers showed that the administration of the drug caused formation of immune reactions similar to those observed after immunization with yellow fever vaccine, and therefore, the drug could be used to enhance the vaccine immunogenicity [
