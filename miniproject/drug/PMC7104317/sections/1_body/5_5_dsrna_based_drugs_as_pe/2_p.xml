<p>Martins et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>] studied the effect of PolyICLC on the efficacy of vaccination of mice, guinea pigs, and primates with virus-like particles (VLP) against filovirus. Administration of PolyICLC resulted in an increase of the level of TNF-Î±, IL-6 and chemokines, activation of DC, NK, and B-cells. The drug enhanced antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response, increased production of antibodies and protection during viral infection.
