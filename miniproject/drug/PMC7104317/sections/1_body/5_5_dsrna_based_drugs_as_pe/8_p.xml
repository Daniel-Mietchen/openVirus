<p>Uchida et al. developed an original platform for improvement of mRNA vaccines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>]. It is based on the following. Eukaryotic mRNA with a polyA tail, formed as a result of mRNA processing, was hybridized with PolyU. The hybridization did not affect the efficiency of mRNA translation, and the double-stranded portion of the mRNA:PolyU had an immunostimulating effect. Activation of mouse and human dendritic cells by mRNA:PolyU was 10â€“100 times more efficient than in the case of single-stranded mRNA [

A study of immunostimulation mechanisms, performed on the HEK293 cell culture, characterized by a high level of TLR3 expression, and RAW264.7 characterized by MDA-5 and RIG-1 receptor knockout, showed that the immune response to mRNA hybridized with PolyU was mediated by TLR3 and RIG-I [
