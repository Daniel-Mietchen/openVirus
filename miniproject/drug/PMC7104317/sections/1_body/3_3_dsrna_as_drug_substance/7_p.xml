<p>In a series of studies by Vilner et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] it was shown that the antiviral activity of synthetic polyribonucleotides significantly depended on the polymer length (now it is clear, that it is determined by the specificity of receptor binding). Based on the results of biological studies, PolyA:PolyU, PolyG:PolyC, and PolyI:PolyC exhibiting the most pronounced IFN-inducing and antiviral activity were chosen for further studies.
