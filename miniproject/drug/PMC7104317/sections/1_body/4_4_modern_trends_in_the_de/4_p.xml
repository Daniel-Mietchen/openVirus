<p>Liposomes are another variant of the cationic delivery vehicle. Wong et al. showed that intranasal administration of PolyICLC, encapsulated in cationic liposomes, to mice prior to infection with a lethal dose of influenza A virus, provided a higher level of protection than the non-encapsulated drug [

For example, liposomes containing PolyI:PolyC, were prepared by incorporating Sendai virus fusogenic F protein into the lipid bilayer and targeted by a monoclonal antibody bound to the liposomes via
