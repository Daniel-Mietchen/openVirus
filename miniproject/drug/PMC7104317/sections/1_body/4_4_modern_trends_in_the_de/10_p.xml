<p>Another way to improve the therapeutic characteristics of dsRNA is the development of dosage forms indented for non-parenteral use. This is especially attractive in the case of treatment of infectious diseases, for which the mucous membranes are the “gateway of infection.” McNally et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>] demonstrated that a single intranasal administration of PolyI:PolyC to mice induced local production of Th1 chemokines in the lungs and upper respiratory tract, and generated a steady migration of T-lymphocytes into the respiratory tract. The observed effects depended on the length of dsRNA. The authors of another study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>] found that the intranasal administration of liposomes with PolyICLC before or shortly after infection of mice with H5N1 influenza virus inhibited viral replication. This resulted in a decrease in its lung titers, an increase in the level of specific humoral and cellular immune responses and survival of infected animals. In addition, liposomal PolyICLC prevented the development of pulmonary fibrosis, a serious complication of the infection.
