<p>The use of bisphosphonates, synthetic analogues of natural pyrophosphates is an interesting aspect in context of developing methods for drug delivery to bones. Bisphosphonates (BPs) are characterized by high affinity for apatite bone structures and also by antitumor activity. In order to provide an intracellular codelivery, PolyI:PolyC and the third-generation bisphosphonate zoledronic acid (ZOL), Chen et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>] obtained lipid coated calcium phosphate nanoparticles (LCP). It was shown that LCP loaded with PolyI:PolyC and ZOL exhibited significantly higher antitumor activity against B16BL6 melanoma cells than free PolyI:PolyC and ZOL preparations. Synergism of the antitumor action of PolyI:PolyC and ZOL in the LCP composition was also demonstrated in mice transplanted with B16BL6 melanoma.
