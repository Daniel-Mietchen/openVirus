<p>In recent years, transport systems based on polyethyleneimine (PEI) have been actively developed for nucleic acid delivery. PEI polyplexes provide a higher level of transfection and protection of RNA from the action of nucleases compared to other polycations. This is associated with a high density of charges on PEI, contributing to condensation of nucleic acids into more compact complexes. To reduce the toxic properties of PEI polyplexes are modified with PEG. A study of such constructs containing PolyI:PolyC and epidermal growth factor showed that high concentrations of immobilized dsRNA were accumulated in the tumor tissue and caused regression of U87MGwetEGFR glioblastoma, A431 adenocarcinoma, and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer [
