<p>In order to overcome DC dysfunction Luo et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>] developed the PMP/OVA/siRNA nanovaccine, which is a polypeptide micelle formed by poly(et-hyleneglycol)-b-poly(L-lysine)-b-poly(L-leucine) hybrid polypeptides (PEG-PLL-PLLeu) with encapsulated OVA antigen, STAT3-siRNA and PolyI:PolyC . Experiments have shown a significant (up to 200-fold) increase in the uptake of OVA antigen and siRNA by TADC after administration of the vaccine and a decrease (by more than 50%) in STAT3 expression. The PMP/OVA/siRNA vaccine increased expression of CD86 and CD40 markers and IL-12 production by DC, exerted an increase in the number of mature DCs and a decrease in the number of immunosuppressive cells in the lymph nodes, which ultimately contributed to the weakening of immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, development of antitumor immune responses and tumor regression . In other words, combination of an immunomodulator PolyI:PolyC and STAT3-siRNA with nanovaccines can be a promising strategy for increasing their therapeutic efficacy [
