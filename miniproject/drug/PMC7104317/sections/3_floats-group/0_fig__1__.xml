  <p>Induction of TLR3-dependent cell signaling pathways in response to exposure to dsRNA. Binding of extracellular dsRNA or dsRNA absorbed during endocytosis or phagocytosis to TLR3 leads to receptor phosphorylation and binding to the adapter molecule TRIF, which serves as a platform for assembly of proteins involved in triggering signaling pathways leading to activation of IRF-3 (7) or NF-κB. In the case of the NF-κB signaling pathway, activated TRIF interacts with TRAF6, after oligomerization the latter acquires ubiquitin-E3-ligase activity, causing ubiquitination of both TRAF6 and RIP1 protein. The polyubiquitin sequence is recognized by the TAK1-binding proteins TAB2 and TAB3, which promote TAK1 kinase binding to the complex. RIP1 with attached ubiquitin molecules is recognized by NEMO, resulted in IKK complex binding to the TRIF–RIP1–TRAF6–TAB–TAK1 complex. TAK1 phosphorylates the IKKb subunit of the IKK complex, promoting its activation. Phosphorylated IkB binds to ubiquitin undergoes proteasomal degradation with release of NF-κB, which migrates into the nucleus, where it binds to the IFN-β promoter. For activation of the IRF-3 (7) pathway TRAF3 binds to TANK or NAP1 and SINTBAD peptides, which, in turn, interact with TBK-1 and/or IKKε; their activated forms are able to phosphorylate IRF-3. Activation of the factor IRF-7 occurs similarly. In the nucleus, activated IRFs bind in the region of the IFN-β promoter with NF-κB and ATF-2/c-jun, resulting in the involvement of cofactors and RNA polymerase II and initiation of transcription.
