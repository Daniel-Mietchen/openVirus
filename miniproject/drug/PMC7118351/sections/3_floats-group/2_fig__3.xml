  <p>Inhibition of viral protein expression and progeny trVLP generation. (A) Western blot analysis to detect VP40. Cells were transfected and infected with trVLP with increasing concentrations of each compound. On day 2 p.i., immunoblot analysis was performed with antibodies specific for VP40 (upper), NP (middle), or β-actin (lower). -V, no transfection and no infection control. M, trVLP-infected, DMSO-treated mock control. (B) Confocal microscopy for detection of viral GP. HEK293T cells were transfected and infected with trVLP and then treated with DMSO (0.2% v/v), 100 μM RBV, or 10 μM of each hit compound (sertindole, raloxifene or ibutamoren). On day 1 p.i., cells were fixed and permeabilized to probe the viral GP with an anti-GP antibody and an Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibody (green). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). Original magnification, × 400. (C) Quantitative RT-PCR for measurement of trVLP RNA levels in the culture supernatants. HEK293T cells transfected with the plasmids mentioned above and infected with trVLP were treated with increasing concentrations of T-705, sertindole, raloxifene, or ibutamoren. On day 2 p.i., the trVLP RNA was purified from the supernatants and subjected to real-time RT-PCR with EBOV GP-specific primer sets. The experiment was performed in triplicate. Statistical significance was estimated using the DMSO-treated sample as a control. n.d., not detected. **P &lt; 0.01; ***P &lt; 0.001.</p>
