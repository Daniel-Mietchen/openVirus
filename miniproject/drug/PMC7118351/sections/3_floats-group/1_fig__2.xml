  <p>Antiviral activity of highly purified sertindole, raloxifene, and ibutamoren. HEK293T cells were applied to the trVLP system in the presence of increasing concentrations of sertindole (A), raloxifene (B) or ibutamoren (C) using RBV (D) as a control. Percentage cell viability (black circles) and percentage trVLP replication (red squares) were assessed in FLuc and RLuc assays, respectively. EC
   <sub>50</sub> and CC
   <sub>50</sub> values were calculated via non-linear regression analysis using the GraphPad Prism 6 software. The means Â± standard deviations of the EC
   <sub>50</sub>, CC
   <sub>50</sub>, and SI values are shown on the corresponding panels. These data are derived from two independent experiments in triplicate.
