<p>Among the selected hits, ibutamoren exhibited the most potent inhibitory effect against EBOV, with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.2 μM, a CC

 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The compound (also called MK-677) is an orally active agonist binding to a GPCR, the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), that is a known ghrelin receptor. This receptor increases GH levels, fat-free mass, and energy expenditure; however, due to increased cortisol levels, it has yet to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (

 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Nevertheless, the anti-EBOV activity mediated via GHSR inhibition has implications for target discovery, because GHSR acts as a hub in the GPCR network of intra- or inter-family connections (
 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The mechanism underlying its antiviral activity as well as evaluation of its efficacy against wild-type, highly pathogenic Ebola viral strains remains to be investigated. In the absence of any clinically available antiviral drug, this study informs that stimulation of GHSR represents a strategic and efficient approach for the development of a host-targeted anti-EBOV drug.
