<p>HTS was performed in 96-well plates using the transfection/infection method. Briefly, HEK293T cells (3 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> per well) were cultured overnight and transfected with a plasmid set consisting of pCAGGS-NP (8 ng), -VP35 (8 ng), -VP30 (5 ng), -L (60 ng) together with pCAGGS-Tim1 (15 ng) as well as pEGFPLuc (0.1 ng; BD Bioscience Clontech), which contains Firefly luciferase (FLuc). The next day, cells were infected with trVLPs (P0) diluted 1:10 with culture medium in the presence of each test compound (at 10 μM). On day 2 post-infection (p.i.), the cell lysates were harvested to determine the antiviral activity and cytotoxicity by measuring RLuc and FLuc levels, respectively, using a dual luciferase assay (Promega).
