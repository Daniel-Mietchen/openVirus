<p>The level of tetracistronic minigenome RNA incorporated within trVLP (P1) was measured by harvesting the culture supernatants from the samples prepared according to a previous report (
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In brief, tetracistronic trVLP RNA was purified using a QIAamp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen) on day 2 p.i. Following reverse-transcription, cDNA was applied to a touchdown PCR with an EBOV-specific primer set followed by quantitative PCR with another inner primer set using SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad) and the CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). To calculate the relative fold changes, the RNA level in the DMSO-treated, trVLP-infected culture supernatant was set at 1.
