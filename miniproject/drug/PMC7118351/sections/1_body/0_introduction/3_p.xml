<p>Several high-throughput screening (HTS) methods, including monocistronic minigenome technology and pseudotyped viral particle systems, have been developed to identify antiviral compounds against EBOV (

 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). These strategies facilitated safe and robust screening of antivirals in biosafety level 2 (BSL2) facilities without the need for the highest-level bio-containment laboratory, BSL4, in which research with live EBOV is restricted. However, these methods enable limited targeting of the viral RNA transcription/replication or entry steps by the antiviral compounds. By contrast, the transcription and replication-competent virus-like particle (trVLP) system can be used to identify antiviral compounds by targeting virtually every stage of the viral life cycle (
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Here, the tetracistronic minigenomes carrying a reporter gene and three viral genes encoding structural proteins VP40, GP and VP24, flanked by 3’-leader and 5’-trailer regions, are cloned under the T7 promoter in the negative-sense orientation. Co-transfection of this tetracistronic construct with five additional plasmids expressing viral proteins for RNA synthesis, including NP, VP30, VP35 and L, together with T7 RNA polymerase initiates transcription and replication of the minigenome and leads to generation of infectious progeny VLPs encapsulating the minigenome RNA. Eventually, trVLPs acquire the ability to infect other target cells expressing TIM-1 and the four viral proteins, NP, VP30, VP35 and L, for the second-round trVLP production. The aim of this study was to identify anti-EBOV compounds in a chemical library and to evaluate their antiviral efficacy using the trVLP system. Elucidation of the chemical structures of the resulting active compounds and the specific cellular targets provides scientific insight into the design of anti-EBOV drugs as well as their specific modes of action.
