<p>Patients with HCV infection are prone to hepatic and extra-hepatic complications after kidney transplantation. we designed the current study to understand the complications that our patient developed in the post-transplantation period. HCV infection is the leading cause of liver disease after kidney transplantation and is associated with an increase in mortality [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Chronic hepatitis and its sequelae are the main forms of liver disease in these patients. HCV-induced cirrhosis is associated with a high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma may be higher in kidney transplant recipients compared to the general population [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In our sample 14 (23%) HCV-infected patients developed clinical hepatic disease, which was in line with the literature. None had progressed to hepatocellular carcinoma.
