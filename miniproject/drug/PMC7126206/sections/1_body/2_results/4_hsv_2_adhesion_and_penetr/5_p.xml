 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D, the ultrastructure of cells were observed by SEM. VK2/E6E7 in control group were long and fusiform, with large volumes, smooth surfaces, and few pseudopods and spinous processes. By contrast, cells in the virus adhesion group were rounded, with reduced volumes, rough surfaces, and many pseudopods and spinous processes. Attached HSV-2 virions were observed on the cell surface and cell pseudopods.
