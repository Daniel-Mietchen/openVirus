<p id="p0175">Results above demonstrated that the use of temperature control techniques ensured a sufficient amount of HSV-2 infecting VK2/E6E7 during the adhesion and penetration phases. Virions remained at the adhesion and penetration stages and did not enter nuclei to begin replication under temperature control technology, and virus adhesion can result in changes in cell morphology.</p>
