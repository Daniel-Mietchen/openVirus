 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B, compared with V-24 h group, cell viability in control, V-1 s, V-30 s, V-1 min, V-2 mins, V-3 mins, and V-4 mins groups were significantly increased. There were no significant differences comparing V-5 mins, V-10 mins, and V-30 mins groups with V-24 h group, suggesting that virions could fully adhere and penetrate into host cells within 5 mins at room temperature.
