<p id="p0200">Observation of cell morphology by light microscopy and TEM indicates that JZ-1 and penciclovir could inhibit HSV-2 infection 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and reduce damage to cells, while berberine showed no such effects. The results of MTT assays also demonstrated that JZ-1 and penciclovir could significantly inhibit HSV-2 infection and improve cell viability at treatment of 24 h, consistent with the results above. Immunofluorescence expression of gD was extremely low at 6 h of infection, and increased significantly after 12 h of HSV-2 infection. Only JZ-1 showed an antiviral effect at 6 h, while penciclovir and berberine showed no such effect. However, JZ-1 and penciclovir both showed anti-HSV-2 effects 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> at 12 h, 18 h, and 24 h, and the anti-HSV-2 effect of JZ-1 was superior to that of penciclovir. The results indicate that JZ-1 may play an antiviral role during the early stages of viral infection.
