 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B, MTT assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of JZ-1 on VK2/E6E7. A significant reduction of the cell viability was observed at concentration &gt;25 mg/mL while there was no obvious cytotoxic effect of JZ-1 at concentration≤12.5 mg/mL. Also the anti-HSV-2 activity of JZ-1 was monitored by MTT test. JZ-1 showed significant cell protective activity at the concentration of 12.5 mg/mL, 6.25 mg/mL, 3.125 mg/mL, 1.5625 mg/mL, and 0.78125 mg/mL, while JZ-1 of 6.25 mg/mL showed the strongest antiviral effect among them. The concentration of JZ-1 used in followed up experiments were 6.25 mg/mL.
