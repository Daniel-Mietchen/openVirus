 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>E and F, expression of the viral proteins gD, gB, VP16, and ICP5 in JZ-1 group was significantly decreased compared with HSV-2 adhesion and penetration groups. By contrast, in penciclovir and berberine groups, expression of gD, gB, VP16, and ICP5 did not differ from HSV-2 alone group. There were no significant differences in the expression of HVEM, Nectin-2, and Nectin-1 between the HSV-2 alone group and other groups.
