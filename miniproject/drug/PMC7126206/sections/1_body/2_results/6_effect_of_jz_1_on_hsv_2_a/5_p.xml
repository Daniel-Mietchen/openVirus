 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>G, the ultrastructure of cells were observed by SEM. VK2/E6E7 in control group were long and fusiform and had large volumes, smooth surfaces, and few pseudopods and spinous processes. By contrast, cells in HSV-2 adhesion group became rounded, with decreased volumes and increased number of pseudopods and spinous processes. More virions were observed attaching to the cell surface in HSV-2 adhesion group. However, the number of attached virions in JZ-1 group was significantly lower than HSV-2 adhesion group, and cell morphology was better in JZ-1 group than in HSV-2 adhesion group. The cell morphologies and numbers of virions in penciclovir and berberine groups were not significantly different from HSV-2 adhesion group.
