<p id="p0070">Standards as dry powder (5.0–7.0 mg) and JZ-1 (1.5 mL) were placed in different volumetric flasks and dissolved in 50% methanol. The samples were sonicated for 20 min, and the resulting solution was filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane filter prior to HPLC. HPLC was performed on a UltiMate 3000 HPLC system (DIONEX Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) equipped with a DAD detector and an Outstand C18 HPLC column (250 mm × 4.6  mm, 5 μm). The mobile phase included water (A) and methanolin (B) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and a column temperature 26 °C. The detection wavelength was set at 230 nm. Twenty microliters of reference standards were injected. The gradient elution was as follows: 0–50 min (75–40% A, 25–60% B), 50–55 min (40–75% A, 60–25% B), 55–60 min (75% A, 25% B). Chromatographic data was collected and analyzed using Chromeleon software.</p>
