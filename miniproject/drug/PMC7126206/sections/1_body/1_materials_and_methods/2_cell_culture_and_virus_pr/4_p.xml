<p id="p0040">HSV-2333 strain was purchased from Guangzhou Biotest Biotechnology Development Co., Ltd (Guangdong, China). When Vero cells reached 80–90% confluency, 250 μL of HSV-2 solution, and 3 mL of DMEM containing 2% FBS were added. The cells were cultured at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 48–72 h until more than 80% of the cells were floating. The cells were subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles. After centrifugation, supernatants were removed and stored at −80 °C. Virus-containing solutions were assessed by TCID50 and MTT methods. The titers of virus stocks were about 10
 <sup>10</sup> TCID50/mL, and the survival rate of infected VK2/E6E7 was 40–60% of control group 24 h post-infection. Virus-related experiments were carried out in biosafety secondary laboratory (BSL-2).
