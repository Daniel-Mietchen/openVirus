<p id="p0110">VK2/E6E7 were grown in a 24-well plate containing aseptic slides and treated as described above. After treatment, the cells were washed three times with PBS and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution (Servicebio Technology Co., China) for 15 mins at room temperature. Fixed cells were permeabilized using 0.4% Triton X-100 (Servicebio Technology Co., China) for 30 mins and blocked with 10% goat serum (Servicebio Technology Co., China) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were incubated with primary antibody then with Alexa Fluor-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody and 4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., USA). The slides were removed, covered with another slide face down and sealed with anti-fluorescence quenching agent (Servicebio Technology Co., China). The fluorescence expression of gD of HSV-2 was observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Japan).</p>
