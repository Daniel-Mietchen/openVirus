<p id="p0270">To further explore the antagonistic effect and mechanism of JZ-1 on HSV-2 adhesion and penetration, we assessed the expression of viral envelope proteins, viral tegument protein, viral capsid protein, viral replication phase protein, and host cell receptors at the HSV-2 adhesion and penetration stages by western blot. The results showed that expression of viral envelope proteins gD and gB, viral tegument protein VP16, and viral capsid protein ICP5 in the JZ-1 group were significantly lower than the HSV-2 adhesion and penetration groups. Binding of gB to heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) on the surface of host cells can shorten the distance between HSV-2 and cells to initiate the adhesion of virus to host cells (

 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Fujimoto et al., 2019</xref>). Our results demonstrated that JZ-1 could effectively inhibit adhesion and penetration of virions into host cells by down-regulating the expression of viral envelope proteins and then reduce its binding to cell receptors. As a late gene transcripts, HSV-2 tegument protein VP16 is not only the key factor of HSV-2 lytic mode infection but also critical for the virus to be reactivated from its latent state (
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). The reduction of VP16 expression indicates that JZ-1 can not only anti-HSV-2 infection of VK2/E6E7, but also interfere with HSV-2 intracellular replication and reinfection by inhibiting the expression of replication gene mediated by VP16 and reducing the activation of latent virus. As an immediate early protein, which is required for viral replication, ICP4 is transcribed by immediate early genes, and its expression shows entry of HSV-2 into the replication cycle (
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). There was no significant expression of ICP4 in each group, since the virons only remained at the adhesion and penetration stages and had not yet undergone replication. After binding of the viral envelope protein gD to the host cell membrane receptor, the polypeptide chain structure and protein conformations changes to induce the fusion of the virus and the cell membrane, which in turn leads to the penetration of virions into host cells (
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2016b</xref>). There was no significant difference in the expression of the host cell receptors HVEM, Nectin-1, and Nectin-2 between the control group, the virus infection group and the treatment group, suggesting that viral infection and drug treatments did not alter the expression level of host cell receptors. Whether the inhibitory effect of JZ-1 on viral adhesion and penetration is exerted by changing the conformations of these receptors is worthy of further study. Expression of downstream proteins and terminal effector molecules after fusion of HSV-2 with cell membranes can also be further assessed to study the mechanism of the anti-HSV-2 effect of JZ-1 (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bright et al., 2012</xref>). At the same time, infection of HSV-2 to host cells are cross-regulated by multiple molecules and pathways. JZ-1 can exert its antiviral effect through a variety of signal transduction mechanisms, which needs to be further explored.
