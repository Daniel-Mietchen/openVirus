<p id="p0280">As one of the main component of the monarch drug of JZ-1, berberine is also one of the leading chemical constituents in JZ-1 detected by HPLC. Using alone of berberine in our experiment showed no noticeable anti-HSV-2 effect whether in the early or late stages. But the antiviral effect of berberine might be exerted by interacting with other components of JZ-1, which needs to be further explored by observing the interaction of metabolites that could interfere with viral cycle. The results of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments showed that the efficacy of berberine was not the equivalent of JZ-1 compound preparation, which also reflected the scientificity of the combination of monarch, minister, assistant, and guide drugs in TCM prescription.
