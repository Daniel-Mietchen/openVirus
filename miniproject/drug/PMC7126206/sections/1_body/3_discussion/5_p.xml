<p id="p0245">Firstly, we explored the anti-HSV-2 effects of JZ-1, penciclovir and berberine at 6 h, 12 h, 18 h, and 24 h of treatment. Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of gD expression showed that only JZ-1 had an antiviral effect at the treatment of 6 h. Since the late gene transcription products of HSV-2, including gB, gC, gD, gE, gG, and other viral structural proteins, are produced significantly 12–15 h after infection (

 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Su et al., 2017</xref>), the gD observed in host cells at 6 h of infection was mostly derived from the original virons that infected the cells, suggesting that JZ-1 plays a vital role in the early stages of viral infection. Both penciclovir and JZ-1 showed apparent antiviral effects at the treatment of 12 h, 18 h, and 24 h according to immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of gD expression, suggesting that with the extension time of HSV-2 infection, penciclovir, which acts on the replication stage of HSV-2, shows antiviral efficacy. Morphological observations and analysis of cell survival after 24 h of infection showed that cell survival rate and cell morphology (including refractive index, cell adherent state, intercellular space, and intercellular junctions) in the JZ-1 and penciclovir groups were superior to those of HSV-2 alone group. Morphological observation and virions count by TEM confirmed the anti-HSV-2 effects of JZ-1 and penciclovir

Cells in the HSV-2 alone group became significantly rounded and showed evidence of nucleus pyknosis, chromatin concentration, mitochondrial swelling, endoplasmic reticulum expansion, and other organelle damage. The morphology of cells in JZ-1 and penciclovir groups was similar to the control group, suggesting that JZ-1 can not only improve cell survival but also maintain the normal function of cells by protecting their organelles. As a nucleoside antiviral drug, the anti-HSV-2 mechanism of penciclovir is competitive inhibition of the HSV-2 polymerase, thus selectively inhibiting synthesis and replication of viral DNA (

The antiviral effect of JZ-1 was superior to penciclovir at the treatment of 12 h, 18 h, and 24 h, indicating that the antiviral effect of JZ-1 is not only exerted in the early stage of infection, but also might in the replication stage.
