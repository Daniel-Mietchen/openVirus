<p id="p0015">HSV-2 infection is a sequential process involving the interaction of multiple viral proteins with host cell molecules. Among more than ten glycosylated proteins in the viral envelope, only five glycoproteins (gB, gC, gD, and heterodimeric gH/gL) play an essential role in membrane fusion (
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Sepúlveda-Crespo et al., 2017</xref>). After contacting between HSV-2 and host cells, gD binds to specific receptors (HVEM, Nectin-1, Nectin-2, or 3-O-sulfated heparan sulfate) and sequentially recruits gB and gH/gL heterodimers. It results in activation of gH/gL heterodimers, which in turn upregulates the fusion activity of gB, allowing it to be inserted directly into cell membranes through its internal fusion loop to anchor virions to host cells (

 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Nozawa et al., 2004</xref>). After the viral genome entering the nucleus, the viral tegument protein VP16 interacts with the host cell transcription factor Oct-1, activating the host cell RNA polymerase complex (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kato et al., 2000</xref>) which in turn mediates immediate early viral gene transcription and expression of the immediate early proteins (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Akhrameyeva et al., 2011</xref>). Expression of immediate early genes including R
 <sub>L</sub>2, R
 <sub>S</sub>1, U
 <sub>L</sub>54, U
 <sub>S</sub>1, and U
 <sub>S</sub>12, which are in turn translated to ICP0, ICP4, ICP27, ICP22, and ICP47, generally peaks around 2–4 h after infection (
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Halford et al., 2001</xref>). The immediate early proteins are the primary activators of early viral genes, and their transcription products are required for viral replication (
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Schaffer, 1987</xref>). Expression of early genes, such as the viral DNA polymerase, ssDNA-binding protein ICP8, and viral thymidine kinase, peaks around 5–7 h after infection (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Costa et al., 1997</xref>). Expression of late gene transcripts include viral structural proteins such as gB, gC, gD, gK, VP16, VP5, and vhs peaks around 12–15 h after infection (
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Sampath and Deluca, 2008</xref>). The nucleocapsid is comprised of mature structural proteins and forms an envelope surrounding viral DNA to enable exit from the nucleus. Then nucleocapsid is further processed in the cytoplasm to form progeny virions that are released into the extracellular space (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Desai and Kulkarni, 2015</xref>). Based on the basic biology of HSV-2 infection, anti-HSV-2 drugs can inhibit different targets. Most commonly-used anti-HSV-2 drugs act at the viral gene replication stage and have single action site. These drugs easily elicit resistance (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hopkins et al., 2018</xref>), and have little impact on latent and recurrent viral infection (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Akhrameyeva et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, the development of drugs acting at the adhesion, penetration, release, and intercellular infection stages of HSV-2 has become an important research goal.
