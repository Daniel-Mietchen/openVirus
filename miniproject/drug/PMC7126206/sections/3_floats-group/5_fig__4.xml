  <p>Anti-HSV-2 effect of JZ-1 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> after 24 h of incubation. (A) Effects of different concentrations of JZ-1 on cell viability of VK2/E6E7 after 24 h of incubation by MTT assay. (B) Antiviral effects of different concentrations of JZ-1 against HSV-2 infection by MTT assay. (C) Effect of JZ-1 on morphology and viability of HSV-2 infected VK2/E6E7 ( × 100). (D) Effect of JZ-1 on immunofluorescence expression of gD in HSV-2 infected VK2/E6E7 ( × 400). (E) Ultrastructural observation of JZ-1 intervention on HSV-2 infection of VK2/E6E7. VK2/E6E7, HSV-2 solution, and drugs (or medium) were co-incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. C stands for control group, V stands for model group, JZ sands for different concentrations of JZ-1 group, JV sands for JZ-1 treatment group, PV stands for penciclovir treatment group, BV stands for berberine treatment group. Data are expressed as mean±SEM for n = 6. **
