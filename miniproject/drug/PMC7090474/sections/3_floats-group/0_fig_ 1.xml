  <p>Possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-mediated inflammatory responses. Based on previous studies of SARS-CoV, we separate the inflammatory responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection into primary and secondary responses. Primary inflammatory responses occur early after viral infection, prior to the appearance of neutralizing antibodies (NAb). These responses are mainly driven by active viral replication, viral-mediated ACE2 downregulation and shedding, and host anti-viral responses. Secondary inflammatory responses begin with the generation of adaptive immunity and NAb. The virus-NAb complex can also trigger FcR-mediated inflammatory responses and acute lung injury.</p>
