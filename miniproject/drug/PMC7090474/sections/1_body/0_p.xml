<p id="Par2">The newly emerging coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), causes fatal acute respiratory disease (ARD) resembling that of SARS-CoV (Chen

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>). The pathophysiology for SARS-CoV-2 has not been well studied, but likely resembles that of SARS-CoV; the acute lung injury caused by SARS-CoV infection mainly results from aggressive inflammation initiated by viral replication (Wong 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2004</xref>). Similar to SARS-CoV infection, SARS-CoV-2 infection also causes increased secretion of IL-1β, IFN-γ, IP-10, MCP-1, IL-4, and IL-10 (Huang 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>). In addition, compared with non-ICU (intensive care unit) patients, ICU patients with severe disease had higher plasma levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, GCSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF-α, suggesting a possible cytokine storm associated with disease severity (Huang 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>). Nevertheless, the causes of these exuberant inflammatory responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection remain largely unknown. In this review, we attempt to discuss and summarize possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-mediated inflammatory responses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In addition, given that uncontrolled pulmonary inflammation is likely a leading cause of fatality in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we also attempt to speculate possible therapeutic interventions that may be applied to attenuate inflammatory responses in order to reduce mortality (Fig.
