<p id="Par10">Given that most patients can survive primary inflammatory responses, we mainly focus on discussing secondary inflammatory responses that frequently lead to fatality. There are several potential therapeutic approaches that may be applied or developed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These approaches focus primarily on blocking FcR receptor to prevent virus-NAb complex binding to FcR to trigger inflammatory responses (Nimmerjahn and Ravetch 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">c</xref>). First, FcR can be blocked by specific antibodies to inhibit its activation. Small-molecule inhibitors can also be developed to interact with the Ig-binding domains of FcR to block FcR activation. Second, the inhibitory FcR, FcγRIIB, may also be targeted to inhibit FcR activation. Several FcγRIIB specific antibodies are now being developed for potential use as novel immune suppressors (van Mirre

 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2007</xref>). Third, FcR activation can also be inhibited by targeting the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is essential for extending the half-life of IgG. Antibody or small molecule-mediated blockage of FcRn can prevent IgG interaction with FcRn, which can decrease circulating IgG levels (Nimmerjahn and Ravetch 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2008b</xref>). In addition, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) can be used to saturate the IgG recycling capacity of FcRn and proportionately reduce the levels of antiviral NAb. IVIG can also competitively block the binding of antiviral NAb to other FcRs (Kurlander and Hall
