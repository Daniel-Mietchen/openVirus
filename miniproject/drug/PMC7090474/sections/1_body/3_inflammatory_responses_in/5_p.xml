<p id="Par9">Given that there are very few mechanistic studies on inflammatory responses in SARS-CoV infection, we focus only on discussing limited mechanisms that might be involved. For the convenience of further discussion of potential therapeutics, here we separate SARS-CoV-mediated inflammatory responses into two different stages (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>): the primary response and the secondary response. Primary inflammatory responses occur early after viral infection, prior to the appearance of neutralizing antibodies (NAb). These responses are mainly driven by active viral replication, viral-mediated ACE2 downregulation and shedding, and host antiviral responses, which can lead to increased cytokine/chemokine production and cellular damage through apoptosis and/or pyroptosis. Most patients can tolerate primary inflammatory responses with a positive outcome of viral load reduction or even viral clearance, followed by receding of inflammation. Secondary inflammatory responses begin with the generation of adaptive immunity and the appearance of NAb that further diminish viral replication. However, as described above, the appearance of NAb can also trigger FcR-mediated inflammatory responses and cause severe lung injury. In SARS-CoV infected patients, the appearance of antiviral IgG coincides with the onset of acute respiratory disease in 80% of patients (Peiris
