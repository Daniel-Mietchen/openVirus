<p id="Par5">Antiviral neutralizing antibodies play an important role in viral clearance. However, previous studies in animal models have shown that in SARS-CoV infection, such anti-S protein-neutralizing antibodies (anti-S-IgG) can also cause severe lung injury by altering inflammatory responses (Liu 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2019</xref>). In SARS-CoV/macaque models, it has been found that S-IgG present in infected lungs can facilitate severe lung injury; in these SARS-CoV S protein-vaccinated Chinese macaques, acute lung injury was more pronounced than in unvaccinated control animals that showed only minor to moderate lung inflammation (Liu 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2019</xref>). Consistent with this observation, adoptive transfer of purified anti-S-IgG-neutralizing antibody (i.v. injection) to macaques, despite the fact that it reduced viral loads following subsequent challenge with SARS-CoV
 <sub>PUMC</sub>, led to acute diffuse alveolar damage in all infected animals, whereas in the control group (injected with non-specific IgG), only minor to moderate inflammation in the lungs was observed (Liu 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2019</xref>). This animal study suggests that despite viral suppression, the presence of anti-spike protein antibody at the acute stage of SARS-CoV infection can actually cause severe acute lung injury that persists until the late stages. Similar observations of SARS-CoV vaccine-induced pulmonary injury have also been reported in multiple animal models using mice and African green monkeys (Bolles
