<p id="Par7">The mechanisms of the anti-S neutralizing antibody-induced inflammation and lung injury remain only partially understood. It has been proposed that the presence of S-IgG prior to viral clearance alters the functional polarization of alveolar macrophages in acutely infected macaques. Anti-S-IgG can promote proinflammatory monocyte/macrophage accumulation and the production of MCP-1 and IL-8 in the lungs. Such anti-S-IgG-initiated proinflammatory responses appear to be mediated through the binding of the virus-anti-S-IgG complex to the Fc receptors (FcR) present on monocytes/macrophages, as FcR blockade reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines (Liu

It is also possible that such a virus-anti-S-IgG complex may additionally activate the classical pathway of the complement system, leading to cellular damages, although this has not been investigated. Alternatively, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) may also be involved.
