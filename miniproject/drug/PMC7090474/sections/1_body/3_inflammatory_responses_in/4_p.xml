<p id="Par8">A major question in SARS-CoV-induced pulmonary disease is why a small percentage of patients, particularly those who produce neutralizing antibody early, experience persistent inflammation, ARD, and eventually succumb, while other patients survive the inflammatory responses and clear the virus. We speculate that a possible underlying mechanism may be related to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infection that occurs in some patients with early, sub-optimal antibody activity that cannot completely clear the virus, but instead leads to persistent viral replication and inflammation (Fig.
