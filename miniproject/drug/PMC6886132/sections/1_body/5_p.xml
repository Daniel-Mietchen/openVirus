<p>Among the drugs that have received attention for host response treatment are statins and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). During the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone in 2014, combination treatment with these two drugs apparently led to “remarkable improvement” in the patient survival
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. These drugs have multiple beneficial effects on the host response, including the restoration of endothelial barrier integrity, a central abnormality in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury

 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. They also accelerate the return of mitochondrial biogenesis, affect T-cell and macrophage polarization and modify the 'cytokine storm'

 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Their potential effectiveness in treating human influenza has been suggested by the activity of an experimental drug that specifically restored endothelial barrier integrity in a mouse model of influenza
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. In this study, drug treatment significantly improved survival without affecting virus replication, whereas antiviral treatment alone was ineffective. Other investigators have shown that not only do statins and ARBs restore endothelial barrier integrity, they reduce virus replication

 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Other generic drug combinations might also be used to treat the host response to influenza
