<p>Not everyone infected with influenza virus dies. In the 1918 pandemic, approximately one-third of the human population was infected but a much smaller proportion died. Moreover, pandemic mortality was much higher in young adults than in children. Thus, for each individual, the host response seems to be a central determinant of disease severity
