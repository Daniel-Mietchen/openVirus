<p>This past year, we commemorated the 100
 <sup>th</sup> anniversary of the 1918 influenza pandemic, which is estimated to have killed 50-100 million people worldwide
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Its impact in India was especially severe; 10-20 million people may have died

 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Since 1997, influenza scientists and public health officials have been concerned about a potential pandemic caused by the highly virulent avian influenza A(H5N1) virus
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. More recently, concern has been shifted to the H7N9 virus. In one study of 1241 hospitalized H7N9 patients in China, 70 per cent were treated with antiviral agents, but the overall case fatality rate was still 40 per cent
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. A recent study has estimated that during the next pandemic, almost 33 million people will die during the first six months
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Thus, regardless of which new influenza virus emerges, the risk of a devastating global pandemic is alarmingly real.
