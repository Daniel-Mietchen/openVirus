<p>In the absence of interest on the part of the usual authorities, people everywhere need to ask 'who is responsible for global pandemic preparedness?' Should we depend on a 'top down' process in which a small group of elite scientists and health officials decide which interventions to study in the hope that one or more of them might affect the course of the next global pandemic? Should these elites be allowed to exclude from consideration an alternative 'bottom up' approach to patient care that is scientifically plausible, eminently practical and could have an immense impact on global health, equity and security? The answer to this question is obvious. If treatment with inexpensive and widely available generic drugs could be convincingly shown to work, patients in any country with a basic healthcare system could be treated on the first pandemic day. It follows that in the absence of support for this idea, clinicians might have to undertake studies on their own to show that treating the host response is effective
