<p id="p0060">Recently, Wang and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) evaluated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> five FDA-approved drugs and two broad spectrum antivirals against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. One of their conclusions was that "chloroquine (is) highly effective in the control of 2019-nCoV infection 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>" and that its "safety track record suggests that it should be assessed in human patients suffering from the novel coronavirus disease". At least 16 different trials for SARS-CoV-2 already registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000029939, ChiCTR2000029935, ChiCTR2000029899, ChiCTR2000029898, ChiCTR2000029868, ChiCTR2000029837, ChiCTR2000029826, ChiCTR2000029803, ChiCTR2000029762, ChiCTR2000029761, ChiCTR2000029760, ChiCTR2000029741, ChiCTR2000029740, ChiCTR2000029609, ChiCTR2000029559, ChiCTR2000029542) propose to use chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 ("Chinese Clinical Trial Register" (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">ChiCTR</xref>)). In a recent publication (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2020</xref>), Gao and colleagues indicate that, "according to the news briefing", "results from more than 100 patients have demonstrated that chloroquine phosphate is superior to the control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promoting a virus negative conversion, and shortening the disease course".
