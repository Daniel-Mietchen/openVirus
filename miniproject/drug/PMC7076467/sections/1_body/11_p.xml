<p>Teleanu et al.â€™s review regards in general the use of nanotechnologies to obtain formulations suitable for nose-to-brain delivery [
 <xref rid="B9-pharmaceutics-12-00138" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is reported an overview of nanotechnology approaches for crossing the blood-brain barrier that involve different kinds of nanoparticles: polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, dendrimers, micelles, gold nanoparticles, silica nanoparticles, and carbon nanotubes. The authors put in evidence that nanotechnology-based approaches are intensively studied at the moment to overcome BBB and deliver the appropriate amount of drug to the specific brain site.
