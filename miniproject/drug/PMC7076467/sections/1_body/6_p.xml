<p>Rassu et al. described the preparation of chitosan nanoparticles loaded with Genistein, an isoflavonoid phytoestrogen that presents antioxidant and neuroprotective activities, but also characterized by low water solubility, rapid metabolism and consequent poor oral bioavailability that limit its clinical application [
 <xref rid="B4-pharmaceutics-12-00138" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Drug loaded chitosan nanoparticles were prepared by the ionic gelation method, with optimization of different parameters. The prepared nanoparticles were in vitro characterized, showing that particles of about 75 nm were obtained, with small polydispersity index and very high drug loading efficiency (96%). Ex-vivo permeability tests of drug loaded nanoparticles was carried out using swine nasal mucosa compared to a drug suspension in phosphate buffer pH 6.5. Cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles was tested on PC12 cells, as neuronal model cells. These tests showed that nanoparticles are able to promote drug diffusion through the nasal mucosa and do not show significant changes in terms of cell viability and apoptotic events on PC12 cells.
