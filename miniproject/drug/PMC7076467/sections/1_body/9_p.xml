<p>The review-section includes seven papers. These reviews include the more recent developments in the area of nose-to-brain delivery, relevant literature is present in their references, they add new contributions in the area. Musumeci et al. wrote an interesting review regarding the use of polymeric nanoparticles for the nose-to-brain delivery in the therapy of epilepsy [
 <xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-12-00138" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Epilepsy is one of the most common global neurological diseases. Its therapy is chronic and usually consists in oral or intravenous administrations of antiepileptic drugs which present some limits, connected to problems of low-bioavailability, side-effects, first-pass metabolism. The nose-to-brain drug delivery can be, therefore, an important way to overcome these problems. In the first part of the review the pathophysiological characteristics of epilepsy, the diagnostic/therapeutic problems are clearly described and the main antiepileptic drugs are reviewed with their limits. There is also a comprehensive overview of the “state-of-the-art” in the field of drug formulation for nose-to-brain delivery, putting in evidence the importance of the so-called “3N” rule: nasal route, nanomedicine, and neurotherapy.
