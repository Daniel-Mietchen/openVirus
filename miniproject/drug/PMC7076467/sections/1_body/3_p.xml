<p>The research section includes five papers. Bonferoni et al. proposed a chitosan salt of chitosan and oleic acid, chitosan oleate, as amphiphilic polymer to obtain polymeric nano-micelles loaded with geraniol, an acyclic monoterpene [
 <xref rid="B1-pharmaceutics-12-00138" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Geraniol is abundant in essential oils extracted from aromatic plants and it has anticancer and neuroprotective properties. The nano-emulsions were in vitro characterized: the formulation based on 2% (w/w) of chitosan oleate showed viscosity values compatible with oral and nasal administrations to rats, and mean diameter of the dispersed phase of about 800 nm. The results of in vivo tests carried out on rats showed that the oral administration of this formulation induced not only a great increase of geraniol bioavailability, but also an enhancement of its aptitude to target the CNS from the bloodstream in comparison to formulations constituted by coarse geraniol emulsion. Moreover, appreciable geraniol amounts were detected in the CNS following the nasal administration of relatively low doses of the chitosan oleate emulsion of geraniol.
