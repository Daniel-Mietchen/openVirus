<p id="Par1">In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), broke out in the Chinese province of Wuhan and rapidly infected hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. Infected patients mostly exhibit general signs of pneumonia (fever, dyspnea, coughing and desaturation) and a presumably significant number of infected patients are asymptomatic. Yet, about 5â€“10% of patients develop critical oxygen deprivation, needing intensive care and intubation with mechanical ventilation (Huang et al.
