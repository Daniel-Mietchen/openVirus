<p>In time-course infection experiments, cells grown on glass-bottom dishes (Cellvis formerly 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> Scientific, Mountain View, CA, United States) were chilled on ice and washed with cold PBS. A549 cells were infected with PR8 virus at an MOI of 1 and synchronized at 4Â°C for 1 h. The cells were then washed three times with cold PBS, and the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 48 h post-transfection. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in PBS, and incubated with antibodies against influenza virus proteins. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor488 goat anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor594 goat anti-mouse and DAPI for 1 h.
