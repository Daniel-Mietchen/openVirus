<p>Influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus (PR8) was provided by the virus collection center at Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China. The Madin–Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC CCL-34) and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Gibco, Invitrogen). The Human Pulmonary Epithelial (A549) cells (ATCC CCL-185) were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium 1640 (RPMI1640; Gibco, Invitrogen). Both DMEM and RPMI1640 were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Invitrogen), and 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 U/ml streptomycin. All these cells were maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator.
