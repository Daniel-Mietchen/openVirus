<p>Madin–Darby Canine Kidney or A549 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured for 24 h at 37°C. Then the cells were treated with anthralin serially diluted with fresh medium and incubated at 37°C for 72 h. Compound toxicity was determined by AlamarBlue
 <sup>®</sup> Assay (Invitrogen). Three independent experiments were performed in duplicate for the calculation of 50% cell cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) using Prism v.6 software.
