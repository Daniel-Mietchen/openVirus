<p>HEK293T cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmid pGL6-vRdRp-lucwhich containing vRdRp response elements and Renilla control plasmid pRL-SV40-N using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States). At 48 h after co-transfection, HEK293T cells were lysed and Luciferase activity was analyzed by the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay Kit (Beyotime Biotechnology) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol.</p>
