<p>This experiment was conducted as described (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Pflug et al., 2014</xref>). We used fluorescence labeling instead of isotope labeling. We have separated synthesized vRNA, which was an equimolar mixture of nucleotides 1–15 from the 5′ end (5′-AGUAGAAACAAGGCC-3′) and nucleotides 1–18 from the 3′ end (3′-UCGUCUUCGUCUCCAUAU-5′). 0.5 μM vRdRp or PA, 0.5 μM vRNA and 0.5 μM capped RNA were incubated in the reaction buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> and 2 mM TCEP) at 37°C, and 30 min later, the dilution series of anthralin were added to the experimental group and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The samples were analyzed on a 20% acrylamide, 7 M urea denaturing gel.
