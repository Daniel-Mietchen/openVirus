<p>The influenza virus RdRp cannot synthesize the capped RNA required for transcription initiation. It captures the cap synthesized by the host RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) for initiating transcription of the virus genome (

The phosphorylation state of the CTD of RNAPII consisting of tandemly repeated heptapeptides of consensus Tyr1–Ser2–Pro3–Thr4–Ser5–Pro6–Ser7 is required for the spatial and temporal recruitment of various factors are involved in the transcriptional cycle (

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Zaborowska et al., 2016</xref>). Among the residues in the heptapeptides, the phosphorylation of CTD at Ser2 and Ser5 is involved in the whole process of cap structure synthesis. Different phosphorylation states mark the stage of transcription so that specific cell protein sets can be recruited as needed. The Ser5P CTD modification which is most commonly close to the transcriptional initiation site and still exists with a low abundance can be recognized by cellular mechanisms needed in the preliminary stage of RANPII transcription, such as mRNA capping enzyme (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">McCracken et al., 1997</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Harlen et al., 2016</xref>). Influenza virus RdRp can interact directly with RANPII by binding to the CTD with the Ser5P modification. Our results show that anthralin does not inhibit the CTD phosphorylation at Ser2 and Ser5, therefore is unlikely to block the transcriptional initiation of host RNAPII. Then, we studied the effects of anthralin on the functions of viral RdRp.
