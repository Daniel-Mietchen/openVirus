<p>The use of small molecules to affect multiple functions of viral polymerase is beneficial to the development of new antiviral drugs. Our results suggest that anthralin has the potential to be a new anti-influenza drug through a chemical modification to improve its efficacy and to lower its toxicity, and provide a new strategy for the development of novel anti-influenza drugs by targeting dual function of influenza virus polymerase that associated with multiple functions in cap-snatch during viral RNA transcription.</p>
