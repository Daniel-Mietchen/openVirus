<p>Previously, we identified anthralin as an active antiviral agent against influenza virus by screening an FDA approved drug library using MDCK cells. Anthralin (

To further study the mechanism of action of anthralin on influenza viruses, we tested further the effect of anthralin in the production of infectious influenza viruses in MDCK and A549 cells. The results showed that the virus titers were significantly reduced concentration-dependently upon anthralin treatment, resulted in a 99% reduction at 12.5 μM and more than 99.99% reduction at 50 μM in both cell lines (
