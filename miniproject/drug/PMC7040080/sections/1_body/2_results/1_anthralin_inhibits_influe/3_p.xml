<p>Therefore, these results suggested that anthralin can efficiently inhibit the replication of influenza virus 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, by lowering the virus titers, decreasing the pathological effects mediated by the inflammatory infiltration of the lungs and protect mice against lethal influenza A virus infection. Taken together, we confirmed that anthralin inhibits influenza virus replication 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>.
