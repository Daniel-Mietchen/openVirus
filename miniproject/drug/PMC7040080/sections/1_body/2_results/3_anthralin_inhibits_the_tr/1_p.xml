<p>During virus RNA replication, the segmented negative-stranded genomic RNAs of influenza virus serve as templates and are transcribed into mRNAs in the nucleus, and then transported through the nuclear pore into the cytoplasm for translation. Afterward, cRNAs and vRNAs are synthesized and are assembled with newly translated viral proteins to form viral RNP, which is stable without being degraded (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Te Velthuis and Fodor, 2016</xref>). To investigate whether anthralin inhibits the down-stream event of the mid-stage of viral lifecycle, we checked the translation of virus proteins using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). As can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, the NP levels are decreased upon anthralin treatment concentration-dependently in both MDCK and A549 cells. For evaluation of the global effect of anthralin on the expression of IAV proteins, the A549 cells were infected with PR8 at an MOI of 1 at 4°C followed by incubation with or without anthralin at 37°C, and then cells were harvested at 3, 5, and 7 hpi for detection of viral proteins. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, at 3 hpi, only PA and NP were detected, anthralin treatment did not reduce the virus proteins levels of PA or NP, that were from the infected virions. However, at 5 hpi, the viral proteins of PB1, PB2, PA, and NP were all expressed and their levels were significantly reduced upon anthralin treatment. At 7 hpi, all viral proteins accumulated to high levels in the untreated cells, while there is virtually no protein expressed upon anthralin treatment except residual PA that was from the originally infected virions. The reason that other viral proteins were not detected may contribute to the lower efficiency of antibodies of other viral proteins. However, the host protein GAPDH was not affected all the time, suggesting that the anthralin mediated reduction in viral protein levels is not due to cytotoxic effect. Instead, anthralin reduced the levels of viral protein.
