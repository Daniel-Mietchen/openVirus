<p>As anthralin can affect both IAV RNA synthesis and protein expression, we speculate that the assembly and release of infectious virions can be blocked as well. To test our hypothesis, we observed the production of virions in the infected A549 cells using electron microscope. Our results showed that anthralin treatment dramatically reduced the formation and release of virions (
