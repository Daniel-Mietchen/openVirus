<p>To investigate which stage of influenza replication is inhibited by anthralin treatment, we monitored the expression and localization of virus NP and HA on the influenza virus infected cells that were treated by anthralin for different times or untreated by confocal fluorescence microscopy analysis. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> in A549 cells synchronously infected by PR8 virus, the internalization of the virus was not affected until 3 hpi. Anthralin treatment for 6 h resulted in reduced expression of NP and HA in A549. However, the nucleus import of NP is not affected. Treatment after virus infection by anthralin for 9 h eliminated the expression of NP and HA in A549 cells. There were virtually no NP or HA visible in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that anthralin acts on the mid-stage of the influenza virus life cycle when the virus is replicating its genomic RNA (
