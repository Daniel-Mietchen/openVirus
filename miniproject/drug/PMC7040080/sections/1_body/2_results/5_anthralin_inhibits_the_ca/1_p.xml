<p>Since virus transcription relies on the binding of vRNA and capped RNA with vRdRp (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Cianci et al., 1995</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 1998</xref>), we next examined the effects of anthralin on the binding of vRdRp with vRNA and capped RNA, respectively. We found that anthralin inhibited specifically the binding of capped RNA, but not vRNA with viral RdRp (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A,B</xref>). Next, we detected the effects of anthralin on the virus endonuclease activity. We found that anthralin inhibited efficiently and concentration-dependently the cleavage of capped RNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Consistent with this, the expressed PA subunit alone has endonuclease function

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). In summary, anthralin inhibits the transcription of influenza virus vRNA by inhibiting the cap-binding and endonuclease activities of the viral polymerase and does not directly interfere with the transcription elongation and replication activity of vRdRp. These findings support that the vRdRp is a promising target for antiviral drugs against influenza, which is especially true for the multifunctional vRdRp inhibitors.
