<p>Anthralin (also known as dithranol), is a synthetic version of a natural compound found in goa powder from the araroba tree. This medication is used for the treatment of long-term psoriasis by decreasing the number of DNA-synthesizing cells in the psoriatic epidermis and the keratinization process, but this decrease is not explicit in other cells and conditions (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Roch et al. (2015)</xref> reported that Endo-1, an analog of anthralin, has a potent antiviral effect by inhibiting the endonuclease activity of influenza virus polymerase. In this study, we tested the antiviral activity in mice model and found that anthralin reduces the weight loss, lung injury, and mortality caused by lethal IAV infection. The mechanism of action study suggests that anthralin acts on the RNA replication stage of the virus life cycle, which includes the transcription of viral mRNAs and the replication of viral RNAs. To further define the targets of anthralin, we investigated the functions of viral and host factors associated with virus RNA transcription and replication. We found that anthralin prevents the PB2 from binding to the capped RNAs and the cleavage of capped RNAs mediated by the endonuclease activity of PA. Taken together, we demonstrated that anthralin has the potential to serve as a new type of influenza virus RdRp inhibitor with inhibitory effects on both cap-binding and endonuclease activities.
