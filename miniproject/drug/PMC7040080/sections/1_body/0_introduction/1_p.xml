<p>Influenza A viruses (IAV) are enveloped viruses of the family 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> that cause contagious respiratory diseases and substantial morbidity and mortality (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Palese, 2007</xref>). Since the IAV genome is composed of segmented RNAs, which makes it more susceptible to antigenic drift and shift, more strains have undergone resistance mutations against traditional antiviral treatment (

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Krammer et al., 2018</xref>). As the risk of influenza pandemic continues to increase, it becomes increasingly important to understand the interactions between drug candidates and targets. We urgently need to develop new antiviral strategies to improve therapeutic effectiveness, especially in the case of severe diseases, and are less vulnerable to antiviral resistance (
