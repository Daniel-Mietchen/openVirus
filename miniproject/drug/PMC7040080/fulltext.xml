The viral polymerases process the capped RNAs to produce short capped RNA fragments that are used as primers to initiate the transcription of viral mRNAs. This process, known as cap-snatching, can be targeted by antiviral therapeutics. Here, anthralin was identified as an inhibitor against influenza a virus (IAV) infection by targeting the cap-snatching activity of the viral polymerase. Anthralin, an FDA-approved drug used in the treatment of psoriasis, shows antiviral activity against IAV infection <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Importantly, anthralin significantly reduces weight loss, lung injury, and mortality caused by IAV infection in mice. The mechanism of action study revealed that anthralin inhibits the cap-binding function of PB2 subunit and endonuclease activity of PA. As a result, viral mRNA transcription is blocked, leading to the decreases in viral RNA replication and viral protein expression. In conclusion, anthralin has been demonstrated to have the potential of an alternative antiviral against influenza virus infection. Also, targeting the captive pocket structure that includes the N-terminus of PA endonuclease domain and the C-terminal of PB2 cap-binding domain of IAV RdRp may be an excellent strategy for developing anti-influenza drugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>influenza</kwd><kwd>cap snatching</kwd><kwd>vRdRp</kwd><kwd>anthralin</kwd><kwd>cap-binding</kwd><kwd>endonuclease</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="47"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza A viruses (IAV) are enveloped viruses of the family <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> that cause contagious respiratory diseases and substantial morbidity and mortality (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Palese, 2007</xref>). Since the IAV genome is composed of segmented RNAs, which makes it more susceptible to antigenic drift and shift, more strains have undergone resistance mutations against traditional antiviral treatment (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Palese, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Krammer et al., 2018</xref>). As the risk of influenza pandemic continues to increase, it becomes increasingly important to understand the interactions between drug candidates and targets. We urgently need to develop new antiviral strategies to improve therapeutic effectiveness, especially in the case of severe diseases, and are less vulnerable to antiviral resistance (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Loregian et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Currently, three classes of antiviral drugs were approved by the FDA for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">De Clercq, 2006</xref>). The M2 inhibitors, amantadine and rimantadine blocks the activity of M2 proteins that are ion channels, thereby preventing the viral genomic fragments from entering the cytoplasm (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Pinto and Lamb, 2007</xref>). The prevalence of viruses resistant to these drugs has been growing around the world, greatly undermining effectiveness of drugs. All currently circulating IAV strains are resistant to M2 inhibitors, so these drugs are no longer recommended for flu treatment (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Shiraishi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bright et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Garten et al., 2009</xref>). The second class of influenza drugs is neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI), including oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir. NA inhibitors preventing the release of the progeny virus particles through binding to the NA and obstructing its enzymatic activity. Since oseltamivir does not inhibit influenza virus replication, it is not effective in inhibiting the inflammation caused by the virus replication, leading to a poor prognosis. A rapid rise in oseltamivir resistance was detected amongst seasonal A/H1N1 isolates before the 2009 pandemic (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Renaud et al., 2011</xref>). The third class of anti-influenza drugs is RNA polymerase inhibitors. Favipiravir (T-705), a new drug currently in the clinical trial, acts as a purine analog, inhibits multiple RNA viruses by targeting viral polymerase. But it increases uric acid, causes digestive system diseases and has reproductive toxicity (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Furuta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Sangawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Furuta et al., 2017</xref>). Compared with NAI, viral RNA polymerase inhibitors have higher tolerance and longer treatment time, so they may be more effective. The most recently approved drug for influenza virus polymerase is baloxavir marboxil (trade name Xofluza). It is a medication that has been developed by Shionogi, a Japanese pharmaceutical company, for the treatment of influenza A and influenza B. The drug prevents the proliferation of influenza virus by inhibiting the endonuclease activity of the PA subunit (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Omoto et al., 2018</xref>). However, according to the clinical results, compared with treatment in adults, baloxavir showed weak therapeutic effect in the susceptible population that includes children, adolescents and the elderly, which cannot shorten the course of the disease (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Hayden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kakuya et al., 2019</xref>). The specific amino acid substitution at the PA active endonuclease site (I38T/F) could decrease the sensitivity of the variant virus strain to baloxavir by 11 to 57 times. In the third phase of the trial, 9.7% of the baloxavir-treated patients were found with the variant virus with I38T/M/F replacement in PA decreased the susceptibility to baloxavir, sometimes related to the rebound of virus titer and the continuous prolongation of symptoms (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Hayden et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, new efforts need to be made to discover and develop new flu drugs with improved properties. Adverse reactions, such as hematochezia, after taking baloxavir have been reported (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Kanai et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, the synthesis of viral mRNA, cRNA, and vRNA is the central event and crucial for influenza virus life cycle. Both host factors and virus polymerase are involved in this process, during which, cap-binding, endonuclease, and vRdRp activity, are attractive targets for small molecule inhibitors. In fact, the viral polymerase of influenza virus is the target for several novel anti-influenza candidates under active clinical development (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">McKimm-Breschkin et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Anthralin (also known as dithranol), is a synthetic version of a natural compound found in goa powder from the araroba tree. This medication is used for the treatment of long-term psoriasis by decreasing the number of DNA-synthesizing cells in the psoriatic epidermis and the keratinization process, but this decrease is not explicit in other cells and conditions (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Liden and Lesson, 1974</xref>). Previously, anthralin was identified in our lab to inhibit the replication of a broad spectrum of influenza viruses in both MDCK and A549 cells (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">An et al., 2014</xref>). In 2015, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Roch et al. (2015)</xref> reported that Endo-1, an analog of anthralin, has a potent antiviral effect by inhibiting the endonuclease activity of influenza virus polymerase. In this study, we tested the antiviral activity in mice model and found that anthralin reduces the weight loss, lung injury, and mortality caused by lethal IAV infection. The mechanism of action study suggests that anthralin acts on the RNA replication stage of the virus life cycle, which includes the transcription of viral mRNAs and the replication of viral RNAs. To further define the targets of anthralin, we investigated the functions of viral and host factors associated with virus RNA transcription and replication. We found that anthralin prevents the PB2 from binding to the capped RNAs and the cleavage of capped RNAs mediated by the endonuclease activity of PA. Taken together, we demonstrated that anthralin has the potential to serve as a new type of influenza virus RdRp inhibitor with inhibitory effects on both cap-binding and endonuclease activities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>Virus and Cells</title><p>Influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus (PR8) was provided by the virus collection center at Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China.

Treatment after virus infection by anthralin for 9 h eliminated the expression of NP and HA in A549 cells. There were virtually no NP or HA visible in the cytoplasm.

However, at 5 hpi, the viral proteins of PB1, PB2, PA, and NP were all expressed and their levels were significantly reduced upon anthralin treatment. At 7 hpi, all viral proteins accumulated to high levels in the untreated cells, while there is virtually no protein expressed upon anthralin treatment except residual PA that was from the originally infected virions. The reason that other viral proteins were not detected may contribute to the lower efficiency of antibodies of other viral proteins.

Whereas, the phosphorylation of Ser2 and Ser5 on CTD of RNAPII was not affected by anthralin treatment at all, suggesting that anthralin does not interfere with the activity of host RNAPII. To further understand the transcription and translational processes that are affected by anthralin, we transfected HEK293T cells with the plasmids expressing the pPOLI-Fluc reporter gene under the control of the RNP complex of PR8. The ratios of Fluc to Rluc activity were reduced concentration-dependently upon anthralin treatment, demonstrating that anthralin decreased Fluc activity through inhibiting the vRdRp mediated transcription of pPOLI-Fluc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>In the process of cap-snatching, the viral polymerase PB2 captures the 5&#x02032;-cap of nascent host capped RNAs, and the PA cleaves the capped RNA 10&#x02013;14 nucleotides downstream of the cap structure (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Koppstein et al., 2015</xref>). The processed cap-containing RNA fragments are then used as primers to initiate transcription of viral mRNAs. Next, the co-localization of influenza virus polymerase complexes and RNAPII in cells that infected with IAV and treated with anthralin for 3, 5, and 7 h were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, at 3 hpi, the host RNAPII localized predominantly in the nucleus, while virus polymerase localized mostly in the cytoplasm. There is a very limited co-localization that may be non-specific random co-localization. During 5&#x02013;7 hpi, the virus gene transcription and RNA replication are highly efficient and close to complete, host RNAPII and virus polymerase co-localize very well in the nucleus. However, the co-localization of host RNAPII and virus polymerase is completely blocked upon anthralin treatment.

It controls skin growth by reducing the synthesis of DNA and the mitotic activity in the hyperplastic epidermis, normalizing the rate of cell proliferation and keratinization. There is no current evidence of any long-term anthralin toxicity related either to skin exposure or to systemic issues. In this study, we demonstrated that anthralin inhibits the replication of influenza virus in a mouse model on lowering the virus titers, lung injury, and death rate in mice with lethal IAV infections.</p><p>To study the mechanism of action of anthralin against the influenza virus, we performed many assays, including adsorption, entry, nuclear import, and export of RNP, virion production, to assess multiple events in the virus life cycle on which anthralin may affect. We found that anthralin inhibits virus replication in the middle stage of the IAV life cycle, which involves the transcription and replication of the influenza virus genome. Next, we made great efforts to understand the antiviral mechanism of anthralin on RNA replication functions of IAV. Interestingly, in addition to identifying the target of anthralin, our results clarified the timing of transcription and replication of IAV RNA. We found that the reference drug ribavirin inhibits the replication of cRNA and vRNA but not the transcription of viral RNA that have been detected 7 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).

So, we focused the mechanism study on the effect of anthralin on the transcription functions of viral RdRp.</p><p>The influenza virus RdRp cannot synthesize the capped RNA required for transcription initiation. It captures the cap synthesized by the host RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) for initiating transcription of the virus genome (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Plotch et al., 1981</xref>). In eukaryotes, RNAPII is used for transcription of mRNAs, snRNAs, snoRNAs, and some micro RNAs (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Steinmetz et al., 2006</xref>).

Among the residues in the heptapeptides, the phosphorylation of CTD at Ser2 and Ser5 is involved in the whole process of cap structure synthesis. Different phosphorylation states mark the stage of transcription so that specific cell protein sets can be recruited as needed. The Ser5P CTD modification which is most commonly close to the transcriptional initiation site and still exists with a low abundance can be recognized by cellular mechanisms needed in the preliminary stage of RANPII transcription, such as mRNA capping enzyme (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">McCracken et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Harlen et al., 2016</xref>). Influenza virus RdRp can interact directly with RANPII by binding to the CTD with the Ser5P modification. Our results show that anthralin does not inhibit the CTD phosphorylation at Ser2 and Ser5, therefore is unlikely to block the transcriptional initiation of host RNAPII. Then, we studied the effects of anthralin on the functions of viral RdRp.</p><p>The influenza virus RdRp is composed of the subunits PB1, PB2, and PA (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Te Velthuis and Fodor, 2016</xref>). PB1, the N terminus of PB2 (PB2-N), and the C-terminal domain of PA (PA-C) form the core of the polymerase (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Te Velthuis, 2019</xref>). They are responsible for interacting with the terminal ends of viral promoters and for catalyzing the nucleotidyl transfer reaction. The core also binds the Ser5-phosphorylated CTD (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lukarska et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2018</xref>). Influenza RdRp binds to m<sup>7</sup>G on nascent host RNAs through a cap-binding domain on the vRdRp C terminus of PB2 (PB2-C) subunit (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Fechter et al., 2003</xref>). Then the host RNA at 10&#x02013;14 nt downstream of the 5&#x02032; cap is cleaved by the endonuclease domain at PA-N of vRdRp and form 1- to 3- base pair interactions with the 3&#x02032; terminus of the viral genome segment, depending on the sequence of the primer (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Dias et al., 2009</xref>). This biological process is called &#x0201c;cap-snatching.&#x0201d; The vRdRp displays cap-snatch activity only when bound by vRNA promoter that is formed by the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; terminal sequences of the vRNA segment (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Fodor et al., 1994</xref>). Therefore, in order to exclude the effect of vRNA binding on subsequent cap-snatch, which includes cap-binding and cleavage of capped RNA, a vRNA binding assay and a cap-binding assay were performed. Anthralin showed specific inhibition on cap-binding, but not vRNA binding. In addition, anthralin was proved to inhibit the endonuclease activity of vRdRp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A&#x02013;D</xref>).</p><p>The use of small molecules to affect multiple functions of viral polymerase is beneficial to the development of new antiviral drugs. Our results suggest that anthralin has the potential to be a new anti-influenza drug through a chemical modification to improve its efficacy and to lower its toxicity, and provide a new strategy for the development of novel anti-influenza drugs by targeting dual function of influenza virus polymerase that associated with multiple functions in cap-snatch during viral RNA transcription.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>All datasets generated for this study are included in the article/<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Material</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The animal study was reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>XC and AH conceived and designed the experiments and contributed to the writing of the manuscript.
