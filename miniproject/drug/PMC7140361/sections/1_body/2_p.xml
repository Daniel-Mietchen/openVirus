<p id="Par3">First, why and in whom does high load HSV replication detected in mechanically ventilated patients and should be considered as a causative pathogen? Bruynseels et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] found that 22% of ICU patients had HSV in the throat. HSV recovery from lower respiratory tract (LRT) samples of invasive ventilated patients is probably viral contamination from the upper respiratory tract, as endotracheal intubation, sputum aspiration, and other invasive operations. Furthermore, as the author mentioned [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], HSV reactivation could also present as bronchopneumonitis, which was not a typical VAP that can be recognized by radiological findings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, all patients with invasive mechanical ventilation and not only VAP patients should be treated as a population at high risk of hospital-acquired HSV infection in LRT and should be evaluated.
