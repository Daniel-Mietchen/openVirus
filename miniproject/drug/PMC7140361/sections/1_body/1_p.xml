<p id="Par2">We read with interest of the article by Lukas Schuierer and colleagues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] about that in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), antibiotic treatment failure, and high levels of herpes simplex virus (HSV) replication, treatment with acyclovir was associated with longer time to death and improved circulatory and respiratory function. Therefore, they suggested a causative role for high load HSV in the group of patients with antibiotics resistant VAP and an acyclovir therapy in this highly selected patient group. From our point of view, some details about HSV replication in ICU patients with mechanical ventilation (MV) need to be further clarified.
