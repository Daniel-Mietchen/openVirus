<p>The U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has long-standing relationships with Ministries of Health, WHO, Institut Pasteur and the U.S. Department of Defense. We approached these institutions to identify key in-country influenza experts in Africa who could answer the survey. In addition, La Réunion, a French territory in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar, was asked to participate. Since La Réunion is not a country, their data were excluded from the country analyses and are presented separately. This study was considered to be an evaluation of existing public health programs and not considered to be public health research.</p>
