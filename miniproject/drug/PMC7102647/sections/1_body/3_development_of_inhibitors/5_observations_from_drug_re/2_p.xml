<p id="p0190">The two-electrode voltage clamp assay remains the most effective assay for M2 ion channel studies, as it is less technically demanding and more likely to be replicated across independent laboratory groups when compared to SEVC. In general, there is a liner correlation between the percentage channel blockage from TEVC and the antiviral activity (
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>). However, we also note that the efficacies of certain M2 inhibitors as measured by TEVC and PRA can be discordant. For example, for compounds 
 <bold>4</bold>, 
 <bold>7</bold>, 
 <bold>9</bold>, 
 <bold>12</bold>, and 
 <bold>15</bold>, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values detected by TEVC are substantially higher than EC
 <sub>50</sub> values by PRA. In contrast, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values detected for compounds 
 <bold>13</bold>, 
 <bold>24</bold>, and 
 <bold>25</bold> by TEVC are lower than their PRA EC
 <sub>50</sub> values. Discrepancies in both cases might arise from different binding kinetics of various M2 channel blockers (
 <xref rid="bib144" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values from TEVC or SEVC measurements are normally plotted using percentage inhibition at a given time point after compound perfusion, therefore the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values may not accurately reflect the true binding potency of the compounds. Instead, kinetic measurements of the 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> values are a more stringent way to determine the true binding potency of M2 channel blockers. However, kinetic measurements are labor intense and are often reserved as a secondary assay to characterize lead candidates that have already shown potent antiviral activity such as compound 
 <bold>16</bold>. Nevertheless, it is understandable that the lack of a straight linear correlation between the results from the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> TEVC or SEVC assay and the cellular CPE or PRA assay might also be additionally due to other factors such as a compound's membrane permeability, virus strain differences, or other off-target effects. However, this is not a specific issue related to M2 channel blockers per se, as other drug candidates commonly face this challenge as well. In some cases, discordance also extends to M2 proteins and viruses containing different mutations. For example, compound 
 <bold>9</bold> inhibits M2 Val27Ala with lower IC
 <sub>50</sub>s than M2 WT (0.3 and 18 μM, respectively), while the EC
 <sub>50</sub>s in PRA are the opposite (i.e. 1.8 and 0.3 μM, respectively). Similar results are also seen for compounds 
 <bold>7</bold>, 
 <bold>10</bold>, and 
 <bold>20</bold> and could reflect, for example, differences in virus strains used and/or subtle changes in the binding kinetics of these compounds against different M2 forms. Thus, as with other drug development efforts, interpretation of specific results for individual compounds must be performed carefully and on a case-by-case basis.
