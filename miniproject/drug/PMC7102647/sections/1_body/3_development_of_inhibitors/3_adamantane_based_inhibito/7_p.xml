<p id="p0155">In further M2 resistance studies, Compound

 <xref rid="bib144" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) Serial passaging of virus in the presence of increasing concentrations of 
 <bold>16</bold> resulted in a novel and unexpected drug-resistance mutation, Leu46Pro, positioned at the distal end of the M2 transmembrane helix. Interestingly, Leu46Pro did not significantly change proton conductance or amantadine sensitivity on its own in WT M2. However, in the presence of Ser31Asn, the Leu46Pro mutation rendered compounds 
 <bold>14–16</bold> ineffective in TEVC experiments. Through molecular modelling and molecular dynamics simulations, the authors proposed that Leu46Pro, despite being located outside of the canonical M2 binding sites of adamantanes, could affect the size of the M2 pore where compounds 
 <bold>14–16</bold> were proposed to interact (
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Musharrafieh et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that when compared to amantadine and WT M2, the genetic barrier for drug resistance is likely to be higher for adamantane-derived compounds that target M2 Ser31Asn, at least
