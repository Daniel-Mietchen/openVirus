 <xref rid="bib139" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2011a)</xref> also reported design of a spirane-adamantane derivative (
 <bold>9</bold>; 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>C) that inhibited WT (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 18 μM), Leu26Phe (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6 μM), and Val27Ala (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.3 μM) forms of M2, as measured by TEVC, which in turn were comparable to amantadine's activity against WT channel in this study (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 15.7 μM). Additionally, based on their previous findings in identifying a dual inhibitor of WT and Val27Ala M2 (
 <bold>10</bold>), 
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al. (2017b)</xref> designed and reported the first class of organosilanes that exhibited potent antiviral activity against amantadine-resistant and oseltamivir-resistant viruses. Their most potent organosilane (
 <bold>11</bold>) was able to inhibit M2 Ser31Asn currents in TEVC experiments by ~86% at 100 μM and inhibited an A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus encoding M2 Ser31Asn with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.4 μM (

 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Barniol-Xicota et al. (2017)</xref> also reported a series of dual M2 WT and Val27Ala inhibitors. However, while both compounds 
 <bold>12</bold> and 
 <bold>13</bold> were potent inhibitors of both the WT M2 and M2 Val27Ala, with IC
 <sub>50</sub>s ranging from 1.9 to 16.2 μM by TEVC, only 
 <bold>12</bold> exhibited any antiviral activity (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.14 μM; 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Barniol-Xicota et al., 2017</xref>), while 
 <bold>13</bold> also exhibited toxicity in MDCK cells (50% cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) = 10 μM). The authors proposed that the antiviral activity of these dual inhibitors is highly dependent on “slow and steady” binding of inhibitors, where a k
 <sub>d</sub> of 10
 <sup>−6</sup> or less is needed to be observed by TEVC.
