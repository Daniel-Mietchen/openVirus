<p id="p0150">The Wang group have also reported results from 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> passaging of two M2-S31N inhibitors 
 <bold>14</bold> and 
 <bold>15</bold>, which potently inhibited both M2 current activity by TEVC (75.5 and 84.3% at 100 μM) and adamantane-resistant viruses (EC
 <sub>50</sub>s = 1.2 and 0.3 μM, respectively;

 <xref rid="bib144" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Musharrafieh et al., 2018</xref>). Remarkably, unlike amantadine, which readily gave rise to resistance after a single passage 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, compounds 
 <bold>14</bold> and 
 <bold>15</bold> required 4–5 passages before two resistance mutations (Val27Ile and Leu26Ile respectively) were detected 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting a higher genetic barrier to resistance. Interestingly, reversion of M2 back to Ser31 was not observed. Further passaging of Ser31Asn + Leu26Ile virus with 
 <bold>15</bold> at higher concentrations selected for a third Ala30Thr. Notably, while both M2 and viruses containing Ser31Asn + Val27Ile or Leu26Ile exhibited similar proton conductance properties and viral replication fitness relative to the single Ser31Asn mutant, the addition of Ala30Thr to Ser31Asn and Leu26Ile resulted in substantially reduced M2 proton conductance and viral replication. These observations may suggest that the viable evolutionary space of M2 in response to selection with these compounds may be limited.
