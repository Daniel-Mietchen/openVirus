 <sub>50</sub> values of 18, 8.6, and 0.7 μM, respectively (
 <xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr">Rey-Carrizo et al., 2014</xref>). Unfortunately, the cytotoxicity of these derivatives may impede their further development as therapeutic agents. In an independent attempt to change the shape and bulk of the adamantane cage, 
 <xref rid="bib149" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. (2012)</xref> reported the discovery of pinanamine derivatives as inhibitors of M2 Ser31Asn. Specifically, an imidazole derivative of pinanamine (
 <bold>19</bold>) showed a moderate inhibitory effect against A/WSN/33 (H1N1) in a cytopathic effect inhibition assay (CPE; EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 95.5 μM). 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al. (2016)</xref> subsequently reported a related compound (
 <bold>20</bold>) with improved activity against both WT A/HK/68 (H3N2) as well as A/WSN/33 (H1N1) encoding M2 Ser31Asn with EC
 <sub>50</sub>s of 2.5 and 3.4 μM, respectively. In a separate endeavor, derivatives of spiranamine (
 <bold>21</bold>) were also explored (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Balannik et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib139" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2011a</xref>). For example, a silaspirane derivative (
 <bold>22</bold>) exhibits activity against both WT and Val27Ala with 95% and 68% inhibition at 100 μM in TEVC experiments. (
