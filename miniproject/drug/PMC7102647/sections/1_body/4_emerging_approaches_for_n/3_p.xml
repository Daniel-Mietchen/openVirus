<p id="p0200">To enable high-throughput screening of M2 inhibitors with ready availability to more research groups, 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> yeast strains have also been developed which are induced to express WT or adamantane-resistant M2 proteins in the presence of galactose. In these assays, M2 expression inhibits yeast growth, as measured by culture turbidity, which in turn is restored by administration of M2 inhibitors. As shown by 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Balgi and Roberge (2009)</xref>, amantadine restored the growth of yeast expressing WT M2 from 27% of control to 95% at 1 μM. This assay was further optimized for high throughput screening: for example, the authors subsequently screened ~250,000 compounds and identified 21 new and potent inhibitors of WT M2 (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Balgi et al., 2013</xref>). These reports demonstrate that growth restoration assays are a sensitive, economical and technically simple technique for high throughput screening for inhibitors of M2 and presumably other viroporins. A similar expression system using 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> has also been used to assess the properties of random M2 mutations (
