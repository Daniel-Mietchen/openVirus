<p id="p0215">To overcome these challenges, computation now plays a critical role in the field of rational drug design, as computers now have sufficient processing power to run virtual screening of large chemical libraries against multiple targets. While these strategies can identify multiple antiviral leads including putative viroporin inhibitors (

 <xref rid="bib130" ref-type="bibr">Tietjen et al., 2015</xref>), the likelihood of false-positive hits necessitates their validation by experimental techniques. Another role of computation is now the extended ability to run complex molecular dynamics simulations in shorter times and for larger complexes to predict and visualize the interaction of viral protein domains and putative inhibitors, complexes of proteins, and simulation of complexes of viral proteins and cellular factors.
