<p id="p0035">Recent advances in molecular and structural biology, electrophysiology, and virology have produced crucial information about the basis of M2-based drug resistance. This in turn has shed light on novel drug development strategies and transitioning of those ideas to practical tools. Here we review the current state of IAV M2 viroporin research and ongoing efforts to identify and develop new antivirals against its drug-resistant forms.</p>
