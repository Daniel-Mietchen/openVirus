 <xref rid="bib115" ref-type="bibr">Stouffer et al. (2008)</xref> suggested that amantadine binds in a pocket located inside the intraluminal cavity and surrounded by the nonpolar side chains of Val27, Ala30, the C
 <sub>β</sub> group of Ser31, and the C
 <sub>α</sub> group of Gly34 (

In this pore binding model, the authors proposed that amantadine, by entering the lumen of the channel, “plugs” the M2 pore and thus prevents the transport of protons. The model further suggests that Ser31Asn confers adamantane resistance by decreasing the pore size and occluding stable access of amantadine to the pore (
