<p id="p0090">In a separate series of studies, an alternative but initially controversial binding mechanism for adamantanes, located external to the M2 pore, was also proposed (

In this binding mechanism, perturbation of the extra-luminal drug binding pocket as a result of Ser31Asn mutation rendered rimantadine incapable of effectively binding to the allosteric site (
