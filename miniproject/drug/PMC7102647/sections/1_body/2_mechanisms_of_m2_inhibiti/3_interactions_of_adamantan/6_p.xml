 <xref rid="bib139" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2011a)</xref> also mapped the drug binding site at the N-terminal lumen of A/M2 near Val27. Recent high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of M2 in complex with adamantanes and other M2 channel blockers published by DeGrado lab also unambiguously recognized the intra-luminal binding site (
