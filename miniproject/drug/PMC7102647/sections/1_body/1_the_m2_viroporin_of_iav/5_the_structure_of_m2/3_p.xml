<p id="p0070">While the mechanisms of proton shuttling that enable conduction remain incompletely understood, it is likely that experimental conditions such as pH, peptide length, lipid/detergent composition and thickness, and binding of small molecules affect the fundamental properties of M2 (

 <xref rid="bib112" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>). Although both studies support a “proton-relay” model of conduction, they differ with regard to the side-chain conformation of His37. The study by 
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al. (2010)</xref> proposes a tightly-packed His37 tetrad which undergoes numerous reorientations and side chain rotations to relay protons. In contrast, the model by 
 <xref rid="bib112" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al. (2010)</xref> suggests three distinct states for the His-Trp quartet: the ‘‘histidine-locked state’’, the ‘‘activated state’’, and the ‘‘conducting state’’, with transition between these states allowing for proton conductance. In this model, the “histidine locked state” exists when a proton is shared between two adjacent histidine residues (HisH
 <sup>+</sup>-His) and the channel is locked in the non-conducting state. They further described the activation cascade at low extracellular pH, when a single hydronium ion approaches the non-protonated histidine in the HisH
 <sup>+</sup>-His dimer, breaks this ionic bond, and transitions the channel to the “activated state”, resulting in the formation of stable cation-p interactions between His37 and Trp41. The Trp41 tetrad forms a gate at the C-terminal end, and the perturbation of this cation-p interaction leads to conformational changes which in turn transition the quartet to the “conduction state”. Here, protons are then donated to water molecules and relayed to the intracellular side (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="bib112" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2010</xref> ). The transition between these three steps requires small changes of the χ
 <sub>2</sub> angles of the His37 and Trp41 side chains. This contrasts with the model by 
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al. (2010)</xref>, where considerable reorientation of His37 and Trp41 residues are required to allow proton passage. Further experimental and theoretical data supporting both models are described in detail elsewhere (
