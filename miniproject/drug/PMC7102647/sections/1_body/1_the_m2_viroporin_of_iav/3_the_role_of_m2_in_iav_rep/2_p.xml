<p id="p0045">The M2 protein of IAV is arguably the best understood viroporin. It consists of a 97 amino acid, type I transmembrane domain-containing protein which forms a tetrameric ion channel that is both proton-gated and proton-selective (

 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Nieto-Torres et al., 2015</xref>). M2 is a multifunctional, modular protein where each segment performs one or more distinct function(s) (
 <xref rid="bib141" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2011c</xref>). Following viral entry, M2 expressed on the virion membrane transports protons from host cell endosomes to acidify the virion interior (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). This low pH environment facilitates conformational changes in viral hemagglutinin (HA) and dissociation of viral ribonucleoprotein complex from M1 proteins to promote virion membrane fusion and release of viral RNA into the host cell. M2 proton gating function is, however, not required per se to convert HA into the membrane fusion competent state (

 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Gutman et al., 1993</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Martin and Heleniust, 1991</xref>). During viral egress, M2 also equilibrates the pH of trans-Golgi lumina and the cytoplasm, which may delay trafficking of virion particles and/or prevent HA from inappropriately adopting a low pH conformation (

 <xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">Pinto and Lamb, 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib117" ref-type="bibr">Sugrue et al., 1990</xref>). Compared to other influenza proteins, the sequence of M2 is highly conserved but has been shown to co-evolve with HA (
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Grambas et al., 1992</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib105" ref-type="bibr">Rossman and Lamb, 2011</xref>). As such, M2's conductance rate closely correlates with HA's fusogenic propensity, where increased proton conductance by M2 correlates with more acid labile HA sequences (
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Grambas et al., 1992</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib110" ref-type="bibr">Scholtissek et al., 1998</xref>). M2 has also been found to localize at the virus budding site on the host cell surface, where the amphipathic helix of M2 alters membrane curvature leading to membrane scission and release of new viral progeny (
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib105" ref-type="bibr">Rossman and Lamb, 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib106" ref-type="bibr">Rossman et al., 2010</xref>). Although protons are the preferred substrate, M2 can also act as a Na
 <sup>+</sup> and K
 <sup>+</sup> antiporter (
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Leiding et al., 2010</xref>). In particular, the ability of M2 to pass bulkier K
 <sup>+</sup> ions becomes physiologically relevant in the endocytic pathway, where high Na
 <sup>+</sup> concentration in early endosome clusters is replaced by K
 <sup>+</sup> to allow for the subsequent release of the viral ribonucleoprotein bundle (
