<p id="p0060">Notably, a highly-conserved sequence of His37-XXX-Trp41 within the C-terminal end of the M2 transmembrane domain is regarded as the functional core of proton conductance (

Another key residue, Ser31, is likely to face the pore interior, and its mutation to hydrophobic residues such as Ala negatively affects pore hydration, resulting in diminished conduction. At the other end of the His-Trp quartet, mutating Asp44 to hydrophobic residues such as Ala affects proton exit at the C-terminal end of the channel by increasing the energy barrier (
