<p id="p0055">Subsequent mutagenesis studies have further defined the specific M2 amino acid residues that are required for proton conduction and regulation (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> ). Notably, a fragment of M2 encompassing the transmembrane domain and spanning as little as amino acids 21â€“51 was observed by TEVC to be sufficient to produce amantadine-sensitive, proton-dependent proton currents (

To a first approximation, transmembrane mutations that are predicted to increase the pore radius (i.e., mutation to residues with smaller side chains) result in increased proton conduction, presumably either through the enhanced formation of water wires or transfer by His37 through conformational changes, while mutations to residues with bulkier side chains that reduce the pore radius also reduce conductance. For example, the introduction of Ala at Val27, which faces the extracellular and intraluminal surfaces and is thought to form the most constricted part of the channel, increases the pore entrance size and obliterates the N-terminal gating mechanism, thereby allowing for easier pore hydration and enhanced conduction (

In contrast, introduction of bulky and/or hydrophobic residues such as Phe or Trp at Val27 results in non- or low-conducting M2 proteins. Similarly, mutations that reduce pore size at other locations including Ala30Trp, Ala30Pro, and Gly34Glu also slow the rate of proton conduction and frequently result in loss-of-function (
