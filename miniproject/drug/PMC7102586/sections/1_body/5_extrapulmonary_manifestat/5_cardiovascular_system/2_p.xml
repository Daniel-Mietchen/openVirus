<p id="p0095">Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease are among the highest risk individuals for severe COVID-19 disease and death [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Cardiac troponin Ilevels are significantly increased in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to those with milder forms of disease [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This may be similar to what is observed in many patients with acute respiratory illnesses; or it may indicate myocardial injury because of the virus as ACE-2 receptors are widely expressed on cardiomyocytes. American College of Cardiology recommends measuring troponin if the diagnosis of acute MI is being considered on clinical grounds and an abnormal troponin should not be considered evidence for an acute MI without corroborating evidence [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Similarly, patients with COVID-19 infection have elevated natriuretic peptides, significance of which is uncertain. Hence an elevated level of natriuretic peptides in COVID-19 should not be taken as an indicator of heart failure.
