 <italic>In vitro</italic> activity of chloroquine (CQ) has been demonstrated against several viruses including Vesicular Stomatitis virus [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], Mouse Hepatitis virus, Nipah virus, Ebola virus, Influenza virus, and more recently, SARS coronavirus [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, except for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus, these effects have not been replicated in clinical studies in humans. CQ did not prevent influenza infection in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Further, there was no effect on patients with dengue infection in a randomized controlled trial [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Of concern was the observation that despite having antiviral activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, CQ increased viral replication and exacerbated fever in animal models of chikungunya virus infection [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Also, patients with chikungunya virus infection had more chronic arthralgia when treated with CQ 
 <italic>vs.</italic> those treated with placebo [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The reasons for this discrepancy between 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and results from clinical studies are not very clear. One possible mechanism would be the failure of the drug to concentrate in target tissues. Also 50% effective concentration [EC50] of chloroquine for anti-viral effects is about three times higher than that necessary to inhibit chloroquine-sensitive malarial parasites [
