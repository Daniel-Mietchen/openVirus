<p id="p0020">Antiviral properties of chloroquine 
 <italic>inÂ vitro</italic> have been observed for more than half a century [
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It exerts its antiviral effect by several mechanisms: reducing endocytosis of virus by stabilising the lysosomes, inhibiting the viral replication, and inducing the production of non-infectious particles by inhibition of glycosylation of the envelope glycoproteins [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Additionally, it exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the release of proinflammatory cytokines, especially tumor necrosis factor-alpha which may ameliorate the immune reaction seen with viral infections.
