<p>To determine the antiviral spectrum of these flavonoids, two additionally viral species were selected as models. PV-1 (a single strain RNA virus) and HSV-1 (a DNA virus), which diverged from HBV in the replication mechanisms. Our data show that the glycosylated flavonoids did not have an inhibitory effect against Polio nor Herpes. These observations are in concordance with previous reports for these myricetin related compounds (Lin et al., 2000[
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; Castrillo et al., 1986[
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). The methoxyflavones displayed a potent effect against Polio and these results are in agreement with previous reports of similar compounds versus this virus (Van Hoof et al., 1984[
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]; De Meyer et al., 1991[
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]). However, the effect of the methoxyflavones against HSV-1 (Figure 1
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">(Fig. 1)</xref>) was modest compared to those observed against HBV (Figure 2a
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">(Fig. 2)</xref>). Altogether, these results showed that the methoxyflavones are active against Polio, Herpes, and Hepatitis B. Additionally, as previously mentioned the methoxyflavones can inhibit influenza virus and HIV-1. These viruses do not share any replicative step thus; the broad range of antiviral activity of methoxyflavones may suggest two possible inhibitory mechanisms: a) inhibiting viral polymerases by acting as non-selective inhibitors, or b) modulating a cellular process related to the viral replication cycle. Indeed, methoxyflavones have been described as inhibitors of several cellular processes, such as the cell cycle, apoptosis, kinases pathway, NFKb/AKT pathway and others (Wudtiwai et al., 2011[
