<p>Plant-derived compounds represent a broad variety of chemical families. However, flavonoids have been the most widely studied as possible antivirals. Indeed, some of these compounds have been active against viruses such as HBV, Polio, and Herpes virus (Zhang et al., 2014[

 <italic>Marcetia genus </italic>plants are a source of flavonoids and have been barely studied. Thus, to determine the antiviral activity of the nine compounds isolated from the aerial parts of
