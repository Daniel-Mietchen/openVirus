<p>Flavonoids and related compounds can interact with polymerases, especially with the reverse transcriptase (Kuete et al., 2010[
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; Ono et al., 1990[
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]). Ortega et al. (2017[
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>][
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]) described that myricetin and methoxyflavones may act as non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). Indeed, a Reverse Transcriptase is involved in the HBV replication cycle and this enzyme has a high similarity with the HIV-1-RT. The binding of MyrG and MyrGG on the reported NNRTI binding pocket was shown by molecular docking. Moreover, the binding energy was inversely proportional to glycosylation grade (Figure 5
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">(Fig. 5)</xref> and Table 3
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T3">(Tab. 3)</xref>). The methoxyflavones showed lower binding energies compared to the glycosylated compounds. Additionally, these compounds produce more hydrogen bonds, which suggest a more stable interaction with the HBV-RT. These docking results are in concordance with the antiviral activities obtained in the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> model of HBV. Residues that consistently within 5 Ã… from docked ligands were Val87, Pro88, Asn89, Leu90, Ser92, Leu 93, Trp 103, Leu223, Ala224, Phe225, Val232, and Phe273. As shown, these results suggest the hydrophobic NNRTI pocket of HBV-RT as a potential target for new inhibitors.
