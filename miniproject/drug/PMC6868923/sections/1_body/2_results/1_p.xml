<p>The antiviral activity of the compounds isolated from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>M. taxifolia</italic> in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models of HBV, HSV-1, and PV-1 was assayed. Table 1
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T1">(Tab. 1)</xref> summarizes the results for cytotoxicity and viral inhibition for the evaluated compounds. As indicated in this table, only: myricetin rhamnoside (MyrG), myricetine-3α-O-rhamnosyl (1→6)-α-galactoside (MyrGG), 5,3'-dihydroxy-3,6,7,8,4'-pentamethoxyflavone (PMF) and 5-hydroxy-3,6,7,3',4'-pentamethoxyflavone (PMF-OH), were active against at least one of the evaluated viruses. Additionally, these compounds showed a scarce or non-cytotoxic effect.
