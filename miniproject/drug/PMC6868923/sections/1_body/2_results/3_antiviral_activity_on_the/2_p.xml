<p>Previous reports show that glycosylated flavonoids related to myricetin, as well as methoxyflavones, can inhibit the HIV-1-RT (Ortega et al., 2017[
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). Thus, the interaction of these compounds with the HBV reverse transcriptase (HBV-RT) as a potential target was evaluated 
 <italic>in silico</italic>. To date, there is no experimental crystal structure of HBV-RT available. For this reason, a homology model of the HBV-RT was constructed by using the crystal structure of HIV-1-RT as a template.
