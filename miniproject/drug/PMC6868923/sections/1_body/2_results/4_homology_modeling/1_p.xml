<p>The alignment between HBV-RT and HIV-1-RT (UniProtKB O11885 and P03366) was performed using the structural alignment tool of Swiss-PdbViewer/DeepView (Figure 3
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">(Fig. 3)</xref>). The HIV-1-RT and HBV-RT share many of the residues involved in key protein-ligand interactions (Daga et al., 2010[
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]). These include the YMDD motif and the catalytic triad of aspartic acid residues, Asp107, Asp229, Asp230. Some differences in the putative hydrophobic NNRTI-binding pocket were found. However, the insertion of 4 amino acids in the HBV enzyme was the major difference observed. Altogether, data suggest that HIV-1-RT and HBV-RT share enough structural and functional similarity to serve as a putative predictor for the interaction with RT inhibitors.
