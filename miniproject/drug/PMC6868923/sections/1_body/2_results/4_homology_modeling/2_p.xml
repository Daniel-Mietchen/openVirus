<p>A structural model of the HBV-RT using the SWISS-MODEL package was generated (Figure 4
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">(Fig. 4)</xref>). Three main subdomains in the HBV-RT structure were identified: the finger, residues 1-49 and 90-172, the palm, residues 50-89 and 173-267 and the thumb, residues 268-351. Nevertheless, differences between the models were found (Figure 4
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">(Fig. 4)</xref>). Homology comparison between HBV-RT model and HIV-1-RT template suggested a similar structural conformation with a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 2.1 Å for the Cα atoms (Table 2
