<p>The conformational differences related to the secondary structure between HIV-RT and HBV-RT were determined. The main HBV features were the elongations in 4 and 5 residues occurring in the protein loops (Figure 4 B
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">(Fig. 4)</xref>). The palm contains the polymerase active site and the non-nucleoside pocket located ~10 Ã… apart. No differences were observed around the three aspartate residues of the catalytic triad: Asp107, Asp229, and Asp230, in HBV and corresponding in HIV-1 RT to Asp110, Asp185, and Asp186.
