<p>The 3D structure of each inhibitor was obtained from the PubChem database (Kim et al., 2016[
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]) or generated by parent structure modification with VegaZZ 3.1.0.21 (Pedretti et al., 2004[
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]). The molecular docking was performed with AutoDock 4/VegaZZ 3.1.0.21 and 30 runs conducted for each compound. Sampling in a cube of 10 Ã… sides around the ligand was carried out. The results were prioritized according to the predicted free energy of binding. Then the final complexes, keeping the backbone atoms of the protein fixed and improving the mutual adaptability between ligand and enzyme were minimized.
