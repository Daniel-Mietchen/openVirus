<p>The cytotoxicity assays were determined by the MTT method (Mosmann, 1983[
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). Also, the cells were seeded in 96-wells plate at a density of 1.5 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well. The next day, different concentrations of the flavonoid compounds were added to the cells and 24 h later, the cell viability was evaluated using the MTT (ThermoFisher, USA) cell proliferation assay as previously described (Ortega et al., 2017[
