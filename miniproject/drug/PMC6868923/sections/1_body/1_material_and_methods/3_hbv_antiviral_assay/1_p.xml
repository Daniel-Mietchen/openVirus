<p>HepG2.2.15 constitutively produces HBV particles and is broadly used to evaluate the antiviral activity (Sells et al., 1988[
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]). The HBV production was quantified through a real-time PCR methodology, using as target the X gene. The sequence of specific primers was forwarded-1608-1627: ATG GAG ACC ACC GTG AAC GC and reversed-1887-1868 AGG CAC AGC TTG GTG GCT TG. The amplification product was of approximately 260 bp. Briefly, 24 h prior to the antiviral assay, the cells were seeded at a density of 1.2 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells / well for each condition. The cells were incubated with “Infection medium” (RPMI with 2 % FBS and 1 % DMSO) (Quintero et al., 2011[
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]) with and without the compounds at the described concentrations. After 72 h, the medium and the compounds were refreshed by replacing them and incubated by 72 h. The supernatant was collected and viral DNA extracted using High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit (Roche Life Science, Germany). The development of qPCR was done on Applied Biosystems 7300 by using a Sybr green commercial kit (Luna® Universal qPCR, Kit NEB Co. USA). The amplification conditions were the following: 3 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles of 15 sec. at 95 °C, 30 sec. at 61 °C and 30 sec. at 72 °C. The viral inhibition relative to control (%) was calculated. Statistical analyses of at least three independent experiments were performed.
