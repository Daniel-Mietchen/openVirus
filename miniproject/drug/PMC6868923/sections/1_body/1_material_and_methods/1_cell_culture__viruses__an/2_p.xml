<p>The 
 <italic>Marcetia taxifolia</italic> (A.St.-Hil.) DC., plant collection, verification, and compound isolation were previously described (Baptista et al., 2016[
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). The 
 <italic>Marcetia taxifolia</italic> (A.St.-Hil.) DC. (
 <italic>Melastomataceae</italic>) was collected in the Amazonanian state in Venezuela. The chemical constituents were separated through organic extraction, further isolation was developed by chromatographic techniques and the compounds were characterized using spectroscopic and spectrometric methods.
