<p id="p0110">Diet and nutrition invariably influence the immune system competence and determine the risk and severity of infections. There are bi-directional relationships among diet, nutrition, infection, and immunity. The changes in one component have an impact on the others [
 <xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The macro-, micronutrients, and phytonutrients in diet, mainly the fruits and colorful vegetables, generally promote healthy immune responses. These micro- and phytonutrients provide the antioxidants and the anti-inflammatory nutrients, including beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, and polyphenolic compounds, which modulate the immune functions [

 <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Apart from the age-related micronutrient insufficiency, as previously mentioned, the nutritional status of an individual affects the risk of SARS-CoV-II infection, the clinical course, and the outcomes of COVID-19. Therefore, the maintenance of host macro- and micronutrient status is an important preventive measure for COVID-19.
