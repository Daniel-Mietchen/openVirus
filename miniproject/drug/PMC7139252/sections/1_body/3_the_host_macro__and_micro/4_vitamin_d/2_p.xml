<p id="p0120">Several meta-analysis and systematic reviews supported the protective role of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of acute respiratory tract infection [

 <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>]. The effective supplementation needs to start before the onset of respiratory tract infection. However, there is inconclusive evidence regarding the underlying mechanisms of vitamin D deficiency and viral disease development [
 <xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The potential mechanisms include the antiviral immune induction, the modulation of immunoregulatory defense, induction of autophagy and apoptosis, and genetic or epigenetic regulation [
 <xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Furthermore, the risk of viral infections can be reduced by vitamin D. The related mechanisms comprised of stimulation of defensins and cathelicidins that can decrease the replication of virus and increase levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, as well as decreasing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that induce inflammation-related pneumonia [

Supportive data for the effective role of vitamin D in decreasing risk of COVID-19 could be highlighted by increased case-fatality rates with chronic disease comorbidity and age, in which lower concentrations of 25(OH)D have been reported. Vitamin D deficiency is globally prevalent, particularly in the elders [
 <xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Over half of the hospitalized elders and nursing home residents in the U.S. had vitamin D deficiency [
 <xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. This high prevalence probably contributes to the first outbreak COVID-19 during winter and the high mortality rate in older adults [

 <xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb9000" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>]. While the natural source of vitamin D is from sunlight exposure, some dietary sources can provide a certain amount of vitamin D, including the fortified cereals and milk. However, for people at risk of COVID-19, the goal should be to raise the concentrations of 25(OH)D above 40–60 ng/ml (100–150 nmol/l) by considering taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D
 <sub>3</sub> for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d. [
