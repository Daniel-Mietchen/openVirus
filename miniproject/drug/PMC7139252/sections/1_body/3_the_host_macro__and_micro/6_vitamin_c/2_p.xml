<p id="p0130">Vitamin C deficiency is associated with pneumonia in several pieces of literature in the early days [
 <xref rid="bb0405" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0410" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. The immune-modulating effects in respiratory infection of vitamin C are also well-documented [
 <xref rid="bb0415" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0420" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0425" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0430" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>]. Nevertheless, the supporting evidence of vitamin C supplementation in the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory diseases are inconclusive [
 <xref rid="bb0435" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0440" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0445" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0450" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>]. In alignment with the evidence of other micronutrients, the supplementation could benefit the vitamin C deficient individual but not in the healthy subjects [
 <xref rid="bb0435" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0440" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Moreover, it has been reported that megadoses administration of Vitamin C before or after the appearance of flu symptoms could prevent and relieve the flu symptoms in the test population regarding the control group [
 <xref rid="bb0415" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0430" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0455" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0460" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Based on 31 study comparisons with 9745 common cold episodes, it has been revealed that the regular supplementation of Vitamin C had a modest but consistent effect in decreasing the duration of common cold symptoms [
 <xref rid="bb0445" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0450" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Furthermore, five trials with 598 participants showed that vitamin C decreased the risk of common cold without any adverse effects [
 <xref rid="bb0465" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Vitamin C supplementation is thus the sensible option to prevent and support the immune responses in the micronutrient-deficit individual at risk for COVID-19.
