<p id="p0170">SARS-CoV -II enters the target cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2). The TMPRSS2 inhibitors block the cellular entry of the SARS-CoV-II virus through the downregulated priming of the SARS-CoV-II spike protein [

 <xref rid="bb0590" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. There is a known TMPRRSS2 inhibitor in the market, i.e., camostat mesylate. Machine learning algorithms have been used to predict the dynamics of this pathway, including Janus-associated kinase (JAK) inhibitors through baricitinib, ruxolitinib, and imatinib [
