<p id="p0035">The viral genome analysis suggested that the SARS-CoV-II was a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and a coronavirus of unknown origin [

 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. While the human transmission is presumably from the animals, it is still inconclusive whether the animal origins in the human transmission chain are from bats, snakes, or others [

 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A study from China also reported that the majority of patients (80.9%) were considered to have mild pneumonia or being asymptomatic, which posed big challenges for the spreading of COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The close contact to infected individuals, either asymptomatic or clinical COVID-19 cases, increase the risk of infection. The monitor of a cluster of COVID-19 cases in China suggested the possibility of indirect viral transmission without a history of close physical connection to the infected individuals. The viral transfer is possible through the common contaminated objects, viral aerosolization in confined space, or from the asymptomatic viral carriers [
