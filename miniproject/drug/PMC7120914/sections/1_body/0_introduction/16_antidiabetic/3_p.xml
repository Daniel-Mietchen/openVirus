<p id="Par58">The most promising terpene compound for treating diabetes is called andrographolide which is a diterpenoid lactone (Brahmachari 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>). This compound forms the major component of the leaves of the small herbaceous plant 
 <italic>. A. paniculata</italic> is an Asian plant that has already been reported to be used in traditional medicines for its therapeutic nature (Brahmachari 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>). The terpenoid acts by reducing the plasma glucose and increasing the utilization of glucose by the body in diabetes mellitus rats (Gupta et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2008</xref>). The actual mechanism by how it does this is it activates the alpha-adrenoreceptors to increase the release of an opioid peptide beta-endomorphin (Brahmachari 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>) which is reported to be secreted in low amounts in diabetic rats (Forman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1985</xref>). This increased secretion in turn activates the opioid Î¼-receptors. These receptors can effectively curb the hepatic gluconeogenesis (glucose synthesis from non-carbohydrate precursors) and elevate the utilization of glucose by muscles. Finally, this results in a reduced plasma glucose concentration (Brahmachari 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>). Andrographolide is also observed to prevent the secondary complications of diabetes such as diabetic retinopathy, a condition that will lead to blindness (Brahmachari 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>). It significantly weakens the retinal angiogenesis and inflammation during the development of the disease (Brahmachari 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>). Moreover, it can also fix the impaired or extended estrous cycle in diabetic rats (Reyes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2006</xref>). Andrographolide was orally administered in all the above studies. This indicates its efficiency for being used as a lead molecule in the future drugs designed for treating diabetes mellitus.
