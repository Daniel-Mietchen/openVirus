<p id="Par41">Terpenes have been shown to have a favorable antiplasmodial activity. With the rising malarial infections and drug resistance, terpenes have gained more attention towards it through antiplasmodial activity (Nogueira and Lopes 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2011</xref>). The interesting mechanism behind the terpene activity is that it binds to the hemin part of infected erythrocytes and kills the parasite just like the famous antimalarial drug chloroquine (Orjih et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">1981</xref>; Kayembe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2012</xref>). Hemin is made of iron which is necessary for the plasmodium development in the erythrocytes. Though hemin breaking enzymes are not yet found in plasmodium, it could be one reason why hemin binding accounts for parasite lysis (Ginsburg and Demel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1984</xref>). Another study suggests that drug-hemin complex binds to phospholipid layers thereby disrupting the respective membrane structure and causing cell lysis (Ginsburg and Demel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1984</xref>). Moreover, it is also known that hemin can affect the carbohydrate metabolism of the parasites, which could lead to lysis of parasites (Rodriguez and Jungery 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">1986</xref>). Thus, terpenes can be designed to be promising drugs for malaria.
