<p id="Par28"> Triterpenes are composed of three or six isoprene units and have the chemical formula C
 <sub>30</sub>H
 <sub>48</sub> which includes steroids and sterols with squalene being the biological precursor of all triterpenes (see footnote 1). Triterpenes are produced by animals, plants, and fungi. They play a role as precursors to steroids in animal and plant organisms, and are derived from mevalonic acid (see footnote 1). Saponins come from the skins of many plants and have emulsion like properties that make them excellent detergents in the human digestive system (see footnote 1). Chemical structures of steroid saponins are similar to hormones that are produced in the human body (see footnote 1).
