<p id="Par78">Ayurveda is a popular medicine system which originated about 3000 years ago in India. The ayurvedic medicines are based on medicinal herbs, minerals, and metals (see footnote 16) along with diet regimes such as vegetarianism (Caldecott

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2007</xref>). Interestingly a lot of medicinal plants used by Ayurvedic practitioners owe their therapeutic property to their terpene contents. One good example is turmeric, a family of ginger which is regarded as “Golden Goddess” by medical practitioners (see footnote 18).

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>). The essential oil of clove is mostly composed of eugenol, a bioactive terpene that is responsible for clove’s aroma (Alqareer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>). Eugenol by itself is said to enhance the blood circulation in the body and improve metabolism (see footnote 22). Thus, based on the above data we can conclude that various terpenes have been in use even before their discoveries by modern science, due to their amazing medicinal properties. A schematic summary of different terpenes and their medicinal uses, that we discussed, is provided below in Fig.
