<p id="Par48">The bioactive terpenes present in various plants have shown various results for antiviral property. It would therefore be important to look for various plant source rather than various monoterpenes for therapeutic purposes. Researchers are also focusing on synthesizing terpene hybrid from fungal sources as they are presumed to have antiviral and UV protective properties (Yuan et al.
