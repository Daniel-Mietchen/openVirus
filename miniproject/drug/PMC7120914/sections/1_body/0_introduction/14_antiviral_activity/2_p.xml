<p id="Par47">Of particular interest is the single main monoterpene that is contributing to the virucidal activity. This was studied by Astani et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2009</xref>) using eucalyptus, tea tree, and thyme essential oil extracts (Astani et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2009</xref>). They suggested that monoterpene hydrocarbons have a slightly higher virulent activity compared to the monoterpene alcohols against HSV-1. The monoterpenes with the highest virucidal activity were identified to be alpha-pinene and alpha-terpineol (Astani et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2009</xref>). The mechanism behind the virucidal activity was suggested to be direct inactivation of free viral particles. However, the study concluded that more than isolated single monoterpenes, a mixture of monoterpenes are more effective and possessed lesser toxicity to host cells (Astani et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2009</xref>). This was further bolstered by another study which evidenced the virucidal property of a combination of monoterpenes obtained from (Zamora et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2016</xref>). The activity was tested against a human flavivirus West Nile virus. The results were positive both in vivo and in vitro. The underlying mechanism was predicted to be induced cell cycle arrest at G0 or G1 phase. This indicates that a mixture of monoterpenes could act as a better antiviral agent rather than a single monoterpene (Zamora et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2016</xref>). Recent studies have shown that triketone-terpene adducts also exert antiviral, antimicrobial and antitumor activity (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2017</xref>). These adducts are obtained from Myrtaceae as secondary metabolites in the form of sesquiterpenes called myrtucomvalones A, B, and C. The terpene adducts successfully inhibited the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2017</xref>).
