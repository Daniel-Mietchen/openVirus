<p id="Par33">The MEP pathway , also known as the non-mevalonate pathway or methylerythritol phosphate pathway, is a metabolic pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis that creates the products isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). This pathway occurs in the chloroplasts and produce monoterpenes, specific sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, and carotenoids (Zhang et al.
