<p id="Par25">Tanshinones are a class of diterpenes that are isolated from dried roots or rhizomes of an herb in traditional Chinese medicine called also known as Danshen or Tanshen (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2012</xref>). Tanshinones were first isolated in the 1930s, and since then, more than 90 chemicals have been identified and split up into two groups: 40 lipophilic and 50 hydrophilic compounds (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2012</xref>). Tanshinones have recently been extensively researched for their anticancer properties in vitro and in vivo (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2012</xref>). Their potential use as an anticancer drug comes from their broad range of activities such as anti-proliferation and inhibiting adhesion, migration, and invasion (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2012</xref>). Analogues of tanshinone have been synthesized in many clinical trials because they have many anticancer attributes (Lee et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2015</xref>). This herb has been used in many Asian countries for preventative and therapeutic solutions to many diseases such as heart disease, vascular diseases, and arthritis (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2012</xref>). Tanshinones may also reduce inflammation and increase immune responses (Zhang et al.
