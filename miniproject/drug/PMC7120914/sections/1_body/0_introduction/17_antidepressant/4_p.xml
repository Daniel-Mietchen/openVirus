<p id="Par63">Apart from monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes also exhibit antidepressant effects. One striking example is beta-caryophyllene which was proved to ameliorate the depressive symptoms in mice (Bahi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2014</xref>). The underlying mechanism of this compound is binding to a receptor called CB2 and activating it. CB2 is found in the brain and immune cells and plays a major role in regulating depressive-related disorders (Bahi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2014</xref>). Thus beta-caryophyllene curbs depression by acting as a CB2 receptor agonist (Bahi et al.
