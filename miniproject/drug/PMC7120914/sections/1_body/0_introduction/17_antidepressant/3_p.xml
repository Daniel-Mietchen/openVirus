<p id="Par62">Among the several terpenes, linalool and beta-pinene are commonly found to be active principles (both Guzmán-Gutiérrez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2015</xref>; Guzmán-Gutiérrez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2012</xref>). They were discovered from the extracts of medicinal plants and and flowers of lavender (Appleton

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2012</xref>; Guadarrama-Cruz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2008</xref>). These monoterpenes act by interacting with the 5HT1A receptors of the serotonergic pathway. Serotonins are important in the fact that their release and re-uptake levels can be altered to overcome stress (Chaouloff 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2000</xref>; Guzmán-Gutiérrez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2012</xref>). They also interact with adrenergic receptors of the body that play a major role in stress-induced behavioral changes (Pandey et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">1995</xref>; Guzmán-Gutiérrez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2015</xref>). Another interesting finding is the interaction of beta-pinene with dopaminergic receptors namely D1 receptors. This is the mechanism followed by most of the antidepressant drugs available in the market (Guzmán-Gutiérrez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2015</xref>). A more interesting study would be to examine the beta-pinene and linalool efficiency through inhalation tests. This is because these monoterpenes are aromatic compounds that generally have an enhanced activity when inhaled as they can directly hit the central nervous system (Guzmán Gutiérrez et al.
