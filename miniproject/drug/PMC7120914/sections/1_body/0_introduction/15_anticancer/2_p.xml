<p id="Par51">Among the different kinds of terpenes, limonene is well recognized as an anticancer agent. Limonene is a bioactive food component found in citrus peels, orange peels, and several other citrus fruits (Jirtle et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1993</xref>). Studies have reported limonene to exhibit strong cancer inhibition activity both in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism behind limonene activity is still under investigation. A study by Jirtle et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1993</xref>) reported that limonene acts through induction of transforming growth factor B-1 and mannose-6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptors (Jirtle et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1993</xref>). In contrast a study by Bishayee and Rabi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2009</xref>) suggested that limonene eliminates cancer cells by induction of apoptosis (Bishayee and Rabi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2009</xref>). Structural studies on limonene reported that they are lipophilic and have the tendency to be deposited in fatty tissues when administered orally. This indicates that limonene can act as an excellent chemopreventive drug for cancer as it can be deposited in the body (Miller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2010</xref>). Another study in 2013 concluded that limonene acts by suppressing the expression of breast tumor cyclin D1 (Miller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2013</xref>). This lead to cell cycle arrest and mitigated proliferation of cancer cells in women with early stages of breast cancer (Miller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2013</xref>). Recent study showed that limonene from pinecones can kill lung cancer cells in vitro by apoptotic mechanism that is activated through caspase-3 pathway (Lee et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2017</xref>). These findings indicate a novel application of limonene towards fighting and preventing cancer. Not just limonene, but also its metabolite perillyl alcohol is also said to exhibit antitumor activity in pancreatic cell lines through apoptotic mechanisms (Sobral et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2014</xref>; Dalessio et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2014</xref>).
