<p id="Par52">Apart from limonene, the terpene thymoquinone has all been widely studied for its chemoprotective and chemotherapeutic activity. Thymoquinone is found to be an active constituent of the volatile oils of an annual herbaceous plant called (black cumin) (Majdalawieh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2017</xref>). The pathways affected by thymoquinone to exert its antitumor properties are p53, PPARγ, MAPK, NF-κB, PI3K/AKT, and STAT3 signaling pathways (Majdalawieh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2017</xref>). Thymoquinone has been proved to be anticancerous against several cancers such as breast cancer, skin cancer, non–small cell lung cancer, bile duct cancer, and brain cancer. The basic mechanisms underlying the cancer inhibition is apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (Sobral et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2014</xref>; Khader and Eckl 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2014</xref>). Most of the cancer related studies were performed using thermoquinone obtained from the 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> extracts. A 2012 study showed that thermoquinone can be obtained in larger amounts from the mint family, namely, 
 <italic>Monarda didyma</italic> and 
 <italic>Monarda media</italic> (Taborsky et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2012</xref>)
 <italic>.</italic> Thus, thermoquinone from alternative sources has to be tested for its precious potential in cancer therapy.
