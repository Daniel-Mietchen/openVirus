<p id="Par30"> Tetraterpenes are also known as carotenoids that have the molecular formula C
 <sub>40</sub>H
 <sub>56</sub> and can be in the category of terpenes because they are made from isoprene units.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn6">6</xref> Most carotenoids are highly unsaturated and for this reason, they are extremely difficult to isolate and purify (see footnote 1). They are found in all different types of fungi, bacteria, and plants and mainly responsible for red, yellow, or orange fat-soluble plant and animal pigments (see footnote 6). One of the most crucial and common tetraterpene is beta-carotene that contributes to the yellow pigment in carrots. It is important to mammals especially because it is a precursor in producing vitamin A and other important terpenoids for vision (see footnote 1).
