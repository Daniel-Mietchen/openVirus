  <p>Fluorescence-based polymerization assay using ZIKV NS5 RdRp. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Polymerization activity was recorded as the relative increase in fluorescence over 180 min in the presence of ZIKV NS5. Shown are the average values of three independent experiments. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Emission kinetics recorded during 30 min is represented as the average of five independent experiments in the presence of indicated reagents. The use of GTP or UTP as nucleotide substrate, MgCl
   <sub>2</sub> as metal donor, or catalytically-inactive mutant NS5-GNN failed to render a measurable fluorescence signal. Experiments were carried out as described in Methods.
