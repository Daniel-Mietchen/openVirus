<p id="Par2">Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging human pathogen of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, a group of single-stranded (ss) RNA enveloped viruses. Members of this family also include the human pathogens dengue virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV)

 </sup>; however, a significant proportion of infected individuals (~20%) develop neurological conditions, including Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), which is the most frequent cause of acute flaccid paralysis not associated with poliovirus in adults, and microcephaly, in newborns. An increase in the incidence of GBS and microcephaly has been associated with outbreaks of ZIKV in Micronesia (2007), French Polynesia (2013), and Brazil (2015)
