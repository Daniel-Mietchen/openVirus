<p id="Par4">Owing to substantial differences in the mechanisms of replication in RNA viruses and the host cell – RNA-templated RNA synthesis

 </sup>. While NNIs typically require no intracellular modification to elicit their inhibitory activity, as they bind directly to allosteric sites on RdRps, NAIs generally require phosphorylation by the host cell machinery to be active. Phosphorylated nucleoside analogs are thus able to bind to the RdRp active site and compete with natural NTPs for their incorporation into the nascent RNA. Despite recent significant progress, no drugs are yet licensed for the treatment of disease caused by any mosquito-borne
