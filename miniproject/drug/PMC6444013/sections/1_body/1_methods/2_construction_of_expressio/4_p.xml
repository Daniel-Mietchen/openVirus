<p id="Par10">The plasmid for the expression of HCV NS5B polymerase was prepared using the Gibson assembly method as described above. Briefly, the pET28a vector backbone was amplified by PCR using primers pET28a_Fw and pET28a_rv (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). An insert containing the HCV polymerase sequence was obtained by PCR amplification of plasmid Jc1FLAG2(p7-nsGluc2A)

 </sup>, using primers NS5B_HCV_Fw and NS5B_Δ21_HCV_rv (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Both vector and insert were assembled as described above. The resulting plasmid, termed pET28-HCV NS5bΔ21, encodes for HCV NS5b polymerase lacking the most C-terminal 21 amino acids and containing a C-terminal His-tag (LEHHHHHH). The predicted molecular weight of this recombinant protein is 65 kDa. For the construction of pET28-HCV NS5bΔ21-GNN (expressing a catalytically-inactive RdRp) we used Gibson assembly and plasmid Jc1FLAG2(p7-nsGluc2a)/GNN

 </sup> to generate the insert. All the constructs were analyzed by sequencing to confirm the presence of the expected insert and the absence of undesired mutations.
