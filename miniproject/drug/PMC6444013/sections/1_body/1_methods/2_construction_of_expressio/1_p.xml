<p id="Par7">The ZIKV NS5 RdRp domain (spanning amino acid residues 275–903

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup> was cloned into the pET16b expression plasmid between 
 <italic>Nde</italic>I and 
 <italic>Xho</italic>I sites using the Gibson assembly method. To do this, the vector backbone was amplified using pET16b as template; the PCR reaction contained 1 × Phusion HF buffer, 200 μM dNTPs, 0.5 units of Phusion
 <sup>®</sup> HF DNA polymerase and 0.25 μM of a specific pET16_Fw and pET16_rv primer pair (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The amplification conditions used were as follows: 98 °C (3 min), 30 cycles of 98 °C (15 s), 51 °C (20 s) and 72 °C (4 min) each, and 10 min of elongation at 72 °C. The RdRp domain was amplified from a pcDNA vector containing the full-length 
 <italic>NS5</italic> gene. PCR amplification was similar to that described above but using the specific primers NS5 short_pET16_Fw and NS5_pET16_rv (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). After purification, the vector and insert were mixed in the presence of 2 × Gibson Assembly Master Mix and the assembly reaction was carried out following the recommendations of the manufacturer. The assembled product was transformed into 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3)-pRIL cells. After plasmid extraction from three independent bacterial colonies, nucleotide sequencing determined that two DNA samples contained the correct construct. The resulting plasmid pET16a-ZIKV-NS5RdRp encodes for ZIKV RdRp fused to an HHHHHHHHHHSSGHIEG amino acid tract in its N-terminus that is used for affinity purification using HisPur
 <sup>TM</sup> Ni-NTA resin The predicted molecular weight of this protein is 75 kDa.
