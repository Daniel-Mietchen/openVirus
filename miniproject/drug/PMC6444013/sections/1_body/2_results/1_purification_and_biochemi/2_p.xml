 </sup>. For the preliminary evaluation of ZIKV NS5 RdRp domain activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, we adapted a polymerization assay based on the detection of radioactive nucleotides incorporated by the polymerase. This method makes use of a homopolymeric ssRNA as a template in the absence of any primer, since it has been previously demonstrated that ZIKV NS5 can initiate RNA synthesis 
 <italic>de novo</italic>

 </sup>. The reactions were performed in the presence of radioactive-labeled nucleotides, and polymerization products were resolved by PAGE. RNA synthesis in the absence of primer was observed both in the presence of poly-U and [α-
 <sup>32</sup>P]ATP as template and nucleotide substrates (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>), and in the presence of poly-C and [α-
 <sup>32</sup>P]GTP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). We observed polymerization activity 
 <italic>de novo</italic> in the presence of Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> but not Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>, in agreement with a previous observation

 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). The same reaction in the presence of the catalytically-inactive mutant GNN showed no detectable signal (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, lanes 7 to 9).
