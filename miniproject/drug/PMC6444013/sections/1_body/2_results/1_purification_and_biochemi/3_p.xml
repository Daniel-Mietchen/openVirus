<p id="Par24">Previous studies suggested that, under certain circumstances, 
 <italic>flaviviral</italic> polymerases can catalyze the terminal transference of nucleotides to RNA. However, this transferase activity has never been reported for ZIKV RdRp

 <italic>de novo</italic> RNA synthesis (as we expect), we performed the same assay but in the presence of radioactive nucleotides that were less competent for viral RNA synthesis: [α-
 <sup>32</sup>P]GTP to poly-U and [α-
 <sup>32</sup>P]ATP to poly-C. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2B</xref>, no elongation was detected under these conditions, supporting the notion that the activity detected was due to 
 <italic>de novo</italic> RNA synthesis. Thus, these results show that both homopolymeric templates, poly-C and poly-U, can be used by ZIKV to initiate RNA replication, as has been previously documented
