<p id="Par26">Preliminary real-time assays, involving the addition of SYBR Green II to the sample before initiating the reaction, showed an undetectable (using poly-C) or barely detectable (using poly-U) increase in fluorescence. In contrast to real-time experiments, we found significant increases in polymerase activity in an end-point experiment where the dye was added after the reaction was completed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Previous studies have documented that an excess of SYBR Green I, chemically related to SYBR Green II, can inhibit other polymerase activities, such as those of Taq polymerase

 </sup>. Our resulted suggested that SYBR Green II acts as an inhibitor of ZIKV RdRp activity. Thus, we decided to test other fluorescent dyes for the real-time detection of newly synthesized dsRNA. It has been reported that SYTO 9 dye shows lower interference on polymerization assays when binding to dsDNA

 </sup>. In contrast to the assays with SYBR Green II, we found that both end-point and real-time polymerization assays resulted in similar increases in fluorescence when using poly-U as template (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, compare A with D). The relative increase in emitted fluorescence (ratio between the values obtained after a 60 min reaction and the background value observed at time 0) was similar using both approaches. This result suggested that SYTO 9 does not inhibit ZIKV RdRp, and thus can be used for real-time detection of activity. We also observed high reproducibility among different experimental samples, as reflected in the modest standard error values in different experiments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1D</xref>). According to our assay, dsRNA synthesis was linear up to 60 min, and then reached the maximum accumulation of product at 150–180 min (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). ZIKV RdRp activity is dependent on the presence of Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> in agreement with our data in radioactivity-based assays. The disruption of the catalytic site (RdRp GNN) also led to complete loss of polymerase activity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Likewise, terminal transferase activity was not detected in assays using poly-U as template and either GTP or UTP as substrate.
