<p id="Par25">Based on the above results, we next sought to detect polymerization activity using a fluorescence-detection method. For this aim, we attemped to establish an assay to quantify RNA synthesis activity as the relative increase in fluorescence emitted by SYBR Green II dye after binding to dsRNA. This procedure was adapted from methods previously described to detect dsDNA synthesis by the human primase-polymerase PrimPol

 </sup>. We anticipated that binding of this intercalating agent to dsRNA generated by ZIKV RdRp polymerization activity would lead to an increase in the emitted fluorescence.
