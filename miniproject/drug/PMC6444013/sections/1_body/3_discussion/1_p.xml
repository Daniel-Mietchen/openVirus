<p id="Par32">There is an urgent need to develop new treatments for ZIKV infection and to control its rapid geographical spread. Different approaches for the discovery of potential small-molecule inhibitors include the screening of chemical libraries, molecular modeling and virtual screening

 </sup>. Although promising developments in this direction have been achieved (reviewed in

 </sup>), there are as yet no antiviral agents licensed against ZIKV at the clinical level. Owing to significant differences in the mechanisms of replication between cellular DNA and viral RNA genomes, the latter involving the synthesis of RNA molecules templated by RNA, RdRps are attractive targets for the development of specific antiviral treatments. The use of antivirals against non-RdRp viral polymerases, such as human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B virus reverse transcriptases, and herpes virus DNA polymerase, supports the suitability of this group of enzymes as therapeutic targets
