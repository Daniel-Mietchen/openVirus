<p id="Par35">Fluorometric measurements of polymerase activity in the absence/presence of three representative inhibitors (heparin, 3′ATP and RTP) revealed a positive correlation with the results using a traditional assay based on radiolabeled nucleotides, further validating the fluorescence-based approach for the screening of antiviral compounds. The possibility of visualizing dsRNA synthesis in real-time increases the sensitivity of the assay, allowing an accurate determination of replication kinetics in the presence or absence of the drug and the predicted affinity constants of the compound tested. This method also permits the characterization of inhibitory molecules 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, which is of use in the identification of prospective antivirals. As part of our studies we have shown that RTP elicits a mild inhibition on ZIKV RdRp polymerization 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. We posit that the observed inhibition might be a consequence of reduced polymerase efficacy to elongate molecules where an RTP residue is incorporated
