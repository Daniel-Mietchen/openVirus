<p id="Par36">Under different experimental conditions, including the use of different concentrations of SYBR Green II and SYTO 9, we found that poly-C RNA was not a suitable substrate for the detection of polymerase activity in real-time. Conversely, both poly-A and poly-U homopolymers were effective as template molecules in real-time assays. We hypothesize that the inhibition of polymerase activity is produced by the interaction of RdRp with the dye during dsRNA synthesis. It is possible that poly-G synthesis as a result of replicating poly-C can lead to non-canonical G-quadruplex structures
