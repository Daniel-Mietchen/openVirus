<p id="Par34">There have been previous attempts to develop high-throughput activity assays to identify drug inhibitors specifically against ZIKV RdRp. These methods include the use of either radioactive nucleotides

 </sup>. Our method has the advantages of being a more economically affordable alternative, as it uses inexpensive homopolymeric RNA as a template substrate instead of labeled synthetic heteropolymeric RNA. Our approach would also allow for assay scale-up to high-throughput formats (e.g., 96 or 384-well formats, automation, etc.), for the rapid testing of small-molecule compound libraries
