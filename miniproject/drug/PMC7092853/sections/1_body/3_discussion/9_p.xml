<p id="p0165">To conclude, our results indicate that CET is an effective antiviral agent against ZIKV. CET exerts anti-ZIKV activities through the inhibition of viral production and replication as well as through virucidal activity. The evidence reported here supports the further study of CET as a candidate compound for ZIKV treatment.</p>
