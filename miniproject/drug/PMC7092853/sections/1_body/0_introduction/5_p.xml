<p id="p0040">Cephalotaxine (CET), harringtonine (HT), homoharringtonine (HHT), isoharringtonine, and deoxyharringtoninea are alkaloids which can be isolated and purified from the Chinese coniferous tree 
 <italic>Cephalotaxus hainanensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. CET has shown promising antiviral activities against hepatitis B [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and has also been found to have antileukemic activities [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Due to their wide range of effects, CET drugs are also believed to have great potential in the treatment of other diseases, including some cancers [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. HT inhibits CHIKV replication by down-regulating viral protein expression, while HHT shows activity against HBV and the coronavirus. Previous research further determined that both HT and HHT are promising candidates for the treatment of diseases related to the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) [

 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>]. Although such drugs have similar structures, their substituents vary widely, which may translate into differences in pharmacological activity [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, in the current study, we opted to investigate the potential anti-ZIKV activity of CET in Vero cells. Our results indicate that CET indeed possesses anti-ZIKV activity. Thus, we also opted to investigate the potential mechanisms which underlie the anti-ZIKV activity of CET. In so doing, we demonstrated that CET (1) disrupts the viral life cycle by preventing ZIKV from replicating and (2) exhibits virucidal activity against ZIKV. These findings suggest that CET has the potential to be developed as a therapeutic agent against ZIKV.
