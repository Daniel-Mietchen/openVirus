  <p>Screening of the FDA-approved compound library for inhibitors of CPV replication. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Experimental timeline of drug treatment and CPV infection. F81 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and pretreated with 10 μM drugs for 1 h before CPV infection, then cell viability was examined using the TransDetect
   <sup>®</sup> Cell Counting Kit at 40 h postinfection. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Flow chart of drug screen using CPE-based assay. Briefly, F81 cells per well were pretreated with 10 μM drugs for 1 h, and then infected with 0.076 MOI CPV, cell viability was detected at 40 h postinfection as described above, antiviral inhibitors against CPV were determined according to the percentage CPE inhibition. Twenty-one drugs showing &gt;20% CPE inhibition from the primary screen were used for a second round of screening, and seven drugs with percentage inhibition &gt;50% were further identified. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Scatter plot of percentage CPE inhibition results for 1430 FDA-approved drugs, numbers in X axis mean the species of the tested drugs, each number corresponds to a specific drug, and the order is the same as that provided in the manual of the FDA-approved drug library, each dot shows the mean percentage CPE inhibition in the presence of 10 μM tested drug.
