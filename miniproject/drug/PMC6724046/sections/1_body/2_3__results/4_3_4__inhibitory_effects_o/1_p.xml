<p>Western blot was also used to evaluate the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of identified drugs against different subspecies of three CPV variants. Dose-dependent reductions in VP2 expression and the quantification of relative expression levels are shown in F81 cells treated with Nitazoxanide (
