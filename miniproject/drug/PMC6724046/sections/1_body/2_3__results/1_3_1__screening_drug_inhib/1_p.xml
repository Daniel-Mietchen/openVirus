<p>In this study, a CPE-based high-throughput screening assay was used to screen CPV inhibitors from an FDA-approved drug library. The timeline of drug treatment and CPV infection, as well as the flow chart of the CPE-based assay, are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00742-f001">Figure 1</xref>A,B. In the primary screen (First round), the Z’ factor was between 0.68 and 0.83 across all 17 drug plates. As the assay quality control index Z’ factors were &gt;0.5 in all plates, it demonstrated that the CPE-based screening assay was suitable for screening anti-CPV drugs. The mean percentage CPE inhibition of each drug was plotted in
