<p>From the absolute qPCR results, dose-dependent reduction in the copy numbers of CPV viral DNA were observed with increasing concentrations of Nitazoxanide (

When CPV-infected F81 cells were treated with the three drugs at 10 Î¼M, the CPV viral DNA copy numbers of 1mL whole cell lysates significantly reduced to 0.07% (Nitazoxanide), 24.04% (Closantel Sodium), and 20.83% (Closantel) compared with the 0.1% DMSO-treated group (
