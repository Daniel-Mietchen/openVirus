<p>Consistent with screening results, all three drugs showed anti-CPV effects when added 1 h before virus infection (pre-infection). The inhibitory effects of Nitazoxanide, Closantel Sodium, and Closantel were 108.00 ± 17.74, 58.14 ± 7.28, and 71.28 ± 3.17, respectively, when the three drugs were added 1 h post-virus infection (
