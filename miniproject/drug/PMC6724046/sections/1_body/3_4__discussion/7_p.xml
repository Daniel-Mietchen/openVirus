<p>Since Nitazoxanide can inhibit the replication of various DNA and RNA viruses, various studies have focused on identifying host factors to explain the broad antiviral activities of Nitazoxanide. Ashiru et al. (2014) reported that Nitazoxanide depleted intracellular Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> stores, besides the phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2Î±, further affecting N-linked glycosylation of the bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) E2 protein and trafficking from the ER to the Golgi [

In addition, Nitazoxanide might block the production of acetyl-CoA, which is a required metabolic intermediates for Vaccinia virus (VACV) reproduction. In general, further studies are still required to clearly elucidate the antiviral mechanism of Nitazoxanide [
