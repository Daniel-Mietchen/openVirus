<p>Closantel sodium and Closantel were also identified and shown to have anti-CPV activities. Closantel is a salicylanilide derivative and is considered to be an anthelmintic agent in livestock [

 <xref rid="B43-viruses-11-00742" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, neither the antiviral activity nor the antiviral mechanisms of Closantel sodium and Closantel have been reported before. Previous studies have shown that Closantel inhibited B-Raf (a serine/threonine kinase) V600E [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-11-00742" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-11-00742" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], SPAK and OSR1 kinase [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-11-00742" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In addition, Senkowski et al. (2015) reported that Closantel could inhibit mitochondrial respiration as well [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-11-00742" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. These reports may contribute to further studies on the antiviral mechanism of Closantel.
