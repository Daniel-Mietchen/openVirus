<p>Feline kidney fibroblast-like monolayer cell line (F81) was originally obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The cells were cultured in growth medium (GM), which consisted of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin; while maintenance medium (MM) consisted of DMEM (Gibco), supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum when used. New CPV-2a strain SD6 (297Ala, 426Asn), New CPV-2b strain SD3 (297Ala, 426Asp) and New CPV-2a strain BJ-1 (297Ala, 426Asn) were isolated and identified in our laboratory. The sequences encoding VP2 protein of SD6, SD3, and BJ-1 were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers MN101724, MN101725, and MN101726, respectively. These submitted sequences of SD6, SD3, and BJ-1 shared as high as 99.3%, 99.3%, and 99.1% nucleotide sequence identity with BR8-90 (DQ340411, New CPV-2a), CPV-2b/598/1995 (KF373568, New CPV-2b) and BR8-90 (DQ340411, New CPV-2a), respectively.</p>
