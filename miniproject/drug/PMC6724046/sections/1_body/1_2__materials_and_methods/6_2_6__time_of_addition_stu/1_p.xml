<p>The time of addition experiment was used to test the drug inhibition stage of the CPV replication life cycle. Meanwhile, the inhibitory effects of the identified drugs at different time points following the addition of the three drugs after virus infection were also evaluated by this assay. Briefly, F81 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (2.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) and then infected with CPV (MOI = 0.076). Nitazoxanide, Closantel Sodium, Closantel, or 0.1% DMSO were added at −1 h (1 h pre-infection), 0 h (CPV infection), 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h or 6 h (post-infection) to determine the inhibitory effects at different time points of drug addition [

 <sup>®</sup> Cell Counting Kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) at 40 h postinfection, as described above.
