<p>Western blot was also used to evaluate the antiviral activity of Nitazoxanide, Closantel Sodium, and Closantel against different subspecies of CPV variants. F81 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 7.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well and pretreated with the three drugs at final concentrations of 5 μM, 10 μM, and 20 μM, respectively, for 1 h. The treated cells were infected with CPV variants SD6 (New CPV-2a strain), SD3 (New CPV-2b strain) and BJ-1 (New CPV-2a strain), at an MOI of 0.076 as described above. Cells with 0.1% DMSO were used as control. After 40 h incubation, cells were harvested and lysed with ProteinExt
 <sup>®</sup> Mammalian Total Protein Extraction Kit (TransGen Biotech, China). Equal amounts of cell lysates were analyzed via sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). After blocking with 5% milk-TBS-Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, anti-VP2 monoclonal antibody (1:800 dilution, INGENASA, Madrid, Spain), and beta-actin monoclonal antibody (AC-15) (1:4000 dilution, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C, blots were further incubated with horseradish-peroxidase(HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at 37 °C. The immunoreactive bands were detected using a SuperSignal™ West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate Kit (Thermo Scientific, USA) and imaged using a chemiluminescence apparatus (Proteinsimple, USA). Band intensities were measured using the Image J software, and viral VP2 protein expression was first compared with beta Actin expression, and then normalized to the 0.1% DMSO-treated group.
