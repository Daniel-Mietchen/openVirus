<p>In this study, a high-throughput screening assay based on cytopathic effects (CPE) was used to screen an FDA-approved drug library for potential drugs capable of inhibiting CPV infection. One New CPV-2a variant SD6 was first used as the prototype for screening the library, then two other variants—BJ-1 (New CPV-2a), and SD3 (New CPV-2b)—were further used to evaluate the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of the identified drugs. The three identified inhibitors are promising drug candidates against CPV infection.</p>
