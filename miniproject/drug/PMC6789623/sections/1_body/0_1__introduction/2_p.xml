<p>PDCoV, belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic> and the family Coronaviridae within the order Nidovirales, is a recently discovered CoV of unknown origin, which has a wide host range, including wild birds, swine, and other mammals [
 <xref rid="B8-pathogens-08-00144" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-pathogens-08-00144" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The PDCoV genome is approximately 25 kb and has seven open reading frames, i.e., open reading frame 1a/1b (ORF1a/1b), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), NS6, and NS7. As an emerging swine enteropathogenic coronavirus, PDCoV has strong pathogenicity and can cause watery diarrhea, vomiting, and high mortality in piglets, posing a potential threat to the swine husbandry. The post-infection mortality of suckling piglets can reach 30% to 40%, causing serious economic losses to the pork industry [

Ectopic expression of porcine aminopeptidase N (APN) rendered non-susceptible cells susceptible to PDCoV infection and greatly enhance PDCoV infection in HeLa cells [
 <xref rid="B11-pathogens-08-00144" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This suggests that PDCoV has the potential to spread between species and may be a threat to humans, as closely related viruses have led to outbreaks of deadly diseases such as SARS and MERS [

 <xref rid="B13-pathogens-08-00144" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. PDCoV global distribution in swine and its potential for transmission to multiple hosts are alarming. Pigs are the second largest livestock species and act as intermediate hosts for multiple zoonotic transmissions, emphasizing the need for studying the zoonotic potential of PDCoV and the development of antiviral drugs [
