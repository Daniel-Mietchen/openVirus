<p>Here, we report that LiCl and DG inhibit the replication of the PDCoV strain SD2018/10 in LLC-PK1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The antiviral activity of LiCl mainly occurs at the early stage of viral infection, while the antiviral activity of DG mainly occurs at the stage of viral attachment. In addition, both drugs inhibited PDCoV-induced apoptosis in LLC-PK1 cells. Therefore, the potential and theoretical bases of the two drugs as therapeutic drugs for PDCoV were validated.</p>
