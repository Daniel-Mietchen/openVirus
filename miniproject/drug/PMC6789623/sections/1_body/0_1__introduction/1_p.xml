<p>PDCoV, first discovered in Hong Kong in 2012, broke out in the United States in early 2014 and then spread to China, Thailand, and Canada. As a novel coronavirus, PDCoV can cause severe diarrhea and vomiting, with high mortality in piglets, which can lead to serious economic loss in the swine industry [

 <italic>Betacoronaviruses</italic> include SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which can cause lethal respiratory infections in humans and are notable examples of interspecies transmission [

 <xref rid="B6-pathogens-08-00144" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Cross-species transmission, facilitated by the widespread prevalence of CoV in mammals and birds, and genetic diversity, driven by high mutation rates and high frequency of recombination, increase the chance of successful adaptation to a new host [
