<p>The PDCoV strain SD2018/10 from our lab was used in this study. The number of infectious PDCoV particles was determined on the basis of the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) in LLC-PK1 cells. Briefly, the cells were seeded into 96-cell plates and grown to 100% confluence for 24 h. Then, the cells were infected using 10-fold serial dilutions of virus samples. After incubation at 37 Â°C for 2 h, the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 72 h. Titers are reported as TCID
 <sub>50</sub> calculated by the method of Reed and Muench.
