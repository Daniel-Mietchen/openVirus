<p>PDCoV infection can cause vomiting and watery diarrhea in piglets and seriously damage the growth of the pig industry. Until now, there are no records of clinically effective agents for the treatment of PDCoV infection, and no compound has shown antiviral activity [

Because neither specific antiviral drugs nor vaccines are available for newly emerging viruses and it is not possible to develop small-molecule drugs and vaccines that act on PDCoV in a short period of time, the novel use of traditional drugs has long been considered to be an important means of finding new therapies targeting new infectious diseases [
 <xref rid="B36-pathogens-08-00144" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It has been reported that LiCl and DG, which are often deemed broad-spectrum antiviral reagents, have antiviral properties against coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, IBV, and PEDV. However, it remains unknown whether LiCl or DG has an inhibitory effect on PDCoV infection.
