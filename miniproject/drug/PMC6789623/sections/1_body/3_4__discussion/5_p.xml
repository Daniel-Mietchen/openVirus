<p>In conclusion, our results indicate that LiCl and DG have potential as effective anti-PDCoV drugs. During an outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea, LiCl and DG could be added to drinking water at the appropriate dose or be given as an intramuscular drug for treatment at the early onset of an epidemic. Further studies are required to explore their antiviral effect against other CoVs and their mechanism of action to control PDCoV infection in vivo.</p>
