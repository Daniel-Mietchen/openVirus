<p>In this study, we used real-time qPCR, TCID
 <sub>50</sub>, and IFA to analyze PDCoV infection. Real-time qPCR was used to analyze the level of PDCoV mRNA expression during PDCoV replication. The infectious titer was determined by TCID
 <sub>50</sub>, and the fluorescence signals detected by IFA were representative of the level of PDCoV protein expression. We found that LiCl and DG inhibited the replication of PDCoV in LLC-PK1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. By performing time-of-addition experiments, we aimed to identify the stage of the viral replication cycle targeted by the drugs. We found that both drugs can reduce viral RNA in cell lysates at the early stages of PDCoV replication.
