<p>We also found that LiCl and DG could inhibit LLC-PK1 cell apoptosis caused by PDCoV infection similarly to the results of a previous report [
 <xref rid="B28-pathogens-08-00144" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Apoptosis is considered a host innate defense mechanism to eliminate virus-infected cells. However, some viruses use and trigger apoptosis to facilitate the release of viral progeny for further dissemination. This can be fundamental for viral pathogenesis and disease development to promote cell death and tissue injury. Previous studies showed that PDCoV induces caspase-dependent apoptosis through the activation of the cytochrome c-mediated intrinsic mitochondrial pathway [
