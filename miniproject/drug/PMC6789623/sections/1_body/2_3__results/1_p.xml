<p>LiCl and DG cytotoxicity in LLC-PK1 cells. The cellular cytotoxic effect of LiCl and DG in LLC-PK1 cells was determined using the CCK8 kit. The structure of DG is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00144-f001">Figure 1</xref>A. The maximum LiCl and DG concentrations that resulted in a cell viability higher than 80% were 60 mM and 1250 μg/mL, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00144-f001">Figure 1</xref>B,C). No differences in cell morphology compared to the mock-treated cells were observed (data not shown) at concentrations of 60 mM LiCl and 1250 μg/mL DG; therefore, 10–60 mM LiCl and 125–1250 μg/mL DG were used in subsequent antiviral assays.
