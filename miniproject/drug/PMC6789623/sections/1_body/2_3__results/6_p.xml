<p>LiCl and DG inhibit LLC-PK1 apoptosis caused by PDCoV infection. The AnnexinV Alexa Fluor647/PI kit was used to detect cell apoptosis. We found that PDCoV could cause apoptosis within 36 hpi. The percentages of apoptotic cells infected by mock-treated, LiCl-treated viruses, and DG-treated viruses were 30.1%, 2.3%, 3.3%, respectively (
