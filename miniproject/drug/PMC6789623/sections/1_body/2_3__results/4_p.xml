<p>LiCl and DG have no viricidal effect on PDCoV virions. To understand whether LiCl and DG have a direct (viricidal) effect on virions, we incubated PDCoV (MOI 0.05) with 60 mM LiCl or 1250 μg/mL DG for 2 h at room temperature or 37 °C before infection of LLC-PK1 cells. The infectious titer was determined by TCID
 <sub>50</sub> at 48 hours postinfection (hpi). We found that none of the drugs directly inhibited PDCoV infectivity (
