  <p>Cytotoxic effect of LiCl and DG treatment in LLC-PK1 cells. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Chemical structure of diammonium glycyrrhizinate (DG). Cells were treated with 0–100 mM LiCl (
   <bold>B</bold>) or 50–5000 μg/mL DG (
   <bold>C</bold>) for 36 h. The relative cell viability was evaluated by the CCK-8 Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. The dotted line indicates the 80% cytostatic concentration (CC
   <sub>80</sub>).
