<p>Two authors discussed all data sets before extracting them from the published literature. To avoid subjective bias, names of the authors, publications, year, and country were omitted during the data extraction process. Retrieved data included: (1) liver biochemical indicators: ALT (U/L), GGT (U/L), ALP (U/L) and TBIL (U/L); (2) liver fibrosis markers: HA (μg/L), LN (μg/L), IV-C (μg/L) and PIIIP (μg/L). Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus.</p>
