<p>Six randomized controlled trials reported on the use of a hepatoprotective drug in combination with an antiviral agent treatment of chronic hepatitis B. The test and control groups included 741 and 645 subjects, respectively. There was a statistically significant heterogeneity between the studies (I2 &gt; 50%), and hence, a random-effects model was used. Meta-analysis showed that using a combination of hepatoprotective and antiviral drugs was more effective than a single antiviral agent to reduce serum levels of ALT, AST, ALP and TBIL. ALT (WMD = -22.98; 95% CI (-34.98, -10.97)), AST (WMD= -26.20; 95% CI [-44.60, -7.81]), ALP (WMD = -56.19; 95% CI [-85.27, -27.11]) and TBIL (WMD= -5.58; 95% CI [-9.50, 1.66]) (
