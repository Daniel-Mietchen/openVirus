<p>Four randomized controlled clinical trials reported the effects of combined hepatoprotective agents versus a single agent on the liver fibrosis index, LN. The group representing the combined hepatoprotective agents included 151 subjects, whereas the single hepatoprotective agent group had 148 subjects. There was no significant heterogeneity (I2 &lt; 50%); therefore, a fixed-effects model was used. Meta-analysis showed that the two hepatoprotective agents was superior to the single one in terms of reducing LN levels (WMD = -33.91, 95% CI [-40.51, -27.31]) (
