<p>RevMan5.2 software was used to analyze the data. For classified data, risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used. For continuous data, weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CI were used. If I2 &lt; 50%, the test was considered uniform with no statistically significant heterogeneity, the fixed effects model was used if I2 &gt; 50%, a random effects model was used. A Funnel plot was used to evaluate possible publication bias.</p>
