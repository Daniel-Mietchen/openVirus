<p>UDCA is a hydrophilic bile acid, which alters the ratio of hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic components in the bile acid pool. It promotes the secretion of endogenous bile acids such as chenodeoxycholic and lithocholic acid, and improves cholestasis. UDCA is mainly used to treat primary biliary cirrhosis, hepatitis B associated liver fibrosis, and cholestatic liver disease, the efficacy is certain. Some studies reported that UDCA protects liver cell membrane and enhances immune function. These mechanisms may be related to the ability of ursodeoxycholic acid to regulate cell cycle, apoptosis and protein biosynthesis of liver cells. Alternatively, the increased pool of hydrophilic bile acid and the stability of the cell membrane may play an important protective role (
