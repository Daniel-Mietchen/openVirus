<p>The results of the current study showed that after a certain treatment course of a combined hepatoprotective and antiviral drugs, liver function and fibrosis index decreased in most of the subjects. Combination therapy was more effective than a single hepatoprotective agent to reduce liver cell damage, promote the liver cell membrane and promote the recovery of liver function, and it may delay the formation and development of hepatic fibrosis (

The meta-analysis of the current study showed that acetylcysteine, ursodeoxycholic acid and silibinin significantly reduced ALT, and were a liver function marker in patients with hepatitis B. The reduction in ALT levels by acetylcysteine was better than ursodeoxycholic acid and silibinin. This may be related to the ability of acetylcysteine to inhibit the expression of serum II-18, IFN-Î³ and NO in the patients with hepatitis B. Some studies stated that acetylcysteine should be used, and that it was more beneficial in early stages of liver disease (
