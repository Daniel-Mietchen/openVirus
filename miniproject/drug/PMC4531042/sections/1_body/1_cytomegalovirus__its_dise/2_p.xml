<p>CMV infection in healthy individuals is often asymptomatic and generally behaves as a benign self-limiting illness. However, a deficiency (partial or complete) of a functioning immune response, whether of the humoral or the cellular type, can result in uncontrolled CMV replication that leads to clinical disease. Transplant recipients belong to the group at highest risk of CMV disease due to the necessary use of drugs that suppress the immune system in order to maintain the transplanted organs (for solid organ transplant recipients) and to treat or prevent graft-versus-host disease (for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT] recipients). In these immunocompromised patients, clinical disease due to CMV is commonly manifested as fever, bone marrow suppression, and a variety of end-organ diseases, such as pneumonitis, enteritis, and rarely, retinitis. In addition, CMV infection is associated with damaging indirect effects, such as increased risk of other infections, graft failure, and death.
