<p>Transplant patients with subclinical CMV viremia who received letermovir 40 mg twice per day and 80 mg daily achieved stable letermovir trough levels at day 4 of treatment, and the trough levels at this doses were consistently above the 90% effective concentration (EC
 <sub>90</sub>) of the drug. There was minimal intra-individual variability,

 <xref rid="b41-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> When letermovir was tested in healthy volunteers, there were moderate increases in the levels of midazolam, tacrolimus, and cyclosporine. However, in the Phase IIa trial, no significant drug interactions were observed in patients on multiple medications. The subject treated for severe multidrug-resistant CMV disease with 240 mg daily of letermovir was on tacrolimus as part of his immunosuppression regimen, and no dose adjustment was required.
