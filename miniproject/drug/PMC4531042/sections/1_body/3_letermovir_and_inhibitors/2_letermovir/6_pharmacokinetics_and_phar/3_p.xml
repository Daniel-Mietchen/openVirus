<p>Based on the pharmacokinetic data and safety profile of letermovir obtained from early phase clinical trials, it appears that a once-daily dose of 120 mg or 240 mg would achieve desirable levels without compromising the tolerability profile. Although no definitive clinical data are yet available regarding its efficacy, it appears from the Phase II studies in kidney and allogeneic HSCT recipients that a 240 mg daily dose of letermovir should be tested further in clinical trials.
