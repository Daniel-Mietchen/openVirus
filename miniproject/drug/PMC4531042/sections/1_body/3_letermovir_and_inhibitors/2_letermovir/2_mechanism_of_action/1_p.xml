<p>Letermovir is highly specific for human CMV, as it has no activity against other herpesviruses or any other virus.
 <xref rid="b43-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Mutational analyses indicated that letermovir resistance mapped to 
 <italic>UL56</italic>. If this finding is sustained, inhibition of the terminase complex by letermovir can be attributed to its specific activity on pUL56.

 <xref rid="b45-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> A sequence variation between amino acids 230 and 370 in pUL56 was identified as conferring letermovir resistance. These are two naturally occurring polymorphisms (L241P and R369S) that alter the inhibitory effect of letermovir on viral replication. The 50% effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) was increased 160-fold with L241P and 38-fold with R396S.
 <xref rid="b46-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> These naturally occurring mutations are the only letermovir resistance genotypes identified to date. Neither L241P nor R369S mutation has been selected during the use of letermovir in human studies, suggesting that there may be a high barrier for development of resistance.
