<p>Letermovir can potentially be used for prevention and treatment of CMV infection in transplant recipients. Given the lack of hematological side effects with letermovir, it has a promising potential role in CMV prophylaxis in allogeneic HSCT recipients. This is currently being evaluated as part of a Phase II trial (to be completed in 2 years). Another potential role of letermovir is in the treatment of active CMV replication, as suggested by the early-phase trials and a proof-of-concept trial in kidney recipients. The treatment of clinically significant CMV disease, in particular of multidrug-resistant CMV, represents another promising treatment indication of letermovir. Furthermore, given its lower risk for adverse effects compared with the currently approved drugs, letermovir may potentially replace the nucleoside analogs as a first-line drug for prevention and treatment of treatment-na√Øve CMV disease. One downside for clinical use is the lack of activity against other herpesviruses, which also commonly reactivate in transplant recipients.</p>
