<p>Letermovir (AIC246 or MK-8228), a 3,4-dihydro-quinazoline-4-yl-acetic acid derivative, is the prototype viral terminase complex inhibitor that is most advanced in its clinical development. The novel compound was initially developed by AiCuris after high-throughput screening, hit-to-lead optimization, structure-activity relationship, and pharmacological analyses.
 <xref rid="b38-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> By 2009, it had undergone a Phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers and a Phase IIa proof-of-concept trial in a small cohort of kidney transplant recipients.
 <xref rid="b40-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Its preclinical data and proposed mechanism of action was presented in 2010 at the International Herpesvirus Workshop (Salt Lake City, UT, USA). In October 2010, the drug was used for the compassionate treatment of a lung transplant patient with CMV disease due to multidrug-resistant CMV.
 <xref rid="b41-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> In April 2011, the drug was granted orphan drug designation for prevention of CMV disease by the European Commission. In August 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration granted it a fast track designation. In 2012, the results of Phase IIb clinical trials using letermovir in bone marrow transplant patients were presented at various international meetings, and the data were subsequently published in 2014.
 <xref rid="b42-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Its continued clinical development is currently undertaken in agreement with Merck.
