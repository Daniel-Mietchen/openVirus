<p>In a dose-finding Phase II study, the efficacy and safety of letermovir prophylaxis was compared with placebo in a cohort of 131 CMV seropositive recipients of HSCT from matched related or unrelated donors from 19 transplant centers in Germany and the USA. In this trial, different doses (60, 120, or 240 mg) of letermovir were compared with placebo for 12 weeks after stem cell engraftment. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, the all-cause prophylaxis failure (defined as CMV infection or study drug discontinuation) was lower in all three groups that received any of the three doses of letermovir compared with 64% with placebo. However, only the groups that received letermovir 120 mg and 240 mg daily achieved a statistically significant difference when compared with placebo, with a combined failure rate of 29% (
