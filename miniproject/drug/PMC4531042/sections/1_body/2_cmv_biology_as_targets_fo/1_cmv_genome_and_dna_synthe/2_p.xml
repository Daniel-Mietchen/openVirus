<p>GCV and its prodrug VGCV are nucleosides that require phosphorylation in order to become active. The first-step of this triphosphorylation is catalyzed by a viral kinase encoded by 
 <italic>UL97</italic>. Mutations in 
 <italic>UL97</italic> that impair viral kinase synthesis account for the most common forms of GCV resistance by CMV. Subsequent diphosphorylation and triphosphorylation are catalyzed by host cellular guanylate and phosphoglycerate kinases, resulting in active GCV triphosphate that serves as a competitive substrate for CMV DNA polymerase during viral DNA synthesis.
