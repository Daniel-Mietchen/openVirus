<p>During CMV replication, viral DNA for each emerging virion is not produced separately. Instead, it is synthesized as a long DNA chain containing multiple repeated gene sequences (known as concatemers). Each gene sequence repetition (monomer) constitutes the genetic material for one virion. The concatemeric DNA will therefore need to undergo cleavage into multiple unit-length monomers that will be subsequently packaged into a viral capsid prior to its release as an infective virion. This maturation, packaging, and termination process is performed by a group of proteins collectively known as the “terminase complex”.
