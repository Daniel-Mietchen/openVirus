<p>Both pUL56 and pUL89 terminase subunits are synthesized in the cytoplasm of CMV-infected cells. Hence, they need to be transported into the nucleus to exert their vital functions. The pUL56 translocation into the nucleus appears to be mediated by interaction of the “nuclear localization signal” (a short amino acid segment in the carboxy-terminal of pUL56) and translocation-protein importin

 <xref rid="b23-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The pUL56 and importin 
 <italic>a</italic> form a stable complex with importin 
 <italic>b</italic>, and the complex interacts with filaments of the nuclear pore for its translocation to the nucleus. Once inside, importin subunits dissociate, leaving the pUL56 available for packaging of CMV DNA.
