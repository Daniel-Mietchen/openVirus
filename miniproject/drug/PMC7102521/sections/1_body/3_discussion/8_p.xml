<p id="p0120">Finally, network pharmacological analysis was performed to predict the possible therapeutic effects of these 26 plants. Because Chinese herbal medicines contain many ingredients, and multiple absorbable ingredients might exert their effects on the body, the general effects of herbs may be dictated by all of the absorbable ingredients they contain. With this consideration in mind, we extracted the recorded ingredients of each of the plants selected from the Chinese medicine database and screened these ingredients for drug-likeness and oral availability (via ADME filter) 
 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The target proteins of all ingredients passing ADME selection were used for network enrichment to predict the general effects of the herbal plants. For all the plants analyzed, nearly half of the top 30 pathways enriched in KEGG are related to antiviral, immune/inflammatory responses and hypoxia response indicating that these herbs are suitable for anti-viral usage. In fact, some of the herbal plants selected here had been reported effective in against SARS-CoV infection in 2003 (
