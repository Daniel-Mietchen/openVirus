<p id="p0080">Each of the potentially effective herbal remedies contains many ingredients in addition to the antiviral ones found here. Thus, the general effects of each plant should be examined by combining the effects of all of the orally absorbable and biologically active ingredients in it. To evaluate the possible general 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of each of our identified herbs, we used the ADME indices listed above to examine each of the orally absorbable and drug-like ingredients recorded in the TCMSP database for each plant. We then extracted the target proteins for each ingredient which had passed the screening process. All proteins belonging to a single plant were combined as input on the online proteinâ€“protein interaction analysis server, String, to find the pathway enrichment.
