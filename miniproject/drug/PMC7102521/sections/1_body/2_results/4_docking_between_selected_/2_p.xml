<p id="p0070">To perform the docking analysis, the 3D structure files of 2019-nCoV PLpro, 3CLpro and spike proteins were built based on the corresponding SARS-CoV templates, i.e., PDB 5e6j, 1uj1 and 6cad, respectively. Then, molecule-protein docking was carried out between the molecules and their reported targets. If the molecules were reported to inhibit viral entry, they were docked with spike proteins (

The molecules selected to target PLpro (M2, M3, M7, M9, M10, M11 and M13) mainly bound in the region between the thumb and palm domains, which might interfere with substrate entering this enzymeâ€™s active sites, located at the bottom of the two domains
