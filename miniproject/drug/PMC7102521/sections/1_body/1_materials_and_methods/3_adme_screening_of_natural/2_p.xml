<p id="p0035">Since Chinese herbal treatments are always taken orally after boiling with water, an 
 <italic>in silico</italic> integrative model of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) was used to screen for natural compounds that may be bioactive via oral administration. The indices used for the screening include evaluation of oral bioavailability, Caco-2 permeability, drug-like value, and drug half-life. The threshold values indicating effectiveness for these four indices were &gt; 30%, &gt; −0.4, &gt; 0.18 and &gt; 3 h, respectively, as recommended by Hu et al
