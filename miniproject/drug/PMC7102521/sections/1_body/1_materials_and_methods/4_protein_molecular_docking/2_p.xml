<p id="p0040">We used molecular docking software AutoDock 4 to perform protein compound docking analysis, according to the following procedure: (1) We built three-dimensional (3D) structure files of the proteins of interest. We used the online server SWISS-MODEL (

The models built were of Protein Data Bank (PDB) format. (2) To retrieve the required 3D structure files of compounds, the structure data file (SDF) format of compounds were retrieved from the PubChem website and then converted to PDB format by Discovery Studio. (3) AutoDock 4.2 was used to prepare PDBQT format files for target and ligand screening (Target.pdbqt and Ligand.pdbqt) and grid and docking parameter files (a.gpf and a.dpf). (4) Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock in Cygwin and finally the results were analyzed. The process and parameters used were detailed by Rizvi et al
