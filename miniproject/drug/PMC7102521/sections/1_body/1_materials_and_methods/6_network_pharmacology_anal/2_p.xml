<p id="p0050">The TCMSP provided the main components of each herb and the protein targets for each component. We identified the reported chemical constituents for each plant in the final analysis and used the ADME indices listed above to find the orally absorbable and drug-like compounds for the plant. The protein targets of these compounds were downloaded from the TCMSP database. All protein targets for each individual plant were used as input for the String online server (
