<p id="p0010">While specific vaccines and antiviral agents are the most effective methods to prevent and treat viral infection, there are not yet effective treatments that target the 2019-nCoV. Development of these treatments may require months or years, meaning that a more immediate treatment or control mechanism should be found if possible. Herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine present a potentially valuable resource to this end. The effectiveness of herbal treatment to control contagious disease was demonstrated during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak 
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. As such, the Chinese government is encouraging the use of herbal plants in fighting this new viral pneumonia. However, the application of herbal treatment is mainly guided by the type of herb (based on the catalogue of classic literature on herbs) and the patientâ€™s symptoms or signs. There is often not enough information to predetermine whether the herbs in question can directly target the viral cause, in other words, herbal usage is generally not guided by viral pathology. We think more detailed knowledge about the direct antiviral effects of different plants would be greatly helpful to the doctors selecting them.
