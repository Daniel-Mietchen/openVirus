<p id="p0105">During the SARS and MERS outbreaks effective diagnostic tools were developed for accurate detection. Although, useful at that time, it is now essential to develop specific tests for COVID-19. The viral nucleic acid detection is primarily used in SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (

 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">CDC, 2020</xref>). The CDC detection assay targets the N region and consists of one test for beta-coronaviruses and two unique probes for SARS-CoV-2. The Charité algorithm comprises of probes for E protein and RA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Once both are positive, the sample is again tested against specific SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (
 <xref rid="bb0485" ref-type="bibr">Loeffelholz and Tang, 2020</xref>). Contrastingly, the E protein with RdRp was also detecting SARS-CoV, and so, these assays can be used to test for the SARS-CoV-2 when there are no traces of SARS-CoV (

When the commercially available Real Star kit, Virus + Rox Vial kit and Super Script III One-step RT-PCR System with Platinum TaqDNA Polymerase were compared for their efficiency, the RealStar Kit did not have any unwanted signals and exceeded the other two in its performance (

These methods can also be compromised due to inadequate sample volume, inaccuracies in methods of testing, not collecting samples at the appropriate time window, and contamination. Similar issues have been identified as potential problems that may diminish the precision of the tests (
 <xref rid="bb0460" ref-type="bibr">Lippi et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, these tests are also expensive, hence cheaper alternatives have been developed to track the symptoms of COVID-19 using smart-phone surveillance (
 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Dorigatti et al., 2020</xref>). Imaging techniques can also be utilized as a diagnostic method in COVID-19. Additionally, chest CT scans have been facilitated to detect lung abnormalities in this SARS-CoV-2 infection (

 <xref rid="bb0860" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2020a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0865" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2020b</xref>). Abnormalities in the CT scans can be concomitant with disease progression and prognosis. But, not all the cases can be perfectly detected with CT scans (
 <xref rid="bb0420" ref-type="bibr">Lei et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, it is essential to conduct molecular tests and consider travel history and clinical symptoms of the patient as well. As there are an upsurge of infected people, more efficient, quicker and cheaper diagnostic tools must be developed to effectively identify infected individuals. Hence, the integrated approach of imaging and molecular diagnosis would help in screening and treating COVID-19 effectively. In order to design these specific drugs, it is important to understand the current strategies used to treat this novel COVID-19
