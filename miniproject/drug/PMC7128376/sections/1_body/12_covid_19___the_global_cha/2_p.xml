<p id="p0200"> COVID-19 has emerged as the most dangerous pandemic threat through-out the globe since its outbreak during December 2019. It has become a big challenge for the researchers and virologist to find a solution for this deadly disease. This is attributed to the fact that COVID-19 is a viral infection that has been known to have the fastest frequency of recombination or replication in its positive strand resulting in the quick formation of new progeny viral cells inside the host cells. It has also been reported that SARS-CoV-2 has a high rate of mutagenesis and changes in structure, which has created a barrier for both investigations of the disease and therapeutic regimens (

Recently, few researchers have identified that the SARS-CoV-2 has mainly two types of strains, which are the ‘L’ and ‘S’ strains. Among these strains the L strain is more common and may have evolved from the S strain; additionally, this L strain has a higher rate of replication inside the human host cell, which has resulted in the escalation of the infection in limited time. Hence, it has become a big challenge to analyze the condition and offer therapy at the short time available. Due to the high mutation rate, it has been harder to understand the genomic organization and host interaction of the virus (
