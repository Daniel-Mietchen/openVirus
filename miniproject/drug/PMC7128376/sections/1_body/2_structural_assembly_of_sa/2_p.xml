<p id="p0055">The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the largest family of the RNA viruses and its genome ranges from 27 to 32 kilobases in size (~125 nm or 0.125 μm). It is a single stranded enveloped RNA virus which possess a positive-sense RNA genome also known as (+ssRNA) with a 5′-cap structure and 3′-poly-A tail (
 <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Chen, 2020</xref>). The viruses belonging to this category, have a few common characteristics that are applicable to SARS-CoV-2 as well. The virus has four important structural proteins which are (E) the envelope protein (M) the membrane protein (S) the spike protein and (N) the nucleocapsid protein, which are required to regulate the function and viral structure (

Among these four proteins the most important ones are N and S, where the former one helps the virus to develop the capsid and the entire viral structure appropriately and the later one helps in the attachment of virus to the host cells (

 <xref rid="bb0785" ref-type="bibr">Walls et al., 2020</xref>). The S protein has three major sections which are, the large ectodomain, a single-pass transmembrane anchor and a short intracellular tail. These play a major role in anchoring the host cells. Among these sections the ectodomain has two subunits which are, the S1 receptor-binding subunit and S2 the membrane fusion subunit. These subunits are in the clove-trimeric or crown structure which is the reason coronavirus (corona = crown) got its name (
