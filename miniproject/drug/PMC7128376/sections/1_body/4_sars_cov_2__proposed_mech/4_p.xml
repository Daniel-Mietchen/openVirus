<p id="p0090">During the infection of the virus, the most important part is the interaction with the host cell nucleases. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 may use proteases similar to SARS-CoV such as TMPRSS11a, Trypsin, Plasmin, Cathepsin L and Furin in the cleavage of the spike protein for the virus to enter the cell. These proteases can be used as targets to reduce the symptoms of COVID-19 as proteasomal inhibitors used for HIV treatment are being used in treatment of COVID-19 (
