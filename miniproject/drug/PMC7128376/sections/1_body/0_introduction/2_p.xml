<p id="p0040">The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is in the midst of worldwide panic and global health concern since December 2019. As of March 26th, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that 416,686 and 18,589 death cases have been confirmed worldwide, and it has spread to 197 countries (

With this emerging battle against this deadly virus, the WHO has strategized to interrupt human-human contact, isolate patients at early stages, identify and reduce transmission from the animal source, address crucial mysteries about the virus and accelerate research, communicate information correctly to the public and minimize the social and economic impact. At this juncture, it is tremendously vital to understand the basic mechanism of the virus to develop specific drugs. Currently, it has been established that SARS-CoV-2 shares sequence homology with the SARS-CoV and a bat coronavirus (

 <xref rid="bb0790" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al., 2020</xref>). Currently, the treatments include Lopinavir/Ritonavir and supportive care, as this is primarily dependent on the severity of the illness. From a research standpoint, various drugs are being developed at an extremely quick pace and new targets are being identified every day, and also numerous drugs are also undergoing clinical trials. Researches are very curious about how to provide the best protection to the public before a vaccine can be made available (

 <xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Gomathi et al., 2020</xref>). Ayurveda and Siddha practices originated in India and are still widely used among the Indian population. By identifying certain phytocompounds, it is possible to effectively characterize medicinal herbs that could help to alleviate the infection. Hence, by repurposing the Indian medicinal plants, more innovative treatment options can be penned down for their role in defeating this viral transmission. At a time of worldwide anxiety, it is imperative to find long term solutions to prevent the transmission of such pandemics. So, it's time for all the citizens to join hands together to fight against coronavirus by practicing self-hygiene and social distancing (

In this review, the structure, immunological influence, mechanism of action of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human host cell, the availability of disease-specific drugs, ongoing clinical trials, recent diagnostics and the potential use of certain Indian medicinal herbs for the effective treatment of COVID-19 has been discussed. Through this review, we suggest that the Indian traditional medicinal herbs may be a beneficial step to combat viruses like the SARS-CoV-2.
