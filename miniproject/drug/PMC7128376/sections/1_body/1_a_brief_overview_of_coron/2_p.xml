<p id="p0045">Coronaviruses, having a total of 39 species under the broad realm of Riboviria, belong to the family Coronaviridae, suborder Cornidovirineae and order Nidovirales (
 <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Gorbalenya et al., 2020</xref>). All the SARS-CoV fall under the species 
 <italic>Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus</italic> and genus 
 <italic>Beta-coronavirus</italic>. Most of the species under this head are enzootic and only a few of these species infect humans (
 <xref rid="bb0670" ref-type="bibr">Schoeman and Fielding, 2019</xref>). Currently, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been confirmed. Specifically, they are named as Human coronavirus 
 <italic>NL63</italic> (HCoV-NL63) and Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), which belong to the 
 <italic>alpha-coronavirus</italic> genus; whereas Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), Human coronavirus (HCoV-HKU1), SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), belong to the 
 <italic>beta-coronavirus</italic> genus. HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 strains of coronavirus cause mild respiratory diseases in humans. The SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus that belongs to the Coronaviridae family that can infect human and several animal species (
 <xref rid="bb0495" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2020</xref>). The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the subgenus 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> and mostly resembles a bat coronavirus, with which it shares 96.2% sequence homology (
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2020a</xref>). Currently, it is thought that SARS-CoV-2 has been introduced to human by an unidentified intermediary animal and then it has spread from human-to-human.
