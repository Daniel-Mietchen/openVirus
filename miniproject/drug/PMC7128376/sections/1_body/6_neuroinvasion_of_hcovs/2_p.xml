<p id="p0100">The COVID-19 are not always confined to the respiratory tract, but they also invade the Central Nervous System (CNS) to induce neurological diseases. Coronaviruses with such potential are the beta-coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV (

 <xref rid="bb0440" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2016</xref>), HCoV-229E (
 <xref rid="bb0745" ref-type="bibr">Talbot et al., 1994</xref>), HCoV-OC43 (

 <xref rid="bb0930" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>), and Porcine Hemagglutinating Encephalomyelitis Virus (PHEV) (
 <xref rid="bb0545" ref-type="bibr">Mengeling et al., 1972</xref>). According to previous study, coronaviruses may initially invade peripheral nerves and enter the CNS via the synaptic route, where this trans-synaptic transfer has been documented in HEV67 and avian bronchitis virus (
 <xref rid="bb0530" ref-type="bibr">Matsuda et al., 2004</xref>). The first coronavirus found to invade the porcine brain was HEV 67 N, and it shares &gt;91% homology with HCoV-OC43 (
 <xref rid="bb0440" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the neuroinvasive propensity has been demonstrated as a common feature of coronaviruses. Since there is a high similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it is quite likely that SARS-CoV-2 may also possess an analogous potential. Based on an epidemiological survey, the first symptom is dyspnea which occurs in 5 days, followed by hospital admission at 7 days, and intensive care at 8 days for COVID-19 (

 <xref rid="bb0810" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020c</xref>). This latency period is enough for the virus to enter and destroy the medullary neurons. A possible mechanism about the entry of SARS-CoV-2 inside the CNS has been illustrated (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> ). Similarly, 
 <xref rid="bb0535" ref-type="bibr">Matthew, 2020</xref>stated that the symptoms might attribute to respiratory disease is due to the inability of air to get into the lungs, that might actually be the defects in respiration controlled by the nervous system. It has been reported that some COVID-19 patients showed neurologic signs, including headache (about 8%), nausea and vomiting (1%). As the neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 is accompanied by respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients, the entry of the virus into the CNS must be prevented. As an emerging virus, awareness of the possible entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the CNS is significant for prevention and treatment. It is also important to find effective antiviral drugs that can cross the blood-brain barrier (
 <xref rid="bb0445" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, more innovative approaches are required to detect this viral infection at an earlier period.
