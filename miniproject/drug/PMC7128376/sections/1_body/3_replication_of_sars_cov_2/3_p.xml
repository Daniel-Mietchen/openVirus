<p id="p0075">The process of replication in the SARS-CoV-2 similar to SARS-CoV virus is multifaceted and needs more understanding (

 <xref rid="bb0910" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). For replication, the genomic RNA contains a 5â€² end region that has the untranslated leader (L) sequence with the transcription regulation sequence (TRS) present at the descending region of the genome (
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Brian and Baric, 2005</xref>). The replicase gene encoded enzymes uses the negative RNA genome as a template to develop a few sets of small, overlapping messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules that further gets translated into the structural proteins viz, (N, M, E and S protein) also known as the building block for the production of new viral particles inside the host body, while the positive stranded RNA genome is used as a template to produce the negative strand. During the replication process inside the human host, the N protein of the virus binds to the genome while the M protein is associated with the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Further with the help of Nsp proteins the RNA gets assembled into a helical twisted structure and buds into the ER lumen. Viral progenies are transferred to the cell membranes by the Golgi bodies and exocytosed into the extracellular space of the human host cell environment. These mechanisms were discovered in the preceding viruses and may have a pivotal role in SARS-CoV-2 as well (

From the replication process of the SARS-CoV-2 it is evident that targeting Nsp proteins could enable us to develop a strategy to overcome this viral infection. Other than replication, other pathways associated with the virus can also be targeted for drug development.
