<p>Human behavioral change in response to the risk of infection can be accounted for by modeling the diffusion of fear as a parallel infection. In this case, the “recovery from fear” occurs at a constant rate, regardless the current state of the epidemic and the behavior adopted by the individuals. However, individuals may or may not reduce risky behaviors on the basis of the current risk perception of the epidemic. The approach considered in this chapter is based on evolutionary game theory  [

Different behaviors adopted in the population are represented by a given set of strategies. The adoption of self-protection is assumed to be driven by the perceived convenience of different behaviors, dependent on the epidemic dynamics.
