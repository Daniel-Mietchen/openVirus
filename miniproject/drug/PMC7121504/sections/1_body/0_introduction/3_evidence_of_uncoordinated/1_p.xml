<p>During an epidemic outbreak, individuals may change their behavior in order to reduce the risk of infection, especially when serious consequences for individual health are implied. A population-based survey reported that more than 75 % of respondents would avoid public transportation and 20–30 % would try to avoid crowded environments as precautionary actions in response to a hypothetical influenza pandemic  [

In the USA, data collected on public response to H1N1 influenza from May 2009 to June 2009 suggest that “16 to 25 % of Americans had avoided places where many people are gathered, like sporting events, malls, or public transportation and 20 % had reduced contact with people outside [their] household as much as possible”  [
