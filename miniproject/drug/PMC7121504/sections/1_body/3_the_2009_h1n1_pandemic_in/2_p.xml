<p>As most European countries, Italy experienced one single pandemic wave during fall-winter 2009 and no substantial activity was detected during the summer. However, the weekly influenza-like-illness (ILI) incidence is characterized by an initial slow exponential increase (September–mid-October 2009) followed by a sudden and sharp increase of the growth rate (mid-October). Over the whole period schools remained open  [

On the other hand, since the emergence of the pandemic the Italian population was exposed to a massive information campaign on the risks possibly associated to the pandemic, which may have contributed to alter the perceived risk.
