<p>The timing of the behavioral response is characterized by parameters 
 <italic>m</italic> and ρ. The former describes how the perceived prevalence 
 <italic>M</italic> is weighted in the payoff functions, i.e., in the balance of the cost associated to the risk of infection and the cost of a self-protection strategy. The latter represents the speed of the imitation process with respect to the disease transmission timescale. As a matter of fact, 1 ∕ 
 <italic>m</italic> defines the threshold for the perceived prevalence above which individuals reducing contacts have a larger payoff; the larger 
 <italic>m</italic>, the earlier the 
 <italic>altered</italic> behavior is perceived as the most convenient choice. On the other hand, ρ drives the delay (embedded in the imitation dynamics) between the time at which a strategy becomes more convenient and the time at which the strategy is adopted by the majority of the population. In sum, the time at which the transition between the two possible behaviors occurs is driven by 
 <italic>m</italic>, while the duration of this transition is driven by ρ; these two parameters together define the 
 <italic>responsiveness</italic> of the population to an epidemic outbreak.
