<p id="Par27">C57/BL TG mice expressing PBD-2 were generated by our lab previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Genomic DNA from mouse tail samples was extracted and used for identification of TG mice expressing PBD-2 by using primers NP03 (5′-GCTGGTTGTTGTGCTGTCTC-3′) and NP04 (5′-AGGTCCCTTCAATCCTGTTG-3′). At 6–8 weeks of age, TG mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) weighing 20 ± 2 g were intraperitoneally injected with 0.2 mL of PRV (2 × 10
 <sup>3.3</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL) each. Their wild-type (WT) littermates (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) were treated with the same amount of PRV each. Survival was assessed in two groups of mice daily for 10 days.
