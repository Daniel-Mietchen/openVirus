<p id="Par26">Synthetic mature PBD-2 peptide (DHYICAKKGGTCNFSPCPLFNRIEGTCYSGKAKCCIR, ChinaPeptides, Shanghai, China) was used to evaluate its antiviral activity against PRV. PRV stocks diluted in DPBS were preincubated with PBD-2 of different concentrations (5 μg/mL, 10 μg/mL, 20 μg/mL, 40 μg/mL, 80 μg/mL) at 37 °C for 1 h. The mixture was then added to a 96-well plate with 10,000 cells in each well (MOI = 0.1), and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for another 1 h. The inoculums were discarded and wells were washed with PBS before adding fresh maintenance medium. After 48 h, cell culture supernatants were collected for viral DNA isolation using a Quick-DNA/RNA Viral Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA). The resulting viral DNA was subjected to real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) along with a standard plasmid. The plasmid containing a glycoprotein D (gD) gene, a highly conservative gene of PRV, was serially diluted and subjected to RT-qPCR to generate a standard curve using the primers P1 (5′-CATCCTCACCGACTTCAT-3′) and P2 (5′-TACCAGTAGTTCACCACC-3′) for amplifying a part of gD gene which is 192 bp in length. The number of PRV copies was determined from the standard curve by converting the corresponding Ct value.</p>
