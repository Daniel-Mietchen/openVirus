<p id="Par25">Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) (DOJINDO, Shanghai, China) assay was used to determine cell viability in accordance with the manufactures’ instruction. Briefly, 100 μL of PK-15 cell suspension (6000 cells/well) was inoculated in a 96-well plate. After 4 h in culture, cells were attached to the bottom of the plate. Different concentrations of PBD-2 ranging from 5 to 80 μg/mL were subsequently added into the plate without the presence of FBS. Cells were co-incubated with PBD-2 at 37 °C for 16 h before adding 10 μL of the CCK-8 solution. After another three-hour incubation, the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (TECAN, Zürich, Switzerland). Cell viability (% of control) = [(absorbance of test sample - absorbance of blank)/(absorbance of control - absorbance of blank)] × 100%.</p>
