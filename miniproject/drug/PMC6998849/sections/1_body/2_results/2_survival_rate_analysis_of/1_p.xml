<p id="Par32">The antiviral effect of PBD-2 on the survival of mice infected with PRV was investigated. WT mice intraperitoneally infected with 0.2 mL of PRV (2 × 10
 <sup>3.3</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL) showed a survival rate of 25% while expression of PBD-2 increased the survival rate of TG mice to 75% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Thus, the results revealed that TG mice expression PBD-2 were more resistant to PRV infection than control mice.
