<p id="Par31">The cytotoxicity of PBD-2 on PK-15 was evaluated using CCK-8 assay. The cell viability analysis indicated that PBD-2 displayed no significant cytotoxicity on PK-15 cells at a maximum concentration of 80 μg/mL and at a minimum concentration of 5 μg/mL (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Then, PBD-2 of different concentrations were used to assess the antiviral effect against PRV in PK-15 cells. Compared with PRV without pretreatment of PBD-2, significant reduction in viral titer was observed when PRV was pre-incubated with 40 μg/mL and 80 μg/mL of PBD-2 (

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). These results indicated that PBD-2 at a relatively high concentration could significantly inhibit PRV proliferation in PK-15 cells without cytotoxicity activity.
