<p id="Par34">The pathological changes of WT mice and TG mice after PRV infection were also detected. Microglia nodules associated with neuronal degeneration and necrosis were observed in brain tissue of WT mice (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a) while neuron swelling, dissolution of Nissl bodies and basophilic inclusions were present in TG mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). Besides, necrosis of cells was found in spleen tissue of WT mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c) and TG mice showed a slight hyperemia in spleen (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). Degeneration of cells and congestion in the liver of WT mice were observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e) while there were no apparent lesions in that of TG mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f). Together, these results demonstrated that TG mice displayed milder tissue lesions than WT mice after PRV infection.
