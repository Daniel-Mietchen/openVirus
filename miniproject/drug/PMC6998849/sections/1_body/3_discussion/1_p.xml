<p id="Par35">The impact of PBD-2 on viral pathogenicity has not been well examined experimentally yet. A previous study has showed that PBD-2 exhibits antiviral ability against PRRSV when the concentration reaches 64 μg/mL [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Similarly, in this study, PBD-2 at 40 μg/mL and 80 μg/mL was found to inhibit PRV proliferation in PK-15 cells while no significant effect was observed for lower concentrations of PBD-2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). These indicate that a threshold concentration is required for PBD-2 to inhibit viral proliferation. According to the survivability, detectable virus copies and pathological changes, the TG mice displayed significantly increased resistance to PRV infection compared with the WT mice. Therefore, the antiviral effect of PBD-2 was confirmed both on cells and in TG mice expressing PBD-2. It has been revealed that defensins can direct inactive enveloped viruses by disrupting viral lipid bilayers [

According to the result, we hypothesize that PBD-2 might have a direct virucidal effect on PRV by damaging the viral envelopes. Besides, it may also affect PRV entry because PBD-2 was still present during the whole process of viral adsorption. Since PRV shared high structural and sequence similarity with other alphaherpesviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the antiviral mechanisms of other defensins against alphaherpesviruses would help understand how PBD-2 inhibited PRV proliferation. HNP-4 and HD-6 were capable of block HSV binding by interacting with heparan sulfate, the primary receptor for HSV binding, while HBD-3 with enhanced inhibitory effect against HSV bound both heparan sulfate and gB [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. HD-5 was able to prevent viral adhesion and entry of HSV by binding to both gB and gD [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Likewise, rabbit NP-1 and HNP-1, -2, -3 inactivated HSV by preventing viral entry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Retrocyclin 2 prevented HSV binding, entry and intercellular spread by binding carbohydrate moieties on glycoprotein B [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In general, these defensins prevent HSV infection by blocking viral binding, penetration or both. Whether PBD-2 is able to block viral binding and penetration by interacting with specific host membrane receptor(s) can be further studied.
