<p id="Par38">In summary, within this study, the antiviral effect of PBD-2 in vitro and in vivo were confirmed using PRV infection model. The technique of large-scale production of PBD-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and the existing transgenic pigs overexpressing PBD-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] have created possibilities for the application of PBD-2 as novel prophylactic and therapeutic methods against Aujeszkyâ€™s disease and other viral diseases. In addition, it is worthy of further studies on the underlying mechanism for the inhibitory effect of PBD-2 on PRV, which will offer more insights regarding antiviral effects of defensins.
