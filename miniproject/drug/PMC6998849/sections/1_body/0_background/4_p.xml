<p id="Par22">Although swine serves as the natural host and reservoir of PRV, mice are often utilized as a preferred model organism to study PRV infection because of their susceptibility to PRV. In this study, the effects of PBD-2 on the proliferation of PRV were investigated both in PK-15 cells and transgenic (TG) mice generated in our previous study [
