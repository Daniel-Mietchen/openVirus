<p id="Par19">Defensins are a group of cationic microbicidal peptides, which are constituted of 18–45 amino acids with three intramolecular disulfide bonds formed between pairs of conserved cysteine residues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Defensins in vertebrates are subdivided into α, β and θ defensins based on their spatial structure and disulfide connectivity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Within pigs, β defensin is the only subfamily of defensins which has been characterized so far [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Porcine β-defensin 2 (PBD-2) was first determined by sequence alignment with the existing sequence of porcine β-defensin 1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It was further identified that PBD-2 was distributed in different pig tissues using a polyclonal antibody against PBD-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The antimicrobial activity of PBD-2 against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria has been well described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. PBD-2 also exhibited immunomodulatory properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Our recent research demonstrated that PBD-2 could alleviate inflammation through interacting with toll-like receptor 4 and suppressing the downstream NF-κB signaling pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Additionally, it has been found that PBD-2 can attenuate proliferation of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in MA-104 cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Molecular docking evaluation has revealed that peptides derived from PBD-2 have the potential to be used to inhibit hepatitis E virus by interacting with its capsid protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, the effect of PBD-2 on virus proliferation in vivo remains unknown.
