<p>In immunocompetent individuals primary EBV infection or reactivation induces usually asymptomatic infection or infectious mononucleosis.
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In immunocompromised patients most EBV reactivations are subclinical and require no therapy.
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, it may be manifested as encephalitis/myelitis, pneumonia, hepatitis and EBV-associated tumors as PTLD.

 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> After transplantation 14–65% of recipients developed EBV reactivation,
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> while the incidence of EBV-PTLD varies from 0.45% to 29%, according to the source of hematopoietic cells, the associated cell manipulation, and the details of immunosuppressive regimens used.
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> We observed high incidence of EBV infection (22.7%) in allo-HCT patients, while there were no cases in auto-HCT setting. In 80.3% (143/175) of EBV reactivations rituximab was used and 93.3% of patients survived this infection. We also observed that in almost 1/3 of EBV reactivations, these episodes were preceded by other viral infection treated with antivirals, which did not prevent the development of significant EBV-DNA-emia with the need of rituximab treatment. This is clinically proven evidence that antiviral drugs do not prevent EBV reactivation in allo-HCT pediatric patients. Antiviral agents, such as ganciclovir, are not active against EBV, presumably because of low levels of viral thymidine kinase expression during lytic phase, and a lack of expression during latency.
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Intravenous immunoglobulins also have no impact in PTLD. Neither ganciclovir/foscarnet nor cidofovir therapy/prophylaxis have any impact on the development of EBV-PTLD, so antiviral agents are not recommended.
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Prospective monitoring of EBV-DNA-emia is recommended in patients after allo-HCT, and these patients should be closely monitored for symptoms and/or signs attributable to EBV infection and PTLD.
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The following pre-emptive therapies are recommended after high-risk allo-HCT: rituximab (375 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup>/weekly), reduction of immunosuppressive therapy (if possible), donor EBV-specific cytotoxic T-cells (EBV-CTL) infusion (if available).
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Compared with rituximab, adoptive cellular immunotherapy has higher response rate (50–88%) and fewer relapse.
