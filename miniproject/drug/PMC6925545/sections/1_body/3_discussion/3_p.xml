<p>We observed that CMV had the highest incidence from all viral infections. CMV is one of the most difficult infections that occur after allo-HCT.
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The CMV serostatus of the donor and recipient before transplantation significantly influence the incidence of CMV recurrence, whereas the immunosuppressive status of the recipient is the most important factor for CMV infection.
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Monitoring by a sensitive technique such as PCR tests of whole blood allows intervention before development of CMV disease. Pre-emptive therapy can be used as a standalone strategy or combined with antiviral prophylaxis. Recently, letermovir, given as prophylaxis, was shown to reduce the risk of clinically significant CMV infection.
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> We have shown that ganciclovir and foscarnetÂ were the most frequently used drugs in our cohort for the therapy of CMV reactivation; accordingly to currently recommended first-line pre-emptive treatment.
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Nevertheless, management of patients with resistant or refractory CMV infection or CMV disease is a challenge. Combination therapy (ganciclovir and foscarnet), cidofovir, leflunomide or artesunate can be considered in patients resistant or refractory to other second-line and third-line antiviral drugs, and immunosuppression should always be reduced, if possible.
