<p>RV and NoV are important pathogens of viral gastroenteritis in children. We observed that cumulative incidence of RV was 5% while NoV was 0.5%, treated only with symptomatic therapy and no deaths were observed. In other studies the incidence of RV infection varied from 2.3% in adult allo-HCT and auto-HCT recipients up to 19.6% in pediatric allo-HCT recipients.

No specific prophylaxis against RV- and NoV-related gastroenterocolitis is available; however, oral immunoglobulins and nitazoxanide were used in some studies.
