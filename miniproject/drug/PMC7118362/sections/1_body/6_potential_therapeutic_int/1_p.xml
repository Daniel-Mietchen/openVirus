<p>Isolation is the first and the most effective measure of containing SARS-CoV-2 infection (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>). Efficient surveillance is the prerequisite for impeding the source and spread of infections. It is important to highlight that older people living in long-term care facilities (such as nursing homes and rehabilitative centers), are particularly vulnerable populations who are at a higher risk for infection due to living in close proximity to others. Thus, long-term care facilities need to have special precautions and protocols to defend residents, employees, and visitors. In this respect the role of geriatricians is crucial for the prompt identification, isolation and care of suspected and confirmed patients affected by COVID-19 disease. This early identification is essential to limit as much as possible the spread of infection among residents in the longterm care facilities. The geriatricians have the responsibility to evaluate the health status of new residents before the admission to immediately identify if the subject suffers of any signs of respiratory disease, comprising fever, cough or dyspnea, too. For all the other residents it is mandatory to assess at least twice a day for the onset of a fever (â‰¥37oC), cough, dyspnea, and any other symptoms potentially correlated to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
