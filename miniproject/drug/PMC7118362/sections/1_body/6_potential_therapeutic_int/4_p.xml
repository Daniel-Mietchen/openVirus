<p>Recent studies have focused on the potential benefit of chloroquine, a largely used antimalarial drug, in the treatment of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. It has been previously reported that chloroquine could inhibit SARS-CoV and is studied for treating COVID-19 in some clinical studies in China. In a recent study, Gao and colleagues report that, in more than 100 patients, the chloroquine phosphate is better compared to the control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promoting a virus negative conversion, and shortening the disease course (

Chloroquine is utilized to prevent and to treat malaria and, at the same time, it is used as an anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus. Some evidences documented that it has potential antiviral properties enhancing endosomal pH needed for virus/cell fusion, as well as interfering with the glycosylation process of SARS-CoV cellular receptors (
