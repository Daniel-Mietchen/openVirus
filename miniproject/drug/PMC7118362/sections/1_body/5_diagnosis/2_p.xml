<p>Different specific and sensitive assays of the SARSCoV- 2 genome were proposed to detect viral RNA in clinical specimens. The sampling source and/or the method to perform the throat/nasal swab may affect RT-PCR testing results. Some studies report that the positive rate of RT-PCR for pharyngeal swab samples is about 60% in early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results suggest that RT-PCR test should be interpret with caution (
