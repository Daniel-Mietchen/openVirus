<p>The radiologic presentation of COVID-19 disease is different and sometime suddenly progressing (

Chest X-ray may be useful as an initial screening, but to assess the severity of the disease and better orientate the therapeutic choices and the use of the intensive care unit, the chest CT scan is mandatory. Most of patients suffer from at least two affected lobes and some patients have five affected lobes. The common manifestations observed in these patients are patchy ground glass opacities and eventually patchy consolidation which are mostly spread in the middle, peripheral and posterior area of the lung (

In second stage, diffuse and bilateral ground glass opacities and consolidation are evident in more than two lobes. In third stage, diffuse ground glass opacities and more dense consolidation are more numerous and evident. After these active stages, it is possible to observe an extensive ground glass opacities with consolidation progressively absorbed (
