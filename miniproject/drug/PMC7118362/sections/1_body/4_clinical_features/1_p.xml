<p>The range of clinical presentations of COVID-19 disease have been described varying from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory failure (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>). The common clinical manifestations include fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia, shortness of breath, sore throat, and headache. In addition, patients may have also gastrointestinal symptoms, with diarrhea and vomiting. Some patients may have taste and smell disturbances, too. While interstitial pneumonia is present in most COVID- 19 disease patients, pleuritic chest pain is present in only few cases.
