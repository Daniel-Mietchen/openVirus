<p>Apart of the genetic characteristics, the envelope spike (S) protein is really important for infectious mechanism of coronavirus. This S protein facilitates receptor binding and membrane fusion and it is important for inducing the host tropism and at the same time the transmission power (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>). Analogous to the known SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 utilize ACE2 as the entry point in the ACE2-expressing cells, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 share the similar life cycle with other SARS-CoV (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>). This high affinity of S protein for human ACE2 probably has facilitate the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in human populations. Increasingly, evidence shows continued human-to-human transmission, along with many disseminated cases across the entire globe (
