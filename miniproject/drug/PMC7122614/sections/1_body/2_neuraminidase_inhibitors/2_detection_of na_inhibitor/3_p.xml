 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. For oseltamivir, His274Tyr (based on N2 numbering) confers resistance in N1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>], whereas Arg292Lys and Glu119Val are the most common antiviral resistance mutations in N2-containing viruses (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">71.4</xref>). Because of the differences in interaction among drugs with the active enzyme site, varying patterns of cross-resistance are found for particular NA mutations. Importantly, zanamivir and laninamivir retain full inhibitory activity against variants with either the His274Tyr or Glu119Val mutation and partial activity against the Arg292Lys variant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>]. Viruses with a His274Tyr are also cross-resistant to peramivir. Antiviral resistance may be caused by a single resistance mutation or a combination of additional mutations, which may enhance the level resistance and/or causes multidrug resistance [
