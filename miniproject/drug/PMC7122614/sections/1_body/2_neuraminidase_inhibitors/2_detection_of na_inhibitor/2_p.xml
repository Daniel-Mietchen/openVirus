<p id="Par29">Besides the phenotypic resistance assay, numerous genotypic PCR-based resistance assays have been developed for detection of previously identified antiviral resistance mutations in NA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. As compared to the phenotypic assays, these types of assays are rapid and easy to perform, and they allow minor variant detection (~1–5 % of the quasispecies) with no requirement of an additional virus culture step. Unknown resistance patterns in newly emerging influenza subtypes or novel NA inhibitors cannot be identified using PCR-based resistance assays.
