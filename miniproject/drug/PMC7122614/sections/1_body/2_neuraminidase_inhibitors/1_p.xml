 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. This transition state analogue of the NA substrate sialic acid has served as the scaffold for the NA inhibitor derivatives [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. In vitro studies to determine the genetic antiviral resistance profiles of the NA inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir were initiated shortly after their development (reviewed in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Due to differences in drug binding interactions and structural differences in the enzyme active site, NA inhibitors show varying antiviral resistance profiles in NA that depend on virus type and subtype (reviewed in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]). Sequential passage in cell culture to select resistant variants found that changes in HA could confer resistance in vitro also [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. These HA changes are predominately found at the receptor binding site and thought to restore the functional balance between HA receptor-binding and NA receptor-destroying properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Mechanisms which influence the viral HA/NA functional balance may have played a role in the emergence of oseltamivir-resistant A/H1N1 viruses during the 2007–2008 season [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. The frequency and possible importance of resistance emergence during drug administration have been studied largely in the context of controlled clinical trials conducted in the late 1990s that served as the basis for approval of zanamivir and oseltamivir in 1999 and, more recently, for approval of laninamivir and peramivir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Although zanamivir and oseltamivir have been available in many countries since 1999, their use has been quite limited, except in Japan and during the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Clinical importance of antiviral resistance emergence was assessed when comparing clinical outcome of oseltamivir-treated patients infected with a susceptible or oseltamivir-resistant A/H1N1 virus during the 2007–2008 influenza season [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. A retrospective clinical study by Dharan et al. showed that patients infected with an oseltamivir-susceptible virus (
 <italic>n</italic> = 182) had significantly fewer days of fever if treated with oseltamivir (
 <italic>n</italic> = 64) as compared to non-treated patients (
 <italic>n</italic> = 93;
 <italic>P</italic> = 
 <italic>0.02</italic>). In contrast, patients infected with an oseltamivir-resistant viruses (
 <italic>n</italic> = 44) did not benefit from oseltamivir treatment (
 <italic>n</italic> = 43; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.5) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Similar finding was reported in a study by Saito et al. where a reduction of fever on days 3–6 was reported in treated oseltamivir-susceptible A/H1N1-infected patients (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), but not in the patients infected with the oseltamivir-resistant A/H1N1 virus strain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. This oseltamivir-resistant A/H1N1 virus variant with an NA H275Y amino acid change emerged first in Norway during the 2007–2008 season and was able to spread rapidly in humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. As it became the dominant variant, it was suggested that the oseltamivir-resistant virus was able to spread more easily in the population than wild type [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. This was unexpected, as both in vitro and in vivo animal studies had claimed reduced virulence and transmissibility of NA inhibitor-resistant viruses before the beginning of 2007–2008 influenza season [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>–
