<p id="Par38">Ribavirin would also be expected to be inhibitory for influenza A and B viruses resistant to the NA inhibitors, but there are no reports of its use in human influenza infections due to such variants. Ribavirin combined with a NA inhibitor exerts additive to synergistic antiviral activity in vitro [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">189</xref>]. A more recent study found that a combination of ribavirin and oseltamivir was no more effective than ribavirin alone against a lethal influenza A(H1N1) infection but superior to single agents against influenza B [

Further studies of such ribavirin-NA inhibitor or T-705-NA inhibitor combinations (see below) are warranted to determine whether this strategy offers the possibility of treating severe influenza, particularly that due to M2 inhibitor-resistant viruses. Recently, triple combinations of amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir have been studied in vitro, in vivo, and in humans with influenza infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">190</xref>]. Given the promise of this combination, a prospective phase 2 study is ongoing to assess the safety and clinical efficacy of this combination for the treatment of influenza. Combination therapy has been demonstrated to reduce the development of resistance in clinical studies and therefore may be of benefit in populations at increased risk of development of resistance emergences [
