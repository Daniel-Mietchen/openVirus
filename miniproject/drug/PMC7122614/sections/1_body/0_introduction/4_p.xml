<p id="Par5">Several new classes of antivirals, many with novel mechanisms of action, are currently undergoing development. Resistance mutations have been identified for many of these agents from inÂ vitro passage experiments, but clinical evidence of resistance emergence is still in its infancy. The following sections review clinical and epidemiological data on antiviral resistance for the three classes of available anti-influenza agents. Information from experimental animal models of influenza is incorporated to supplement the limited data derived from clinical studies.</p>
