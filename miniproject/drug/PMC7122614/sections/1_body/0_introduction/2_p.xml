<p id="Par3">Factors that influence the clinical and epidemiologic importance of drug-resistant influenza viruses include the magnitude of phenotypic resistance, its frequency and rapidity of emergence, its stability and ability of resistant variants to compete with wild-type virus in the absence of selective drug pressure, and the effects of resistance mutations on viral replication competence, pathogenicity, and transmissibility in vivo. Prior to being replaced by the pandemic 2009 A/H1N1 virus, most circulating seasonal A/H1N1 viruses in the 2008–2009 season contained the His275Tyr mutation and were therefore highly resistant to oseltamivir while retaining susceptibility to zanamivir. All currently circulating A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 viruses have mutations conferring M2 inhibitor resistance. There is no data to date indicating that M2 inhibitor resistance is associated with worsened viral virulence, atypical influenza, or enhanced transmissibility. Sporadic viruses with primary resistance mutations resulting in neuraminidase inhibitor resistance have been described. Most but not all NA mutations conferring resistance in clinical isolates have been associated with reduced infectivity, replication, and pathogenicity in animal models of influenza. Such features are important not only in clinical management of individual patients but also are key factors that need to be considered by health authorities and governments when making decisions regarding the stockpiling of antivirals for response to pandemics or other influenza threats [
