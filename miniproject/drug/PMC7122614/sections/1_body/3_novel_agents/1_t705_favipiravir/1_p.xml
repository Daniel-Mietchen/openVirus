<p id="Par39">Favipiravir (T-705; 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide) is an antiviral drug that is phosphoribosylated by cellular enzymes to its active form, favipiravir-ribofuranosyl-5′-triphosphate (RTP), and selectively inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of influenza virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">191</xref>]. It is highly active against seasonal strains A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and influenza B; the 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 virus; highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A/H5N1 isolated from humans; A/H1N1 and A/H1N2 isolated from swine; and A/H2N2, A/H4N2, and A/H7N2. The antiviral is active against viruses that are resistant to amantadine, rimantadine, oseltamivir, and zanamivir, in addition to dually resistant viruses (M2 and NA inhibitor resistant) [

In studies of serial passage of two seasonal (A/Brisbane/59/2007 and A/New Jersey/15/2007) and two 2009 pandemic (A/Denmark/524/2009 and A/Denmark/528/2009) A/H1N1 viruses in MDCK cell lines in the presence or absence of low concentrations of favipiravir, no favipiravir-resistant viruses were phenotypically or genotypically (PB1, PB2, PA, and NP sequencing) detected. Sequence analysis, though, did demonstrate an enrichment of G → A and C → T transversion mutations, increased mutation frequency, and a shift of the nucleotide profiles of individual NP gene clones under drug selection pressure [

The drug is currently licensed in Japan for use selectively when approved by the Ministry of Health; studies of efficacy are ongoing in the rest of the world with the goal of seeking regulatory approval in the near future.
