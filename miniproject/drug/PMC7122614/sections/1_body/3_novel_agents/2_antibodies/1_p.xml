<p id="Par40">Recent studies have reported the development of neutralizing antibodies to specifically target conserved regions of the virus HA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">194</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">195</xref>]. HA binding of the antibodies was elegantly shown by X-ray crystal structures of HA-antibody protein complexes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR196">196</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR197">197</xref>]. These antibodies differ in their recognition sites: Some are targeted to the sialic acid RBS and globular head, while others bind to the stalk region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">195</xref>]. As the stalk region is more conserved between different HA subtypes, cross-reactive immunity against several influenza subtypes may be obtained with broadly neutralizing capacities. Although the antibodies are being developed against conserved regions of HA, mutations do arise at the antibody target sites, which may result in viral escape.
