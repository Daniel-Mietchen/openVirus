<p id="Par42">Lessons learned from the 2009 pandemic suggest that there is a significantly higher frequency of antiviral resistance emergence in the pandemic virus compared to interpandemic influenza. Further, the clinical and epidemiologic implications of antiviral resistance in a future pandemic influenza virus cannot be predicted with confidence. As a result, the great progress made in developing global systems to rapidly monitor the susceptibility patterns of circulating strains needs to be maintained and potentially expanded to include regions with sparse surveillance [
