<p id="Par44">Given the current pattern of antiviral susceptibility in circulating strains, M2 inhibitors should not be utilized for the prevention or treatment of influenza, while any of the neuraminidase inhibitors should be considered whenever therapy is indicated. Such therapy should be started as early as possible to improve the benefit obtained from the use of the therapy. Given its slightly broader activity against most oseltamivir-resistant variants, zanamivir would be the preferred therapy for patients with proven or suspected oseltamivir-resistant influenza. Novel agents, optimally with novel mechanisms of action, need to be developed. Drugs in advance stages of development include the polymerase inhibitor favipiravir [
