<p id="Par43">A number of unanswered questions remain regarding antiviral drug resistance in influenza viruses. With contemporary next-generation sequencing, it is possible to understand the kinetics of the emergence of resistance from minor variant populations to the predominant population in a given host. Such data can inform the optimal timing of screening and intervention. Specific risk factors beyond generic concepts, such as immunocompromised and young age, should be identified that predict the emergence of resistance. From a therapeutic perspective, the optimal approach, including the duration of therapy and the benefit of combination therapy in patients with severe illness or who are predicted to have prolonged shedding, needs to be carefully studied. Currently, there is a significant gap in the capacity to test specimens for resistance, and as a result, many patients with potential resistance may be missed. As a result, there is a desperate need for susceptibility assays that can be utilized broadly in the clinical laboratory. Lastly, there is need for ongoing and expanded surveillance of antiviral susceptibility patterns in human and animal influenza viruses, especially community isolates in countries with higher antiviral use, and for resistance transmission in high-risk epidemiologic settings.</p>
