<p id="Par15">Studies in experimentally infected animals and treated humans have documented the common emergence of resistant variants as the course of infection progresses over time. Following treatment, approximately 70â€“90 % of amino acid substitutions in resistant viruses occur at position 31, and about 10 % each are found at positions 27 and 30 [
