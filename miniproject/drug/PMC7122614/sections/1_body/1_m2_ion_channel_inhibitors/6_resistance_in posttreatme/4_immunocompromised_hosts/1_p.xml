<p id="Par18">Resistant influenza A viruses may be shed for prolonged periods in immunocompromised hosts, who can serve as a reservoir for nosocomial transmission. One study of adult bone marrow transplant and acute leukemia patients recovered resistant virus in 5 (33 %) of 15 M2 inhibitor-treated patients and in 5 (83 %) of 6 patients with illness who shed virus for ≥3 days [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The median time between the first and last virus isolation was 7 days with range up to 44 days. Death associated with influenza occurred in 2 of 5 (40 %) patients with resistant virus, compared to 5 of 24 (21 %) without, and prolonged illness was noted in several with protracted shedding. Other reports have documented prolonged shedding of resistant variants in immunocompromised hosts with or without continued drug exposure, including one transplanted SCID child who shed for 5 weeks and one adult leukemia patient who shed resistant virus for ≥1 week of therapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Another case report documented recovery of resistant virus &gt;1 month after cessation of a course of amantadine, as well as shedding of mixtures of wild-type virus and variants with different resistance genotypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Heterogeneous populations of resistant variants with sequential or dual mutations have been found in several immunocompromised hosts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. One stem cell transplant recipient shed dually M2 inhibitor and oseltamivir-resistant virus for at least 5 months and probably over 1 year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The prolonged shedding of resistant variants in immunocompromised hosts is consistent with the genetic stability of such variants observed in experimental animal models [
