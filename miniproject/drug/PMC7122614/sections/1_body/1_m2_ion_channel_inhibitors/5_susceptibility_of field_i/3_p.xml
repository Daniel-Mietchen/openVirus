<p id="Par13">M2 proteins show considerable evolution in human and swine viruses, and the H3 and H1 subtype viruses have phylogenetically different M2 proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. This may influence the mutations that are more advantageous for conferring M2 inhibitor resistance. A characteristic feature of A/H1N1, A/H1N2, and A/H3N2 swine viruses circulating in Europe since 1987 has been the presence of Ser31Asn mutation, as well as Lys27Ala in some isolates, that confers resistance to M2 inhibitors [

The postulated role of swine as intermediate hosts in the emergence of some novel human viruses and direct interspecies transmission from birds may be another mechanisms for a reassortment event leading to acquisition of an M gene encoding resistance in a human strain [
