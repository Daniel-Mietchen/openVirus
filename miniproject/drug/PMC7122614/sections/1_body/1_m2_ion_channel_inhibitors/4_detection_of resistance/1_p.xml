<p id="Par9">There are currently no rapid tests that can screen for and identify the presence of M2 inhibitor resistance. M2 resistance may be diagnosed using phenotypic assays or gene sequencing. Most phenotypic assays, including plaque reduction, yield reduction, and ELISA, utilize the growth of virus in cell culture exposed to a range of concentrations of the drug of interest; these assays are not widely available. Pyrosequencing methods for rapid analysis of mutations in the M2 gene associated with resistance have been described and are used in several reference laboratories [

As a result, most clinicians rely on data generated from groups actively monitoring the resistance among circulating strainâ€”in the United States this is actively done by the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (
