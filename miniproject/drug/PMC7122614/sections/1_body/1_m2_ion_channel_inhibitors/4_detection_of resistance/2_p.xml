<p id="Par10">Detection of M2 inhibitor resistance has usually relied on virus isolation from respiratory samples and susceptibility testing of virus in cell culture. Several assays have been described including plaque reduction, yield reduction, and ELISA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Following phenotypic analysis, genotypic M2 inhibitor resistance has been confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis of the M2 gene and detection of the characteristic mutations. Genotypic detection can be accomplished quickly by the use of PCR restriction length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of RNA extracted from respiratory samples using commercially available endonucleases for discrimination of point mutations in the M2 gene [
