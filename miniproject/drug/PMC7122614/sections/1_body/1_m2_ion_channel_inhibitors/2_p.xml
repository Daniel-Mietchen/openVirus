<p id="Par7">Mutations in the M2 inhibitor gene at one of five commonly recognized sites (position 26, 27, 30, 31, or 34 of the M2 protein) in human viruses result in reduced binding of the M2 inhibitors or in enlargement of the pore diameter. The function of the M2 pore of viruses with any of the mutations is preserved in the presence of the inhibitor [
