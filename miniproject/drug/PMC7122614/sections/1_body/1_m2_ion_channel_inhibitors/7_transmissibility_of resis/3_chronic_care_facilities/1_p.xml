<p id="Par21">Transmission of M2 inhibitor-resistant viruses is well documented in nursing home outbreaks of influenza A and may be manifested by a persistent or an increasing number of virus-positive patients despite amantadine prophylaxis. The recovery of the same genotype of resistant virus from multiple patients on prophylaxis or from patients or staff not receiving drug indicates ongoing transmission in this setting [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. This particularly true with multiple isolations of a less commonly observed resistant variant, as was found with nine isolates of a Leu26Phe variant in one nursing home outbreak [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. The frequency of instances in which amantadine or rimantadine has failed to control outbreaks because of resistance emergence is not well defined, although existing studies demonstrate a range of protective efficacy from 59 to 76 % [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Studies have demonstrated patients who developed infections with resistant viruses, typically with the Ser31Asn mutation, in 16–28 % of residents’ long-term care where M2 inhibitors were used during an outbreak [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Such findings emphasize the importance of proper isolation of treated persons and of using NA inhibitors for treatment of ill persons.
