<p id="Par6">The M2 ion channel allows the influx of protons into the viral particle which, in turn, facilitates uncoating [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. M2 inhibitors bind to the M2 ion channel and limit the influx of protons resulting in its antiviral effect. Since the M2 protein is present only on influenza A viruses, M2 inhibitors have no activity against influenza B [

Early studies demonstrated that influenza variants with high-level resistance to amantadine and rimantadine could be selected in the laboratory though in vitro and in vivo passage in virus in the presence of the drug [
