<p>Prior to experiments with RABV challenge, 0.1 mg/kg of TMR-001 was tested without RABV challenge to ensure no neurological side effects or adverse events were observed that could interfere with the challenge study (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00177">Table S1</xref>). Group size was six animals and route of administration was different for each group: intramuscular (IM), intraperitoneal (IP), or IV every 24 h for 10 days. Animals were anesthetized with 1.5â€“5% isoflurane for IP and IV administration. For IV administration, the catheter was flushed with twice the capacity of sterile saline to ensure the drug entered the vein and 0.04 mL lock solution. For IM administration, animals were restrained and 0.1 mL was injected into the gluteal muscle in the left hind leg. All IM injections were done using a tuberculin syringe and needle not exceeding 28 gauge (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). All groups were observed once daily for 28 days. Animals from the IP group were reused in subsequent challenge experiments after 28 days.
