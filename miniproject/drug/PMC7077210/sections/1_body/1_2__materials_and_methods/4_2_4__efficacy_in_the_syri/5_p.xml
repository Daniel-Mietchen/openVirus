<p>For the RABV challenge study, the group size was 12 female hamsters and the route of administration was different for each group as described above; an additional untreated control group was also included. Starting on day 0, 0.1 mg/kg of TMR-001 was administered by each route, as described above, every 24 h for 10 days. On day 1, all animals were anesthetized with 1.5–5% isoflurane and infected IM in the gluteal muscle of the left hind leg with 10
 <sup>3.5</sup> mouse intracranial LD
 <sub>50</sub> (50 µL) of canine rabies virus strain TX coyote 323R. This dose was previously determined to be lethal by the intramuscular route in the hamster model. Starting on the day of infection, animals were observed once a day, and from 7 to 21 days after infection animals were observed twice daily for clinical signs of rabies. Animals were euthanized by isoflurane overdose at the first clinical signs of rabies (e.g., paresis, paralysis, seizure), according to euthanasia criteria or at the termination of the experiment. Euthanasia was confirmed by lack of heartbeat and respiration. For hamsters not immediately undergoing necropsy, thoracotomy was used as secondary verification of euthanasia. During necropsy, the brain was harvested to confirm rabies diagnosis by the direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test [
