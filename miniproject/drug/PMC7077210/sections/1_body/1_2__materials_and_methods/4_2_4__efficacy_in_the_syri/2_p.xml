<p>Animals were individually identified by implanting a microchip (Bio Medic Data System, Seaford, DE, USA) except those in IV administration groups, which were individually housed and identified by cage numbers. The microchip was preloaded in a syringe, animals were anesthetized with 1.5â€“5% isoflurane using a vaporizer, and the microchip was injected subcutaneously on the back. After all procedures involving anesthesia, animals were monitored continuously until fully recovered and once per day for three days after implant. </p>
