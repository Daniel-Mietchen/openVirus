<p>An approved animal use protocol was established with the CDCâ€™s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #2758SMIMULC-A4). Female, six-week-old, LVG Syrian hamsters were purchased from Charles River Laboratory (Wilmington, MA, USA). Animals in the intravenous (IV) treatment group underwent survival surgery at Charles River Laboratory to insert a jugular vein catheter before arriving at CDC. Hamsters without jugular vein catheters were randomly assigned to groups containing six or 12 animals (based on the design described below). We have found the hamster model to be more reproducible than mouse models, and Syrian hamsters are well-established in the literature for rabies pathogenesis studies and the evaluation of biologics. </p>
