<p>Confluent monolayers of BSR cells were treated with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and diluted to 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> live cells/mL as described above. A total of 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells (0.1 mL) were added to 0.4 mL DMEM-10 in each well of an eight-well camber slide and incubated 24 h at 37 °C and 0.5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The medium was removed, and 29 µM–2.9 pM of TMR-001 was added in 10-fold serial dilutions to each well in duplicate for 24 h preinfection treatment and in duplicate for simultaneous treatment. Rabies virus ERA diluted in DMEM-10 was added at MOI = 0.1 to each well of simultaneous treatment slides and in duplicate for 24 h postinfection treatment (

Simultaneous treatment slides were incubated for 48 h, while the 24 h preinfection and 24 h postinfection treatment slides were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and 0.5% CO

Slides were observed at 200× magnification under a fluorescent microscope and clusters of greater than two adjacent infected cells (indicating cell-to-cell spread) were counted in each well and compared to counts from virus-only control wells. Stored supernatant was titrated as described previously [
