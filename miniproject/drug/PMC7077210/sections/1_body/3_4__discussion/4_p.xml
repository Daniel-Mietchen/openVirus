<p>This study further supports the need to understand the mechanism of action of potential antiviral compounds when the infections cross the BBB. RABV-specific antiviral compounds, which are viricidal, will most likely have to pass through the BBB to be effective, particularly for IV or oral routes of administration [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00177" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Alternatively, this effect may be overcome by direct administration into the cerebrospinal fluid. In a mouse model, administration of mannitol was shown to increase the permeability of the BBB but had no effect on RABV challenge [

 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00177" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], or RNases could be linked to other proteins or antibodies to better target RABV infection [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00177" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Future studies could incorporate changes to TMR-001, increased concentrations, and increased permeability of the BBB to potentially improve clinical outcomes. Further studies could evaluate the effects of RNases to prevent rabies in other animal models as this study was confined to the Syrian hamster model.
