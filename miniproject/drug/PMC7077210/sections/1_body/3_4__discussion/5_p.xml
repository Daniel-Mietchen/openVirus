<p>Recently interest in favipiravir as an RABV antiviral [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00177" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] has increased after reports of human rabies survivors treated with this drug [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00177" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Additional, studies of favipiravir showed in vitro inhibition of RABV but no effect on rabies survival in a mouse model [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00177" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00177" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00177" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Recently, in vivo imaging was used to show favipiravir suppressed RABV replication in the periphery, but double or triple the dose was required to suppress replication in the CNS [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00177" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Another recent study also showed in vitro efficacy but limited effect in vivo of antimicrobial peptides dermaseptins against RABV in a mouse model [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00177" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. These studies demonstrate that the in vivo delivery of rabies antivirals in animal models is a confounding factor that must be addressed in future rabies antiviral studies.
