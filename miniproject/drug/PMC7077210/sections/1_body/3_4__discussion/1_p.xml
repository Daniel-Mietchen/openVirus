<p>Relatively little work has previously examined the effect of ribonucleases on RABV. In 1965, Enright, et al. observed that a strain of mice resistant to rabies virus infection had higher ribonuclease activity in the peripheral blood leucocytes and serum than a susceptible strain [

RABV release was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner in neuronal cells (MNA), epithelial cells (BSR), and primary fibroblast cells (E03E), and cell-to-cell spread was inhibited in BSR cells. In previous studies, ranpirnase (TMR-004) protected mice at 0.1 mg/kg from an Ebola virus challenge [
