<p>Since both RABV release into the supernatant and cell-to-cell infection were inhibited, the efficacy of ranpirnase to prevent rabies in the Syrian hamster model was assessed. First, a pilot study was completed to ensure TMR-001 treatment in uninfected animals did not cause any unexpected toxicity or clinical signs that could complicate observations of rabies clinical signs. Based on a study in mice using a different form of ranpirnase [
