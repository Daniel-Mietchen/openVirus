<p>In addition to virus released in the supernatant, the effect of ranpirnase TMR-001 treatment on RABV cell-to-cell infection in BSR cells was also measured by counting the clusters of infected cells and comparing counts to virus-only controls at each time point. This method was chosen based on an approximate 24 h replication cycle for RABV strain ERA. Using this method, all treatment groups had decreased cell-to-cell infection with increasing amounts of TMR-001, with almost no cell-to-cell infection observed at the highest concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00177-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). Of the three treatment groups, 24 h postinfection had consistently lower cell-to cell infection at each concentration. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> for cell-to-cell infection was 600 nM, 100 nM, and 20 nM for 24 h preinfection, simultaneous, and 24 h postinfection treatment, respectively. The amount of cell-to-cell infection was not significantly different between the different treatment time points (two-way ANOVA Tukeyâ€™s adjusted
