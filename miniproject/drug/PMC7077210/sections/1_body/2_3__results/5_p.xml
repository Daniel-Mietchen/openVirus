 <sub>50</sub> RABV and were treated with TMR-001 starting 24 h preinfection and continuing once per day for 10 days. The same dose (0.1 mg/kg) and routes (IV, IP, IM) were used as described above. Animals were euthanized when clinical signs of rabies were first identified, between days 9 and 13 postinfection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00177-f004">Figure 4</xref>) as was expected based on previous experience with the hamster model. All animals euthanized with clinical signs of rabies were positive for rabies virus antigen in the brain stem by the DFA test. One animal, from the IM group, survived to 14 days postinfection without any clinical signs of rabies but was euthanized due to lack of significant differences between the groups. This animal was tested by DFA and confirmed negative for rabies virus antigen in the brain stem at the time of euthanasia. Continuation of the experiment could not be justified because, whether the animal succumbed later or survived to the end point (45 days postinfection), the statistical significance of the groups would not change.
