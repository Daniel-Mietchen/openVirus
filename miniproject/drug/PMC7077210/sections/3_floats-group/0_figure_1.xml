  <p>Time of treatment method. For cells treated 24 h preinfection, BSR cells (a clone of baby hamster kidney cells) were seeded in each well of an 8-well slide on day 1 and incubated overnight. On day 2, cells were treated with TMR-001 and incubated overnight. On day 3, treated cells were infected with rabies virus (RABV) strain Evelyn–Rokitnicki–Abelseth (ERA) and incubated for 48 h. On day 5, supernatant was collected, and cells were fixed and stained. For cells treated with TMR-001 simultaneously to infection, BSR cells were seeded in each well of an 8-well slide on day 1 and incubated overnight. On day 2, cells were treated with TMR-001, infected with RABV strain ERA, and incubated for 48 h. On day 4, supernatant was collected, and cells were fixed and stained. For cells treated 24 h postinfection, BSR cells were seeded in each well of an 8-well slide on day 1 and incubated overnight. On day 2, cells were infected with RABV strain ERA and incubated overnight. On day 3, infected cells were treated with TMR-001 and incubated overnight. On day 4, supernatant was collected, and cells were fixed and stained.</p>
