  <p>Inhibition of rabies virus release by TMR-001. TMR-001 was added 24 h preinfection at the given concentrations to a clone of baby hamster kidney cells (BSR), mouse neuroblastoma cells (MNA) and bat primary fibroblast cells (E03E). Culture supernatant was sampled at 24, 48, and 72 h postinfection. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50), 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) and the 50% selective index (SI50) were calculated for each condition. The virus concentration in the supernatant was measured in fluorescent foci units per mL (ffu/mL) using direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining of MNA cells 24 h postinfection. The average and standard deviation were calculated from the log transformed data of six statistical replicates from at least two biological replicates and plotted on a linear axis. Comparison (2-way ANOVA, Dunnett’s adjusted 
   <italic>p</italic>-values) of each concentration to the 0 µM TMR-001 (PBS) control are shown as &lt;0.05 (*), &lt;0.01 (**), &lt;0.001 (***), &lt;0.0001 (****). Note that no virus was detected in any of the replicates for BSR cells treated with 3 µM TMR-001 at 72 h postinfection, MNA cells treated with 10 µM TMR-001 at 72 h postinfection, as well as E03E cells treated with 10 µM TMR-001 at 24 h and 48 h postinfection.
