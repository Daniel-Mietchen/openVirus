<p id="Par25">Chinese herbal medicines have been reported to inhibit and destroy pathogenic microorganisms. Numerous Chinese herbal medicines have been widely used for the prevention and cure of viral diseases in China and other Asian countries for thousands of years. The newly identified dibenzocyclooctane lignan kadsurindutins A (1) isolated from the stems of 
 <italic>Kadsura induta</italic> was found to exert antiviral effects against Hepatitis B Virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Moreover, samarangenin B (Sam B), isolated from 
 <italic>Limonium sinense,</italic> has antiviral function and can suppress HSV-1 replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Moreover, berberine, 
 <italic>Coptidis rhizome</italic>, and Ching-Wei-San have antiviral effects against HSV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], whereas polyphenolic compounds isolated from 
 <italic>Saxifraga melanocentra</italic> have anti-HCV activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In total, 11 chemical constituents isolated from 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> have antiviral effects on influenza A1 virus (FM1) and five chemical constituents isolated from 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> have antiviral effects against RSV in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> also has antiviral effects on influenza virus, HCMV, HSV-1, and HSV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This study found that the 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide can inhibit PRV infection and kill this virus. These results showed that this extract might contain one or more broad-spectrum antiviral agents. Mechanistically, some of the active chemical constituents or biologically active components of 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide probably enhance protective immunity in response to virus infection. To address this, liquid chromatography is the preferred method for the analysis of compounds from Chinese herbal medicines. The polar and thermally-unstable compounds can be fractionated by capillary electrophoresis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, the isolation and characterization of highly effective compounds and the accurate determination of the composition of active ingredients from Chinese herbal medicines is still a major problem. After separating these effective components, they can be used not only for PRV, but could also be tested against some human viruses such as human influenza virus or HIV. These effective broad-spectrum antiviral agents might thus provide a new treatment option for human viruses.
