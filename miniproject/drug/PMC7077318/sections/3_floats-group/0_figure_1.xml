  <p>Structure of GC376 and the inhibitory effect of GC376 on the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) 3CL
   <sup>pro</sup> determined by FRET assays. (
   <bold>A</bold>) GC376 is a dipeptidyl bisulfite adduct salt that showed excellent inhibitory effects on some picornaviruses and coronaviruses in enzymatic or cell-based assays and (
   <bold>B</bold>) an enzyme (100 nM) and a fluorescent peptide substrate (40 μM) were used in the FRET assay, and the concentration of GC376 ranged from 0.03 μM to 80 μM. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
   <sub>50</sub>) was calculated using GraphPad Prism5 to assess inhibition ratios at different inhibitor concentrations. The error bars show the S.D. of the results from three replicates.
