  <p>Structure alignment between the PEDV 3CL
   <sup>pro</sup>–GC376 and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) 3CL
   <sup>pro</sup>–GC376. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The structure of PEDV 3CL
   <sup>pro</sup>–GC376 (red) is superimposed with the complex structure of TGEV 3CL
   <sup>pro</sup>–GC376 (blue). GC376 is shown as sticks with balls, and the residues of 3CL
   <sup>pro</sup> involved in binding with GC376 are labeled and shown as lines. The conserved residues between the two 3CL
   <sup>pro</sup>s are labeled in black and nonconserved residues are labeled in different colors. The black arrows indicate the structural deviation of the Leu side chain and 6-membered aromatic ring of GC376 between the two structures and (
   <bold>B</bold>) the root mean square deviation (RMSD) values for the residues involved in the GC376 binding of the two structures.
