<p>It is reported that GC376 shows excellent antiviral activities against the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and the structure of TGEV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>–GC376 complex is determined [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We compared the binding between the PEDV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>–GC376 complex and TGEV-3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>–GC376 complex. Most of the residues forming the substrate-binding pocket were conserved, and the two 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>s showed a highly similar binding mode for GC376 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00240-f006">Figure 6</xref>A). The RMSD values of the most listed residues between the two proteases were approximately 0.4 Å, and three residues from a loop (T47, I51 and Y53) showed RMSD values higher than 1 Å (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00240-f006">Figure 6</xref>B). Some of the nonconserved residues, such as Q163 of the PEDV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> and H163 of the TGEV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, formed similar hydrogen bonding interactions between the main chain oxygen and GC376. Overall, there were two relatively obvious differences: a. the loop (46-49) was stable, and water-mediated contacts were observed between Thr 47 and GC376 in the TGEV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>–GC376 complex, which have also been found in the norovirus (NV) 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> and picornavirus (PV) 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> in complex with GC376 [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]; however, the loop (46-49) was flexible, and only hydrophobic interactions were observed in the PEDV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>-GC376 complex. b. The Asn 141 residue, which has a side chain that protrudes into the pocket, resulted in a narrower entrance in the PEDV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> than that in the TGEV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, which has an Ala 141 residue instead (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00240-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The two differences cause small structural deviations in the Leu side chain and the 6-membered aromatic ring of GC376 between the two structures, respectively. At the same time, the differences influenced the size of the entrance to the pocket, which might affect the efficiency of the entry and release of the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> substrate.
