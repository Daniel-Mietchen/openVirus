<p>Compared with the sequence of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> from the FJZZ strain, the sequences for 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> from the YN144 strain and CV777 strain were identified to differ by one and six residues, respectively. All of the different residues were far from the substrate-binding site of the PEDV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> (PDB: 4ZUH, FJZZ strain) and might not cause obvious differences in enzymatic activities; thus, we used the PEDV FJZZ 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> stored in our laboratory for inhibition assays. The results indicated that GC376 exerted strong inhibitory effects on the PEDV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of approximately 1.11 Î¼M (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00240-f001">Figure 1</xref>), which was comparable to the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of other coronaviruses reported in a previous study [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].
