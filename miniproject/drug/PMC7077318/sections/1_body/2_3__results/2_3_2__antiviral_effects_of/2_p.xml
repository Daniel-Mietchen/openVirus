<p>Western blot assays were introduced to further quantify the antiviral effects of GC376 on the two viruses. Both of the viral nucleocapsid proteins were decreased in a similar dose-dependent manner with increasing GC376 concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00240-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,B). The N proteins showed significant reductions at 12.5 μM and were almost undetectable at 25 μM. The results further indicated that GC376 had similar inhibitory effects on the two PEDV virus strains with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of approximately 12.5 μM, which was consistent with that of the cell-based IC
 <sub>50</sub> measurement assays. Since GC376 showed similar effects against the two PEDV strains, we performed IFA with one of the PEDV strains, YN144. Compared with the non-drug-treated cells, GC376 reduced virus infection at 1.56 μM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00240-f003">Figure 3</xref>C). It almost completely inhibited virus replication at approximately 6.25 μM, and cell syncytosis disappeared; 12.5 μM GC376 abolished the infection.
