<p>To elucidate the inhibitory mechanism and provide a structural model for further inhibitor optimization of GC376 against the PEDV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, we determined the structure of the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>–GC376 complex (1.65 Å). Investigation into the substrate-binding site revealed a prominent electron density for GC376 in two monomers, especially in subunit A (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00240-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). The interface area between the PEDV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> and GC376 was 373 Å
 <sup>2</sup>, and the buried surface of GC376 took up 76% of the total solvent-accessible area (computed using the PDBePISA tool, 
 <uri xlink:href="http://pdbe.org/pisa/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://pdbe.org/pisa/</uri>). As the 6-membered aromatic ring of GC376 occupied the place of the PEDV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> substrate P3 residue, whose side chain usually points to the solvent, it contributed little to the interface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00240-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). The glutamine surrogate ring and the leucine of GC376 fit comfortably into the S1 and S2 binding sites, respectively. However, in subunit B, there was no density for the 6-membered aromatic ring of GC376, and only part of the density was available for the glutamine surrogate ring (data not shown). These detailed interactions were analyzed using PyMOL and the LigPlot
 <sup>+</sup> program (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00240-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The bisulfite group of GC376 was removed, and the compound formed a covalent bond with Cys 144. Hydrophobic interactions were extensive between the protease and the compound (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00240-f004">Figure 4</xref>D). Four residues of the PEDV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, Cys 144, His 162, Gln 163 and Glu 165, are involved in the hydrogen bond interactions with GC376 (
