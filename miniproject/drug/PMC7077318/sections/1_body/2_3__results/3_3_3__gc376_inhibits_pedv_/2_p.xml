<p>Superposition of the PEDV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>-GC376 complex with the previously reported apo-PEDV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> structure (PDB: 4XFQ) yielded root mean square deviations (RMSDs) of 0.31 Å and 0.18 Å between the Cα atoms for chains A and B, respectively. This finding indicated that no large conformational change in the overall structure occurred upon ligand binding. However, examination of the substrate-binding pocket between chains A and B of the PEDV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>-GC376 complex revealed a structural difference in the loop composed of residues 44–52 (ASSTTSTID). Interestingly, there was only electron density (contoured at 1.0 σ) for the 46–48 residues (STT) of chain A but not for chain B. This result suggests that the part of the loop is flexible and that its orientation directly influences the entrance size of the substrate-binding pocket. Thr 47 in the loop and Asn 141, which is located on another side of the binding pocket, both protrude into the pocket, forming a narrow entrance with the width of ~8 Å (
