<p>Superimposition of the PEDV nsp5-GC376 and PEDV nsp5-peptide complex (PDB: 4ZUH) [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] indicated that the glutamine surrogate ring and the leucine of GC376 perfectly occupy the position of the P1-Q and P2-L residues of the peptide substrate, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00240-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). As P1-Q is the most conserved residue of the PEDV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> recognition sequence, there may be few possibilities to introduce modifications at this site, or doing so may be difficult. In examining all the P2 residues of the cleavage site in the PP1ab, two different residues were observed (Val and Met). To determine the preferred P2 residues of PEDV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, fluorescent peptide substrates with different P2 residues were synthesized. Except for Val and Met, several other residues with different side chain sizes were introduced into the substrates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00240-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). FRET assays using the different substrates were performed as described above. The original substrate without P2 mutation exhibited the highest cleavage efficiency. P2-M showed a little decrease, and P2-I and P2-V retained 60% activity. Furthermore, a large reduction of approximately 70% compared to that of P2-L was observed for P2-P/Y/ F/W. Thus, Leu is the most preferred residue at P2 site of PEDV 3CL
