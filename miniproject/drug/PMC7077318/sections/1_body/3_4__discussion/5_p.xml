<p>In determining the P2 residue specificity of PEDV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> and optimization of GC376, Leu showed best effects in both assays (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00240-f005">Figure 5</xref>). In FRET assays using peptide substrates with different P2 residues, P2-M with a longer side chain and P2-I/V with shorter side chains showed lower cleavage efficiency (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00240-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). This suggests that the length of Leu fits best in the S2 subsite. P2-P/F, which have a larger pyrrolidine or benzyl side chain group, resulted in a great increase in activity, which indicates that the residue with a side chain volume larger than that of Leu is not acceptable at the S2 subsite, further proving that P2-Y/W with even larger side chains are almost uncleavable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00240-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). Two modified compounds, Target 1 and Target 2, both showed lower inhibitory effects compared to that of GC376. GC376 (L-M) had stronger effects than GC376 (L-P) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00240-f005">Figure 5</xref>C,D), which was consistent with the results of FRET-based P2-site specificity assays. In conclusion, Leu of GC376 was the most preferred group in the S2 subsite, and we could rationalize the design of it based on Leu in the future. Perhaps replacement of one of the hydrogens of the Leu side chain by other atoms that causes minor changes might produce stronger binding, thus resulting in better inhibition. The 6-membered aromatic ring of GC376 stretches into the solvent and may not serve as a primary modification site.
