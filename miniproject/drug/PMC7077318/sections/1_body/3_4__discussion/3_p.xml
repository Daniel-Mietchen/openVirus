<p>In our study, a series of available coronavirus inhibitors were applied in FRET-based assays to identify an effective inhibitor of PEDV. GC376, a dipeptidyl bisulfite adduct salt, worked best and was selected as the subject of subsequent experiments. Biochemical assays yielded an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.11 ± 0.13 μM for GC376 against the PEDV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, which was slightly higher than that against the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> (0.82 ± 0.47 μM) and lower than that against the SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> (4.35 ± 0.47 μM) [
