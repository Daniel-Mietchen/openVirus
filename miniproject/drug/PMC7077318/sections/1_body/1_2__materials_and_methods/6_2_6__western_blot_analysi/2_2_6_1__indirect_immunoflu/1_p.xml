<p>Vero cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1 Ã— 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well. YN144 was inoculated into the wells at an MOI of 0.01, and GC376 was added at a series of concentrations at the same time. Indirect immunofluorescence assays were performed when 60% of the cells died. Briefly, cells were washed with PBS before fixation by 4% formaldehyde in PBS, treated with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked with 2% BSA. After blocking, the cells were incubated with the primary antibody and a FITC-labeled secondary antibody (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) in the dark. Finally, the cells were examined under fluorescence microscopy after staining with DAPI.
