<p>The fluorescent peptide substrate “Dabcyl-YNSTLQ↓AGLRKM-E-Edans” (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA), which contains the N-terminal cleavage site of the PEDV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, was used in FRET assays. All reactions were performed in a solution of 20 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, 30% glycerol and 4 mM DTT at pH 8.0 in a total volume of 100 μL. The enzyme concentration used in FRET assays was 100 nM, and the substrate concentration was 40 μM. The concentrations of GC376 ranged from 0.03 μM to 80 μM. The fluorescence units upon cleavage were monitored every 5 min for 30 min at 485 nm, with excitation at 340 nm. Relative fluorescence units (RFU) were determined by subtracting the background value (substrate control well without the protease) from the fluorescence values. Finally, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated using GraphPad Prism5 (San Diego, CA, USA) to assess the inhibition ratios at different inhibitor concentrations.
