<p>GC376 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00240-f001">Figure 1</xref>A) and its two variants Target 1 and Target 2 were synthesized at LabNetwork (global e-Commerce platform for discovery compound and building block: 
 <uri xlink:href="www.labnetwork.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.labnetwork.com</uri>, Shanghai 200131, China) with purity higher than 95%. In Target 1, Leu of GC376 is replaced with Met, which has a longer side chain; in Target 2, Leu of GC376 is replaced with Phe, which has a side chain with a larger volume. The compound was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 100 mM and stored at −80 °C.
