<p>Before the 50% maximal effect (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) measurement, the 50% cell death toxic concentrations (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) of GC376 in Vero cells were determined. Briefly, confluent cells grown in 96-well plates were treated with various concentrations (50–200 μM) of GC376 for 72 h. All the wells, including control wells, contained 0.2% DMSO. Cell cytotoxicity was measured using the Celltiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay reagent (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). For EC
 <sub>50</sub> measurement, two PEDV strains (CV777 and YN144) were used. When cells were grown to 80%–90% confluence, the virus was added at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 with a series of GC376 concentrations (0.78 μM, 1.56 μM, 3.13 μM, 6.25 μM, 12.5 μM, 25 μM, 50 μM and 100 μM). All the wells, including the virus and cell control wells, contained 1% DMSO. Cell viability was measured as above at 12 h and 36 h for YN144 and CV777, respectively. Finally, the EC
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated using GraphPad Prism5 (San Diego, CA, USA) to assess the inhibition ratios at different inhibitor concentrations.
