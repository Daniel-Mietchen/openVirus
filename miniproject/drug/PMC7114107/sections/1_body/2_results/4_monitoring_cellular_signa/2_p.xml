<p id="p0105">To better understand how these drugs induced changes to the cellular signaling network would lead to limiting HSV-1 replication, we next systemically evaluated changes in the phosphoprotein panel during viral infections treated with drug combinations. Compared to uninfected cells treated with drug combinations alone, cells pre-infected with HSV-1 followed by drug treatments provide a more realistic model for studying the changes in cellular physiology under optimal drug combination treatments, as drug treatments would almost always take place after infection is detected (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A). We used HSV-1 that was engineered to express GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) as a way to track HSV-1 replication within infected cells. This allowed us to distinguish changes in cellular signaling induced by infection on the single cell level.
