<p id="p0115">The results in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> suggest that IFN does not directly eradicate virus in already infected cells; instead IFN inhibits viral infection by targeting uninfected cells and preparing them to avoid further viral invasion, which is in line with the known biological mechanisms of IFN. Once viral infection had begun in the cell population, IFN could not reduce the level of viral infection. In contrast, Optimal_B (RIB-rich combination) was effective in this study, in which cells were infected prior to drug treatment. These results indicate that RIB can directly target viral replication inside the cells.
