<p id="p0130">Now that we understood that modulation of the S6 phosphorylation state is critical target in the control of HSV-1 replication we sought to validate the cause-effect relationships between pS6 signaling and HSV-1 infection using the pS6 kinase inhibitor, SL0101. To evaluate the effect of down-regulating the S6 pathway on HSV-1 replication we looked at viral replication 16 h after treatment with SL0101. At 50 μM of SL0101 there is a slightly decreased GFP level in +HSV-1 samples, while SL0101 at 100 μM or RIB at 100 μM profoundly decrease the viral infection level (

 <sup>RSK</sup>, pS6, pSTAT1, and pSTAT3. When HSV-1 was not present, RIB and SL0101 both showed general signaling regulation across multiple pathways. With viral stimulation, however, SL0101 at 25 and 50 μM no longer resulted in dramatic signaling regulation. This result shows that HSV-1 infection could overcome changes induced by low dose SL0101. However, at 100 μM, SL0101 treatment resulted in a general decrease in signaling across multiple pathways. RIB at 100 μM appeared to be much more specific in signaling regulation, as only pS6 was significantly down-regulated (
