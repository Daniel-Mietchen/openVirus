<p id="p0140">The ultimate goal of our system using phosphoflow is to better understand how drug therapies affect cellular physiology so that we can quickly develop more targeted therapeutic modalities for treating disease. In this study we used a mouse model of vaginal HSV-1 infection as a way to assess the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of the drug combinations we previously discovered. In addition, this acts as a proof of principle that our platform can determine key signaling nodes that should be manipulated as therapy of disease. 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A depicts our setup of a model of HSV-1 vaginal infection in mice. To ensure that the animal model could be used to evaluate HSV-1 inhibition efficacy 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we first tested ACV alone and drug combination Optimal_B (RIB-rich treatments). Mice treated with ACV showed decreased HSV-1 viral load, especially on day 3. Remarkably, mice treated with drug combination Optimal_B had HSV-1 levels that were 70-fold lower than those of untreated mice on day 3 (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B). This result indicated that this animal model could be applied as an effective 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> model to examine HSV-1 inhibition efficacy of other drug treatments.
