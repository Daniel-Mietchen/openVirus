<p id="p0100">Based on the results described above, we next focused on the phosphorylated states of STAT1 and S6 after drug treatment of cells. Monitoring pSTAT1 over time showed that pSTAT1 was upregulated, in a dose-dependent manner, as early as 0.5 h and this was extended up to 16 h after drug treatments (

 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C and D). When plotting pSTAT1 and pS6 signaling side-by-side along the time course, pSTAT1 was an instant and long-lasting marker for IFN, whereas pS6 was a later period marker for RIB (
