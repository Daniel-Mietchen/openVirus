<p id="p0180">In conclusion, we have used phosphoflow technology to evaluate possible mechanisms of therapeutic drug combination and elucidate how these drug combinations modulate cellular signaling so as to design better antiviral therapeutics. Specifically, we were able to identify STAT1 and S6 phosphorylation as a key signaling nodes involved in HSV-1 replication and demonstrate that therapeutic drug combinations that effectively block HSV-1 replication were modulating these signaling nodes to block HSV-1 replication. We extended our findings to develop a proof of principle in a mouse model of vaginal HSV-1 infection by targeting S6 phosphorylation directly with the S6 kinase inhibitor SL0101. The efficacy of targeting this phosphorylation step shows that using analysis of cellular signaling modulation can determine new, efficacious antivirals and drug targets.</p>
