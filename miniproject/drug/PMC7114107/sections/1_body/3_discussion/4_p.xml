<p id="p0160">The impact that modulation of S6 phosphorylation would have on viral replication is not a well-understood idea. While HSV-1 replication either induced or required upregulated levels of S6 phosphorylation, blocking these heightened levels of S6 phosphorylation by RIB was sufficient to block HSV-1 replicaiton. We used these findings to focus on the phosphorylation of S6 as a new target when developing therapeutics against HSV-1 infection. Using this focus, we used a small molecule (SL0101), an inhibitor of an S6 kinase that can reduce S6 phosphorulation and thereby mimic the efficacy of one of the drug combination by lowering S6 phosphorylation. We went on to show that SL0101 could effectively block the replication of HSV-1 in an animal model of vaginal HSV infection.</p>
