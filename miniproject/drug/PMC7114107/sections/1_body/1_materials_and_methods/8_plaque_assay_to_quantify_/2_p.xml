<p id="p0085">Plaque assays were performed on Vero cell monolayers. Each lavage was serially diluted eight times with DMEM at a ratio of 1:10. During this process, 0.4 mL of lavage dilution was added to the Vero cell monolayer, and virus absorption was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37 °C with gentle shaking every 20 min. After absorption, excess virus was removed by three washes with DMEM. 1 mL of agar overlay medium was added on top of the Vero cell monolayer. After plaques started to form the agar overlay was removed, and the cell monolayer was stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Plaques were counted under a microscope and bar graphs were produced based on averages of three experimental data points. Statistical differences were determined using a
