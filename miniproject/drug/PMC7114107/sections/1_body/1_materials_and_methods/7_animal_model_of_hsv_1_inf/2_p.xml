 <italic>In vivo</italic> compound treatment and stimulations were performed on female KOS strain mice. All animal handling was performed in accordance with University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Animal Research Committee guidelines and animals were monitored for changes to health regularly. Each mouse received either 25 μL of 2.9 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> PFU/mL HSV-1 or 25 μL PBS vehicle via vaginal administration on day 0. HSV-1 infection was allowed to occur for 24 h post virus administration. The first vaginal lavage was collected at 24 h post infection (day 1) followed immediately by a 50 μL drug treatment via vaginal administration. The second vaginal lavage was collected at 48 h post-infection (this was 24 h post-first-round drug treatment) (day 2) followed immediately by a 50 μL drug treatment via vaginal administration. The third vaginal lavage was collected at 72 h post-infection (24 h post-second-round drug treatment) (day 3). HSV-1 viral copy number in vaginal lavage was quantified by plaque assay as described below. To assess Optimal_B efficacy, twenty-seven mice were randomly distributed into three groups each containing nine mice. One group was untreated, one was treated with ACV at 80 ng/mL, and one was treated with drug combination Optimal_B. To evaluate SL0101, an RSK p90 inhibitor, eighteen mice were divided into two groups (an untreated control group and a SL0101 treated group). SL0101 at dose of 200 μM was applied to the treated group.
