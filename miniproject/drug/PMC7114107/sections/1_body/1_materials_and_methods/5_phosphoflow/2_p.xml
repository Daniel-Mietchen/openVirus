<p id="p0070">Phosphoflow was performed as previously described (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Krutzik et al., 2008</xref>). Briefly, cells with or without treatment were fixed with formaldehyde (1.6% final concentration), permeabilized with 4 °C pure methanol, washed twice with staining medium (PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% sodium azide), and finally stained with phosphospecific antibodies in staining medium. Antibodies are against Akt (also known as Protein kinase B), ERK (extracellular signal-related kinase), JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinases), cJun, MAPKAPK2 (Mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2), NFĸB (Nuclear Factor ĸB), p38 (Mitogen-activated protein kinase), S6 (ribosomal protein S6), STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription), STAT3, STAT5, and STAT6. Flow cytometry was performed on a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer. After acquisition, data were analyzed using FlowJo software to generate median fluorescent intensity (MFI) values for each phosphoprotein in each treatment group. The median values were exported to Microsoft Excel for further analysis. All experiments were done with isotype controls to determine background staining. In addition, all experiments were done in triplicates. Data presented as single flow cytometry plot is representative of all three experiments. Data from the triplicates was further converted to bar graphs by averaging data and plotting with error bars representing the standard error.
