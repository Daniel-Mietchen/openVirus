<p id="p0040">In this study, we use phosphospecific flow cytometry, or phosphoflow, to understand the changes in cellular signaling using potent antiviral drug combinations as stimuli. The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins by kinases and phosphatases are part of the essential regulatory networks that drive the phenotype and function of cells, tissues, and organisms, especially after exposure to a drug or biological therapeutic (

Using phosphoflow to monitor multiple indicators of cellular physiology allows us to determine how drug combinations affect the intricate cellular signaling by simultaneously interrogating distinct signaling nodes within treated cells. The insight afforded to us by phosphoflow analysis of a drug combination or disease state may allow us to better design specific therapeutics that modulate the activity of disease-related kinases or phosphatases (
