   <bold>STAT1 and S6 Phosphorylation States After Antiviral Drug Stimulation.</bold> A. pSTAT1 signaling was identified as a marker for IFN rich treatment, but not for RIB rich treatment. B. pSTAT1 is an instant, long-lasting marker for IFN treatment. Activation of pSTAT1 was available as early as 0.5 h after drug stimulations and continued for up to 16 h after IFN drug treatments. C. pS6 signaling was identified as a marker for RIB rich treatment, but not for IFN rich treatment. D. pS6 signaling was not an instant marker but a later-period marker for RIB treatment, as pS6 level did not change until 8 h after drug treatments. E. Quantification of pSTAT1 and pS6 signaling in samples treated with Optimal_A and Optimal_B indicates pSTAT1 signaling is Optimal_A specific and pS6 is optimal_B specific. Unit for drugs is ng/ml. As a reminder: high dose IFNs and ACV (Optimal_A and Optimal_AA), high dose RIB and ACV (Optimal_B), low dose IFNs and ACV (Subopt_A), and low dose IFNs and RIB (Subopt_B). For Part E, data plotted is mean ± standard deviation. All experimental data shown is representative data from three independent experiments.
