   <bold>Quantification of Flow Cytometry Plots from Fig. 3C</bold>. The average of Mean Fluorescent Intensity (MFI) for the histogram plots represented in Fig. 3C (N = 3) were quantitated relative to unstimulated and plotted in bar graphs along with standard error shown in errors bars across experiments. Green bars represent HSV infected cells while black bars represented mock infected cells. A shows GFP levels, B shows pAKT levels, C shows pMAPKAPK2 levels, D shows pNFĸB levels, E shows pS6 levels and F shows pSTAT1 levels. Red arrows in A, E and F indicate Optimal_B and Ribavirin treatments across the analysis.
