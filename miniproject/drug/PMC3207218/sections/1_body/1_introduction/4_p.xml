<p>In addition to the viral proteins, there are numerous cellular proteins involved at each stage of the influenza virus life cycle. A few of these are mentioned above and have been identified and characterized through detailed studies of individual viral proteins, most often interaction studies. However, these likely only represent a small fraction of required host factors and efforts to broaden our knowledge in this area will provide a much more sophisticated picture of the influenza virus replication cycle. The advent of RNA interference (RNAi) technology now allows one to query the participation of each encoded host protein in a particular function such as virus replication. A number of studies

This review will discuss these findings and their implication for development of new options for influenza therapy.
