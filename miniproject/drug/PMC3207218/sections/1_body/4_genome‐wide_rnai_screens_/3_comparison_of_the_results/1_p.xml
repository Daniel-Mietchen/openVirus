<p>Although each of these studies analyzed their own datasets in detail and provided certain levels of validation for their hits, this review will focus more on comparing the results and discussing the power and limitations of the RNAi approach. From the descriptions above, it should already be clear that each study employed distinct assays that include differences in cell types, virus strain, siRNA library, and assay readout. Despite this, it is still surprising that not one hit was common to all five screens, although a similar low level of overlap was observed between three HIV‐1 RNAi screens 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref>. To look at this in more detail, a list of hits was generated composed of the primary hits from all five screens. For the 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> screen, 130 human homologues could be identified from the list of 176 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> hits. From Shapira 
 <italic>et al</italic>., the list of 220 hits required for virus replication was taken into consideration and for Brass 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 249 of the initial 312 hits were used as these confirmed with at least one siRNA from the pool. The hits considered for the König and Karlas screens were those validated with two or more siRNAs. Analysis of this combined list of 1077 reveals 992 genes that are unique to one of the screens, whereas 85 genes are found in two or more of the screens (Figure 
 <xref rid="rmv703-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). More specifically, 72 genes are common to two of the five screens, eight are common to three screens and five are common to four of the screens. Within this small group of 13 genes found in three or more screens, those encoding subunits of the Vacuolar‐type H+‐ATPase (vATPase) complex and the members of the coatomer or COPI complex clearly stand out, leaving no doubt that these cellular complexes are required during the influenza virus life‐cycle. vATPase activity is known to be required for acidification of the endosome and has previously been implicated in influenza virus entry

 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">43</xref>, so this finding was not unexpected. The involvement of the COPI complex, however, was a new finding, and we await a thorough analysis of its role in influenza virus replication. Initial characterization by two of the groups suggests potential roles in both virus entry
