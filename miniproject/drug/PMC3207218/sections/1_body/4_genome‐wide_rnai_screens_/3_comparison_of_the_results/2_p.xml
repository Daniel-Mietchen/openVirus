<p>To delve further into the other host functions that are most strongly supported by these multiple RNAi screens, all genes that were identified in two or more screens were considered further. When this list of 85 genes is analyzed in terms of function and gene classification, there are six categories that are enriched and represented by at least five genes (Table 
 <xref rid="rmv703-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In addition to the aforementioned COPI and vATPase complexes, which are ranked second and third, the ribosome (ranked first), spliceosome, nuclear pore/envelope, and kinase signaling categories are also enriched. Dependency on ribosomes is not unexpected for a virus that replicates fast and must express its proteins rapidly. Neither is the involvement of the splicing machinery or elements that control nuclear trafficking, as both are known to be fundamental to influenza virus replication. However, the identification of specific factors involved in these processes in the infected cell, may point towards interfaces with the virus, for example, interactions with viral proteins. As an example, NXF1 is described to be required for the efficient export of specific influenza virus mRNAs

 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">45</xref>. Kinase signaling is obviously a broader category and is likely to be involved at multiple stages of the virus life‐cycle, however, the kinases shown in Table 
 <xref rid="rmv703-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref> that were identified by at least two studies, represent top candidates for further study.
