<p>Of the 85 cellular factors that were identified in two or more of the influenza virus screens, 50 are considered to have druggable properties (Table 
 <xref rid="rmv703-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>), according to the Integrated Druggable Genome Database available from Sophic (

 <xref rid="rmv703-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>), so could serve as top candidates for further exploration.
