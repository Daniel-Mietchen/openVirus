<p>Further insight into the role of the cellular protein in the influenza virus life cycle is crucial in order to comprehend the consequences of manipulating its function. For this, we will rely on integrating the data from the RNAi screens with those studies that use alternative approaches to address virus‐host interactions. For example, protein interaction studies such as the yeast‐two‐hybrid assay employed by Shapira

It is expected that those host factors for which we obtain multiple lines of evidence for an involvement in the influenza virus life cycle will naturally attract more research interest, and that in turn will foster their development as potential drug targets.
