<p>There are four drugs currently approved for the treatment or prevention of influenza and all of these act on viral proteins (Table 
 <xref rid="rmv703-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Amantadine and rimantadine both target the M2 protein and are specific for influenza A virus. By inhibiting M2 ion channel activity, they block acidification of the incoming virus particle and therefore prevent the release of the viral genome

However, because of widespread resistance to these drugs in current circulating viruses, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has recommended that they not be used during the 2010/2011 influenza season in the USA. The drugs that are recommended for clinical use are oseltamivir and zanamivir, which target the neuraminidase activity of the NA protein and are active against both influenza A and B viruses 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>. NA inhibition prevents release of the newly‐formed virus particle at the last step of the replication cycle. Although oseltamivir is an oral drug, zanamivir is administered via inhalation. Another NA inhibitor, peramivir, obtained approval from the FDA for emergency use during the 2009 pandemic, but this approval has since expired
