<p>One of the major issues with drugs that target viral proteins is that resistance is very likely to develop. This is particularly true of RNA viruses that have a more error‐prone polymerase and for influenza virus, the segmented nature of the genome allows for mutations to be transferred to new virus strains during reassortment. Mutations in the M2 protein that confer resistance to the adamantanes are found in nearly 100% of H3N2 influenza A viruses, as well as the pandemic H1N1 influenza A viruses that are currently circulating (CDC surveillance). In contrast, the seasonal H1N1 viruses that were circulating prior to the H1N1 pandemic remain sensitive to the adamantanes. The pattern is reversed when looking at resistance to oseltamivir, where the H3N2 viruses and pandemic H1N1 viruses are sensitive whereas the seasonal H1N1 viruses are 100% resistant. Oseltamivir resistance arose over a relatively short timescale (three seasons), which was unexpected as it was believed that oseltamivir resistant viruses carried a fitness deficit

The co‐circulation of viruses that are resistant to either of the two classes of antiviral drugs obviously brings with it the concern that a multi‐drug resistant virus may emerge. We may have been granted a reprieve from this situation in that the prevalence of seasonal H1N1 viruses has dropped significantly since the appearance of the pandemic H1N1 virus, and therefore the oseltamivir‐resistance mutation is no longer in circulation. Nevertheless, if H1N1 viruses have a propensity for developing oseltamivir resistance and this is acquired by the pandemic H1N1 virus in addition to its existing adamantane resistance, we would have few therapeutic options at our disposal. Some examples of multi‐drug resistant viruses have been isolated from patients undergoing therapy, but so far, they have not been seen in general circulation

 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>. Examination of these resistant H1N1 viruses in animal models for influenza virus has shown that they do not appear to be attenuated either in terms of pathogenicity or transmission 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>. This current status fuels the argument that new options for influenza antiviral therapy are sorely needed, and moreover, that we must start exploring different targets, including non‐viral ones.
