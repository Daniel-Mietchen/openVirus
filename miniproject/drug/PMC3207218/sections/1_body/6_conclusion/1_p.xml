<p>In summary, the use of RNAi screens has expanded our knowledge of the number of cellular proteins potentially involved in the replication of influenza virus by several fold. The fact that multiple such studies were published over a short time span has provided us the opportunity to assess the usefulness of the approach and more importantly to learn how one should interpret such data. Clearly, if we restrict ourselves to analyzing the overlapping hits at the level of gene name, we will limit the pool of required host factors to a few key members. However, if a cross‐comparison is performed at the level of gene function, the multiple studies provide support for the participation of distinct cellular pathways or protein complexes, some of which are not seen if analyzing the studies on an individual basis. Overall, these studies provide strong evidence that the vATPase and COPI complexes, the ribosomal, mRNA splicing and nuclear trafficking machinery, and kinase‐regulated signaling are all required for efficient replication of influenza A virus. Of these, the COPI complex is the best example of a new cellular function that was uncovered by the use of RNAi screening and this is sure to spur further research to understand how it facilitates influenza virus replication. The screens also present new avenues to explore in terms of potential targets for antiviral drugs. Some of these cellular factors may be specifically required by influenza virus, whereas others may also play a role in other virus infections, which presents the opportunity for development of a host‐directed drug with broad‐spectrum activity.</p>
