<p>DAS181 or Fludase is a developmental therapeutic candidate for influenza and is unique in that it targets a cellular component. DAS181 is a recombinant protein with sialidase activity and acts by removing sialic acid from proteins in the airway and thus prevents influenza virus attachment 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref>. Maraviroc, which was approved in 2007 as an antiretroviral drug, is another example of a host‐directed antiviral. Maraviroc targets one of the HIV‐1 co‐receptors, C‐C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref>, and thereby prevents virus entry. Support for the value of pursuing CCR5 as a drug target came from individuals who have a deletion in their CCR5 gene leading to loss of function and who are more resistant to HIV‐1 infection 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref>. Admittedly, maraviroc has also taught us that antiviral drugs directed at cellular targets are not immune to resistance, as maraviroc‐resistance has been observed both in the laboratory and in patients. Interestingly, resistance seen 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> results from the virus adapting to use the drug‐bound form of CCR5, while in patients, the drug selects for the growth of viruses that use the alternative receptor, C‐X‐C chemokine receptor type 4, which are therefore insensitive to a CCR5‐inhibitor 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref>. This only emphasizes the close interplay between virus and host cell and how the role of any required cellular protein will have to be carefully dissected in order to validate it as a drug target. One should also distinguish between chronic and acute infections, as the length of drug treatment for acute infections such as influenza will usually be limited to about a week. Therefore, inhibition of a cellular function will be temporary, and perhaps, there is greater opportunity to explore the potential for host‐directed antiviral therapies in this setting, rather than with a chronic infection.
