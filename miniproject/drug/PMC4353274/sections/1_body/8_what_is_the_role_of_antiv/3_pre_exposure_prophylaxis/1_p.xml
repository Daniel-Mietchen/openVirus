<p>Pre-exposure prophylaxis with either oseltamivir or zanamivir for hospitalized patients or staff is not routinely recommended. This recommendation differs from that for residents and staff in long-term or chronic care facilities. Pre-exposure prophylaxis for patients may be considered in specific circumstances (eg, in high-risk semi-closed hospital units such as transplant units) when at least one laboratory-confirmed case occurs on a hospital unit. The end of a unit outbreak is generally considered when no new cases of ILI have appeared for â‰¥7 days after the onset of the last case. Pre-exposure prophylaxis increases the risk of long-term use, and the development of resistance.</p>
