<p>Clinical trials with the neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) oseltamivir and zanamivir and and meta-analyses of oseltamivir therapy administered within 36 h to 48 h of symptom onset to low-risk outpatients with influenza (where placebo-controlled trials were ethically safe) have shown that overall, these agents shorten the duration of symptoms by 1 to 1.5 days (

Systematic reviews of studies investigating the efficacy of NIs in treating mild to moderate influenza illness in out-patients have not adequately addressed the significantly greater benefit of NI treatment in very ill hospitalized patients, nor the greater benefit of earlier treatment after onset of symptoms (
