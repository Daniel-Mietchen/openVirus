<p>During peaks of influenza activity in the community, a case definition in older children and adults of fever &gt;38 °C with cough has a positive predictive value of 86% and a negative predictive value of 39.3% for influenza in patients attending an outpatient clinic (

In older patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who have been vaccinated for influenza, only the presence of fever &gt;37.8° and myalgias correlated with influenza, but with a lower positive predictive value of 41% (
 <xref rid="b11-idmm-26-e5" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Other respiratory viruses, including but not limited to: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, coronavirus or human metapneumovirus infection, may account for those with non-influenza infection. The use of influenza polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is preferred to direct fluorescent antigen detection (DFA) due to its greater sensitivity. A nasopharyngeal swab is preferred for influenza PCR testing, particularly if the patient requires hospital admission. If the patient is intubated, an endotracheal aspirate can be substituted for an NP swab. If an NP swab has been performed and is negative, and the patient is subsequently intubated, an endotracheal aspirate specimen for PCR should also be performed. Multiplex PCR testing allows for the diagnostic confirmation of other respiratory viruses, although unlike influenza, there are presently no antiviral agents available to treat them.
