  <p>Antiviral effects of eltrombopag determined in different cell types infected by different HCMV strains and clinical isolates. HFFs were infected at an MOI of 0.02 and adipose-derived adult mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) at an MOI of 5. HCMV LA expression was determined 120 h post infection. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Eltrombopag concentrations that reduce HCMV LA expression by 50% (IC
   <sub>50</sub>). Numerical values are provided in 
   <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cells-09-00031">Table S3</xref>. The eltrombopag concentration that reduced ASC viability by 50% (CC
   <sub>50</sub>) was 17,872 Â± 1302 nM. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Representative growth curve indicating the effects of equimolar concentrations of Fe(III)Cl
   <sub>3</sub> on the anti-HCMV effects of eltrombopag as indicated by HCMV LA expression in U1 (MOI 0.02)-infected HFFs 120 h post infection.
