<p>Our findings are in agreement with a case report on an immunocompetent patient, who suffered from HCMV-associated thrombocytopenia and recovered after eltrombopag therapy [
 <xref rid="B17-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This response had originally been attributed to effects of eltrombopag on platelet production [
 <xref rid="B17-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The possibility that eltrombopag may exert antiviral affects was not considered. Our current data show that therapeutic eltrombopag levels interfere with HCMV replication, which may have contributed to the beneficial clinical outcome. Notably, eltrombopag has also been shown to inhibit the replication of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus, a member of the genus
