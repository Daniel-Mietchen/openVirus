<p>A number of different iron chelators, including desferrioxamine, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), and ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid (EDDS), were shown to inhibit HCMV replication [

 <xref rid="B38-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, the iron chelators tiron and ciclopirox olamine were not found to inhibit HCMV strain AD169 replication in MRC5 cells [
 <xref rid="B50-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The experimental setup differed, as MRC5 cells were infected at a high MOI of 3, and no doseâ€“response relationships were determined. Hence, a direct comparison is not possible. Notably, specific antiviral activity can easily be missed if the therapeutic window between antiviral and cytotoxic effects is relatively small. For example, desferrioxamine was found to inhibit HCMV replication at concentrations that did not decrease the viability of confluent fibroblasts but affected dividing cells [
 <xref rid="B32-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In contrast, eltrombopag inhibits HCMV replication in concentrations that do not affect cell proliferation. Hence, the size of the therapeutic window that discriminates between anti-HCMV activity and antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects substantially differs among iron chelators. Eltrombopag seems to be an iron chelator that possesses a particularly preferential therapeutic window in terms of its anti-HCMV activity.
