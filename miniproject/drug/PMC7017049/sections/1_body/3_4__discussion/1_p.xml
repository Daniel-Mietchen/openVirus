<p>Here, we show that the approved thrombopoietin receptor agonist eltrombopag exerts anti-HCMV effects in various cell types infected with a range of different virus strains and clinical isolates, including drug-resistant ones. The observed IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranged from 99 nM to 4331 nM, which is in the range of therapeutic plasma concentrations that have been reported to exceed 45 ÂµM [
