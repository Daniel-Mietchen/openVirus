<p>Immunoblotting was performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B23-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In brief, cells were lysed in a Triton X-100 sample buffer and proteins separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Proteins were detected using specific antibodies against ÃŸ-actin (3598R-100-BV, BioVision via BioCat, Heidelberg, Germany) or HCMV 45 kDa LA (MBS320051, MyBioSource via Biozol, Echingen, Germany), and were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using a commercially available kit (Thermo Scientific, Schwerte, Germany).
