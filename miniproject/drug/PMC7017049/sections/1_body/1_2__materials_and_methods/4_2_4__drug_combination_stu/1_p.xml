<p>Drugs were combined at equimolar concentrations or used as single agents. Combined effects were determined by staining for HCMV LA. Combination indices (CIs) were calculated at different levels of inhibition (50% inhibition, CI
 <sub>50</sub>; 75% inhibition, CI
 <sub>75</sub>; 90% inhibition, CI
 <sub>90</sub>; 95% inhibition, CI
 <sub>95</sub>) by the method of Chou and Talalay [
 <xref rid="B24-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], using CalcuSyn software version 1.0 (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Weighted average CI values (CI
 <sub>wt</sub>) were calculated as (CI
 <sub>50</sub> + 2 × CI
 <sub>75</sub> + 3 × CI
 <sub>90</sub> + 4 × CI
 <sub>95</sub>)/10. CI
 <sub>wt</sub> values ≤0.7 indicate synergistic effects, CI
 <sub>wt</sub> values &gt;0.7 and ≤0.9 moderately synergistic effects, CI
 <sub>wt</sub> values &gt;0.9 and ≤1.2 additive effects, CI
 <sub>wt</sub> values &gt;1.2 and ≤1.45 moderately antagonistic effects, and CI
 <sub>wt</sub> values &gt;1.45 antagonistic effects [
