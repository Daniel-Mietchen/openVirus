<p>Cell viability was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye reduction assay as described previously [
 <xref rid="B23-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Five thousand cells were seeded per well in 96-well microtiter plates and incubated with culture medium containing serial dilutions of the indicated substances. After five days of incubation, MTT (1 mg/mL) was added, and after an additional 4 h, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 50% 
 <italic>N</italic>,
 <italic>N</italic>-dimethylformamide adjusted to pH 4.5. Absorbance was determined at 570 nm for each well using a 96-well multiscanner. After subtracting background absorbance, cell viability was expressed in percent relative to untreated control cells. Drug concentrations that reduced cell viability by 50% (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) were calculated using CalcuSyn (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). The MTT assay measures metabolic activity in the mitochondria. To confirm viability results by a second assay, the CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega, Walldorf, Germany), which measures cellular ATP production, was used according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
