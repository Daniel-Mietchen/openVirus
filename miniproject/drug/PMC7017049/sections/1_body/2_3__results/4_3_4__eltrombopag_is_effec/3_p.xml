<p>To confirm the relevance of iron chelation as mechanism of the anti-HCMV action of eltrombopag using a clinical virus isolate, U1-infected HFFs were treated with equimolar concentrations of eltrombopag and Fe(III)Cl
 <sub>3</sub>. The presence of equimolar Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> concentrations prevented the eltrombopag-induced inhibition of HCMV LA expression in U1-infected cells in a comparable fashion (
