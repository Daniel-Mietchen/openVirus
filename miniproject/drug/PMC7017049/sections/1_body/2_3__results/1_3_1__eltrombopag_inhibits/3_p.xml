<p>The HCMV replication cycle is divided into three phases characterized by the expression of immediate early, early, and late viral genes. Immediate early genes are transcribed immediately after infection and do not depend on synthesis of viral DNA or transcription of proteins. Delayed early proteins are represented by the viral DNA polymerase, and other viral functions required for viral DNA synthesis, and some viral structural proteins. Late genes encode mostly structural proteins used in viral assembly and packaging, and are generally expressed subsequent to delayed early genes [
