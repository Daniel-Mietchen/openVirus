<p>Eltrombopag did not affect HCMV Hi91-induced immediate early antigen (IEA) expression (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cells-09-00031">Figure S1</xref>), but inhibited HCMV Hi91-induced LA expression with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 415 nM in HFFs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00031-f001">Figure 1</xref>A,B). Eltrombopag concentrations of up to 25 µM did not reduce the viability of proliferating HFFs by 50%, as determined by MTT assay (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00031-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). Cell viability determination by CellTiter-Glo resulted in similar results (HFF viability at 25 µM: 53 ± 4 µM). Hence, the selectivity index, cytotoxicity concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>)/IC
 <sub>50,</sub> is higher than 60.2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00031-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). Higher MOIs were associated with higher IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00031-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). At MOI 1, the highest MOI investigated in HFFs, the eltrombopag IC
 <sub>50</sub> was 3844 nM. The observed eltrombopag concentrations are within the range of therapeutic plasma concentrations, which have been described to exceed 45 µM [
