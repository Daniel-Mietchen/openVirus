<p>Recent decades have seen the emergence and identification of several new viral infections of global significance,

 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> but they have also witnessed the development of highly innovative new antiviral drug therapies, which have, for example, dramatically improved the prognosis of those infected with HIV
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and now are radically changing the care of those infected by hepatitis C.
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, concerns have been expressed about the increasing costs of developing new drugs and bringing them into clinical use.
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5â€“9</xref> In broad terms, drug development begins with discovery and preclinical laboratory research, before moving on to clinical development, starting with first testing in humans (phase I clinical trials) and continuing until regulatory review and approval.

 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Phase I to III clinical trials may be responsible for more than half the time and cost required to bring a new drug from discovery to regulatory approval.
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Therefore, trends in the time taken for clinical development may be an important driver of increasing total development costs as well as having implications for patient access to innovative new medicines.
