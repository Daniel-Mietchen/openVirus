<p>We analyzed the outcomes using a multi-level model with two random effects levels, calves nested within replicates, and days nested within calves. The fixed effects portion included a spline function of time to model the anticipated initially gradual, then steeper rise, and then the rapid fall in the clinical score that reflects the natural history of the disease. We created a separate spline function for each outcome. We analyzed each drug treatment arm, i.e. arm 1 to 6, encoded as dummy variables, interacted with the spline function (modelling time) in the fixed effects portion of the model. We performed the same analyses using the clinical score modified to exclude temperature to determine if there was a benefit beyond antipyresis in the ibuprofen treatment arms. We used the same approach when estimating drug effect on respiratory rates and viral shedding.</p>
