<p>Models were compared using likelihood ratio tests. Adherence to underlying assumptions was assessed graphically. Some outlying observations were noted in these graphs. We refit models with and without these observations that may have deviated from the underlying assumptions and compared these models with the full models. Including or excluding these apparent outliers did not materially change overall coefficients or standard errors. Ultimately, we retained the outlying observations because we did not have a good clinical reason to exclude them.</p>
