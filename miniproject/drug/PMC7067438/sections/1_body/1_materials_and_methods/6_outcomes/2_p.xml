<p>The clinical score used has been described elsewhere.[
 <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Briefly, it assigns a numeric score to constitutional, nasal, ocular, and respiratory signs based on a structured clinical exam. It is similar to a clinical score described by Collie [
 <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] but attributes less importance to fever. The scoring schema is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0230245.s001">S1 File</xref>. A higher score indicates more severe clinical signs. The clinical exam was performed daily by a veterinarian blinded to drug allocation. These clinical examinations were also performed in the days prior to infection with bovine RSV. We also compared the effects of treatment on clinical score without the temperature component, and on respiratory rate alone. The exam was recorded in real time using paper case report forms and subsequently transferred to a customized Filemaker-pro 12 database (Filemaker Inc. Santa Clara, CA).
