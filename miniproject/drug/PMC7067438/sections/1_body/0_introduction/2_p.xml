<p>Prostaglandin E surges have been noted at 6 hours, 1 to 2 days, and 5 days following RSV inoculation in a cotton rat (

 <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In vitro studies on bovine turbinate cells infected with bovine RSV have demonstrated significantly enhanced prostaglandin E
 <sub>2</sub> expression by microarray analysis at 12, 24, and 48 hours post-infection compared to uninfected control cells (unpublished data, Gershwin Lab). COX-2 but not COX-1 activity (which in turn leads to increased prostaglandin E among others) is elevated in both human respiratory epithelium
