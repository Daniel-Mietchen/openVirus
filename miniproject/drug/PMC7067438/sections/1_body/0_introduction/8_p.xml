<p>We have previously shown improved clinical score but also increased viral shedding in bovine calves when ibuprofen rather than placebo was initiated on the day following experimental bovine RSV infection.[
 <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] GS-561937 FPI initiated on the day following inoculation both improved clinical scores and decreased viral shedding; a smaller benefit was seen when this FPI was started three days after infection.[
 <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] This earlier work demonstrates the these drugsâ€™ potential but is of limited practical value because clinical symptoms of RSV typically appear three to five days after inoculation. Failure of these drugs to improve outcomes when started at three to five days following inoculation would severely limit any potential clinical application for FPIs or NSAIDs in either bovines or humans.
