Vaccinations are currently not available for children and bovine vaccines are variably effective. Bovine calves are a good model for human RSV. The clinical and immunological manifestations are similar, natural infection fails to induce immunity in both species, and enhanced natural disease following a specific formalin inactivated vaccine for humans has been replicated in bovine calves.[
