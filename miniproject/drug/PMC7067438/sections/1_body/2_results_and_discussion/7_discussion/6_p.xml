<p>Human infant research with FPI for RSV is limited because the barriers to research in infants are appropriately high. Adults treated at the first appearance of RSV shedding following artificial infection with human RSV do benefit from FPI.[

 <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] We speculate that delaying the first episode of RSV infection until infantsâ€™ Th2 skew has decreased may decrease the formation of antibodies to bystander antigens. Indeed, Gershwin 
 <italic>et al</italic> previously showed using this bovine RSV infection model that infected calves are more predisposed to production of IgE antibodies against aerosolized ovalbumin during active infection than are uninfected calves [
