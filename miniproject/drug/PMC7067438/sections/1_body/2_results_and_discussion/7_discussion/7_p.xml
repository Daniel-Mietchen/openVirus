<p>The concept of dual antiviral and anti-inflammatory or even a more multifaceted treatment regimen for RSV has been proposed before.[

 <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] The combination of triamcinolone, a glucocorticoid, with palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody decreased lung histopathology when treatment was started on the third day following inoculation in cotton rats. The primary limitations to applying this study clinically arise from ongoing development of ever more potent pre fusion antibodies [

 <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] Our findings vindicate the concept of dual antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapy. We will explore the mechanisms why this is so in a later manuscript. Given the potential for viral resistance to a single FPI, future research may entail the use of two antivirals and an NSAID.
