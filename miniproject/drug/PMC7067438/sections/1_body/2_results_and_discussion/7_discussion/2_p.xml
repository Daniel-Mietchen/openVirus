<p>Prior experimental evidence that treatment with NSAIDs decreases illness when initiated after RSV infection has occurred is limited. Richardson et al found some benefit using 20 mg of indomethacin in a cotton rat model.[
 <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Treatment within a day of inoculation using ibuprofen in a bovine RSV model did not decrease histopathological changes but was associated with better clinical scores than placebo. This was useful only as proof of concept because infected but asymptomatic patients (human or bovine) will not often be diagnosable.[
 <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] We have advanced current knowledge (1) by determining that initiation of treatment up to five days after inoculation is beneficial and (2) by demonstrating that dual therapy of an NSAID with an FPI should be used.
