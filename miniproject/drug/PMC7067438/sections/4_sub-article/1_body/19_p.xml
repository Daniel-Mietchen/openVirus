<p>Globally the work is well done and the paper well written. Although the Results section is short, the Discussion section is rich, the authors highlighting the proof of concept of this work for further studies in infants rather than a clinical trial. The authors are aware of the high cost of fusion inhibitors and thus its limitation for their use in calves, and the problem of treating animals or infants early after infection, when clinical signs are low or non-visible. </p>
