<p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript by Walsh et al. describes the results of a randomized controlled trial of therapeutic ibuprofen and antiviral (GS-561937, a fusion protein inhibitor) treatment on clinical disease and viral load in a bovine model of RSV infection. The article is relatively straightforward, although the statistical analyses are complex. My comments are mostly minor.</p>
