<p>The authors should make a distinction between antiviral drugs and antibodies, which are two different approaches. Concerning antibodies, since the discovery of the prefusion and postfusion forms of the RSV F protein, many new antibodies have been described. Among them, some have been shown to be specific of the prefusion form and were shown to be more effective against RSV infection in small animal models (rodents), in contrast to palivizumab which is used as a preventive treatment in infants at risk. So, the authors should specify about which antibodies they talk.</p>
