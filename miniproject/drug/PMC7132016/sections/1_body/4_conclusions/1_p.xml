<p>Our review shows the following: (1) In highly epidemic areas of COVID-19 infection, such as Wuhan, China, the proportion of infected patients with abnormal liver function test results (mainly elevated serum AST levels) is greater than that observed in regions where a smaller proportion of cases of COVID-19 infection in the population have occurred. (2) The proportion of infected patients with elevated serum transaminase levels is higher in adults than in children and in men than in women, respectively. However, we suggest that further studies are needed to confirm these preliminary observations. In the meantime, we believe that the front-line medical staff should pay attention to liver function tests in patients infected with COVID-19. For those patients with a pre-existing history of liver diseases (especially older patients), special attention should be paid to monitoring hepatic changes caused by COVID-19, whilst carefully identifying the cause of the liver dysfunction.
 <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> We also recommend that front-line medical staff should assess the use of appropriate hepatoprotective therapies, especially in patients with pre-existing liver disease, in order to attenuate the potentially deleterious impact of COVID-19-related liver damage/dysfunction.
