<p>In two Chinese multicenter surveys, one of which was led by the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, including 552 hospitals in 31 provinces/provincial municipalities through January 29th, 2020 and the other was led by the First Hospital of Lanzhou University including 7 hospitals, a considerable number of patients with COVID-19 had some abnormalities in liver function tests.

 <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> It seems likely that the proportion of infected patients with increased serum AST levels in Wuhan (i.e. the area in which the epidemic of COVID-19 started) is much greater than cases reported outside Wuhan. It is plausible to speculate that there may have been a higher viral load of COVID-19 in exposed patients in Wuhan, where the infection began and was concentrated in a greater proportion of the population.
