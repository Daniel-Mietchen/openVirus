<p>Of the five case reports, three were in children and two were in adults. The age of children ranged from 3 months to 7 years, whereas the age of adult patients ranged from 35 to 56 years. None of these children had abnormal serum liver enzymes and, therefore, it is possible to hypothesize that older age is associated with a higher likelihood of liver damage/dysfunction. However, further studies are needed to confirm this finding. We look forward to more case reports/case series on COVID-19-related liver damage/dysfunction in different age groups in the future.</p>
