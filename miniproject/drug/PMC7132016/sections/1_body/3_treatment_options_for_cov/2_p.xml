<p>From the findings discussed above, however, we believe that it is also reasonable to explore novel treatments for COVID-19 targeting of the ACE2 receptor. The ACE2 cellular receptor is highly expressed in human lung tissues, gastrointestinal tract, liver, vascular endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells.

 <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> All organs with high expression of the ACE2 receptor may be targeted by SARS-CoV-2 infection.
 <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Activation of the ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas signaling pathway or inhibition of the ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway could be potential pathways for the treatment of COVID-19. For SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, both ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin-II-receptor antagonists might be used not only for treating high blood pressure but also for reducing systemic inflammatory response and improving patient mortality.
