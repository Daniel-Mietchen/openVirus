<p>Surprisingly, in addition to the acute respiratory symptoms, patients with COVID-19 also have varying degrees of liver damage/dysfunction. For example, Chen 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> showed that more than a third of COVID-19 patients have some liver function test abnormalities. Most of these infected patients had mild-to-moderate elevations of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels; one patient had severely elevated serum aminotransferases (ALT of 7590 U/L, AST of 1445 U/L).
 <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Since COVID-19-related liver dysfunction is now attracting widespread attention, this review discusses the epidemiological characteristics, the potential mechanisms, and the treatment options for liver dysfunction induced by COVID-19.
