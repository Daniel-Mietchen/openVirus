<p>Hypoxia and shock induced by COVID-19-related complications (such as respiratory distress syndrome, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and multiple organ failure) may also cause hepatic ischemia and hypoxia-reperfusion dysfunction. Experimental data showed that hepatic cell death and inflammatory cell infiltration caused by hypoxia can be seen both 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models of hepatic ischemia and hypoxia.
 <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> This suggests that oxygen reduction and lipid accumulation in hepatocytes during shock and hypoxic conditions may lead to cell death. The subsequent marked increase in reactive oxygen species and their peroxidation products can act as a second messenger, activating redox-sensitive transcription factors, and further amplifying the release of multiple proinflammatory factors, causing liver damage.
 <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> All the aforementioned findings suggest that pneumonia-associated hypoxia is one of the most important factors causing secondary liver injury in COVID-19 patients.
