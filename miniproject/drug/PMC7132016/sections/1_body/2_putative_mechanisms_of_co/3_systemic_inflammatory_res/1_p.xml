<p>Although many COVID-19 patients were not too unwell, this infection in some patients has resulted in sudden deterioration, ending in multiple organ failure. Most experts believe that the occurrence of multiple organ failure is mainly related to the sudden initiation of an inflammatory “storm” in the critically ill COVID-19 patients.
 <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The so-called inflammatory “storm”, or systemic inflammatory response syndrome, is strongly related to activation of both natural and cellular immunity that is triggered by COVID-19 infection.
 <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In fact, the virus is able to directly induce multiple proinflammatory signals via toll-like receptors (TLRs) and activation of killer T lymphocytes.
 <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The activated T lymphocytes then attack the infected body cells, leading to their apoptosis and necrosis, until T lymphocytes are depleted. Damage-related pattern molecules released by dead infected cells can further amplify some inflammatory signals, such as TLRs. At the same time, T-lymphocyte depletion cannot control viral and bacterial infections, thereby activating multiple inflammatory signaling pathways, which lead to macrophage activation and secondary inflammatory reactions. Subsequently, when more inflammatory cytokines are released, more cell damage and necrosis are observed (
