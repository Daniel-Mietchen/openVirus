<p id="p0050">The viral particle must be sufficiently stable to protect the genome until its delivery into the host cell. Simultaneously, it must be metastable, to allow its disassembly and release of the genome for replication in the infected cell at the appropriate time. The energetic barrier that prevents viral disassembly outside the cell is lowered upon infection by structural changes in the viral components. These changes may be induced by binding of a cellular ligand or by changes in the environment, such as pH change upon entering a specific cellular compartment. Numerous viruses preassemble immature particles that undergo irreversible (usually proteolytic) transitions into mature structures of fully infectious virions. Mutual interactions of viral capsid proteins are typically different from those of cellular proteins, which predominantly create binary interactions. Viral structural proteins interact with multiple neighboring partners to form multicomponent macromolecular structures [reviewed in (
