<p id="p0025">Unlike cellular genomes, which consist of double-stranded (ds) DNA, viral genomes can be formed by a broad variety of nucleic acids (NAs), including ds or single-stranded (ss) circular or linear DNA or positive-, negative- or sometimes ambi-sense RNA. As viral life cycles are dependent on cellular factors and cellular metabolic and signaling pathways, the number of possible antiviral drug targets is limited. However, almost all viruses encode unique proteins and enzymes that may serve as specific targets for antiviral therapy. The overarching goal of modern drug development efforts is to design compounds that specifically inhibit viral targets or cellular targets essential for virus replication.</p>
