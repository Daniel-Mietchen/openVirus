<p id="p0035">To package their genomes into particles of very limited size, viruses encode few genes. Virions consist of an RNA or DNA genome that is protected by an outer shell called a capsid (also nucleocapsid) formed by a lattice of capsid proteins. In enveloped viruses, the capsid is additionally surrounded by a lipid bilayer spiked with viral proteins. The size of animal viruses ranges from approximately 25 nm to over 300 nm (
