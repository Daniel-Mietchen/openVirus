<p id="p0395">The HBV capsid protein is the building block of the viral core, surrounding the viral nucleic acid (pre-genomic RNA, pgRNA) and reverse transcriptase. The HBV core is icosahedral, formed by 240 copies of capsid protein dimers. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> HTS of HBV core assembly inhibitors using a modified HBV capsid protein has been described (
 <xref rid="bb1620" ref-type="bibr">Stray et al., 2006</xref>). The capsid protein was modified by deleting the nucleic acid binding domain, which is dispensable for capsid assembly, and the N-terminal assembly domain alone was used in the assay. To fluorescently label the HBV capsid protein, all cysteine residues dispensable for assembly were replaced with alanines. A unique cysteine residue (C150) was C-terminally joined to the assembly domain and labeled with fluorescent BODIPY-FL dye (C150BO). During assembly, capsid proteins dimerize, bringing C150BO residues close together and resulting in C150BO fluorescence self-quenching. Following incubation of the labeled HBV protein with inhibitors, fluorescence was measured in black 96-well microtiter plates.
