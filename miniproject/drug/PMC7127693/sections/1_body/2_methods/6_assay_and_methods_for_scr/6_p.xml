<p id="p0415">A rapid and simple turbidimetric method was developed to screen inhibitors of assembly of HCV core protein (
 <xref rid="bb0545" ref-type="bibr">Fromentin et al., 2007</xref>). For the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assembly reaction, two components, an N-terminal part of the HCV core protein corresponding to the minimal assembly competent domain and RNA corresponding to the full-length 5′UTR of HCV, were used. Assembly of HCV nucleocapsid-like particles was initiated by mixing the purified protein and nucleic acid, and the assembly process was monitored by measuring turbidity at 350 nm.
