<p id="p0420">Numerous viruses, including picornaviruses, retroviruses, alphaviruses, and flaviviruses, encode proteases that are essential for their virulence. The majority of viral proteases specifically cleave viral polyprotein precursors to liberate the functional proteins of the virion. Some viral proteases, such as the papain-like proteases of coronaviruses, also reprogram cellular signaling pathways, including ubiquitination mechanisms and interferon controlled responses, to prevent degradation of viral components (

 <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Buck et al., 2005</xref>) and retroviruses (
 <xref rid="bb0680" ref-type="bibr">Hallenberger et al., 1992</xref>), use also host cell proteases, mainly furin, to trim their envelope and surface proteins. This triggers conformational changes required for interaction with cellular receptors and membrane fusion in enveloped viruses. Some viruses use proteases other than furin to modulate their infectivity, as shown for viruses entering airway epithelial cells [reviewed in (
