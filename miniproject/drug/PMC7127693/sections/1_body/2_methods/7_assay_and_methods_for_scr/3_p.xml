<p id="p0425">Numerous 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays to monitor the activity of proteases and their inhibitors, including commercial kits, have been developed. Classical methods use synthetic peptides that mimic the target sites of the protease. Although some of the methods described here were not originally designed to screen the activity of viral proteases in the presence of inhibitors, they can be adapted for this purpose by simply changing the peptide sequence to the target site of the protease of interest. The cleavage yield is usually monitored either colorimetrically (

 <xref rid="bb1910" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>) or as a change in fluorescence triggered by the release of fluorescent labels such as 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) or rhodamine (

To study the specificity of inhibitor binding and to extend the research to rational design of inhibitors, X-ray or NMR structures of proteases in complex with the inhibitor may be determined, as reported in numerous cases for the proteases of HIV-1 [reviewed in (
