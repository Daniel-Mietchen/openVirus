<p id="p0275">The majority of viruses enter cells by endocytosis. Unfortunately, there are no suitable experimental techniques for endosome handling, making it difficult to study early steps in the viral life cycle such as uncoating and capsid disassembly. Viruses that enter cells by direct membrane fusion, such as HIV-1, are an exception. There are several methods available to monitor and quantify HIV uncoating. As some of these were reviewed recently by Campbell and Hope (
 <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Campbell and Hope, 2015</xref>), we will discuss them very briefly. Two main techniques are used in these assays: ultracentrifugation or utilization of HIV-1 specific cellular restriction factors. The “
 <italic>in vitro</italic> core-stability assay” is based on ultracentrifugation of released HIV-1 virions through a detergent layer, where the viral membrane dissolves, into a sucrose gradient, where the viral cores are concentrated (

 <xref rid="bb1625" ref-type="bibr">Stremlau et al., 2006</xref>). The “CsA-washout assay” involves specific cellular factors (TRIM-cyclophilin) that restrict HIV-1 infection by binding to the capsid core and cyclosporine A (CsA), which can effectively turn off restriction (

 <xref rid="s0085" ref-type="sec">Section 3.1</xref>), was reported (
