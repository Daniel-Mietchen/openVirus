<p id="p0250">A rapid cell-based HTS method was developed to assess SARS-CoV entry inhibitors (
 <xref rid="bb1905" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>). This Dual Envelope Pseudovirion (DEP) assay employs two HIV pseudoviruses: one encodes an envelope protein from the target virus and firefly luciferase and the second encodes a control, unrelated viral envelope protein and Renilla luciferase. Reporter expression is determined with the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Inclusion of the unrelated envelope protein greatly reduced false positive hits (

A similar approach employing four pseudotyped HIV viruses, carrying Marburg virus glycoprotein, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase isolated from A/Goose/Qinghai/59/05 (H5N1) influenza virus, Ebolavirus Zaire envelope glycoprotein, and Lassa virus envelope glycoprotein, has been used for entry inhibitor screening (
 <xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>). This screening identified multiple compounds with potent inhibitory activity against entry of both Marburg and Ebola viruses in human cancer cell lines, and confirmed their anti-Ebola activity in human primary cells (

To establish infection, the glycoproteins of these viruses must be processed by the host intracellular lysosomal protease cathepsin L (CatL). HTS resulted in identification of several inhibitors that block the cleavage of viral glycoprotein but not CatL itself (
