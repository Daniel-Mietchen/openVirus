<p id="p0235">Cell-based assays are routinely used to screen viral entry inhibitors. High throughput formats have been developed for screening of HIV-1 fusion inhibitors. Cell-cell fusion assays involve two types of cells: effector cells that stably (

 <xref rid="bb0725" ref-type="bibr">Herschhorn et al., 2011</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0845" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al., 2006</xref>) express HIV-Env glycoprotein and target cells that express CD4 and either CXCR4 or CCR5. Co-cultivation of these cells leads to HIV-1 Env-mediated cell membrane fusion, resulting in formation of multinucleated syncytia. Membrane fusion induces expression of a reporter protein such as luciferase (

This approach uses effector cells that express both HIV-1 Env and the Renilla luciferase (R-Luc) reporter protein using inducible tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) and target cells that express the HIV-1 receptor (CD4) and co-receptor (CCR5) and contain the firefly luciferase (F-Luc) reporter gene under the control of a tTA-responsive promoter. Upon fusion of the effector and target cells, tTA enters the target cells and activates the expression of the F-Luc reporter. The inhibition of fusion of cellular membranes is determined as a decrease in F-Luc luminescence, and the inhibitor specificity is measured as the R-Luc activity (
