<p id="p0260">In an infection competition assay, HBV particles were isolated and used to infect HepaRG and PHHs cells that had been pre-incubated with HBV envelope protein-derived peptides to test their potential activity to block HBV infection. Twelve days after infection, viral RNAs were quantified by Northern blot (
