 <xref rid="bb1155" ref-type="bibr">Marchand et al., 2001</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb1210" ref-type="bibr">Merkel et al., 2009</xref>). Initial methods used radioactively labeled DNA oligonucleotides comprising the terminal 
 <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequences of linear viral DNA required for integration. The joining of the processed strand to the other strand (self-integration) or to supplemented target DNAs can be analyzed by PAGE (

 <xref rid="bb0895" ref-type="bibr">Katzman et al., 1989</xref>). A less time-consuming, non-radioactive method involves time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurement using a 21-meric oligonucleotide fluorescently labeled on the terminal GT dinucleotide. This assay monitors the binding of integrase to the substrate as well as the subsequent 3′-processing reaction, which both change the anisotropy (
 <xref rid="bb0650" ref-type="bibr">Guiot et al., 2006</xref>). Alternatively, the yields of both the processing and joining reactions can be measured upon separation of the radioactively labeled product from the rest of the DNA molecule using adsorption to PEI-cellulose (
 <xref rid="bb1260" ref-type="bibr">Muller et al., 1993</xref>). A real-time HTS method measures fluorescence emission resulting from removal of the 3′-terminal dinucleotide, labeled with a quencher, by integrase (
 <xref rid="bb0705" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2007</xref>). Han et al. described a fluorescence method to screen molecules that inhibit binding of integrase to viral DNA (
 <xref rid="bb0690" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2013</xref>). Methods evaluating the integrase strand transfer reaction have been modified to a high-throughput format using magnetic beads (
 <xref rid="bb0710" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2008</xref>) or streptavidin-coated microplates (
 <xref rid="bb0855" ref-type="bibr">John et al., 2005</xref>). A method to assess strand transfer by time-resolved FRET with a europium-streptavidin-labeled substrate has been optimized for 384- and 1536-well plate formats (
