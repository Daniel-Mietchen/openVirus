<p id="p0290">Polymerase inhibitors represent the vast majority of clinically approved antiviral drugs, followed by protease inhibitors, immunostimulators, entry inhibitors, and integrase inhibitors [reviewed in (
 <xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">De Clercq and Li, 2016</xref>)]. Polymerases continue to be a preferred target for newly designed inhibitors (
 <xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">Clercq, 2008</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">De Clercq and Li, 2016</xref>). Polymerase inhibitors may be nucleoside and nucleotide analogs, pyrophosphate analogs, or nonnucleosides, such as allosteric inhibitors (
 <xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">De Clercq and Li, 2016</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb1290" ref-type="bibr">Ã–berg, 2006</xref>). Non-specific approaches such as plaque assays were initially used to monitor the effectiveness of polymerase inhibitors (
 <xref rid="bb1690" ref-type="bibr">Tino et al., 1993</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb1695" ref-type="bibr">Tisdale et al., 1993</xref>). The activity of these inhibitors also can be evaluated based on their ability to prevent the cytopathic effects of the virus (
 <xref rid="bb1880" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). More straightforward assays involve measurement of incorporated radio-labeled nucleotides, which directly reflects the polymerase activity (
 <xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">Coates et al., 1992</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0740" ref-type="bibr">Hirashima et al., 2006</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0875" ref-type="bibr">Joyce, 2010</xref>); these include HTS methods using homopolymeric polycytidylic acid and [
 <sup>3</sup>H]-GTP (
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Amraiz et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, the pyrophosphate released during the polymerase reaction can be measured luminometrically by combining the primer extension with the commercial PiPer assay (
 <xref rid="bb1145" ref-type="bibr">Malvezzi et al., 2015</xref>). The pyrophosphate anion also can be detected with DNA-attached magnetic nanoparticles (
 <xref rid="bb1705" ref-type="bibr">Tong et al., 2015</xref>) or quantum dots (
 <xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">Chai et al., 2015</xref>). Frequently used fluorescence methods avoid the use of radiochemicals. These methods exploit a fluorescent label, such as dsDNA binding dyes like SYBR green or PicoGreen (
 <xref rid="bb0445" ref-type="bibr">Driscoll et al., 2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0750" ref-type="bibr">Holden et al., 2009</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb1925" ref-type="bibr">Zipper et al., 2004</xref>), or FRET between two nucleotides (
 <xref rid="bb1540" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz and Quake, 2009</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb1800" ref-type="bibr">Weiss, 2000</xref>). Numerous kits for quantification of products of both DNA and RNA polymerases, including reverse transcriptase, are commercially available (
 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Bustin, 2000</xref>). Quantitative real-time PCR is a preferred method to monitor the activity of DNA polymerases (cellular as well as viral) in the presence of inhibitors (
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Beadle et al., 2016</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb1935" ref-type="bibr">Zweitzig et al., 2012</xref>), and quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR has become standard for screening inhibitors of viral RNA polymerases (
 <xref rid="bb1005" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2015</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb1300" ref-type="bibr">Okon et al., 2017</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb1360" ref-type="bibr">Pelliccia et al., 2017</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb1880" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). White et al. described a HTS method using a microfluidic apparatus combined with digital PCR for single-cell analysis (
 <xref rid="bb1805" ref-type="bibr">White et al., 2013</xref>). In their method, a fluorescently labeled template also serves as a primer, due to stem formation. It emits a measurable polarization signal both upon binding of the polymerase and extension (
 <xref rid="bb1215" ref-type="bibr">Mestas et al., 2007</xref>). The assay has been used for HTS of inhibitors of poliovirus RNA polymerase (
 <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Campagnola et al., 2011</xref>).
