<p id="p0285">Depending on the virus type, either DNA or RNA polymerases replicate the viral genome. Thus, these enzymes play a key role in viral life cycles. Reverse transcriptase, an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase of retro- and hepadnaviruses, is unique among nucleic acid polymerases. Despite the different mechanisms of viral replication, polymerases, which are essential for all viruses, are excellent targets for antiviral therapies.</p>
