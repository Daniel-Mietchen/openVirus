<p id="p0305">The viral gRNAs of some RNA viruses are modified at the 5â€² ends with cap structures, which may be either acquired from the host cell mRNA (e.g. in influenza virus) or newly synthesized (e.g. flaviviruses). The methylation of viral gRNA mimics that of cellular mRNA cap structures to enhance the chances of the virus to escape from cellular defense mechanisms and also to increase the efficiency of translation of viral proteins. Virus-specific methyltransferases are thus a promising therapeutic target.</p>
