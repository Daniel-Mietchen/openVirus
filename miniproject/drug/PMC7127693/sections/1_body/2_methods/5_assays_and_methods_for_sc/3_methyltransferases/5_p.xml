<p id="p0320">The activity of purified recombinant methyltransferases can be determined by measuring the methylation by-product S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) using commercially available kits. In one such assay, conversion of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to SAH is monitored luminometrically 
 <italic>via</italic> luciferase reaction, in which measurable ATP is generated through a sequence of reactions with MTase-Glo™ reagent (Promega). The EPIgeneous™ methyltransferase kit (CisBio Bioassays) is based on competition of produced SAH with fluorescently labeled SAH (SAH-d2 tracer) for binding to a terbium cryptate-labeled anti-SAH antibody. The decrease in FRET between the tracer and antibody is then evaluated. ELISA using anti-5-methylcytosine antibody can be used to quantify methylation of immobilized cytosine-rich DNA substrate (e.g. EpiQuik™ DNA Methyltransferase Activity/Inhibition Assay Kit; Epigentek). This method was modified with homogenous time resolved FRET (
