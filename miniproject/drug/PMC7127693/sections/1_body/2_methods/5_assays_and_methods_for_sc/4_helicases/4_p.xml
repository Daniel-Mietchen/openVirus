<p id="p0345">Helicase activity is fueled by ATP hydrolysis; thus, inhibition of ATPase activity became another possible antiviral strategy. ATPase activity can be determined either by the decrease in ATP or formation of ADP (using commercially available fluorescent anti-ADP antibodies) or inorganic pyrophosphate. Phosphates released by ATP hydrolysis can form a molybdophosphate complex that can be measured colorimetrically using malachite green, quinaldine red, or rhodamine B (
