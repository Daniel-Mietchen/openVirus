 <xref rid="bb1325" ref-type="bibr">Özeş et al., 2014</xref>). The substrate is usually a dsDNA oligonucleotide consisting of a fluorescently labeled strand annealed to the complementary strand carrying a quencher. This approach was also adapted for real-time determination of the RNA helicase activity of HCV (
 <xref rid="bb1665" ref-type="bibr">Tani et al., 2010</xref>). In this assay, an ssDNA capture strand complementary to the strand carrying the quencher was used to prevent reannealing of the unwound duplex. Recently, a colorimetric assay for monitoring helicase activity using DNA-conjugated gold nanoparticles was developed (
 <xref rid="bb0415" ref-type="bibr">Deka et al., 2017</xref>). This method is based on shifts in the optical properties of nanoparticles due to DNA unwinding and allows simple screening of inhibitor activity. The dsDNA melting curves can be determined spectrophotometrically (at 524 nm and 260 nm) or even by the naked eye. Another fluorescence HTS of dengue virus NS3 helicase inhibitors measures the unwinding of a double-labeled molecular beacon (

 <xref rid="bb0825" ref-type="bibr">Jang et al., 2013</xref>)]. A G-quadruplex-based method for label-free determination of HCV helicase NS3 activity measures changes in the luminescence of transition metal complexes with DNA upon helicase-mediated quadruplex melting (
