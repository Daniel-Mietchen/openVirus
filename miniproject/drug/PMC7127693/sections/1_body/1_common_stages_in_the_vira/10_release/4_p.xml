<p id="p0210">The final step that results in the separation of virus from the cell surface is pinching off the particle. This is a controlled process that involves both viral protein domains and cellular factors. During this process, viruses apparently use cellular machinery similar to that used during the last step of cell division (the release of the daughter cell) called endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) [reviewed in (
