<p id="p0115">The nature of the genome not only dictates the mechanism of replication, but also has other important consequences. The genome of (+)RNA viruses may serve directly as mRNA for production of viral proteins. Therefore, the mere introduction of genetic material (e.g. in exocytic vesicles) may result in productive infection. The RNA polymerases that copy the genetic material of RNA viruses are error-prone, which provides considerable genetic flexibility and the propensity to evolve drug-resistant mutants. These features are amplified in viruses with segmented genomes that undergo reassortment.</p>
