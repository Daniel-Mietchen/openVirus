<p id="p0195">Flaviviruses form icosahedral particles upon budding into the neutral milieu of the ER. The particles then translocate to the more acidic environment of the trans-Golgi network. This pH shift results in disassembly of the immature lattice and extensive rearrangement of the flaviviral particle. This is connected with the exposure of a viral structural glycoprotein (prM) that is specifically processed by the cellular protease furin in the trans-Golgi network. The liberated globular heads of prM remain attached at the low pH, but are released when the virus enters neutral body fluids (
