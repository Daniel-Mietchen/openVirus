<p id="p0150">Orthomyxoviruses and herpesviruses are enveloped viruses that assemble their nucleoproteins in the nucleus. Herpesviruses package their dsDNA genome as head-to-tail concatemers and assemble icosahedral procapsids on scaffold proteins in the nucleus [reviewed in (
 <xref rid="bb0720" ref-type="bibr">Heming et al., 2017</xref>)]. However, subsequent steps of herpesvirus assembly proceed in the cytoplasm. The preassembled procapsid is too large to pass through the NPC, but it exits the nucleus by viral protein-driven vesicular transport across the nuclear inner membrane leaflet. Thus, the herpesvirus acquires an initial envelope from the inner nuclear membrane [for review see (
 <xref rid="bb0515" ref-type="bibr">Fields et al., 2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0715" ref-type="bibr">Hellberg et al., 2016</xref>)]. Next, the herpesviral membrane fuses with the outer nuclear membrane, and the naked particle is released from the nucleus into the cytosol. Here, the virus acquires tegument (a protein layer between the capsid and the envelope) and other proteins. Final herpesvirus envelopment occurs at the Golgi membrane containing the viral glycoproteins (

Preassembled orthomyxoviral ribonucleoproteins, upon their export from the nucleus, are driven to the plasma membrane to which they attach through electrostatic interactions of the matrix protein M1 with membrane phosphatidylserine. The virions then assemble simultaneously with budding during which they also acquire HA, NA and M2 membrane proteins. Poxviruses undergo an even more complicated pathway. They are enveloped with multiple membranes acquired from ER/intermediate compartments and Golgi or early endosomes (
