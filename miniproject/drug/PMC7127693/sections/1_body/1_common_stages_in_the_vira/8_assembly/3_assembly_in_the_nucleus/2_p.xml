<p id="p0145">The limiting step for nuclear assembly is the size of NPCs, which are large enough to transport RNA and import proteins required for assembly into the nucleus; however, NPC size limits the transport of larger assemblies. Therefore, some viruses form assembly intermediates in the nucleus. These structures are then exported to the cytoplasm, where they come together to form viral particles. Nuclear export is specific and depends on the presence of nuclear export signals (NES) in the transported proteins. One example of a nonenveloped icosahedral virus that assembles in the nucleus is adenovirus, the assembly of which has been studied intensely due to its potential use in gene therapies [reviewed in (
 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Ahi and Mittal, 2016</xref>)]. Recent data suggest that upon accumulation of multiple copies of adenoviral dsDNA genomes, coordinated assembly and packaging occur by two interlinked mechanisms that involve both capsid proteins and core components (

The assembly occurs in the so-called peripheral replicative zone with the assistance of scaffolding proteins that facilitate formation of adenoviral particles but are excluded from mature viruses. Adenoviruses are finally released upon lysis of the infected host cell.
