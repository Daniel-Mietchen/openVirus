<p id="p0070">To infect a cell, viruses must overcome the plasma membrane to deliver their genetic material into the cytosol. Viruses enter cells by two main mechanisms. A majority of animal viruses, both enveloped and nonenveloped, enter cells by one or two types of endocytosis, such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis (e.g. VSV, influenza A virus, rhinovirus), caveolin-mediated uptake (echovirus, polyoma virus), clathrin/caveolin-independent endocytosis such as caveolar or lipid raft-mediated (e.g. SV40, polyomavirus mouse), or macropinocytosis (e.g. vaccinia virus, respiratory syncytial virus, Ebola virus, HIV-1) (

These endocytic mechanisms enable the virus to be transported by the cellâ€™s machinery through the plasma membrane and to pass through the dense actin cortex. Cellular entry of some viruses is coupled with receptor-mediated signaling, resulting in activation of molecules that facilitate virus entry by cytoskeleton reorganization, induction of long-distance transport of the virus-containing vesicles, or actin cortex disassembly. The second type of entry is used by some enveloped viruses (paramyxo-, herpes-, and retroviruses), which upon cell surface receptor binding, infect the cell by direct fusion of viral and plasma membranes at neutral pH.
