<p>Most of the therapeutic options that are available for managing COVID-19 are based on previous experiences in treating SARS- and MERS-CoV. A major reason for the lack of approved and commercially available vaccines or therapeutic agents against these CoVs might be the relative lack of interest among the pharmaceutical companies.

 </sup> These are outbreak scenarios: the demand for drugs or vaccines lasts only for a period while the outbreak lasts. The number of affected people will also be a small proportion of the global drug and vaccine market. So by the time a new drug or vaccine is developed, there might not be any patients for clinical trials and also no meaningful market for newly discovered drugs. According to WHO guidelines, infected patients will receive supportive care including oxygen therapy, fluid therapy, and antibiotics for treating secondary bacterial infections. The WHO also recommends the isolation of patients suspected or confirmed for COVID-19.

 </sup> The major therapeutic drugs that might be effective in managing COVID-19 include remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir alone or in combination with interferon-Î², convalescent plasma, and mAbs.

 </sup> Nevertheless, before utilizing these drugs for COVID-19 pneumonia patients, clinical efficacy, and safety studies should be conducted.
