<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of the family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> (subfamily 
 <italic>Coronavirinae</italic>) that infect a wide host range to produce diseases ranging from common cold to severe/fatal illnesses. The novel virus was initially named “2019-nCoV” which was changed to “SARS-CoV-2” by the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), since it was found to be the sister virus of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).

 </sup> The ongoing coronavirus threat that emerged in China has rapidly spread to other countries and has been declared as a global health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO). Many nations are diverting their best efforts for the implementation of appropriate preventive and control strategies. Neither vaccines nor direct-acting antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of human and animal coronavirus infections.
