<p>Technology is available for making fully human antibodies (such as human single-chain antibodies; Hu-scFvs) or humanized-nanobodies (single-domain antibodies, sdAb, VH/VHH) that can traverse across the membrane of the virus-infected cells (trans bodies) and bind to or interfere with biological activities of replicating virus proteins which consequently leads to inhibition of virus replication. Examples include trans bodies to influenza virus, hepatitis C virus, Ebola virus, and Dengue virus.

 </sup> Thus, it is possible to generate trans bodies to CoV intracellular proteins such as the papain-like proteases (PLpro), cysteine-like protease (3CLpro) or other non-structural proteins (nsps) that are pivotal for CoV replication and transcription for safe, non-immunogenic, broadly effective passive immunization of CoV-exposed subjects and treatment of infected patients.
