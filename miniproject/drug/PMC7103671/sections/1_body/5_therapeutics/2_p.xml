<p>S protein is considered the major target for designing CoV antiviral therapies such as S protein inhibitors, S cleavage inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies, RBD–ACE2 blockers, siRNAs, fusion core blockers, and protease inhibitors.

 </sup> All such therapeutic strategies have shown potential 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and/or 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-CoV activities. Comparatively, even though 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies performed with these agents have shown efficacy, most of them lack sufficient support due to the lack of randomized animal or human trials, hence of limited use for COVID-19. Hence, the necessary support of extensive animal and human trials is required for such therapeutics to become useful. The binding of COVID-19 and ACE2 affects the balance of renin–angiotensin system (RAS), potentially leading to exacerbation of severe pneumonia. Thus, it is speculated that ACEI and angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT1R) inhibitors might be able to reduce pulmonary inflammatory responses, thereby reducing the mortality.
