<p>Early effort was directed in developing animal models for SARS-CoV, but the specificity of the virus to ACE2 (receptor of SARS-CoV) was a major hindrance to such efforts. Later, a SARS-CoV transgenic mouse model was developed by introducing hACE2 gene into the mouse genome.

 </sup> The first animal model used for developing a MERS-CoV vaccine was rhesus macaques. Infected animals showed clinical symptoms such as increased body temperature, piloerection, cough, hunched posture, and reduced food intake.

 </sup> Another frequently used animal model for MERS-CoV is the common marmoset, wherein the virus caused lethal pneumonia.

 </sup> Humoral and cell-mediated immunity could be detected in both rhesus macaques and common marmoset following MERS-CoV immunization.

 </sup> Roberts et al. established golden Syrian hamsters (strain LVG) as a model to assess vaccine protection to different SARS-CoV strains.

 </sup> These hamsters are a potential model for studying CoV pathology and pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy. The attenuated NSP16 CoV vaccine was studied in mice.
