<p>Attempts to develop animal models for MERS-CoV such as mice, hamsters, and ferrets face limitations due to the inability of MERS-CoV to replicate in the respiratory tracts of these species. Small animals (mice or hamsters) resisting natural infection with MERS-CoVs (which are susceptible to SARS-CoV) have been genetically modified to a more humanized structure, e.g., hDPP4 human, hDPP4-transduced, and hDPP4-Tg mice (transgenic for expressing hDPP4), and ascertained for susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection.

 </sup> Alteration in the mouse genome using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing tool could make the animals susceptible to CoV infection and virus replication.
