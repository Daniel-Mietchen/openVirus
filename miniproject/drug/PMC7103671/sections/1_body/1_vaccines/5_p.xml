 </sup> The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) recently announced the initiation of three programs aimed to develop COVID-19 vaccines by utilizing established vaccine platforms.

 </sup> Among the three programs, two are continuations of previously initiated partnerships. CEPI collaborated with Inovio in 2018 to developing DNA vaccine candidates for MERS ($56 M funding). The vaccine in development utilizes DNA Medicines’ platform for delivering synthetic genes into cells for translation into antigenic proteins, which elicit T-cell and antibody responses. CEPI has collaborated with The University of Queensland in 2019 to develop the molecular clamp vaccine platform against multiple viral pathogens including MERS-CoV ($10 M funding). The vaccine platform functions by synthesizing viral surface proteins that get attached to the host cells and clamp them into shape. This facilitates easier recognition of antigens by the immune system.

 </sup> Other than these ongoing programs, CEPI has announced funding to Moderna for comparing mRNA therapeutics and vaccines. They will design and manufacture an mRNA vaccine in collaboration with the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

 </sup> NIAID-VRC scientists are developing a vaccine candidate expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein in the mRNA vaccine platform technology. This vaccine is expected to undergo clinical testing in the coming months.
