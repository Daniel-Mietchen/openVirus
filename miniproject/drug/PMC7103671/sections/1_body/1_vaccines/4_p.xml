<p>Immuno-informatics approach can be used for the identification of epitopes for inclusion in COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Recently, immuno-informatics was used to identify significant cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and B-cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The interactions between these epitopes and their corresponding MHC class I molecules were studied further by using molecular dynamics simulations and found that the CTL epitopes bind with MHC class I peptide-binding grooves

 </sup> Such epitopes may possess the ideal characteristics to become part of COVID-19 vaccine candidates. The nucleocapsid (N) protein as well as the potential B cell epitopes of the E protein of MERS-CoV has been suggested as probable immuno-protective targets that induce both T-cell and neutralizing antibody responses.

 </sup> Reverse genetic strategies have been successfully used in live-attenuated vaccines to inactivate the exonuclease effects of non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) or to delete the envelope protein in SARS.

 </sup> Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a chicken CoV. It was suggested that avian live virus IBV vaccine (strain H) might be useful for SARS
