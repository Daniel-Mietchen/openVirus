<p>The possibility of developing a universal CoV vaccine was assessed based on the similarity in T-cell epitopes of SARS- and MERS-CoV that confirmed the potential for cross-reactivity among CoVs.

 </sup> such that vaccines developed for SARS-CoV may exhibit cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2. The comparative evaluation performed on full-length S protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV identified that the most variable residues were located in the S1 subunit of S protein, the critical CoV vaccine target.

 </sup> These findings suggest that the specific neutralizing antibodies that are effective against the SARS-CoV might not be effective against the SARS-CoV-2. Even though the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has key mutations compared to the SARS-CoV, they will still act as a viable target for vaccine development.

 </sup> Likewise, the close similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to the SARS-CoV suggests that the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 might be the same as that of SARS-CoV receptor (ACE2).
