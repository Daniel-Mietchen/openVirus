<p>Multiple strategies are adopted in the development of CoV vaccines; most of these target the surface-exposed spike (S) glycoprotein or S protein as the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Several S-protein-based strategies have been attempted for developing CoV vaccines, e.g., use of full-length S protein or S1-receptor-binding domain (RBD) and expression in virus-like particles (VLP), DNA, or viral vectors

 </sup> The S protein molecule contains two subunits, S1 and S2. The S1 subunit has an RBD that interacts with its host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), whereas the S2 subunit mediates fusion between the virus and host cell membranes for releasing viral RNA into the cytoplasm for replication.

 </sup> Hence, S-protein-based vaccines should induce antibodies that block not only viral receptor binding but also virus genome uncoating. It has been shown that the C-terminal domain of the S1 subunit of porcine 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic> constitutes the immunodominant region, and the immune response to this region shows the most potent neutralizing effect.

 </sup> The S protein has a major role in the induction of protective immunity during infection with SARS-CoV by eliciting neutralizing-antibodies and T-cell responses.

 </sup> Thus, full-length or appropriate parts of the S glycoprotein are believed to be the most promising candidate CoV vaccine composition. It was also reported that neither the absence nor presence of the other structural proteins affects S protein immunogenicity or its binding to the ACE2 receptor that is a critical initial step for virus to access into the host cell.

 </sup> Due to the superior ability of RBD to induce neutralizing antibody, both recombinant proteins that contain RBD and the recombinant vectors that encode RBD can be used for developing the effective SARS-CoV vaccines.
