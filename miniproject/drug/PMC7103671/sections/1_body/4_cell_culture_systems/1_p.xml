<p>Several permissive cell lines to hCoVs including monkey epithelial cell lines (LLC-MK2 and Vero-B4) have been used in neutralization assays for assessing neutralization titers of antibody preparations. Goat lung cells, alpaca kidney cells, and dromedary umbilical cord cells have been found to be permissive for MERS-CoV.
