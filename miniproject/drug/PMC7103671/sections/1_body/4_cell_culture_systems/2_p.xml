<p>Pseudotyped virions/VLPs encoding reporter systems such as GFP or luciferase can be used for quantification and evaluation of the effectiveness of mAbs and drugs in inhibiting the cellular entry of CoVs.

 </sup> Assays using pseudotyped virions/VLPs can be performed in BSL-2 facility since these do not use infectious virus. A safety concern for passive immunization with antibodies is a possible antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of virus replication. Antibodies with modified Fc fragments or without Fc fragment,
