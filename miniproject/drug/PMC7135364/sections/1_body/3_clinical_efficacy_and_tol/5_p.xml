 <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Although remdesivir therapy was not favoured due to the high mortality rate of 53.1% (93/175), no detailed clinical or biochemical side effects associated with remdesivir therapy was ever described; the safety profile of remdesivir was not challenged. One patient on remdesivir therapy developed hypotension and cardiac arrest after discontinuation of the loading dose; however, the authors explained that such an adverse event cannot be excluded to be related to underlying Ebola virus disease, a potentially fatal infectious disease.
