<p id="para0013">The first case of COVID-19 in Washington, USA, was compassionately treated with i.v. remdesivir for the progression of pneumonia on Day 7 of hospitalisation 
 <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Interestingly, the patient's condition improved and no obvious adverse effects were observed. Of note, real-time reverse transcription PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs remained positive at 4 days after the administration of remdesivir, but the authors noted a trend in the decline of viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs [cycle threshold values: illness Day 7 (the day of remdesivir administration), 23–24; Day 11, 33–34; and Day 12, 37–40]. The oropharyngeal swab tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 one day later. Of course, it is too early to conclude the direct antiviral effect of remdesivir on enhanced clearing of viral loads in the respiratory tract, but it indeed suggests a promising therapeutic effect of remdesivir.
