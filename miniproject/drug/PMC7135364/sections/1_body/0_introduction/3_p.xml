 <italic>.</italic> Currently, there are four genera in the subfamily Coronavirinae of the family Coronaviridae: 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Gammacoronavirus</italic>. Before the current COVID-19 epidemic, there were six recognised human respiratory coronaviruses, including HCoV-229E (
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic>), HCoV-OC43 (
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>), HCoV-NL63 (
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic>) and HKU1 (
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>) that often cause mild respiratory tract infection as well as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that in contrast can lead to severe or even fatal lower respiratory tract disease 
 <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The seventh human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, belongs to the genus
