<p>The question, then, based on this evidence, is which viruses should be studied to prepare a vaccine to control the next pandemic? Will type A (H2N2) return, in keeping with the recycling theory? Much of the population will now be susceptible. Type A (H9N2), a less pathogenic avian virus, has transmitted occasionally to humans, with little or no further transmission, but has not produced disease with high case fatality (

Other viruses, such as the A (H7) highly pathogenic avian strains, including A (H7N7), which infected humans in the Netherlands, and A (H7N3), which spread extensively in western Canada, can also be considered candidates but are not as high on the list since fewer transmissions to humans and less clinical disease have been seen (
