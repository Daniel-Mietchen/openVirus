<p>With ordinary influenza viruses of pandemic potential, such as type A (H2N2) and A (H9N2), treatment success in the interpandemic period would be more likely relevant to the pandemic. Such may not be the case with the type A (H5N1) virus. The virus has evolved since the 1997 Hong Kong outbreak, and some evidence of a systemic infection involving the brain and gastrointestinal tract exists (

 </xref>) and means that the drug may need to reach adequate concentration in these sites, remote from the respiratory tract. Zanamivir is not orally bioavailable and is thus not likely to be useful in treating influenza A (H5N1) infection, although it might play a role in prophylaxis. Oseltamivir, in contrast, is absorbed and metabolized. While human studies of oseltamivir in treatment would be critical now, such studies have been difficult to carry out, since the disease has been occurring in areas where recognition of the cause is often delayed. We have yet to determine whether the mixed results that have been described with this drug in the limited case reports are due to late treatment or other factors, such as need for higher doses (

 </xref>). A planned clinical trials network may solve this problem. In the meantime, animal studies are urgently needed to evaluate dosage and duration of therapy, particularly against the Vietnam strain of the A (H5N1) virus. These studies would help guide treatment of human cases until more data are available. Mouse studies have already indicated that, while oseltamivir is effective, it is not as effective when given for 5 days as it was against the 1997 Hong Kong variant of A (H5N1) influenza (

  <italic>36</italic>
 </xref>). This finding indicates that treatment for 10 days might be necessary, since in the mouse studies, replication resumed after therapy was stopped. The dose may also need to be increased. Studies in ferrets and nonhuman primates would have more relevance to the situation in humans than studies in mice.
