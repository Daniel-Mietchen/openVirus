<p>A live, attenuated vaccine would more likely produce antibodies after 1 injection and would have a number of other theoretical advantages over inactivated vaccine in a pandemic. Unfortunately, such a vaccine will not generally be considered for 2 reasons. First, production requires specific pathogenâ€“free eggs and these will be in shorter supply than ordinary eggs. This could change if cell culture could be used. However, the bigger problem involves evaluation before and use early in the pandemic. Since this vaccine virus could reassort, it might introduce the pandemic virus into the population if used too early. The question also arises whether attenuation would be successful with a new and potentially more virulent wild type, a result which could be evaluated in advance in animals (
