<p>While supplies of vaccines will increase as the pandemic evolves, antiviral drug supplies will decrease as stockpiles are depleted. The starting level will depend on the amount of stockpiling, based more on economic and policy consideration than science. As with vaccines, planning decisions will be in place to prioritize use during the initial period, which may need to be modified based on epidemiologic characteristics of the outbreak and clinical characteristics of the cases. The key virologic issue will be whether the pandemic strain is susceptible to the antiviral drugs. Most recent planning, since it is focused on the threat of the A (H5N1) virus, has assumed that adamantanes would not be useful. This assumption means that if the disease is systemic and case fatality is high, among the NAIs only oseltamivir would be useful, since it is absorbed (

 </xref>). Given the limited quantities likely to be available, at least in the near future, the drug will have to be restricted to treat those most likely to die or have severe consequences. Careful observation of treatment results will help to determine if the dose and duration of therapy is appropriate. Seasonal prophylaxis uses larger quantities of drug, but possibly limited postexposure use could be feasible. Zanamivir, if available, might find its role in prevention. Infection is likely through the respiratory tract, and given past evidence, the drug could make a major contribution in prophylaxis before vaccine is available. Throughout, mechanisms need to be in place to monitor antiviral resistance, which might emerge as a problem with extensive use of the drugs. A long-term goal should be to develop new antiviral agents against influenza. The global reliance on basically 1 drug from 1 source cannot be allowed to continue. Other NAIs are available for clinical evaluation, and drugs targeting other phases of influenza viral replication would be especially useful.
