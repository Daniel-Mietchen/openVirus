<p>Given the threat of a virulent virus such as A (H5N1) and the suggestion that adaptation to transmissibility may occur gradually, the concept has emerged that antiviral drugs may be used to interrupt early, local transmission. The aim would be to prevent spread out of the region of origin, in other words, extinguishing the epidemic at its source (

 </xref>). Thus, this goal seems worthy of consideration on more than a theoretical basis. Models also suggest that the approach might be more likely to succeed with partial immunity in the population (

  <italic>42</italic>
 </xref>). This immunity could be produced by prior vaccination with a current A (H5N1) vaccine. Practical issues may be of greatest concern, especially the ability to put antiviral prophylaxis in place rapidly in rings around cases. Supplies of oseltamivir are also an issue. Will those countries with stockpiles be willing to share with other countries on the possibility, not certainty, that a pandemic could be avoided?
