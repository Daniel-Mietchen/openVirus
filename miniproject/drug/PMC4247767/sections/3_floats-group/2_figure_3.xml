   <bold>Concept of integrating drug combination theory and viral dynamics.</bold> The effect of a drug combination calculated by mathematical modeling of viral dynamics could be assessed by the Loewe additivity and Bliss independence. This approach could improve antiviral therapy by predicting the effect of a drug combination 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
   <italic>in vitro</italic>, estimating the optimal drug dosage and combination, and discovering how the drugs interact.
