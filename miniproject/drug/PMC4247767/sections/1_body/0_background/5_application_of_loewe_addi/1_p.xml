<p>We here explain the usefulness of combining the Loewe additivity with mathematical modeling of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. The aim is to optimize the antiviral drug combination. Combining multiple drugs such as interferon-α and ribavirin is a standard therapy for enhancing the antiviral effects and reducing the risk of drug-resistant viruses. However, the conventional anti-HCV drugs fail to eradicate HCV genotype 1 in about 40% patients and may cause severe side effects. To overcome these problems, researchers have developed and administered direct acting antiviral (DAA) drugs that target viral-specific proteins such as viral proteases, as adjuncts to conventional anti-HCV drugs. To understand the principle behind optimal drug combinations and doses, we focused on the essential features of HCV replication and the mechanisms of the antiviral drugs (Figure  
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Using previous mathematical models of HCV replication in a host cell [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], a modified mathematical model accounting for the mechanisms of drug actions would quantitatively simulate the anti-HCV effects at any dose of a drug combination. The effects of the drug combination at specific doses could then be evaluated by the Loewe additivity. In this way, we could estimate the synergistic dose point of a drug combination that enhances the anti-HCV effects (Figure  
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). The above analysis could predict the optimal drug combination that both reduces the total dose of each drug and enhances their anti-HCV effects.
