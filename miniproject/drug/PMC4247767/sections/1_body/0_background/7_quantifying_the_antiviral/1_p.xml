<p>The Bliss independence measure can predict antiviral effects as well as evaluate drug combinations. To illustrate this idea, we estimate the anti-HIV effect of a well-known antiviral host factor by Bliss independence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) suppresses HIV replication in cells by two main mechanisms: (1) inhibiting viral reverse transcriptase and (2) mutating cytidine (C) to uracil (U) in viral DNA by cytidine deaminase activity (Figure  
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). Although the anti-HIV effect of reverse transcriptase inhibition can be measured using a mutated APOBEC3G (with its C-to-U activity removed) (Figure  
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A), the extent to which the mutation itself inhibits HIV replication cannot be experimentally determined. To quantify the anti-HIV effect of C-to-U mutation by APOBEC 3G, we can use Bliss independence to model the unaffected fractions of viral infectivity of wild-type (WT) and mutant APOBEC3G, denoted
