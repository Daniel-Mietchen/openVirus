<p>Bliss independence is the other major criterion for clarifying drug combination effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Bliss independence defines the expectation of a combined drug effect, calculated by multiplying the probabilities of the individual drugs. It assumes that each drug independently targets a different stage of viral replication via a different mechanism, with no interaction between the drug actions. Bliss independence expresses the unaffected probability of a two-drug combination
