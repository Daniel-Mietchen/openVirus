<p>If the combined effect of the single drug doses is consistent with Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ6" ref-type="">6</xref>), this drug combination is evaluated as additive according to the Bliss independence measure. For instance, suppose that drugs A and B exhibit 50% and 60% inhibition, respectively. The Bliss independence predicts that drugs A and B will exert a combined inhibitory effect of 80%, calculated as
