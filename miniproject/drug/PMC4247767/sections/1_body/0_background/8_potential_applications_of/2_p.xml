<p>The above research potentially benefits not only cancer chemotherapy, but also antiviral therapy development. For instance, Owens 
 <italic>et al.</italic>[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] showed how HCV replication responds to chemical combinations that inhibit some enzymes involved in the sterol biosynthesis pathway. Supplementing computational simulation with 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, they identified a rational inhibitor combination as a novel drug candidate. Mathematical models of HCV dynamics during drug therapy have also been investigated at the intracellular level [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], the intercellular level [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], and on a scale encompassing both levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. These studies have quantitatively elucidated the properties of anti-HCV drugs such as interferon and protease inhibitors. Furthermore, by inputting clinical data to a mathematical model of HCV dynamics, Rong 
 <italic>et al.</italic>[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] derived a mechanism by which drug-resistant viruses can rapidly emerge during single-drug therapy. Applying drug combination theories to these studies, mathematical models of HCV dynamics could be used to optimize the anti-HCV drug dosage and combination, thereby enhancing the anti-viral effect and reducing the risk of drug-resistant viruses (Figure  
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
