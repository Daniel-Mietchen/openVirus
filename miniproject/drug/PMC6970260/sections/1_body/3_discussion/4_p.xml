<p>Although we did not directly compare the results between the medication classes, a particularly low percentage of correct answers was observed for gastrointestinal and antiallergic drugs in both physicians and students, and antithrombotic and antidiabetic medications in the students. A relatively high percentage of correct answers was found for rheumatologic drugs, opioids, and antibiotics requiring dose modification. Good awareness and knowledge about renal recommendations for antirheumatic medications in internal medicine house-staff has been reported by Surana et al,

The same applied to digoxin, a drug well-known for its adverse reactions and narrow therapeutic index, which was correctly classified as a drug with renal precautions in nearly 90% of physicians and students. In contrast, relatively good results for antibiotics requiring dose adjustment are contrary to previously reported findings.
