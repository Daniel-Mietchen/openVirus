<p>Both physicians and students had difficulties with determination of drugs that do not need dose adjustment and do not require special precautions in patients with CKD. For example, less than 20% of physicians knew that telmisartan, valsartan, and quinapr﻿il can be safely administered in normal doses in such patients. A very low percentage of correct answers was also found for dalteparin, fluoxetine, valproic acid, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin. Moreover, the percentage of answers “no renal recommendations” within a given drug class was very similar regardless of the actual recommendations (eg, cilazapril and perindopril vs. quinapril; dalteparin vs. enoxaparin; amoxicillin and clarithromycin vs. levofloxacin). Taking unnecessary precautions may lead to underdosing of drugs, especially important in antibiotherapy.
