<p>Overall, 138 physicians and 183 medical students completed the questionnaire. Detailed data on students’ and physicians’ responses are shown in 
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. For clarity, percentage was shown for correct answers only. The percentage of correct answers “No renal precautions” ranged from 16.9% (fluoxetine) to 68.3% (pantoprazole) in the students and from 14.5% (valproic acid and dalteparin) to 81.2% (pantoprazole) in the physicians. The percentage of correct classifications of drugs requiring dose reduction ranged from 6% (rivaroxaban) to 67.2% (ciprofloxacin) in the students, and from 24.6% (ranitidine) to 85.5% (ciprofloxacin) in the physicians. For drugs that should be avoided in subjects with eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2, the range was 6% (metoclopramide) to 27.3% (alendronic acid) in the students, and 8.7% (sotalol) to 76.1% (metformin) in the physicians. When the last two categories were pooled together (“drugs with renal recommendations”), the range was 37.2% (enoxaparin) to 87.4% (digoxin) in the students, and 28.3% (ranitidine) to 94.9% (ciprofloxacin and methotrexate) in the physicians. The percentage of lacking responses (interpreted as “I do not know”) was rather low (up to 3–6%), with the exception of topiramate and amantadine (8.0 and 9.4%) in the physicians, and famotidine, memantine, levetiracetam, amiloride, venlafaxine, topiramate, donepezil and rivastigmine (8.2–9.2%) in the students.
