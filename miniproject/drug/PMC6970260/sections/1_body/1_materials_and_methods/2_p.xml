<p>The questionnaire comprised a list of 64 drugs commonly used in older patients, 45 of which require dose adjustment or should be avoided in subjects with eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m
 <sup>2</sup>. Drugs were divided into 11 groups: diuretics (5 drugs), cardiovascular (9 drugs), antithrombotic (4 drugs), neuropsychotropic (17 drugs), analgesics (5 drugs), antirheumatic (3 drugs), gastrointestinal (5 drugs), antibiotic/antiviral (9 drugs), antidiabetic (2 drugs), antiallergic (3 drugs), and antiosteoporotic (2 drugs). The questionnaire comprised three possible responses to each medication: 1) does not need any renal precautions; 2) dose should be reduced; and 3) should be avoided. If a respondent did not choose any option, it was interpreted as “I do not know.” The selection of drugs for analysis and recommendations on prescription modifications were based on guidelines from the American Geriatrics Society 2015 Beers Criteria Update Expert Panel,

 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Respondents were not allowed to use any mobile or computer-based dose-adjusting systems. Percentage of correct answers (“no renal precautions,” “dose reduction” and “avoid”) was calculated for each medication. As prescribing recommendations may vary between sources, we additionally analyzed combined category “drugs with renal recommendations” (“dose reduction” + “avoid”) to assess “renal awareness.” Percentage of correct answers in both groups of respondents was compared with the chi
 <sup>2</sup> test with Yates correction (if appropriate). Statistical analysis was performed with StatSoft Statistica v12. P value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.
