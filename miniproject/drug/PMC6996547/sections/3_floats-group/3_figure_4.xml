   <sub>2</sub> NPs of 200 nm could enhance the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and promote expression of cytokines associated with innate immunity in mice. Non-infected mice were sacrificed on days 1 and 3 after intraperitoneal administration and spleens were collected. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Maturation of DCs was measured through FACS analysis. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Expression levels of cytokines (IFN-α, IFN-β, and IL1-β) were determined through qPCR. These results are mean ± SD values obtained from three distinct animals and are representative of three independent experiments. *, P &lt; 0.05; **, P &lt; 0.01; and ***, P &lt; 0.001 compared to the control group.
