<p>Influenza A virus is one of the most common respiratory pathogens worldwide. In 1997, the Ô¨Årst major epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 occurred in Hong Kong. Since then, it has become well known for its potential to cause global pandemics in humans and mammals at all ages with considerable risks of morbidity and high fatality rates; it is now considered a growing threat to public health around the world.

 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> To date, it has been classified as a List A disease by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and as a Category 1 animal disease in China. A variety of antiviral drugs and vaccines have been adopted to prevent and control influenza-induced illness. However, it remains difficult to limit the spread of these viruses due to their highly contagious nature, frequent mutation of viral genes, and the emergence of resistant influenza strains due to the widespread abuse of antiviral drugs. Therefore, new approaches to fighting influenza virus infection are urgently needed. Due to unique structure and chemical characteristics, including large surface area, strong targeting performance, good biocompatibility, and high adsorption capacity, NPs have many benefits over conventional materials. Therefore, NPs have been widely applied in clinical trials. As carriers of anti-tumor drugs, NPs can significantly improve the curative effects of tumor therapies and reduce toxic drug side effects, making them attractive candidates for cancer therapy.

Herein, we have demonstrated that NPs alone effectively inhibit viral replication in a mouse model and protect mice from H5N1 infection. Our data further confirm the feasibility of the use of NPs alone as therapeutic agents to control influenza infection.
