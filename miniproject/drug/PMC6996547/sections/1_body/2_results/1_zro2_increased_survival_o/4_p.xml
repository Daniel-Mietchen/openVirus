<p>To explore whether the effect of NPs against H5N1 infection was dose-dependent, an experiment was performed using ZrO
 <sub>2</sub>, SNs, and PS at different dosages. We found that NPs could dramatically increase the survival rate and reduce the average body weight of mice within a narrower range compared to the glucose group. The survival rates of mice in the 25 mg/kg ZrO
 <sub>2</sub>, 50 mg/kg ZrO
 <sub>2</sub>, and 100 mg/kg ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> groups were 100%, 85.7%, and 100%, which were all significantly higher than that in the glucose group (42.9%). Although the survival rates showed modest differences among dosages of NPs, the range of weight loss was reduced with increasing dosage (

 <sub>2</sub> at a dosage of 100 mg/kg could improve the survival of H5N1-infected mice.
