<p>SNs were prepared as previously described.
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Briefly, SNs were synthesized through a two-step selective-etching method. In the first step, organicâ€“inorganic hybrid solid silica spheres (HSSSs) were elaborately designed with a three-layer sandwich structure. The core and outer layer, or shell, were made up of a pure silica framework hydrolyzed from tetraethylorthosilane (TEOS), and the middle layer comprised organic silica co-condensed from TEOS and N-[3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl]ethylenediamine (TSD). In the second step, HSSSs were converted into SNs with an appropriate amount of aqueous hydrofluoric acid.
