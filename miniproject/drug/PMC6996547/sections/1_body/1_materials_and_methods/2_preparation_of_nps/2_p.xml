<p>ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> was prepared as previously described.
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Briefly, SNs were employed as templates. SNs underwent a dewatering process prior to dispersal in a mixture of alcohol and acetonitrile. Ammonia was added to adjust the pH to a weakly alkaline value. The zirconium precursor was slowly injected into the mixture with magnetic stirring. The hydrolysis of zirconium was triggered in the weakly alkaline environment to induce the growth of small ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> using SNs as seeds. After 6 h of reaction, a ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> shell gradually formed on the surface of the SN seeds. The thickness of the shell can be controlled by adjusting the reaction time and the Zr:SN ratio. To remove the SN seed core, NaOH solution (1 mL, 1 M) was added, followed by reaction at 80Â°C for approximately 4 h. The ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> NPs thus obtained were collected through centrifugation and washed three times with deionized water.
