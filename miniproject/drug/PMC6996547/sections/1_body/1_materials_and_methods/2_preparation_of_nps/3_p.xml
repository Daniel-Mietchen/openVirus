<p>Preparation of poly-styrene (PS) was prepared as previously described.
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Briefly, 6 g of freshly distilled styrene (Merck), 250 mg of hexadecane, 5 mg of the fluorescent dye N-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-perylene-3,4-dicarbonacidimide, and 100 mg of the hydrophobic initiator 2.2′-azobis(2-methylbutyronitrile) were added to 24 g of water containing 125 mg of the surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium chloride. After stirring 1 h for pre-emulsification, the miniemulsion was prepared by sonification for 120 s at 90% amplitude at 0°C to prevent polymerization. Polymerization was carried out at 72°C overnight. After the synthesis, surfactant was removed by Amicon ultrafiltration (100 kDa), extensive dialysis and washing. Before being used, the particle suspensions were dispersed by sonification.
