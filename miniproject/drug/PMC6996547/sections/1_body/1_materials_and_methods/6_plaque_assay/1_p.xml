<p>Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. Right lung homogenates from individual mice were prepared and diluted 10-fold in DMEM and added to a monolayer of MDCK cells in semisolid agar containing 0.5 μg/mL trypsin-tolylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) (Sigma, Beijing, China). The cultures were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 60–72 h, fixed, and stained with 1% crystal violet. Plaque-forming units (PFUs) were then counted.
