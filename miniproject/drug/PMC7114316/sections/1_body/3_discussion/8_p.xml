<p id="p0185">The three compounds (NSC345647, NSC87511, and NSC343256) with the EC
 <sub>50</sub> values better than the broad spectrum antiviral drug, ribavirin, and the known viral protease inhibitor, lopinavir, were less effective when their activities were examined in the post-viral entry and prophylactic antiviral experiments (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In the case of post-viral entry, capability of the selected compounds to penetrate through the plasma membrane might be poor. Therefore, intracellular concentration of the compounds was less than the actual amount added in the culture media. For the prophylactic purpose, the compounds stability was very crucial. The antiviral activities of these compounds may be improved by utilizing a special drug delivery system that directs the compounds to macrophages and carries them inside the cells. Recently, nanoparticle-encapsulated drugs have been reported as a cargo for biopharmaceutical delivery to the target cells as well as preventing drug degradation (reviewed by 
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Visser et al., 2019</xref>). On the other hand, modification by adding functional groups such as carboxyl, methyl, acetyl, aldehyde or ketone to the compound can improve their binding affinities, solubility or stability. However, the modification should not decrease their drug-like characteristics. In this study, we have modified the compound NSC87511 by adding a acetyl group as shown in

 <sup>pro</sup> binding pocket and might enhance cell permeability.
