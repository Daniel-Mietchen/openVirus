 <sup>pro</sup> of FIPV carrying nonredundant residues at both N- and C-termini. This is the first report to describe the kinetic characteristics of tag-free FIPV 3CL

 </sub> and Km of 0.71 ± 0.04 s-1 and 8.56 ± 1.15 μM, respectively. By taking advantage of structure-based virtual screening, three candidate compounds, NSC345647, NSC87511, and NSC343256, were shown to possess antiviral activity. The compound NSC345647 was a fungal metabolite called Chaetochromin, isolated from

 <italic>, Penicillium, Chaetomium,</italic> etc. Chaetochromin A is a symmetrical dimer having two trans-2,3-dimethyl groups on the 5,6,8-trihydroxy-naphtho-γ-pyrone ring (
