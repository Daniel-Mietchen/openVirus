<p id="p0195">In conclusion, we utilized the application of computer-based assays for virtual screening to determine potential antiviral candidates for the treatment of FIP. We targeted the FIPV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, which is responsible for poly-protein processing in CoV during viral replication. We identified three best candidate compounds that possessed the characteristics of antiviral inhibitors. These natural compounds showed strong affinity toward the target and inhibited the FIPV infection, as determined by molecular docking and cell-based assays.
