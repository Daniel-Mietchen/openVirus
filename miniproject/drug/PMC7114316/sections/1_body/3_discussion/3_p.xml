The polyketides and their unique secondary metabolites containing aromatic rings are commonly found in stictic acid. The derivatives of stictic acid could reduce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cells via their anti-oxidative activity (

 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Papadopoulou et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, stictic acid could react with the Cys141 within the cysteine triad of tumor suppressor protein p53, to reduce its reactivation in human cancers (

 <sup>pro</sup> of CoV also contains cysteine as the nucleophilic active site in the catalytic dyad (Cys144 and His41) (
