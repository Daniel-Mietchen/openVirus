<p id="p0180">The selectivity index, defined as the ratio between CC
 <sub>50</sub> and EC
 <sub>50</sub>, was used to determine the drug selectivity. The cut-off value of SI for “hit” compounds set for this study was ≥4 (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Severson et al., 2007</xref>). Our study showed that the SI value of NSC345647 in the pre-viral entry assay was 8.88. However, for the post-viral entry and prophylactic antiviral activity assays, it showed SI values of 2.20 and 3.69, respectively. The binding affinity of this compound to the binding pocket of FIPV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> was determined as −8.3 kcal/mol using the program Autodock Vina. On the other hand, NSC87511 had SI values &gt; 4 for all the three antiviral assays. Therefore, NSC345647 and NSC87511 were promising candidate natural compounds for drug development. Some inactive compounds CID5318214, CID3821945, CID5748601, and CID5372747 also inhibited protease activity, but could not control FIPV infection under all the tested conditions. It is possible that their anti-protease activities might be influenced by unknown factors within the cell-culture conditions, resulting in lower activity.
