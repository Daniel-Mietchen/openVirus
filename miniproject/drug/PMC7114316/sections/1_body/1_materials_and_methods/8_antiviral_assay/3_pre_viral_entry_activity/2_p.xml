<p id="p0090">To determine the inhibitory activities of the compounds against FIPV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> before the entry of the virus into the host cells, the CRFK cells were incubated overnight as mentioned above. The FIPV strain 79–1146 at 100 units of 50% Tissue Culture Infective Dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) was inoculated simultaneously with different concentrations of each compound into separate wells. The final concentrations of each compound were 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 1, and 0.5 μM per well, based on the CC
 <sub>50</sub> values obtained from the cytotoxicity assay. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h.
