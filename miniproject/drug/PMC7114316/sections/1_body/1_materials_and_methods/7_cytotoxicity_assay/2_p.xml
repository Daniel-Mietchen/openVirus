<p id="p0080">The CRFK cells were seeded at 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL (100 μL/well) onto a 96-well plate and incubated overnight. On the following day, the cells were incubated with varying concentrations (200, 100, 10, 1 and 0.1 μM) of the test compounds for 48 h. Three independent experiments were performed to test the cytotoxicity. To determine the population of living cells, 20 μL of MTS solution (CellTiter 96 Aqueous Non-radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay Kits, Promega®, Madison, USA) was added into each culture well. The MTS tetrazolium compound was bio-reduced by the metabolically active cells into formazan as a product, which turned the media to yellow. The color intensity was proportional to the number of living cells. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the optical density of each sample was measured at 490 nm using a multi-mode reader (Synergy H1 Hybrid Multi-Mode Reader, BioTek®, USA). The absorbance values of the compound treated wells were divided by the average of the absorbance of the control wells. The ratio of inhibition was calculated as 50% cytotoxicity (cytotoxic concentration; CC
 <sub>50</sub>) using nonlinear regression analysis. The results were presented as means and standard deviation using the statistical software Prism version 5.0.1 (GraphPad, San Diego, USA).
