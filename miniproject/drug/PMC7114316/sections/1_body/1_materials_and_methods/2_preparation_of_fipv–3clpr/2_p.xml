<p id="p0050">The crystal structure of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (ID: 5EU8). This structure was processed to prepare it for the molecular docking studies. This preparation involved adding hydrogen atoms, eliminating water molecules, removing some ions, specifying the correct protonation and tautomerization states of the binding site residues, and calculating the partial charge using the program Chimera (UCSF, San Francisco, USA). The prepared structures were saved as pdb and mol2 files for subsequent molecular docking analysis. A total of 8,338 structural files of natural compounds were retrieved from PubChem, Drugbank, Zinc, and NCI databases to generate a library of initial compounds for the screening process. The structures of the compounds were saved in mol2 and sdf formats prior to the docking analysis.
