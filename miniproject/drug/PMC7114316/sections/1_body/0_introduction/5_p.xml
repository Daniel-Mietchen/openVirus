<p id="p0045">In this study, we utilized an 
 <italic>in silico</italic> approach to search for the candidate anti-FIPV lead compounds from the available database, particularly, natural compounds targeting the FIPV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. This approach could circumvent major investments on agents or drugs that do not present suitable properties and reduce the chances of failure of downstream 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assays as well as during the later stages of clinical tests. In addition, the compounds identified by this method may provide useful precursors and information for the further development of potential therapeutic agents against FIP and other emerging CoV-associated diseases.
