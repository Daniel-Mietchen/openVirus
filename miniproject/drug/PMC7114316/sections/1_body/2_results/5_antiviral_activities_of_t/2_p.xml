<p id="p0145">We evaluated the viral infection based on differential expression of the FIPV antigens within the cytoplasm of mock- and virus-infected CRFK cells. The antiviral activity before the entry of the virus into the host cell was determined to check if the compounds could inhibit the virus at this stage. The compounds NSC345647, NSC87511, and NSC343256 demonstrated more effective inhibitory activity than ribavirin. Furthermore, the compounds NSC345647 and NSC343256 showed better EC
 <sub>50</sub> values than the reference protease inhibitor (lopinavir). The same compounds were also observed to inhibit FIPV replication in CRFK cells during the post-viral entry step of FIPV infection when FIPV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> was also expressed by the viral gene. The results indicated that three compounds had the better EC
 <sub>50</sub> values. The prophylactic or protective activity was determined to check if the compounds could penetrate the host cells and still possess the inhibitory activity to prevent FIPV infection. The results revealed that the compounds NSC345647, NSC87511, and NSC343256 could completely protect the cells from virus infection at concentrations of 20–50 μM. However, the remaining compounds could not inhibit FIPV infection in any of these conditions, despite having good IC
 <sub>50</sub> values. The compound NSC87511 showed high SI values (&gt;4.00) in all the three conditions (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The qPCR results showed that the percentage of viral reduction by the selected compounds in all the three conditions mostly corroborated with the IPMA results (
