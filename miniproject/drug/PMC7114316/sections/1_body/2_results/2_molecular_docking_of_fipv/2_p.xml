<p id="p0125">Molecular docking analyses were initially carried out using the program Autodock Vina, and then re-docked using the GOLD and ICM-pro programs. The candidate compounds were ranked according to the affinity-binding scores, and then the consensus scores were used to narrow down their hits (
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The AUC value can discriminate between the sensitivity and specificity of a set of docked results from individual scoring functions. Our validation dataset consisted of 64 compounds, which was sufficient for the analysis. The results showed a significantly higher AUC (0.886) of three, rather than two, combinations of the scoring functions (

 <sup>pro</sup> binding pocket, which was suitable for further assays.
