<p id="p0150">The protease-inhibition and antiviral activity assays demonstrated that three compounds possessed anti-FIPV activities. Therefore, we further analyzed the interactions between the compounds and the active site of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, especially those between the key amino acid residues. All the compounds were firmly placed within the binding pocket of FIPV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, where the catalytic residues His41 and Cys144 were present. The binding pockets of FIPV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> exhibited non-covalent interactions with the small molecules (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> ), which is favorable in drug design. The non-covalent interactions between amino acid residues in the binding pocket of FIPV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> and each compound are detailed as follows: 1) compound NSC345647 (upper panel A, alkyl/π-alkyl: His41, Cys144, Pro188; π-donor: Glu165; lower panel A, hydrophobic interaction: Thr47, Phe139, Ala141, His163; hydrogen bond: Ile140, Gly142, Cys144, Glu165); 2) compound NSC87511 (B upper panel, alkyl/π-alkyl: His163, Leu164, Pro188; π-sigma: His41; lower panel B, hydrophobic interactions: Cys144, Asp186, Gln187; hydrogen bond: Thr47, Glu165); compound NSC343256 (upper panel C, Alkyl/π-alkyl:Cys144, Pro188; π-π stacking: His41; hydrogen bond:THR47; lower panel C, hydrophobic interactions: Asn25, Glu118, His163, Leu164, Asp186, Gln187; hydrogen bonds: Asn24, Val26, Thr47). In particular, all the compounds showed interactions with the thiol group of cysteine (Cys144) and the imidazole ring of histidine (His41) (

 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Lipinski, 2004</xref>) and ADME/T properties. The Ro5 criteria defined four ranges of simple physicochemical parameters, molecular weight ≤500, log P ≤ 5, H-bond donors ≤5, and H-bond acceptors ≤10, which are mostly associated with orally active drugs. The compounds NSC87511 and NSC343256 abided by the ‘drug-likeness’ criteria, except the compound NSC345647, which showed less potential for orally-active properties (
