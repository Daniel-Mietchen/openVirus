 <sup>pro</sup> that was expressed in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) was subsequently purified by the Ni-NTA column. Following proteolytic cleavage with FXa protease, the tag-free FIPV 3CLpro with high purity was shown on the SDS-PAGE (

 <sup>pro</sup> (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Hsu et al., 2005</xref>), the tag-free FIPV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> prepared in this study should reflect the actual activity. Moreover, owing to its high degree of homology to SARS 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, the enzyme kinetic analysis was performed by using the same fluorogenic substrate (Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans) as described previously (

 <sub>m</sub> value of FIPV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> was measured to be 8.56 ± 1.15 μM, and the
