<p id="p0135">Fifteen compounds selected by the molecular docking analysis were subsequently tested using the inhibition assay against FIPV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. During the primary screening, seven compounds showed more than 50% inhibition of the enzyme activity at a concentration of 100 μM (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). The seven hits NSC345647, NSC87511, NSC343256, CID5318214, CID3821945, CID5748601, and CID5372747 displayed IC

 <sup>pro</sup> were 3.6 ± 0.3 μM (NSC345647), 17.0 ± 1.8 μM (NSC87511), 11.7 ± 0.9 μM (NSC343256), 16.7 ± 1.7 μM (CID5318214), 5.8 ± 0.7 μM (CID3821945), 45.2 ± 3.6 μM (CID 5748601), and 48.8 ± 4.1 μM (CID5372747), indicating that these compounds were competitive inhibitors. However, the compounds CID452967, NSC14975, NSC38273, NSC142227, CID71313853, NSC36398, NSC270914, and NSC131547 did not show any significant inhibition, with IC
