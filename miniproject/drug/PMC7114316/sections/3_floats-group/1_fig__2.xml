  <p>Protein purification and kinetic parameters of FIPV 3CL
   <sup>pro</sup>. (A) SDS-PAGE analysis of the FIPV 3CL protease at different stages of the purification procedure. Lane 1 represents the molecular mass markers. Lanes 2 and 3 show the cell lysate without and with IPTG induction to overexpress FIPV 3CL protease with fusion tag, respectively. Lane 4 is the tagged protease after Ni-NTA column chromatography. Lane 5 represents the purified FIPV 3CL
   <sup>pro</sup> after cleavage of FXa to remove the fusion tag. Two extra bands of the intact FIPV 3CL
   <sup>pro</sup> and the fusion tag at lower molecular mass appear on SDS-PAGE. Lane 6 shows the purified untagged protease (arrowed) after passing the second Ni-NTA column. (B) Determining the kinetic parameters of FIPV 3CL protease. The initial reaction rates of the protease at different substrate concentrations were plots against substrate concentrations to obtain the
