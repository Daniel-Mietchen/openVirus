<p>CMV is the most frequent etiological factor for congenital infections and its infections are still global health problems of humans. Though CMV infections are often opportunistic, they sometimes cause serious diseases in healthy adults with weakened immunity and babies. Currently, no drugs are available for asymptomatic infants and for infants with CMV congenital infections to reduce related morbidity during the neonatal period. Some traditional antiviral drugs (e.g., ganciclovir, valganciclovir, cidofovir, foscarnet) are applied for the treatment of CMV acute infections, however, their efficacy is limited by side effects, cross-resistance and others. There is no effective cure for CMV infections, especially for latent infections. Promisingly, many novel antiviral drugs/agents and preventive/therapeutic strategies have been approved for clinical application (e.g., letermovir) or are being developed (e.g., maribavir, EGS-RNase, CRISPR/Cas9, TALENs, HCMV vaccine, ACT). We should investigate the interactions between CMV and hosts thoroughly to understand how antiviral agents or therapeutic strategies affect CMV infection outcomes. Moreover, the development and implications of novel antiviral agents and preventive/therapeutic strategies should be explored as extensively as possible. The future research tendency and application of these new insights should also be a highlight and could potentially become a promising milestone in the development of therapeutic strategies for CMV infections.</p>
