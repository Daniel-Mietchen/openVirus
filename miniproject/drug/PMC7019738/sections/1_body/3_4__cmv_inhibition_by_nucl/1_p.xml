<p>The treatment of diseases caused by CMV is quite challenging because of high mutation rates and latency. Thus, infection is still a serious threat to humans. Fortunately, external guide sequences (EGSs), transcription activator-like effectors nucleases (TALENs) and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs)/CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas9) nuclease system might provide effective therapeutic strategies to treat diseases caused by CMV through designing a specific DNA or RNA sequence that target essential genes for viral growth. However, the effective modification of the viral genome avoiding off-target effects and the option of escape variants ignoring the editing of these approaches are required for successful clinical application.</p>
