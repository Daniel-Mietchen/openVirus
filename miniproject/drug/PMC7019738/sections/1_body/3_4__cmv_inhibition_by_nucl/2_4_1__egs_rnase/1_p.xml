<p>Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a unique RNases in that it is a ribozyme – an RNA that acts as a catalyst which is somewhat like a protein enzyme. Its function is to cut an extra or precursor sequence of RNA on transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules; that is, to catalyze the cleavage of precursor tRNA into active tRNA without any protein component. RNase P has the activity in cleaving the 5’ leader sequence of precursor tRNA. EGSs signify the short RNAs that induce RNase P to specifically cleave a target mRNA by forming a precursor tRNA-like complex. Therefore, EGS technology probably acts as an effective strategy for gene-targeting therapy. </p>
