<p>Li et al. explored the antiviral effects of an engineered EGS variant in targeting the shared mRNA sequence which codes for capsid scaffolding proteins (mCSP) and assemblins of murine CMV (MCMV) in the animals [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00021" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In vitro, the EGS variant was more active in directing RNase P cleavage of the target mRNA than a natural tRNA by 60-fold. In MCMV-infected cells, the EGS variant decreased mCSP expression by about 92% and inhibited viral growth by about 8000-fold. In MCMV-infected mice, the EGS variants were more effective in reducing mCSP expression, decreasing viral production, and increasing animal survival, compared with the natural EGS. The results demonstrated that the EGS variant with higher targeting activity in vitro are also more effective in inhibiting MCMV gene expression in mice [
