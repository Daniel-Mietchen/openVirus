<p>Deng et al. reported that engineered EGS variants induced RNase P to efficiently hydrolyze target mRNAs which code for HCMV major capsid protein [

In vitro, the engineered EGS variant was more efficient in inducing human RNase P-mediated cleavage of the target mRNA than a natural tRNA-derived EGS by about 80-fold. In cells infected with HCMV, the EGS variant and natural EGSs resulted in HCMV gene expression reduction rate by about 98% and 73%, and the viral growth was inhibited by about 10,000 and 200-fold, respectively. The results showed that the EGS variant has higher efficiency in blocking the expression of HCMV genes and viral growth, compared with the natural EGS [
