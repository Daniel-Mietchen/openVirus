<p>Chen et al. utilized three pairs of TALEN plasmids (MCMV1–2, 3–4, and 5–6) to target the MCMV M80 and M80.5 overlapping (M80/80.5) sequence to test their efficacy in blocking MCMV lytic replication in NIH3T3 cells [

Using lipofectamine or a specific lipoid NKS11 as transfection reagents, TALEN plasmids could specifically target the M80/80.5 sequence and effectively inhibit MCMV growth in cell culture when the plasmid transfection is prior to the MCMV infection. Using NKS11 which was previously proved to be nontoxic to mice as a transfection reagent, the most specific pairs of TALEN plasmids (MCMV3–4) showed that its competency to inhibit the replication and gene expression of latent MCMV in immunocompetent Balb/c mice. The administration of MCMV3–4 plasmids resulted in significant reduction in the copy number level of immediately early gene-1 DNA which is key to viral latency in mice, compared with the controls. Additionally, the innate immune DNA-sensing pathways of host might be involved in the induction of cytokine secretion such as type I interferon (IFN) (mainly IFN α and β) to fight against invading viruses. The result hinted that TALENs were able to provide an effective strategy to clear latent MCMV in animals [
