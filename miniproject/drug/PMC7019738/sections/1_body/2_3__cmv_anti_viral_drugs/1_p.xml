<p>At present, some antiviral drugs have been approved for the treatment of CMV infections clinically. Current available drugs for antiviral therapy of CMV infections include the inhibitors of viral DNA polymerase, such as the nucleoside analog ganciclovir, the nucleotide analog cidofovir, and the pyrophosphate analogue foscarnet [

All these drugs have low oral bioavailability and dose-related toxicities, and therefore new antiviral agents with improved efficacy and fewer side effects need to be developed. Several drugs with anti-HCMV activity are preclinically or clinically evaluated, including a series of benzimidazole riboside compounds showing efficient inhibition in the process of HCMV replication such as genomic DNA maturation. Another attractive inhibitor candidate was the phosphorothioate oligonucleotide fomivirsen, which specifically binds to sequences complementary to CMV major immediate-early transcription sites so that it inhibits the viral gene expression. However, these inhibitor compounds are currently waiting for further examination before they can be used in clinics [
