<p>Choi et al. used the guinea pig which is a small-animal model to develop a CMV vaccine. A glycoprotein pentamer complex encoded by guinea pig cytomegalovirus (GPCMV) is essential for viral entry into non-fibroblast cells to enable congenital CMV [

Like HCMV, GPCMV needs a guinea pig specific cell receptor (platelet-derived growth factor receptor Î±) for fibroblast entry, but other receptors are required for non-fibroblast cells. A disabled infectious GPCMV vaccine strain induced humoral immune responses against viral pentamers to promote neutralization on non-fibroblast cells; thus, the vaccinated guinea pigs were protected from congenital CMV infections. The design including the pentamer complex as a part of vaccines may significantly enhance efficacy. This new finding lays stress on the importance of the immune response to the pentamer complex in contributing to the protection against congenital CMV and has opened a new era for the development of CMV vaccines [
