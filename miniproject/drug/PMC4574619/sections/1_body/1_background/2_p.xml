<p>The overall prevalence of PIDs globally remains highly uncertain due to the large number of PID conditions, differences in case definitions, and variability between countries in both genetic profiles (e.g., consanguinity) and survival rates of PID patients [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Estimates of the prevalence of CVIDs reported to PID registries generally range from 1:10,000 to 1:100,000 people with a best estimate around 1:50,000 people for high-income countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. One US telephone survey of self-reported PIDs without clinical verification reported 8 CVID and 15 oPID patients from approximately 10,000 surveyed households representing approximately 27,000 people. These numbers translate into prevalence rates of CVIDs and oPIDs of approximately 1:3,300 and 1:1,800 people, respectively [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], p. 501.” Notably, other authors extrapolated these results globally without any adjustments for study bias or differential survival of PID patients in different countries and estimated an unrealistic global prevalence as up to 6 million PID patients worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. This estimate contrasts sharply with the approximately 77,000 PID patients reported in a survey among physicians in 225 Jeffrey Modell Foundation Centers in 78 countries, which included approximately 8600 CVID patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. With respect to oPIDs, one Minnesota county with a comprehensive medical record system estimated an overall PID incidence for 2001–6 of 10.3 per 100,000 person-years, with an age-specific incidence of approximately 22 per 100,000 person-years aged 0–5 years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. These rates do not directly translate into rates per newborn due to imperfect diagnosis and time delays associated with development of symptoms and diagnosis. A study of VAPP in the US assumed an incidence of approximately 1 PID patient per 10,000 births in the US [
