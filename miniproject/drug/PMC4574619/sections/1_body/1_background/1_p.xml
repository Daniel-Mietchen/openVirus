<p>Immunocompetent individuals infected with poliovirus typically excrete for several weeks (mean around 30 days) and no longer than 3 months [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, a small fraction of individuals with B-cell-related PIDs can excrete for longer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The GPEI maintains a registry of known long-term excretors that included 73 immunodeficient patients with evidence of more than 6 months of poliovirus excretion identified prior to 2014 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], which largely overlaps with the 68 long-term poliovirus excretors listed in a recent review [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Of the 73 known long-term excretors, 13 (17 %) presented with common variable immunodeficiency disease (CVID), while the remainder presented with other PIDs (oPIDs), including not further specified PIDs (16), severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID)(14), hypogammaglobulinemia (11), X-linked agammaglobulinemia (8), agammaglobulinemia (6), major histocompatibility complex class II molecule deficiency (2), humoral and cellular immunodeficiency (1), HLA-DR-associated immunodeficiency (1), and immunodeficiency-centromeric instability-facial abnormalities (1). Six of the 13 (36 %) long-term excretors with CVID fit the criteria for chronic excretion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and one additional CVID patient died approximately 5 years after the probable onset of infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], while none of the long-term excretors with oPIDs excreted longer than 5 years.
