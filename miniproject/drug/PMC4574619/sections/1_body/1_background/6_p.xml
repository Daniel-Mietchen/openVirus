<p>PID patients with poliovirus infections remain vulnerable to VAPP, and the GPEI identified most long-term excretors when they presented with VAPP (i.e., 57 of 73, 78 %) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A retrospective analysis of all 37 immunodeficient VAPP cases reported in the United States between 1975 and 1997 found 6 months of excretion or more for 6 of 31 (19 %) patients with follow-up samples available, including 1 chronic excretor with CVID [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Some patients developed fatal VAPP after a long period of excretion, while others survived and continued to excrete iVDPVs long after VAPP onset, and both asymptomatic long-term excretors and those with VAPP may spontaneously clear the infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. For most known long-term excretors, we could not determine their IVIG therapy status at the time of OPV infection, but the majority of those with available data appeared to have acquired the OPV infection before the start of IVIG therapy. However, at least 2 excretors started IVIG therapy before the estimated onset of the long-term OPV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Thus, IVIG therapy may reduce the probability of acquiring an OPV infection or of an OPV infection establishing persistent replication, but it does not completely prevent long-term infection.
