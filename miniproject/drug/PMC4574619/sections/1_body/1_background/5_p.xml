<p>Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> summarizes the results of several screening studies that provided additional evidence about the frequency of long-term poliovirus excretion. All studies combined that screened PID patients for long-term excretion detected only 1 prolonged excretor (a CVID patient in Sri Lanka) out of 318 CVID patients (0.3 %) and 978 total PID patients (0.1 %) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Another child in Sri Lanka with SCID died while infected and appeared as a long-term excretor in some publications assuming infection following the first OPV dose received [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] but not in other publications based on the duration of documented excretion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], which reflects uncertainty about the date of the OPV exposure that initiated the infection. Given the low numbers of observations overall, inclusion of this excretor would double the apparent rate of long-term poliovirus excretors per PID patient (e.g., from 1 in 978 to 2 in 978). A 7-country screening study identified 17 total poliovirus excretors and followed these individuals longitudinally until they stopped excreting or died. In this study, 6 excretors died within 6 months while still excreting poliovirus. Of the remaining 11 excretors, 10 stopped excreting spontaneously within 6 months, while 1 spontaneously stopped excreting after 8 months [
