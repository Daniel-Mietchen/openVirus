<p>Further events for all surviving PID patients include onset of PID symptoms and diagnosis and events related to OPV infection, including the 1) monthly probability of primary and secondary OPV infection that depends on poliovirus vaccine use (i.e., OPV-only, IPV/OPV, or 0 if no OPV use), age, income level, diagnosis status, treatment status, and serotype, 2) monthly progression of OPV infection that depends on the potential for long-term poliovirus excretion determined at birth, and 3) monthly probability of developing VAPP while infected, with an income-level dependent probability of fatal VAPP. When a primary OPV infection occurs during simulation (i.e., a clinical PID patient receives OPV), we independently sample the serotype(s) based on the serotype probabilities in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, which implies some possibility of 2 or 3 concurrent serotypes. For secondary OPV infections, we assume only one serotype based on the probabilities in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. We assume probabilities of the serotype(s) excreted based on limited evidence from the iVDPVs isolated to date (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. After OPV2 cessation, removal of the serotype 2 component implies no new creation of iVDPV2s (i.e., unless introduced for outbreak response or through an unintentional or intentional event). We assume no change in the overall rate of OPV infections after OPV2 cessation, with new infections involving serotypes 1 and/or 3 according to the same relative likelihood of serotypes 1 and 3 as before OPV2 cessation (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Similar to the very low estimated VAPP rate (i.e., approximately 1 per million) for first poliovirus infections in immunologically competent individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], VAPP also represents a rare event for PID patients, with 4 CVID and 33 oPID patients reported with VAPP in the US during the 23-year period 1975–1997 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Assuming approximately 400 annual PID births [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] in the US and that 20 % of PID patients represent CVIDs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), this translates into VAPP rates of 2200 and 4500 per million first infections in CVID and oPID patients, respectively. To translate these into monthly probabilities of VAPP given OPV infection, we assume that the GPEI identified all paralytic long-term poliovirus excretors that occurred during the last 5 years (i.e., 26 paralytic long-term excretors during 2009–2013) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We then multiply the estimated rates above to obtain the same cumulative number of paralytic poliovirus excretors during 2009–2013 in the model as reported, which makes the rates depend on all other model assumptions. This approach results in monthly VAPP probabilities of 0.004 and 0.008 for CVID and oPID patients, respectively. Thus, while VAPP clearly represents a very high risk for long-term excretors, VAPP onset may not occur until many years of the OPV infection if at all [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] and one known chronic excretor continues to excrete after approximately 30 years without development of VAPP to date [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].
