<p>With respect to the use of PAVDs, we assume that at least 40 % of long-terms excretors may clear the virus within 5 days if they receive a PAVD regimen, based on the results of a small clinical trial of pocapavir in immunocompetent subjects (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Assuming that immunodeficient patients would respond as well as immunocompetent subjects, 40 % represents a lower bound given that some subjects apparently resistant to the drug potentially acquired resistant virus from other subjects in the trial after clearing their initial infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To provide bounds on the potential impact of PAVDs, we considered an upper bound of 90 % drug effectiveness, reflecting either higher effectiveness of pocapavir or the potential effectiveness of combining multiple compounds. We further considered three scenarios of PAVD use: 1) the 
 <italic>status quo</italic>, which assumes no availability of the PAVD and provides a baseline for comparison, 2) passive PAVD use, which assumes that 50 % of iVDPV excretors identified by previously experiencing and surviving VAPP receive PAVDs for one month in January, 2020, and 3) active PAVD use, which represents a hypothetical upper bound and assumes 90 % of all iVDPV excretors receive PAVDs for one month in January, 2020. Both PAVD scenarios further administer PAVDs according to the same fractions to any long-term excretors that develop paralysis after January, 2020. If an excretor receives PAVDs, we randomly determine whether the infection clears based on the effectiveness assumption (i.e., 40 % or 90 %) and assume this occurs within a month of the start of PAVD treatment.
