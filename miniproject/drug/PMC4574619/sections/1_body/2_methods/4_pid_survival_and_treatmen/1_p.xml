<p>The remainder of Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> lists events and associated probabilities that may occur at monthly intervals over the lifetime of the PID patient, including death prior to clinical PID onset based on age-specific general population death rates in each income level [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. After clinical PID onset, we assume different monthly probabilities of death depending on the PID category (i.e., CVID or oPID), treatment status, and R
 <sub>0</sub> for WPV1 in the population in which the PID lives. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> shows the assumed baseline survival curves for effectively treated and not effectively treated PID patients, and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> shows the assumed treatment fraction as a function of time in each income level. We constructed the baseline survival curve for treated CVID patient from a longitudinal study of CVID patients in Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], which we assume applies for CVID patients living in populations with an R
 <sub>0</sub> of 4 or 5. From the survival curve, we compute the monthly probability of death D(t1) between t1 and t2 months after CVID onset as D(t1) = 1-S(t2)/S(t1)
 <sup>1/(t2-t1)</sup>, where S(t1) and S(t2) represent the proportion surviving t1 and t2 months after CVID onset, respectively. For oPIDs, we constructed a baseline survival curve based on judgment and limited evidence that suggests very short survival for some oPIDs (e.g., SCID), but a relatively long tail due to some oPID defects with longer survival [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Based on data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] that suggest much shorter survival prior to widespread IVIG treatment in high-income countries, we assume 5-fold higher monthly probabilities of death for CVID patients and an equal relative monthly risk of death for untreated compared to treated oPID patients (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). We assume that even for treated PID patients, relative death rates increase with increasing R
 <sub>0</sub>, because higher poliovirus R
 <sub>0</sub> values correlate with poorer hygiene and sanitation conditions. Thus, for treated CVID patients, we assume monthly death probabilities of up to 50 times (i.e., for the highest R
 <sub>0</sub> value of 13) the monthly death probabilities calculated from the baseline survival curves (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). We further factor in the possibility of IVIG-treatment lapses using the monthly income level-dependent lapse probabilities in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, assuming these represent independent events and include both failure to receive IVIG during a month or reduced quality of the polio or other antibodies. If an IVIG-treatment lapse occurs, then we assume the PID patient becomes subject to the untreated monthly death probability for the time of the lapse. Given that effective treatment depends on delivery through a completely functional health system, we assume lower treatment fractions in lower income levels, with some projected increase over time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). During simulation, if the proportion of PID patients receiving treatment (with or without lapse) equals less than the assumed treatment fraction for a given month, then we randomly add PID patients to the pool of treated patients until the proportion treated is no longer smaller than the assumed treatment fraction.
