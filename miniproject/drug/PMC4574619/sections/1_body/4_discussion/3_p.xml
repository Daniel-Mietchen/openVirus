 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> highlights high-impact and reasonably feasible research opportunities to reduce uncertainties in future iVDPV risk estimates that we identified through the model development process. The opportunities include research to reduce uncertainty about key drivers of the prevalence of iVDPVs after OPV cessation, such as retrospective analysis of global PID registries to better characterize PID survival in low- and middle-income countries, expanded (and if feasible) longitudinal poliovirus screening of PID patients to better estimate the probability of long-term excretion for PID patients, and clinical trials with PAVDs involving long-term excretors to determine the PAVD effectiveness in clearing poliovirus infection. Other research opportunities may address specific questions identified through the model development process or provide better estimates of the bounds of current true global long-term poliovirus excretor prevalence. With the long lead time for research, development, and implementation of risk management strategies and the long observation period required for longitudinal screening, the research opportunities we identified represent urgent, although in some cases potentially costly priorities. However, the potential consequences of an iVDPV-associated outbreak in a developing country after OPV cessation in the absence of a tested outbreak response strategy beyond the first few years after OPV cessation will likely justify further investments to improve iVDPV risk management. Some lower-cost research opportunities, such as more systematic reporting of timelines of events associated with long-term excretors and continued follow-up [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] beyond recovery from infection, may help resolve a number of specific questions identified through our modeling process. In addition to the questions in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, we identified many other specific theoretical questions and practical issues not addressable by feasible, short-term research. For example, a better understanding of the immunological mechanisms of long-term poliovirus excretion and recovery would help inform model inputs and address the question of reinfection. Assessing the impact of iVDPV prevalence on risks after OPV cessation requires integration of the results from the iVDPV prevalence model with a global poliovirus transmission model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In this context, the transmissibility of iVDPVs compared to cVDPVs or WPVs represents an important uncertainty that will significantly affect the risk of any transmission from long-term excretors over time. While we cannot directly estimate R
 <sub>0</sub> values for poliovirus, environmental sampling and expanded stool surveys around known excretors may provide data to inform assumptions going forward.
