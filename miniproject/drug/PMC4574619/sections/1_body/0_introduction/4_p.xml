<p>Since 2006, the GPEI intensified the search for asymptomatic long-term iVDPV excretors through screening studies and for paralytic long-term iVDPV excretors through the acute flaccid paralysis surveillance system. Consistent with this intensification, the average annual number of identified long-term excretors increased by a factor of 2.5 from 2000–2005 to 2006–2013 [

Improvements in the quality of health care delivery in middle - income countries may also imply increased survival of PID patients and affect the prevalence of long-term excretors. The increased number of individuals with PIDs screened for long-term iVDPV excretion led to some identified long-term excretors, and the updated data provide better information to characterize the bounds of the proportion of PID patients with long-term iVDPV excretion [
