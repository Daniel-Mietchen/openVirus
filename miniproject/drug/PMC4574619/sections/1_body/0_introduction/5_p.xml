<p>The accumulation of new evidence about PID prevalence, survival, and long-term excretion of polioviruses and the parallel development of PAVDs motivate a re-analysis of the iVDPV risks going forward and consideration of the potential impact of PAVDs. In addition, the serotype-specific OPV vaccination and cessation strategies that did not exist at the time of our prior analysis motivate the consideration of serotype-specific differences in iVDPV risks [

We developed a stochastic, discrete-event simulation (DES) model to estimate the prevalence of long-term iVDPV excretors up until and after OPV cessation based on current evidence. The model incorporates the available new evidence about iVDPVs and explores the potential impact of PAVDs on iVDPV prevalence for use in integrated global modeling of long-term poliovirus risk management policies [
