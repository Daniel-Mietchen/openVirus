<p>While any cVDPVs would likely emerge at a time of relatively high population immunity to transmission given the recent use of OPV in most countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], after OPV cessation, countries will only use the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) for polio immunization. While IPV appears to provide sufficient population immunity to prevent transmission in populations with high hygiene levels and low fecal-oral transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], recent asymptomatic circulation of serotype 1 WPV (WPV1) in parts of Israel despite very high IPV routine immunization coverage strongly suggests that IPV-induced immunity alone cannot prevent or stop transmission in some settings [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Modeling further suggests that population immunity to poliovirus transmission will drop significantly and fairly quickly after OPV cessation in most developing countries, regardless of IPV use due to both new birth cohorts that only receive IPV and waning immunity in those previously immunized or exposed to LPVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Strategies to respond to and control any iVDPV-associated outbreaks in developing countries long after OPV cessation require careful consideration, because using OPV could re-introduce large amounts of LPV at a time of low population immunity, and IPV may not provide sufficient population immunity to stop its transmission. Recognizing this risk, in 2006 an Institute of Medicine committee recommended the development of one or more polio antiviral drugs (PAVDs) [
