<p>Given the importance of chronic excretors for long-term poliovirus risk management, we further compared the model results with the limited evidence about chronic excretors. The model estimates global CVID prevalence in 2015 of approximately 14,000 patients, compared to approximately 8,000 CVID patients known to a large network of PID treatment centers in 78 countries [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. This suggests a large number of unidentified CVID patients globally. However, significant uncertainty about the true global prevalence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] complicates verification of this model result. The data from chronic excretors identified since 1970 sum to approximately 53 person-years of chronic infection (i.e., not including the first 5 years of infection during the prolonged excretion time) and suspected chronic excretors detected through environmental surveillance of another 95 person-years (assuming a rate of 1.1 % VP1 divergence per year), for a total of almost 150 person-years of detected chronic infection. The 1,000 stochastic iterations of the DES model yield an average of approximately 200 person-years of chronic infection. The difference reflects the expected large proportion of asymptomatic chronic excretors (Fig.
