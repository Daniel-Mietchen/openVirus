<p>As suggested in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, countries in the upper middle-income group, which includes about 2.5 billion people in 2013 (nearly 50 % of them in China), account for an estimated 16 total long-term excretors (52 % of the global estimate). Thus, while the high-income countries include more long-term excretors per capita during OPV use, they represent only approximately 1.2 billion people and the majority of these countries stopped all OPV use years ago, which already led to a decline in their long-term excretor prevalence.
