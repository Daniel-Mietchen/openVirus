Using these methods, they verified the respiratory tract as a principal infection site and established preliminary time courses of virus amplification and clearance in patients. Subsequent detailed clinical investigations demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is detected within 1–2 days after patient symptoms, peaking 4–6 days later and clearing within 18 days [

These are the findings that help to define transmissibility periods and inform public health authorities on appropriate quarantine measures.
