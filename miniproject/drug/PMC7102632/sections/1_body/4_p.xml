<p id="p0025">The findings by Zhou and colleagues highlight interactions of the entering SARS-CoV-2 virus with host factors; specifically those interactions with the ‘corona’ of spike (S) proteins projecting from virus membranes. The most threatening bat-derived CoVs are those with distinctively human-tropic S proteins (

S-specific neutralizing antibodies and antiviral agents interfere with these susceptibility factors and protect from infection.
