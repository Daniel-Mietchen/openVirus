<p id="p0020">Using the isolated SARS-CoV-2 virus, the authors subsequently identified a critical host susceptibility factor [
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. When cultured cells overexpressed the transmembrane protein angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein from humans, bats, pigs, or civet cats, they became hypersensitized to infection, showing that ACE2 is a SARS-CoV-2 receptor [
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These findings harken back to the earlier SARS-CoV, which also utilizes both human and animal ACE2 proteins as receptors and exhibits a zoonotic distribution that matches its binding to the ACE2 receptor orthologs [
 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. They also reflect the behavior of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, which, although relying on a distinct dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) protein receptor, similarly disseminates among animal species in correlation with its binding to DPP4 orthologs.
