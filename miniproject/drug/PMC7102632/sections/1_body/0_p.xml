<p id="p0005">Within a short time after recognizing a novel infectious respiratory syndrome in Wuhan, China, dedicated virologists at the center of the outbreak completed groundbreaking work to identify the agent of disease. Their investigations, reported in Zhou 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], began with next-generation sequencing of nucleic acids in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of diseased patients. From the sequence data, a novel coronavirus was identified and provisionally named 2019-nCoV. The 2019-nCoV RNA virus genome is closely related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV that emerged in human populations in 2003–2004 to cause epidemic disease and to several SARS-related CoVs in bats that are known to have the potential for human infection [

It is alarming that SARS-CoV-2 has expanded far beyond that of the previous 2003 SARS-CoV, spreading to over 40 countries and infecting over 80 000 individuals as of 25 February 2020. The infection is associated with a SARS-like disease [
