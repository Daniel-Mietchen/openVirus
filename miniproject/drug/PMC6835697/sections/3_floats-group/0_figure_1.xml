  <p>The amino acid sequence of griffithsin (GRFT). Corresponding secondary β-sheet structures are marked with yellow arrows based on the crystal structure of a GRFT dimer with mannose at a resolution of 1.78 Å [
   <xref rid="B19-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Tyrosine and aspartate residues in three carbohydrate-binding domains, which are essential for mannose-binding, are noted with blue and orange arrows, respectively. Wild-type GRFT has a non-standard amino acid at position 31, but it is replaced by alanine (colored in red) in recombinant GRFT. The sequence display was generated by the RCSB protein data bank website (
