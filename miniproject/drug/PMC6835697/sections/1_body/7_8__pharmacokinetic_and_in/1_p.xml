<p>Three studies were conducted to examine the in vivo antiviral efficacy and pharmacokinetic behavior of GRFT using various small animal models (
 <xref rid="marinedrugs-17-00567-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B41-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Subcutaneous injections of GRFT into guinea pigs and mice were very well tolerated, resulting in the accumulation of GRFT up to relevant therapeutic concentrations [
 <xref rid="B41-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The serum from GRFT-treated animals was found to retain antiviral activity against HIV-1-enveloped pseudoviruses in a cell-based neutralization assay [
 <xref rid="B41-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In addition, active GRFT, which is capable of neutralizing HIV-Env pseudoviruses, was also detected in rat fecal extracts after chronic oral dosing [
 <xref rid="B46-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The in vivo efficacy of GRFT was also demonstrated in the humanized bone marrow-liver-thymus mice which were protected from vaginal infection with HIV-1 after being treated with recombinant 
 <italic>C. crescentus</italic> expressing GRFT [
 <xref rid="B47-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, GRFT was not orally bioavailable even after chronic treatment [
