<p>GRFT is a red algae-derived lectin of 121 amino acids (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-17-00567-f001">Figure 1</xref>). It exhibits potent (EC
 <sub>50</sub> in the picomolar range) and broad-spectrum antiviral activity and negligible in vitro and in vivo host toxicity [
 <xref rid="B9-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Its antiviral activity relates to a unique structural feature that forms a homodimeric complex with three carbohydrate-binding domains on each monomer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-17-00567-f002">Figure 2</xref>). These three carbohydrate-binding domains target high-mannose arrays present on many pathogenic enveloped viruses including HIV; severe, acute, or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV) [

 <xref rid="B18-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As a result of its broad antiviral spectrum, it shows great promise as a general microbicidal agent that can prevent viral transmission and as a therapeutic against enveloped virus-mediated diseases. From discovery to clinical development, much interest has surrounded GRFT because of its potential to be the first clinically proven, preventive measure against various viral diseases. In this review, the structural characteristics of GRFT are examined. Also, its in vitro antiviral activity against HIV, which is the most studied target pathogen for GRFT so far, is discussed in detail using a variety of combination study results involving current antiretroviral drugs. The antiviral mechanism of action for GRFT is explained in conjunction with viral resistance profiles to GRFT. In addition, its in vitro and in vivo toxicity profiles are summarized, and its pharmacokinetic and in vivo efficacy study results are delineated. To provide a practical drug development perspective, a large-scale production and formulation strategy as well as a drug delivery strategy for GRFT as an HIV-preventive biologic is discussed. Finally, ongoing clinical studies of GRFT and its effects on viruses other than HIV are summarized.
