<p>Five studies have characterized viral resistance profiles caused by chronic GRFT treatment (

 <xref rid="B26-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,

 <xref rid="B40-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Since the antiviral activity of GRFT mainly depends on disrupting the biological functions of multiple mannose molecules on viral glycoproteins, a reduction in the glycosylation levels of a target protein can lead to GRFT resistance. For example, the 234 and 295 glycosylation sites are involved in GRFT-induced HIV-1 neutralization since a concomitant lack of glycans at both positions resulted in natural GRFT resistance [
 <xref rid="B25-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Conversely, introducing glycosylation sites at N234 and N295 in HIV-1 clade C virus increased GRFT antiviral potency [
 <xref rid="B25-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In line with these observations, deglycosylation at position 295 or 448 decreased the sensitivity of a single transmitter/founder HIV Env to GRFT [
 <xref rid="B31-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Since N295 and N448 are GRFT-specific, high-mannose, N-linked glycosylation sites on gp120, a single deglycosylation at N295 or N448 in primary or T-cell-line-adapted HIV-1 isolates also resulted in marked resistance to GRFT [
 <xref rid="B40-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Furthermore, glycosylation sites at positions 230, 234, 241, and 289 located in the C2 region and 339, 392, and 448 in the C3–C4 region were also implicated in GRFT resistance [
 <xref rid="B39-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A loss of glycosylation sites on gp120 as well as a rearrangement of glycans in V4 also led to HIV-1 subtype C resistance against GRFT [
 <xref rid="B39-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In the case of DC-SIGN-dependent antiviral activity of GRFT, the effects of extra glycosylation seem to be dependent on the location of the glycosylation. For example, the introduction of the 234 glycosylation site abolished HIV-1 sensitivity to lectin’s ability to inhibit binding to DC-SIGN and virus transfer [
 <xref rid="B38-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, the addition of the 295 glycosylation site enhanced the inhibition of DC-SIGN-dependent HIV-1 transfer by GRFT [
 <xref rid="B38-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Given the overlapping nature of the binding specificity displayed by GRFT and neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1, GRFT resistance could also affect HIV-1 sensitivity to antibody-dependent neutralization.
