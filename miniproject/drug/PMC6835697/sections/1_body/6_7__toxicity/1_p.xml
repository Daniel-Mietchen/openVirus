<p>The ubiquitous nature of glycosylated proteins in the body raises concerns that GRFT may cause toxicity by interacting with glycosylated host proteins. For this reason, the effects of GRFT on host cells and animals have been studied extensively. According to five previous reports, GRFT does not exhibit any toxicity at its active antiviral concentrations (

 <xref rid="B28-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,

 <xref rid="B45-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. GRFT induced only minimal changes in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by epithelial cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [
 <xref rid="B43-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In addition, it had no measurable effect on cell viability or the levels of T-cell activation markers [
 <xref rid="B43-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. GRFT treatment induced only minimal alterations in the gene expression profile of human ectocervical cells [
 <xref rid="B43-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It also caused no significant cell death, mitogenicity, activation, or cytokine release in mouse PBMCs [
 <xref rid="B44-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. No obvious changes were observed in animal fitness, blood chemistry, or complete blood count parameters in GRFT-treated mice [
 <xref rid="B44-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Interestingly, the PBMC-bound form of GRFT was still able to maintain its antiviral activity, raising the potential of its versatile in vivo antiviral activity [
 <xref rid="B43-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Chronic intravaginal or systemic administration of 2 mg/kg of GRFT was also non-toxic in mice [
 <xref rid="B44-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. GRFT, when administered in gel form, was not associated with any changes in the rectal proteome [
 <xref rid="B42-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. An increased abundance of two common and beneficial microbial taxa after GRFT treatment was due to placebo formulations and not to GRFT, itself [
 <xref rid="B42-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This association between the placebo gel and changes in the rectal proteome and microbiota indicates the need to alter the components of the placebo gel in future studies [
 <xref rid="B42-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. GRFT was also well tolerated after subcutaneous administration in guinea pig and mouse models [
 <xref rid="B41-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In addition, GRFT was found to be non-irritating and non-inflammatory in human cervical explants and in an in vivo rabbit vaginal irritation model [
 <xref rid="B45-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In this study, no mitogenic activity was reported in cultured human lymphocytes treated with GRFT [
 <xref rid="B45-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, following GRFT treatment, reversible splenomegaly was observed with the activation of certain spleen B and T cells [
 <xref rid="B44-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This GRFT-associated increase in spleen and liver mass was also noted in another study [
 <xref rid="B41-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Therefore, an immune response elicited by GRFT treatment should be controlled in order to avoid potential GRFT immune-related toxicity [
