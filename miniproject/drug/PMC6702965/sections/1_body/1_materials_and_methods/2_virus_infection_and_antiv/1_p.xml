<p>Cell monolayers were grown on multiwell plates and incubated for 1 h with different AVs (purchased from Sigma). Stock solutions of LG, VPA, and CRL were prepared in DMEM (VPA) or 2% ethanol (a concentration previously shown to preserve more than 80% cell viability) and diluted in DMEM to prepare the working stocks. After 1 h of incubation with AVs, duplicate cultures were infected with the corresponding virus in a reduced volume of medium containing the AV, for 1â€“2 h; the virus inoculum removed and cells washed twice with medium, before the addition of drug-containing fresh medium (supplemented with 2% FCS). Cultures were then incubated until massive cytopathic effect was observed. Total virus (intracellular and extracellular) production was evaluated by plaque assay on the corresponding virus-sensitive cells. From the dose-effect relationship of each AV on each virus yield, 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) were determined.
