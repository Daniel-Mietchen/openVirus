<p>Vero and COS (both from African green monkey kidney), BHK21 (baby hamster kidney), and IBRS-2 (pig kidney) cells were grown at 37Â°C in DMEM medium supplemented with 5 or 10% fetal calf serum. ASFV isolates, either from a field strain (E70) or a Vero cell-adapted strain (Ba71V), were grown in swine alveolar macrophages (E70) or in Vero cells and titrated on COS cell monolayers, as described (
