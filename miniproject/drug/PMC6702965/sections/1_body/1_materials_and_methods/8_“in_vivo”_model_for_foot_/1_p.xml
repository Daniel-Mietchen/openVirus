<p>LG was initially dissolved in DMSO and then diluted in Tween80: ethanol: saline (1:1:8). Groups of 6â€“12 8-week-old C57 (B16J) female mice were inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) as described (
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Baranowski et al., 2003</xref>) with different concentrations of LG and administration schedules. Mice were challenged i.p. with 10
 <sup>3</sup> or 10
 <sup>4</sup> pfu/mouse of type C FMDV C-S8 and monitored daily for signs of infection up to 4 days p.i. Control mice were inoculated with the same volume of PBS alone plus vehicle. Mice exhibiting clear signs of disease, as well as all surviving mice at the end of the experiment, were anesthetized and euthanized.
