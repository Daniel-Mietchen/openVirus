VPA has been shown to alter a variety of signaling pathways, including an increase in GABA neurotransmission, inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs), inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase beta (GSK3β), or attenuation of phospholipid signaling (

VPA treatment of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-infected cells reduced viral production without significantly affecting viral RNA and protein synthesis but interfering with both cell release and specific infectivity of virion particles, while VPA blocked virus entry and multiplication during West Nile virus (WNV) (
