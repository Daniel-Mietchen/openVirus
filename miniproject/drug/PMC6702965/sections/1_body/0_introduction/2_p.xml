<p>LG is an ester derivative of gallic acid, a natural plant phenolic compound. It has been widely used as antioxidant (E312) in food manufacturing, as well as in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. LG protects cells from oxidative stress, in a process associated with radical scavenging, inhibition of enzymes involved in lipid peroxidation, and increasing expression of antioxidant genes (

We have previously demonstrated that viral production was strongly inhibited at non-toxic concentrations of LG, in different cell lines infected with African swine fever virus (ASFV), herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), vaccinia virus (VV), influenza virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus and Sindbis virus (
