<p>Despite the considerable effort invested in new vaccine designs, viruses still produce many porcine diseases with economic importance, such as those caused by ASFV, foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), VSV, or swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), and many aspects regarding their spread and persistence remain elusive. ASFV causes an important animal disease for which no effective vaccine or therapeutic treatment is available (

Conventional vaccines have allowed FMD control and eventual eradication of the disease when properly produced and administered, but pose shortcomings such as the need of high-containment facilities for production, short-lived immunity, and short shelf-life after formulation (
