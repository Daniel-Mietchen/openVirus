<p>Combined administration of different inhibitors is one of the strategies being currently explored to improve antiviral treatments (
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">De Vleeschauwer et al., 2017</xref>). We studied the effect on ASFV infection of LG, VPA, and CRL, either alone or, searching for possible synergistic effects, in their possible combinations but most of the mixtures of two AVs resulted in an inhibitory effect similar to that obtained with the single drugs, or at least not higher than the sum of effects of both AVs. Nevertheless, in a few cases, combination of LG and VPA resulted in a slightly higher inhibitory effect than that expected from the sum of their individual effects (data not shown).
