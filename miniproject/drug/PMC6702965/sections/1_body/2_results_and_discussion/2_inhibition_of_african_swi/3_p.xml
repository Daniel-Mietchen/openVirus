<p>We next studied the effect of the time of addition of the AVs on virus yield, assuming that assessing the step in virus cycle targeted by the drug may reveal information on the mechanism of action of the AV. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, ASFV infection was greatly reduced when the AVs were added prior to virus adsorption. In the case of CRL, recovery of virus productivity was observed when CRL was added as early as 0 h after infection (simultaneous with the virus inoculum), which could support its implication in preventing virus attachment. Nevertheless, it has been described that CRL, among other inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis, affected ASFV production in Vero cells by inhibiting a fusion activity, without affecting the binding and internalization of the virus particles (
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Bernardes et al., 1998</xref>). While in that work, the inhibitor was added simultaneously to the virus, in our experiment, CRL was present 3 h before infection, allowing a possible effect of this compound on the cell membranes before virus adsorption.
