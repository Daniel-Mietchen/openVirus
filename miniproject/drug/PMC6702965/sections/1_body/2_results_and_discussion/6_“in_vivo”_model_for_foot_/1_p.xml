<p>C57 mice were chosen for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, as this mouse strain is clinically susceptible for FMDV infection (
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Salguero et al., 2005</xref>). A preliminary assay for LG toxicity in C57 mice revealed non-toxic working concentrations of up to 200 mg/kg administered twice daily for 5 consecutive days (data not shown). We next evaluated the protective efficacy of LG against intraperitoneal challenge of FMDV C-S8 isolate in these mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10 per group). A dose of 100 mg/kg or 200 mg/kg of LG was administered intraperitoneally once daily for 3 (group 0) or 4 (group −1) consecutive days. Mice were challenged with 1,000 pfu of FMDV C-S8 following 1 h (group 0) or 24 h (group −1) after administration of LG and animals were monitored daily for survival rate and clinical score. As reported, FMDV produced a limited mortality in C57 mice, with a survival rate of 40% in LG-untreated virus-infected controls (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Simultaneous inoculation of LG and FMDV conferred no protection (group 0), while inoculation of LG 24 h prior to viral challenge (group −1) increased survival rate to 70% at LG doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg. Although both doses conferred similar protection, mice treated with 200 mg/kg showed lower weights than those treated with 100 mg/kg dose.
