<p>Next, we studied whether LG treatment reduced the virus load upon mice infection. To this end, a new experiment was performed using the protocol (âˆ’1), that is, LG injection 24 h previous to infection, with a dose of 100 mg/ml of LG administered intraperitoneally for 4 consecutive days. Animals were bled and euthanized for further dissection at day 2 p.i. Total (intracellular and extracellular) virus RNA was extracted from blood, spleen, lung, heart, and thymus samples. FMDV cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase, and qPCR was performed. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>, a significant reduction of viral RNA copies (VRC) was found in all samples from FMDV-infected C57 mice that had received one daily dose of LG (100 mg/kg) starting 24 h before virus inoculation.
