<p>Our results provide further characterization of the antiviral effect in cultured cells of the inexpensive drugs VPA and LG against a highly relevant animal virus such as ASFV that is quickly spreading in regions of Europe and Asia. The results also extend the antiviral potential of LG to FMDV and SVDV causing vesicular diseases in animals. LG, but not other esters of gallic acid, can significantly reduce the FMDV growth in cultured cells by inhibiting a late step in FMDV infection. Interestingly, LG also reduced the mice mortality upon infection with FMDV, which causes an economically devastating livestock disease. To our knowledge, this is one of the first descriptions of a cell-targeted compound with antiviral effect
