<p>We further characterized the effect of LG on FMDV infection, as the availability of cost-effective antivirals for this virus, that severely impacts global livestock security, is limited (
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">De Vleeschauwer et al., 2017</xref>). To determine the effect of LG on FMDV protein synthesis, the expression of structural (VP1) and non-structural (3C) FMDV proteins was analyzed at different times after virus infection in the presence or absence of the AV. As expected, the expression of both proteins was significantly reduced (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), which is consistent with the level of inhibition (1 log.u.) detected in infective virus production. Likewise, LG transiently inhibited positive strand viral RNA synthesis, from 2 to 3 h.p.i., when total and extracellular viruses were analyzed (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). At 8 h.p.i., the amount of intracellular FMDV RNA was not affected by LG, although extracellular virus was significantly reduced, which might reflect a decrease of infective virus release in the presence of LG. However, as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, a consistent decrease of at least 1 log.u. was observed in the total virus production of two FMDV serotypes in cells infected at 24 h.p.i, and at three different M.O.I.s, supporting the inhibitory effect of LG at late times in FMDV infection.
