<p>The effect of time of addition of LG in FMDV infection revealed that virus productivity was blocked when LG was added up to 7 h.p.i. (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating that the step inhibited by the drug was late in infection (considering that the FMDV cycle is completed in about 8–10 h). With a M.O.I. of 0.1 pfu/cell, it is expected that two successive virus cycles have occurred at 24 h.p.i. The results in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> (“low M.O.I.”) are consistent with this model showing a plateau in virus titers from 8 to 15 h.p.i. (when the second virus round is inhibited by LG additions), with the total virus productivity recovered when LG was added at 20–24 h.p.i. A similar result was reported for the inhibitory action of LG on ASFV infection in Vero cells (
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Hurtado et al., 2008</xref>); in this case, virus production was inhibited when LG was added up to 5 h.p.i. and the maximum virus titer was observed from 15 h.p.i., involving the viral DNA replication as the LG-sensitive step in virus inhibition. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> (“high M.O.I.”), when higher M.O.I.s (1 or 5 pfu/cell) were used, most cells resulted initially FMDV-infected leading to a single round of infection.
