<p>To determine whether the inhibition of virus infection was also observed with esters of gallic acid other than LG, the effect of gallic acid (G) and its esters, propyl gallate (PG), octyl gallate (OG) (

 <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Yamasaki et al., 2007</xref>), and LG, was analyzed in FMDV-infected BHK21 cells. In this experiment, ASFV-infected Vero cells were also included. As represented in 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, LG was the only compound that inhibited FMDV infection, reducing virus yield by up to 2 log.u, in a range of concentrations (10–30 μM) that still maintained cell viability. Neither G nor PG inhibited FMDV growth at non-toxic concentrations (up to 100 μM) while OG reduced virus yields by 2 log.u. at 100 μM, an effect that could be due, at least in part, to the cell toxicity exerted by this OG concentration. This result contrasts with the inhibitory effect of OG observed in ASFV (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), supporting that different viruses can show distinct sensitivities to an antiviral targeted against cellular functions, likely depending on their requirement on the affected cell function.
