  <p>LG, CRL, and VPA virotoxicity on FMDV or ASFV. Virus suspensions were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with LG, VPA, or CRL (from 0 to 300 Î¼M for LG and CRL, or 0 to 300 mM for VPA); controls with viruses incubated in 2% ethanol in the absence of the drug were included (vehicle). At each AV concentration, total virus was titrated by plaque assay.</p>
