  <p>Specificity of the inhibition exerted by LG on FMDV infection. Vero cell monolayers for ASFV or BHK21 for FMDV were incubated for 1 h with G, PG, OG, or LG at the indicated concentrations (0–1,000 μM) and then infected with ASFV Ba71V strain or FMDV C-S8 strain in medium containing the same gallate esters concentrations. Total virus produced at 24 h.p.i. was titrated by plaque assay on BHK21 (FMDV) or Vero (ASFV) cell monolayers in duplicate samples and represented as virus yield (%).</p>
