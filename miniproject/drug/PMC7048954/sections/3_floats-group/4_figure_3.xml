 <caption>
  <p>Lineweaverâ€“Burk (LB) plots of NS3-4A protease Inhibition (
   <bold>A</bold>-
   <bold>C</bold>). Left Panels. LB plots of substrate concentration versus NS3-4A enzyme activity (genotype 1b) in the presence of various concentrations of MPP inhibitor. FRET assays of recombinant NS3-4A protease activity were conducted as described in methods. Right Panels. Secondary plots of Km/V (slope) versus MPP concentration were used to derive Ki for each MPP. Plots of [MPP] vs Km/V showed highly significant linearity for all three MPPs (r
   <sup>2</sup> = 0.97, 0.90 and 0.99 for ZnPP, CoPP and SnPP respectively, P&lt; 0.005) strongly suggesting competitive inhibition of MPP for NS3/4A protease.
