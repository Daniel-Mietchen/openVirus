<p>The HCV NS3-4A protease-helicase is an attractive viral target for antiviral drugs. Enzymatically, the complex performs crucial protease and helicase steps in HCV RNA translation and polyprotein processing.
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Oral, first-generation HCV protease inhibitors were the first drugs used in combination with conventional pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapies and significantly improved treatment outcomes.

 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Second generation protease inhibitors were subsequently shown to be effective adjunctive antiviral agents when used in combination with other drugs that target the HCV RNA polymerase or the NS5A protein.
