<p>The findings of 
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> were further tested with statistical cross-comparisons of MPP vs meso MP vs genotype from multiple experiments and summarized in 
 <xref rid="T0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for either CoPP or ZnPP across each genotype were not significantly different; however, CoPP was a better inhibitor than ZnPP for all genotypes (p &lt; 0.05) (
 <xref rid="T0003" ref-type="table">Table 3A</xref>). In contrast, both ZnPP and SnPP were better inhibitors than their meso variants (
 <xref rid="T0003" ref-type="table">Table 3B</xref>). These comparisons emphasize the importance of the vinyl R group of the MPP for anti-protease activity.
