<p>Reciprocal plots were performed to determine the inhibitory parameters of three active MPPs (Zn, Co, and Sn) (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>–
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">C</xref>, respectively) for genotype 1B. These plots demonstrated that enzymatic inhibition was basically competitive and all three MPPs showed similar Ki (0.48, 0.43 and 1.7 µM, ZnPP, CoPP, and SnPP respectively).
