<p>The performance of HCV replicons is known to be influenced by multiple factors such as cellular proliferation, viability, and culture confluency.

 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Consequently, we tested whether the major, active MPPs, as well as a known NS3 protease inhibitor, danoprevir,
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> had effects on cellular proliferation and/or viability in Huh 5.15NS replicon cells (
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Huh 5.15NS replicon cells were seeded onto plates, allowed to attach overnight, then MPP (10 or 20 μM) or control vehicle added. At 24 and 48 hrs intervals, cultures were assayed with MTT assay as detailed in the methods. Of the compounds tested, ZnPP was most active and reduced the amount of viable cells 40–50% at both intervals while CoPP had no detectable effects at either time point. Neither FePP or SnPP had significant effects at 24 hr but both caused a small reduction of viable cells (12–19%) by 48 hrs. Because HCV inhibitors can potentially influence replicon cellular proliferation through inhibition of the replicon pathway,
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> we also tested the effects of Danoprevir, a known NS3 inhibitor with the MTT assay. Danoprevir had little if any effects on viable cells at 24 or 48 hrs at concentrations equivalent or in excess of its EC
