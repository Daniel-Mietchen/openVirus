<p>In contrast to the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, there was considerable disparity in the EC
 <sub>50</sub> of the MPPs, and only ZnPP and FePP showed comparable IC
 <sub>50</sub> and EC
 <sub>50</sub> values (
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1A</xref>, 
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). At this time, we suspect that these findings may reflect differences in MPP cellular uptake, intracellular distribution, and cellular replication. Nevertheless, Western blot analyses showed that ZnPP, CoPP and CuPP decreased expression of HCV proteins NS3-4A and core in both infected hepatoma cells and replicons roughly comparable to EC
 <sub>50</sub> values which further confirms their antiviral activities (
