<p>Assay of various metal-substituted porphyrin derivatives showed that removal of the vinyl R group of the protoporphyrins (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and substitution with deutero-, isohemato, or meso groups resulted in the loss of activity (
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1B</xref>). We next tested the antiviral behavior of metal-free, ie, “free base” porphyrins (
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1C</xref>) containing the same R substitutions. None of the porphyrin variants was as effective as protoporphyrin for anti-protease activity or inhibition of viral replication although mesoporphyrin did show appreciable anti-NS3-4A and intracellular activity. The isohemato- and mesoporphyrin R substitutions both contain saturated alkyl groups with free rotation that are not resonance stabilized with the planar porphyrin ring, in contrast to the vinyl group of protoporphyrin.
