<p>While our data indicate a direct interaction of MPP with the NS3-4A protease, it is important to note that protoporphyrins and MPPs might also impact HCV through other host enzymes and innate antiviral pathways. MPPs such as ZnPP and SnPP influence cellular levels of heme precursors in the protoporphyrin synthetic pathway through feedback and also induce HO-1 expression and heme oxidation possibly implicating multiple sites of antiviral activity.
