<p>Three MPPs were also tested against three major NS3-4A mutations, V36M, T54A and A156T. While V36M and T54A chiefly arise with the use of the linear peptidomimetic compounds, A156T arises during treatment with nearly all linear and macrocyclic compounds developed to date.

 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> ZnPP, CuPP and MnPP inhibited protease constructs with these mutations with the same fidelity as the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that MPPs could be designed for use on resistant proteases.
