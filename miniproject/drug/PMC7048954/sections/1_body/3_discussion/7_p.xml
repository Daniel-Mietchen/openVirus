<p>In addition to structural requirements for optimal NS3-4A inhibition, our data showed that three MPPs: CoPP, ZnPP and SnPP, were equally active against four of the major viral genotype enzyme constructs, ie 1A, 1B, 2A, and 3A, (

The effectiveness of the MPPs against genotype 3A protease is especially attractive as it is the most resistant of all genotypes to first and most second-generation oral anti-proteases
