<p>Classical double reciprocal, Lineweaver–Burk (LB) plots showed that MPPs bound NS3-4A with a basic competitive behavior similar to what we have shown previously for BV.
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> CoPP and ZnPP were the most active protease inhibitors tested and showed Ki values 10–20 fold stronger than biliverdin. Interestingly, the identity of the coordination metal had only minor effects on protease IC
 <sub>50</sub> and calculated Ki. Moreover, free-base protoporphyrin, the immediate precursor to heme in the cellular synthetic pathway, was noted to have IC/EC
 <sub>50</sub> values similar to FePP. These findings suggest that the coordination metal only minimally impacts protease inhibition per se; however, the metal may alter pharmacodynamics such as cellular uptake and distribution much more dramatically. Generally, pharmacodynamics is not well understood for the MPPs as a class. Even the cellular uptake of heme is complex and can involve multiple mechanisms in addition to hemopexin binding and receptor-mediated uptake.

 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Related non-heme protoporphyrins such as ZnPP, CoPP and SnPP are known to interact differentially with heme uptake systems, and they also show marked differences intracellularly for interactions with cellular enzymes such as HO-1. Consequently, pharmacodynamic parameters appear important for the eventual choice of antiviral MPP candidates to consider for further development.
