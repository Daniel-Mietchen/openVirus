<p>HCV replicons were used to quantify the intracellular activities of the MPPs. However, viral synthesis in replicon cells is known to be affected by agents that also influence other cellular activities such as stability, replication, and growth.
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Testing of four of the most potent MPPs, ZnPP, CoPP, SnPP and FePP showed differences in the ability of these compounds to influence viability or cellular proliferation in addition to their antiviral activities. Of the four compounds tested, ZnPP showed the most effect on viability as compared to CoPP which had no influence. Marginal effects were seen with SnPP and FePP. These results might be expected since ZnPP, but not other MPPs, has been reported to regulate pathways important for cellular replication such as Wnt/Î²-Catenin

 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Our preliminary studies indicate that ZnPP directly interferes with DNA synthesis and also inhibits telomerase and chromosomal telomere repair mechanisms.
 <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> While these effects lead to a modest increase in apoptosis, ZnPP tends to be more cytostatic than cytotoxic however this difference cannot be determined from our data here. Consequently, it is not yet clear how or where the cellular activities of ZnPP may influence antiviral behavior but these topics require further study.
