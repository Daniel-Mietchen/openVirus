<p>All mean FRET values were determined using 3–4 replicates per point. A completely randomized design with multiple treatment groups was used for the analysis of variance for each experiment and variances then pooled among experiments using appropriate degrees of freedom for among and within-group comparisons. IC
 <sub>50</sub> and ED
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined by regression assuming sigmoid curve inhibition and tested either pairwise using Fisher’s Least Significant Difference test or among treatment groups using F statistic. All experiments were repeated at least twice. 
 <italic>Graphpad Prism</italic> or 
 <italic>Excel</italic> software was used for least-squares regression and calculation of all variances; however, final multiple group statistical comparisons were set up conventionally and performed by hand using standard tables of t and F values. 
 <italic>P</italic> values that were greater than 0.05 were not considered significant.
