 <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase (
 <italic>Perkin-Elmer Cetus</italic>, Norwalk, CT), and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (
 <italic>Gibco/BRL Life Technologies</italic>, Gaithersburg, MD) were used in these studies. All porphyrins and metalloporphyrins were obtained from Frontier Scientific, Inc (Logan, UT) and were the purest forms available (&gt;97% purity). All tetrapyrroles were dissolved in minimal volumes of Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted into culture media or assay buffers to achieve the final concentration. Controls received an identical volume of diluted solvent only. HCV recombinant NS3-4A protease with 
 <italic>SensoLyte Assay</italic>s utilizing Fluorescence Energy Transfer (FRET) probes were purchased from 
 <italic>AnaSpec</italic>, Fremont, CA.
