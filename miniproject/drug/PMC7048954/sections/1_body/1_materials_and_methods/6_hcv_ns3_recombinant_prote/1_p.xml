<p>Recombinant NS3-4A protease activities (1A, 1B, 2A, and 3A genotypes) were determined fluorometrically with 
 <italic>SensoLyte</italic> HCV Protease Assay Systems (
 <italic>AnaSpec</italic>, Fremont, CA) using FRET assays.
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Wide (591 nm/622 nm) short (490nm/520nm), or narrow (340nm/490nm) wavelengths for excitation/emission were used as listed in 
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Wavelengths used for each compound were determined empirically from autofluorescence experiments that defined the optimal signal-to-noise ratios. All assays were performed in parallel with control incubations containing porphyrin only to correct for autofluorescence. IC
 <sub>50</sub> was defined as the concentration of antagonist necessary to achieve 50% inhibition of NS3-4A protease activity as determined in the enzymatic assays and was calculated by regression from activity vs antagonist concentration sigmoidal plots. To ensure assay performance, a known inhibitor, 
 <italic>Anaspec 25346</italic>, was routinely tested in each batch of assays.
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The inhibitor was employed at 10–20 µM (about 2-5x its IC
 <sub>50</sub>) and led to 60–80% inhibition of the NS3-4A recombinant enzyme.
