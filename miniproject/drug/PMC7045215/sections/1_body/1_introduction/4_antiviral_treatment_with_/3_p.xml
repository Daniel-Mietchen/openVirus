<p>Valacyclovir has been tested in multiple sclerosis (MS) with equivocal results. MS lesion size on brain MRI scan and clinical disability were outcomes; cognition was not assessed in the two MS trials.
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 32</xref> In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 18-week trial in 24 patients with schizophrenia with positive HSV1 titres, valacyclovir 3â€‰g/day was superior to placebo with effect sizes of 0.79, 0.97 and 1.14 for tests of working memory, verbal memory and visual object memory, respectively.
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> These results are promising for the treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, specifically in individuals with HSV seropositivity. Valacyclovir also improves cognition in patients with HSE, but controlled trials are lacking.
