<p>The majority of older adults have had HSV infection during their lifetimes.
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Reactivation of HSV seropositivity immunoglobin M (IgM) has been shown to correlate significantly with incident AD,
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and the anti-HSV1 IgG antibody avidity index has been shown to be higher in amnestic mild cognitive impairment than healthy controls.
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> ORs for the association between HSV1 seropositivity and AD, compared with HSV seronegative individuals, range from 1 to 3 across studies,
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 20</xref> with an OR of 2 reported in two Swedish cohorts.
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> In a series of 240 adults, HSV1 seropositivity was associated with a lower neuropsychological test battery score and an 18-fold increase in severe impairment in delayed memory.
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In a Finnish study of 383 home-dwelling patients with cardiovascular disease, seropositivity for HSV1, HSV2 or cytomegalovirus was associated with lower Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores and with decline in MMSE and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> scores during 1â€‰year of follow-up. In that study, with 0 to 1 viral seropositivities as reference, HRs for 2 and 3 viral seropositivities were 1.8 (95% CI 0.9 to 3.6) and 2.3 (95% CI 1.1 to 5.0), respectively.
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In patients with psychotic disorders, impaired neurocognitive test performance has been associated with HSV1 seropositivity.
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref> In summary, the associations between prior exposure to HSV, particularly HSV1, and cognitive impairment are detectable in healthy older adults, patients with cardiovascular disease, and patients with psychotic disorders.
