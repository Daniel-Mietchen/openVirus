<p>There are two primary outcome measures (multiple outcome measures): change in ADAS-Cog and change in ADCS-ADL. For multiple outcome measures in this phase II trial, statistical significance on any one measure is meaningful and correction for multiple comparisons is not needed, unlike for co-primary outcome measures.
