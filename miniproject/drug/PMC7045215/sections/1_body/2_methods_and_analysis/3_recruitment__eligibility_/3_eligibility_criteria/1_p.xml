<p>Detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria are described in 
 <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="B1">box 1</xref>. Adults with a diagnosis of probable AD by NIA clinical criteria are eligible.
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Patients with MCI and CDR=0.5 are also eligible if they have prior evidence of AD neuropathology from either positive amyloid PET scans or an AD CSF profile of low Aβ with high total tau (tau, p-tau) levels based on the Aβ42/t-tau index (ATI, calculated as Aβ42/(240+1.18 t-tau)) with ATI &lt;1.0 and p-tau &gt;61 pg/mL being indicative of AD. We adopted this approach because MCI is heterogeneous, and we wanted to include only those patients with MCI with amyloid and tau biomarkers of AD neuropathology. We are interested in the effects of the antiviral drug valacyclovir on cognition and function as clinical outcomes, and on amyloid and tau as biomarker outcomes, based on the basic science literature on the effects of antiviral drugs like valacyclovir on amyloid and tau and other measures that are affected by HSV.
