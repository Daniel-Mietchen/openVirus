 <sup>18</sup>F-Florbetapir (Amyvid) is purchased from a local vendor. Participant preparation consists of intravenous catheterisation followed by bolus injection of the tracer (injected activity 10 mCi). PET scans are acquired in dynamic, 3D imaging mode beginning 50 min after injection. Four brain images are acquired, each with 5 min scan time over 20 min. The standardised uptake value (SUV), defined as the decay-corrected brain radioactivity concentration normalised for injected dose and body weight, is calculated. SUV is normalised to cerebellar grey matter to derive standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR). SUVR is determined at the voxel and ROI level; the sum of six ROIs known to show increased amyloid radiotracer uptake in mild AD (medial orbital frontal, anterior cingulate, parietal, temporal, posterior cingulate, precuneus)
