<p>Detection of serum antiviral antibodies against HSV1 surface protein gG-1 is 100% specific and 98% sensitive for exposure to HSV1.
 <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Repeated reactivation leads to lifelong elevation of viral titres, but they do not indicate duration or timing of HSV exposure. We obtain serum antiviral antibodies to HSV1 and HSV2 with IgM and IgG from standardised assays performed by Quest Diagnostics.
