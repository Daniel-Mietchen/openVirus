<p>For 
 <sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240 PET imaging (injected activity 5 mCi), PET scans are acquired from 80 to 120â€‰min after injection. Using similar processing methods to 
 <sup>18</sup>F-Florbetapir PET, the main outcome is tau SUVR in the medial and inferior temporal lobes with cerebellar cortex as reference region. Tau aggregation is limited to medial temporal cortex in older adults and does not spread into neocortical regions until after AD symptoms become manifest.
 <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> We will examine superior temporal, occipital, prefrontal cortex, superior and inferior parietal lobule, and precuneus as exploratory ROIs.
