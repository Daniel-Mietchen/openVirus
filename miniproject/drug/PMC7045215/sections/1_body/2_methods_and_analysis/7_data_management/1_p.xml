<p>Data entry will be completed by Programme Managers, Clinical Research Coordinators, and Research Assistants on the study protocol. Data entry/cleaning will be done throughout the project. The data collected in this study will be monitored by the Data Coordinating Centre (DCC) at NYSPI. The unit will work closely with the research assistant/coordinator and the Principal Investigator to facilitate independent auditing of primary subject records. The database will provide reports indicating all modifications that have been made in the database together with paper communications (fax, e-mail) confirming and authorising these modifications. Access to the data system is available only to authorised users, with multiple levels of security including user ID/password authentication via MS Active Directory overseen by experienced IT personnel. Other authorised users with direct access to the data system will be DCC staff. DCC data-related operations and the SIR/Citrix system have been certified by Columbia Universityâ€™s Information Security Office. The dataset will not be published in a data repository.</p>
