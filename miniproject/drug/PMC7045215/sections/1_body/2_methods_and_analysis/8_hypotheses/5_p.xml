<p>Additional measures examined will be apoE ε4 genotype as a potential moderator of outcome, changes in serum antibody levels to HSV1 and HSV2, MRI ‘signature’ in AD of regional cortical thinning and whole brain cortical thinning,
 <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52 53</xref> and CSF acyclovir levels to examine plasma/CSF acyclovir correlations. CSF studies will be optional and approximately one-third of the sample is expected to agree to LP.
