<p>This medium effect size is clinically meaningful given the paucity of effective therapies in AD. A small-to-medium effect size (0.30–0.45) for either efficacy measure may not reach significance but still provide enough signal to warrant a phase III trial. For Hypothesis 2, the detectable effect size for ADCS-ADL will be similar to that for Hypothesis 1. For Hypothesis 3 (
 <sup>18</sup>F-Florbetapir PET) and for Hypothesis 4 (
 <sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240 PET), with n=55 completers per group (15% attrition), the minimum detectable effect size of the group difference is d=0.54, that is, if changes differ by 0.54 SD between treatment groups, we will be able to detect such difference with 80% power for a two-sided test at the significance level of 0.05. For the exploratory moderator hypothesis, the minimum detectable interaction effect size is Cohen’s f
 <sup>2</sup>=0.07 (a small-to-medium effect size) with 80% power at a significance level of 0.05, that is, if group X moderator interaction explains more than 6.8% of the variance (Cohen’s f
 <sup>2</sup> = (R
 <sup>2</sup>/(1 R
 <sup>2</sup>)) we can detect such effects.
