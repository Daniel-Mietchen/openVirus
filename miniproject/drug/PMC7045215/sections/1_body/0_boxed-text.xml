  <list-item>
   <p>The association between herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1) and cognitive impairment meets several Bradford-Hill criteria suggesting a cause and effect relationship with consistent evidence of impairment, modest effect size, and a temporal relationship between HSV exposure and cognitive deficits.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>First randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of an antiviral treatment in Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) or any dementia that evaluates clinically relevant cognitive and functional outcomes.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Evaluation of the impact of antiviral treatment on biomarkers: positron emission tomography amyloid and tau imaging indices, and secondary measures of MRI cortical thinning, anti-HSV antibodies and odour identification impairment.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>A linear association between virus exposure dose and illness severity cannot be tested accurately because the frequency of seropositivity is high in older adults and antibody levels reflect both old and new infections.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>HSV is unlikely to be the sole cause of AD as some individuals with HSV seropositive do not develop AD and individuals with HSV seronegative can develop AD.</p>
