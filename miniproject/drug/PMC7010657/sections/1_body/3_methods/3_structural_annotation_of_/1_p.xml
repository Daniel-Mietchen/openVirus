<p id="Par13">An organized approach was used to implement the structural annotation of all the peptides and this is comprehensively shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Initially, all the peptide sequences in the PlantPepDB database were examined for an identical sequence in Protein Data Bank (PDB)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup>. In case, an identical sequence was available in PDB, we retrieved that structure and assigned it to the matching PlantPepDB peptide entry. If the identical sequence was not available in PDB, then we used different pipelines for predicting the structure of peptides depending on the length of peptides. The peptides which were having a sequence length below five were not modelled. The peptides with length five to six residues were modelled using PEP-FOLD3
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup> Server. The peptides with sequence length 7 to 25 were modelled using PEPstrMOD
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup> which is again a peptide structure prediction server. The jobs in PEPstrMOD were submitted for a batch run so that multiple structures can be modelled simultaneously. The peptides with length more than 25 residues having homologous structures in PDB (i.e. sequence identity &gt;40% and sequence query coverage &gt;50%) were predicted using homology modelling. The top templates were used to make the tertiary structure of peptides using MODELLER
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>. Finally, the remaining peptides which did not have any significant homolog in PDB, were modelled via the de-novo approach using I-TASSER Suite
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup> in a parallel manner so that multiple cores can be used to run the modelling jobs quickly. We used DSSP software
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup> to assign eight types of secondary structural states (H: alpha helix, G: 3/10 helix, I: pi helix, B: beta-bridge, E: extended strand, S: bend, C: loop and T: turn)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup> by providing the tertiary structure of peptide in PDB file format as input.
