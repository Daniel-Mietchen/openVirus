<p id="Par14">All the 3848 peptides of PlantPepDB were analyzed carefully and the physicochemical properties of the peptides were calculated using the peptide sequences. We used biopython module ‘Bio.SeqUtils’

 </sup> from which we imported the ProtParam utility in which the peptide sequences were provided as inputs. In-house python scripts were used to run 10 types of analysis on peptide sequences, like amino acid count, amino acid percent, isoelectric point, molecular weight, Grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) index, aromaticity, instability index, atomic composition, molar extinction coefficient and secondary structure fraction. Some properties like the number of positively and negatively charged residues were calculated by the previously calculated amino acid counts. The aliphatic index of peptides was calculated using the formula given on the Expassy Bioinformatics Resource Portal’s ProtParam

 </sup> tool documentation i.e. Aliphatic index = X(Ala) + a ∗ X(Val) + b ∗ (X(Ile) + X(Leu)) where X(Ala), X(Val), X(Ile), and X(Leu) are mole percent (100 X mole fraction) of alanine, valine, isoleucine, and leucine. The coefficients a and b are the relative volume of the valine side chain (a = 2.9) and of Leu/Ile side chains (b = 3.9) to the side chain of alanine. The Atomic Composition of peptides which tells us about the carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur content was calculated using the Proteomics Toolkit (

We have used an in-house Perl script to provide automated input to the proteomics toolkit server and extract out the atomic composition information in tabular format.
