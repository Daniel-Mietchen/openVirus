<p id="Par10">In a nutshell, users can take advantage of PlantPepDB in the following means: (i) searching for plant peptides from 11 databases and 835 research articles at one go and therefore save time, (ii) with all the additionally curated meta-data that is available in the database, users can find much more comprehensive information than available in the primary sources, (iii) users can search the data by amino acid composition as well as by setting various physicochemical property parameters, (iv) extract structural information for most of the peptides with 5 or more residues, that will facilitate structure to function analysis as well as screening and docking studies. We hope that the development of PlantPepDB will expedite the plant peptide research.</p>
