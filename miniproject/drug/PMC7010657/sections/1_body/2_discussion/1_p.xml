<p id="Par9">Bioactive and therapeutic peptides comprise of a wide class of peptides having biological activities. The discovery of insulin therapy in 1920s has led peptide therapeutics to play a vital role in medical practice. Diversification has occurred in peptide drug discovery to integrate a broad array of structures noted from diverse natural sources or via efforts of medicinal chemistry, apart from its conventional focus on endogenous human peptides. Peptides are molecularly poised amid proteins and small molecules, even so therapeutically and biochemically dissimilar from two of them, thus represents an exclusive category of pharmaceutical compounds. By engineering enhanced pharmaceutical properties, by utilizing strategies of novel chemistry for broadening molecular diversity and by developing into new indications and molecular targets, the pace has been maintained by peptide therapeutics with scientific innovation. To facilitate peptide-based research, several peptide databases are available which contain peptides of many functional categories, however, there are no peptide databases dedicated to peptides extracted from plant sources except PhytAMP which only contains 273 peptide entries with limited functional categories. In an attempt to make a comprehensive meta-database, PlantPepDB is developed, embodying a compilation of peptides which are derived from only plant sources with a wide variety of functional categories. PlantPepDB is developed in an attempt to make a comprehensive meta-database comprising a collection of peptides which are derived from only plant sources with a wide variety of functional categories. All the entries present in PlantPepDB are cross-linked with their original sources for easy access to the primary source. It contains peptides from already available databases as well as from several manually curated literature sources. However, collecting from such a huge amount of dataset showed a problem that has been carefully addressed in PlantPepDB which is the number of duplicate entries which are having the same peptide sequence, but different meta-information collected from different sources (both literature and databases). In this database, such peptide entries have been manually curated to merge all the meta-information of a peptide sequence, thus reducing the number of repeated and duplicate peptide entries into a single information enriched entry. Further, the physicochemical properties like molecular mass, isoelectric point, amino acid, and atomic composition, molar extinction coefficient, aromaticity, instability index, Grand Average of hydropathicity and aliphatic index etc. of each and every peptide has been incorporated into the database which will facilitate the user to decide the usability of a peptide in various experimental studies. The tertiary structure of all peptides that have more than 5 residues have been integrated into the database which are vital for screening, docking and simulation studies. Moreover, many peptides which were described in different sources with single functional property were found to possess multiple properties when repeated and duplicate peptide sequences were merged, which make PlantPepDB a very effective web resource of plant peptides.</p>
