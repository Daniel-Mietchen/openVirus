<p id="Par21">PlantPepDB is a web-based repository dedicated to plant peptides. It consists of 3848 manually curated plant peptide entries and various search options are provided for the user to explore the database. There are three major tools incorporated in the database (i.e. SW Align, Peptide Mapping, and BLAST) which helps the user to align their query peptide sequences with PlantPepDB sequences. This database provides information on different functional categories of plant peptides, their physicochemical properties, and tertiary structure.</p>
