<p id="Par7">The peptides which have a minimum length of 5 residues were modelled using various modelling approaches. The distribution of peptide structures across the modelling tools that were used can be found in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. First, there were 477 peptides whose sequence length was below 5 residues, and these were not considered for structural modelling. There were 75 peptides for which the tertiary structures were already available, and were extracted from PDB database. The peptides with length 5 and 6 residues were modelled using PEP-FOLD 3

 </sup> server which is a server for de novo peptide structure prediction. A total of 319 peptides were modelled using this server which had the sequence length of 5 and 6 residues. A total of 921 peptides with sequence length from 7 to 25 residues were modelled using PEPstrMOD

 </sup> (in batch mode) webserver, a state-of-art method used to predict the tertiary structure of peptides. Out of 2056 remaining peptides, 1791 peptides were modelled using homology modelling approach since all of them had significant homologs available in the PDB database. For all these 1791 structures, 5 models were built using the best template and out of them, the model with the least DOPE score was selected as the final model. Finally, the remaining 265 peptide sequences that had no significant homolog in PDB were modelled using I-TASSER Suite

 </sup> which is considered to be the gold standard tool for de novo modelling of protein tertiary structures. DSSP software package was used to assign the secondary structural states of all the peptides available at PlantPepDB. The tertiary structures of all the peptides were given as input to the DSSP except 477 peptide entries whose structure was not modelled due to sequence length below 5 residues. The DSSP output reports of each peptide in PlantPepDB is available in the database along with the tertiary structure.
