<p id="Par4">Based on the curated information of peptide functions, we categorized all the peptide entries into 9 major functional categories. Maximum number of peptides were found in microbe killing functional group with 2356 entries, followed by therapeutic peptides with 1465 entries, toxic peptides (407 entries), inhibitory peptides (280 entries), invertebrate killing (209 entries), immune system related (65 entries), plant defense response (43 entries) and opioid peptides (8 entries). A separate category named as miscellaneous with 231 peptides is also created for those functional categories that do not fit into any other category. The therapeutic functional category consists of 31 diverse classes of peptides, like anticancer, vasorelaxant, anti-hypertensive, diuretic, antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, etc. Along with functional and sub-functional classification of peptides, their responses in organisms are also mentioned i.e. whether the peptides will exhibit their response in plants, animals or other organisms. Detailed information about the number of peptides present in each functional and sub-functional category along with their response information is illustrated in TableÂ
