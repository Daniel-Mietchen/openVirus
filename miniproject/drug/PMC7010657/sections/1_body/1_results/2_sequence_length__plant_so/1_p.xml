<p id="Par5">Currently, there are 3848 unique peptide entries that have been incorporated in the database from 11 different published databases and 835 published literature articles. The database consists of peptides of varying length range. There are 2862 peptides which are less than or equal to 50 residues in length (i.e. about 75%) and rest 986 peptides are of length above 50 residues (i.e. only about 25%). The database consists of peptides extracted from 443 plants among which the maximum number of peptides were found in Glycine max with 296 peptides followed by Arabidopsis thaliana with 150 peptides and Triticum aestivum with 142 peptides.</p>
