<p id="par0080">These replicons have been used to screen for drug candidates acting on the transcription and replication machinery of 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family members. Lead compounds identified in the past years include abamectin, ivermectin and berberine â€“ a plant-derived isoquinoline alkaloid 
 <xref rid="bib0320" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Abamectin and ivermectin are widely used antihelminthics but no follow-up studies were conducted on their antiviral effect against CHIKV. However, a Phase II/III trial is ongoing to assess safety and efficacy of ivermectin use in DENV infections 
 <xref rid="bib0325" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. In a follow-up study, berberine was shown to inhibit the MAP kinase pathway activated by CHIKV infection, showing that it was effective in alleviating symptoms of CHIKV infection in a mouse model 
 <xref rid="bib0330" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. However, no clinical studies followed. The WEEV replicon has been used in a high-throughput study using a library of 2206 extracts of marine organisms from diverse geographic regions. Thirty-seven primary hits were identified and, from these primary hits, an antimycin A derivative from the marine actinomycete 
 <italic>Streptomyces kaviengensis</italic> was isolated as the most promising. Antimycin A is a prominent broad-spectrum antiviral that inhibits the cellular mitochondrial electron transport chain and
