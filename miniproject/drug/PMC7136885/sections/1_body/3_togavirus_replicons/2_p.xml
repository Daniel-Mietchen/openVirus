<p id="par0070">Members of the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses with genomes of ∼10–12 knt in size, featuring a 5′ cap and a 3′ poly-A tail. Togavirus genomes code for two polyproteins, the 5′ nonstructural and the 3′ structural polyprotein. The nonstructural polyprotein is produced by direct translation of the genome. The structural polyprotein is produced by translation of a 26S subgenomic RNA produced by the viral RdRp from a promoter located between the two coding regions. The structural polyprotein is processed into four structural proteins: Capsid, E2/3, E1 and 6K. The nonstructural polyprotein is proteolytically processed into four nonstructural proteins: nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4, which all interact to form the replication complex (reviewed in Ref.
