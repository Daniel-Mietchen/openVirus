<p id="par0060">Dengue replicon systems have been successfully used for hit discovery by Lu 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, who identified phthalazinone derivatives as potent inhibitors of DENV2 replication 
 <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Frabasile 
 <italic>et al</italic>., using a similar screen, showed that naringenin, a citrus flavonone, greatly impaired genome replication using human Huh7.5 cells harbouring DENV1 and DENV3 replicons 
 <xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Hernandez-Morales 
 <italic>et al</italic>. tested a HCV compound library in a high-throughput DENV2 replicon screening assay, identifying JNJ-1A as an effective lead 
 <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. This publication showed how the subgenomic replicon system can be used to detect drug-induced resistance-associated mutations. In the case of JNJ-1A, resistance-associated mutations were found to cluster in the NS4b coding region. Interestingly, NS4b has no known enzymatic activity but is essential for replication, and is known to interact with viral and cellular proteins to form the dengue replication complex and subvert the cellular innate immune response 
 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Quinic acid derivatives were shown to reduce the amount of NS3 in treated DENV1 and DENV3 replicon-containing cells by FACS analysis 
 <xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Interestingly, genome replication and translation were excluded as the mode of action for some drug candidates, such as hirsutine, using the dengue subgenomic replicon system 
 <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Dengue virus drug discovery is a hotbed of activity as recently reviewed 
 <xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. However, none of the aforementioned drug candidates has been taken to the clinic.
