 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family. It is an enveloped virus with a nonsegmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome of ∼15.2 knt. The genome codes for 11 proteins: small hydrophobic protein (SH), attachment protein (G), fusion protein (F), matrix protein (M), Nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), Large protein (L) harbouring RdRp activity, transcriptional regulator M2.1, transcription/replication regulatory protein M2.2, and the two nonstructural proteins: NS1 and NS2.
