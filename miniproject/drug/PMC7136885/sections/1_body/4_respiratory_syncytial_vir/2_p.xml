Therefore, in the mid-1990s a minigenome system was developed based on plasmid-driven expression of the L, N, P and M2 proteins that form a ribonucleoprotein complex within transfected cells, together with an RNA molecule consisting of the leader and trailer sequences of the RSV genome and a region coding for

 <xref rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. In 2011 a true RSV replicon was established by replacing the SH, G and F coding regions with the selectable marker blasticidin S deaminase (bla). The replicon was found to be stable and non-cytopathic in several cell lines. It could be packaged into VLPs by co-expression of structural proteins SH, G and F in
