<p id="par0035">This review will briefly cover the modern success story of the establishment and use of subgenomic replicons in the development of drugs against hepatitis C virus (HCV) and then illustrate the potential of dengue virus, togavirus, respiratory syncytial virus and norovirus replicons, and the Ebola virus minigenome, in the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors. In recent years replicons have been derived from viruses such as hepatitis E virus, enterovirus 71, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, among others, but their description is beyond the scope of this review
