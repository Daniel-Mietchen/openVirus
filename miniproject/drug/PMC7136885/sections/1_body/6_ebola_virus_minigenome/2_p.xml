<p id="par0130">EBOV is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. The EBOV genome is ∼19 knt in size and codes for eight major viral proteins: Nucleoprotein (NP), glycoprotein (GP) and soluble glycoprotein (sGP), VP35, VP40, VP24, VP30 and Large protein (L) 
 <xref rid="bib0485" ref-type="bibr">[97]</xref>. The L protein, harbouring RdRp activity, together with NP, VP30 and VP35, constitutes the ribonucleoprotein complex, with the former three proteins being sufficient for replication, and VP30 essential for transcription 
 <xref rid="bib0490" ref-type="bibr">[98]</xref>. The minigenome system consists of an RNA molecule carrying the native 5′ leader and 3′ trailer sequences of the genome, with an expression cassette inserted in the antisense direction coding for either 
 <italic>cat</italic>, luciferase or green fluorescent protein (GFP) (

 <xref rid="bib0490" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>. Classically, cells are co-transfected with plasmids coding for L, VP30, VP35 and NP. These cells are then transfected with the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed minigenome RNA, leading to replication and transcription of the minigenome within transfected cells, and ultimately to expression of the reporter gene. Over the years improvements have been made to this system, such as cell lines stably expressing L, NP, VP30 and VP35 to minimise variability introduced during co-transfection of plasmids 
 <xref rid="bib0495" ref-type="bibr">[99]</xref>, a selectable marker that is co-expressed with the reporter for creation of a stable cell line continuously replicating the minigenome and T7-polymerase-driven expression of the minigenome within cells transfected with a plasmid coding for the minigenome and T7 polymerase
