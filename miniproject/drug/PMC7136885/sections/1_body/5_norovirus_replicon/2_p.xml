<p id="par0105">Despite very high virus titers in stools during infection and successful culture of murine noroviruses in RAW264.7 and primary murine cells, human noroviruses have eluded efficient propagation in cell culture so far. Human noroviruses have been found to produce low virus titers in B cells and 3D models of differentiating Caco-2 cells; however, these data are controversial
