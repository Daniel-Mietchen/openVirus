<p id="par0110">Human noroviruses are non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the family of 
 <italic>Caliciviridae</italic>. Their genome size varies between 7.2 and 7.5 knt and they contain three open reading frames. ORF1 codes for a polyprotein that is post-translationally processed by the NS6 protease into the six nonstructural proteins NS6 (protease), NS7 (RdRp), NS5/VPg (capping of viral RNA), NS3 (RNA helicase) and NS1/2 and NS4, which have been implicated in the formation of the replication complex. ORF2 and ORF3 are translated from subgenomic RNAs into the major and minor capsid proteins VP1 and VP2, respectively (reviewed in Ref. 
 <xref rid="bib0440" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>). The short 5′ and 3′ UTRs flanking the ORFs contain secondary structures that stretch into the coding regions and are essential for replication, transcription and pathogenesis
