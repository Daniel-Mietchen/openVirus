<p id="Par8">Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 often have a poor prognosis. In patients with ACS, cardiac functional reserve can be reduced owing to myocardial ischaemia or necrosis. When infected with SARS-CoV-2, cardiac insufficiency is more likely to occur, leading to a sudden deterioration in the condition of these patients. Some of the patients with COVID-19â€‰in Wuhan had previous ACS, which was associated with severe illness and high mortality. For patients with cardiac insufficiency who have underlying heart disease, SARS-CoV-2 infection might act as a precipitating factor to worsen the condition and lead to death.</p>
