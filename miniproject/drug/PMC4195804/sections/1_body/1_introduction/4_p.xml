 <italic>in vitro</italic>, there are presently, no approved antiviral agents or vaccines available to tackle any potential SARS or SARS-like outbreaks, such as MERS. Different parts of the virus, that are deemed viable targets include, 3CLP, PLP, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the 5′–3′ helicase [

The inhibitors include replication and entry inhibitors, which can be developed for therapeutic purposes, not just against SARS, but other coronaviruses, including the novel MERS-CoV.
