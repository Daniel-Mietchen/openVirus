<p id="par0030">SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV both belong to the family Coronaviridae, which are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses with approximately 30,000 nucleotides [

 </xref>]. CoVs represent the largest RNA viruses. For the well-characterized SARS-CoV, two overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), encompass approximately two-thirds of the genome. A translational read-through by a −1 ribosomal frameshift mechanism allows the translation of the overlapping reading frames into a single polyprotein pp1ab, whereas, translation without the −1 ribosomal frameshift mechanism produces pp1a. The polyproteins are later cleaved by two viral proteinases, 3C-like protease (3CLP) and papain-like protease (PLP), to yield non-structural proteins essential for viral replication [
