<p id="par0060">Helicases are proteins that catalyze the separation of duplex oligonucleotides into single strands in an ATP-dependent reaction. On the basis of this activity, helicases can be divided into two types: those that unwind duplexes in a 3′→5′ direction, and those that unwind in a 5′→3′ direction. Helicases require a molecular mechanism for transducing the chemical energy generated by the ATPase activity into an oligonucleotide strand separation and displacement activity [
