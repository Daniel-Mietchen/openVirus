<p id="par0055">Recently, Frieman 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] developed a yeast-based assay to screen for small molecules that block SARS-CoV replication on the basis of their inhibition of nsp3 or PLP. The basis for the screen was that stimulated expression of nsp3 in 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> causes a pronounced slow growth phenotype. Using this principle, they screened a small molecule library for compounds that specifically prevented the nsp3-induced slow growth phenotype. These compounds were then validated in cell culture models for efficacy against SARS-CoV replication, as well as the known enzymatic functions of nsp3. The authors found five compounds that reversed the slow growth phenotype in yeast. One of the compounds, NSC158362 (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>g), considerably blocked SARS-CoV replication 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> with an EC
 <sub>50</sub>  &lt; 1 μM. This effect was specific for SARS-CoV replication because no effect on influenza virus replication was observed with up to 50 μM of the inhibitory compound. Another compound, NSC158011, was shown to inhibit nsp3-dependent protease activity in a cell culture assay, but could not prevent virus replication. NSC158362, could not inhibit the protease, deubiquitinase or anti-IFN activities of nsp3, therefore suggesting that the compound may be inhibiting a yet unknown novel activity of nsp3 required for viral replication or may be inhibiting some cellular factors that regulate nsp3 function in infected cells.
