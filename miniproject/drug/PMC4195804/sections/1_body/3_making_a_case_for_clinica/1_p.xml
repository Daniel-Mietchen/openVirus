<p id="par0090">Currently, there are no approved drugs for the treatment of SARS-CoV infection. During the initial outbreak of SARS, a number of medications that included ribavirin with and without corticosteroids [

These drugs have known pharmacological properties and are, therefore, widely available, as some of them are used for the treatment of some viral infections, such as hepatitis C virus, albeit with some adverse side effects including hemolytic anemia, elevated transaminase levels and bradycardia [

Hence, with the new outbreak of MERS-CoV infection, optimization and development of some of the aforementioned lead compounds or other inhibitors with known or new mechanisms of action becomes important for therapeutic purposes, as there are no reports of any compound in clinical trials.
