<p>This study found an overall virologically confirmed household SAR of 8%, similar to results for an earlier study involving the FF100 (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>): SAR reached 34% among contacts who did not receive AV prophylaxis. The SAR increased further for clinical endpoints. These SARs for those who did not receive AVs compare to results of a study in Kenya which reported a confirmed household SAR of 26% (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) in a population without widespread use of AV prophylaxis. Another study in Japan (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), where &gt;90% of contacts had received AV prophylaxis, reported a virologically confirmed SAR of only 5%. Other studies have used clinical endpoints, such as in the United States (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), where a clinical SAR of 10% was reported after 7 days. These findings compare to household SARs found for seasonal influenza in historical studies, ranging from 18% (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) to 22% (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Although these studies had similar design, there are several possible explanations for our results, such as differences in case definition, a different period of follow-up, differences in ascertainment of secondary cases, and differences in AV use. Our observed SAR among those who did not receive prophylaxis is higher than that previously observed for seasonal influenza and suggests a substantial proportion of close contacts were infected with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. Serologic studies will provide important insights into the rates of infection (both symptomatic and asymptomatic in a household setting).
