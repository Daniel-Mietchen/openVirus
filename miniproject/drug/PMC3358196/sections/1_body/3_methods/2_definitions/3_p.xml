<p>Secondary cases were defined as case-patients who had received prophylaxis if AVs were administered 
 <underline>&lt;</underline>24 hours before illness onset. Any asymptomatic contact who received AVs was classified as having prophylaxis. For a small number of contacts with nonâ€“case-defining symptoms before starting AVs, it was not possible to distinguish prophylaxis and treatment. These contacts were excluded for AV analyses.
