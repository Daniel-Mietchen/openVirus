<p id="Par34">HeLa cells were seeded on glass coverslips at a density of 3 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>cells/plate and cultured overnight. The cells were pretreated with DMSO or MD for 1 h. Then, the cells were washed twice with PBS after treatment with TNF-α (100 ng/mL) for about 15 min. Fix the cultured cells for 15 min with 4% paraformalde-hyde and Permeate the cells at room temperature for 15 min with 0.5%Triton X-100. Cells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 30 min, then the primary antibody and secondary antibody was added successively. Nuclear was stained with DAPI. Image were observed and collected under a confocal laser scanning microscope.
