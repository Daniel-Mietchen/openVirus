<p id="Par33">The 293 T were pretreated with DMSO and MD (1 μM) for 1 h. Then the 293 T cells were co-transfected with pGL4.17 containing the ICP0 promotor sequence and RL-TK plasmids by using lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested to determine luciferase activity 36 h post transfection using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System kit (Promega, WI, USA, E1980) by a luminometer instrument.</p>
