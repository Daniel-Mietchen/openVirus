<p id="Par30">Cell pellet was collected by centrifugation at 13000 x g for 1 min. The harvested cells were washed once with PBS and then resuspended in lysis buffer consist of 20 mM Tris–HCl, PH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM Na3VO4, 25mMβ-glycerolphosphate, 0.1 mM PMSF, a complete protease inhibitor set (Roche). The resuspended cell pellet was vortexed for 20s. lysis on ice for 20 min before cell lysates were centrifuged at 13000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants which the soluble proteins are in were collected and subjected to western blot analysis. The proteins were detected by using appropriate antibody.</p>
