<p id="Par17">We proceeded to explore the molecular mechanism by which immediate early genes were inhibited by MD. It has been reported that efficient replication of HSV-1 relies on the activation of the NF-κB pathway in the host cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We further tested whether MD suppressed the expression of viral genes by disturbing the NF-κB pathway. Both viral evasion and antiviral cytokines such as TNF-α are able to induce activation of the NF-κB pathway, so we used recombinant protein TNF-α to trigger the pathway. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, MD did not abolish TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of IκBα and P65 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Using confocal microscopy, we found that MD did not block nuclear translocation of the P65 protein in response to TNF-α stimulation, which was consistent with the western blot results (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Therefore, MD had no effect on the NF-κB signalling pathway. Moreover, the MAPK signalling pathway has also been reported to be involved in the regulation of cytokine production and viral replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], so we also investigated whether this pathway was affected by MD. We found that MD showed no effect on the activation of ERK and AKT, which are critical components of the MAPK pathway (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c, d). Thus, all these data show that MD exhibits anti-HSV-1 activity independent of the cellular NF-κB and MAPK pathways.
