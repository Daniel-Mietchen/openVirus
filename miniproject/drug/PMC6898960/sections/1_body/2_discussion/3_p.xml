<p id="Par20">It has been reported that MD has antitumour effects, especially against lymphoma, breast cancer and prostate cancer, by targeting DNA topoisomerase II [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, its anti-HSV-1 effect has not been reported. In our study, we found that MD suppressed HSV-1-induced toxicity at 3.13 μM and had no obvious cytotoxicity to cells at this concentration. Further experiments demonstrated that MD suppressed GFP-tagged HSV-1 replication and viral titers in host cells. We tested our hypothesis, that MD shows antiviral activity against HSV-1 by inhibiting the expression levels of viral proteins. We found that the expression levels of viral genes, including ICP6 and gB, were significantly suppressed by western blot analysis. Therefore, we found that MD blocked HSV-1-induced toxicity and suppressed viral protein synthesis. Given that MD can interact with topoisomerase II to regulate DNA synthesis, examination of whether MD reduces the expression level of viral genes by directly binding topoisomerase II is a promising direction to evaluate the possible mechanism of antiviral efficacy of MD in the future.
