<p id="Par10">Mature HSV-1 contains a large DNA genome core enveloped by a protein capsid. The middle layer is referred to as tegument, which is composed of viral proteins and mRNA. The outer layer is surrounded by the glycoproteins gB, gC and gD, all of which are necessary for viral entry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Once the HSV-1 virus enters the cytoplasm of the infected cell, its genome is released into the cell nucleus and encodes several gene products that enable viral replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Viral gene expression is strictly regulated in a cascade fashion. Immediate early genes, early genes and late genes are expressed successively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The immediate early genes include 
 <italic>ICP0, ICP4, ICP22, ICP27</italic> and 
 <italic>ICP47</italic>, whose products are required to initiate and regulate the efficient expression of early genes and late genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. For example, ICP0 mediates the degradation of several cellular proteins and induces the conjugation of ubiquitin. Mutation of 
 <italic>ICP4</italic> or 
 <italic>ICP27</italic> significantly blocked the expression of early and late viral genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Regulated by the immediate early genes, early genes are expressed approximately 2–8 h after infection. Most early genes are involved in viral replication. As the infection progresses the late genes begin to be expressed, and the products of late genes are structural proteins whose expression also depends on immediate early genes. Some HSV-1 viral proteins are known to be necessary for viral DNA synthesis and include proteins encoded by the 
 <italic>UL5, UL8, UL29, UL30, UL42</italic> and 
 <italic>UL52</italic> genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. For example, UL9 helps to unwind the DNA strain by flanking the origins of DNA replication. UL30 and UL42 are two subunits of the DNA polymerase, so losing one of these proteins impedes the elongation of viral DNA chains.
