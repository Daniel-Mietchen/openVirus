<p id="para0001">A movement to reposition drugs has been initiated in recent years 
 <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In this strategy, it is important to use drugs that have been proven to be harmless and whose pharmacokinetics and optimal dosage are well known. In the current episode of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emergence 
 <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, we find a spectacular example of possible repositioning of drugs, particularly chloroquine. We had 20 years ago proposed to systematically test chloroquine in viral infections because it had been shown to be effective
