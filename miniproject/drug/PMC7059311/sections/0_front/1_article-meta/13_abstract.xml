  <title>Background</title>
  <p id="Par1">Few data are available regarding the use of direct antiviral agents (DAAs) for chronic hepatitis C in psychiatric patients. The aim of the study is to assess safety and outcome of DAAs in patients with psychiatric comorbidities.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2">This retrospective, observational, single-centre study enrolled patients treated with psychiatric drugs who initiated DAAs between 2015 and 2018. Patients were classified into two groups: A (on anxiolitycs/antidepressant) and B (on antipsychotics). Week-12 sustained virological response (SVR-12) and adverse events (AEs) were evaluated.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par3">One hundred forty-four patients were included (A:101; B:43). Patients were 49.3% males, mean age 60 years (SD ± 13.5); 31.9% cirrhotic; 125 (86.8%) HCV-monoinfected and 19 (13.2%) HCV /HIV-coinfected. Twenty patients (13.8%) required a change of psychiatric therapy before initiation of DAA. Overall, SVR-12 was achieved in 88.2% of subjects in intention-to-treat(ITT)-analysis. Lower SVR rates were observed in group B vs A (79% vs 92%, 
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.045) and in those changing psychiatric drugs vs others (8% vs 30%, 
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.015). According to per-protocol (PP)-analysis, SVR-12 was achieved in 93/95 (97.9%) in group A versus 34/36 (94.4%) in group B (
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.30). At least one AE occurred in 60 patients (41.6%), including 10 severe AEs, leading to 3 discontinuations. AEs were more frequently reported in group A (
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.015).

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p id="Par4">The study confirms effectiveness and safety of DAA-based treatment also in this special population, even if a careful evaluation of history and drug-drug interactions is warranted.</p>
