<p id="Par79">Moreover, one of our main concerns before starting DAAs and during the course of treatment was the need of an adjustment or modification of the baseline psychiatric co-medication, which was prescribed in over 13.8% of our patients, in agreement with psychiatrists. In fact, changes in psychiatric treatment before DAA-initiation seemed to play a role in treatment failure as it was associated with a higher number of lost to follow-up patients. The lack of a self-rated questionnaire evaluated after the completion of anti-HCV treatment failed to prove whether lost to follow-up patients was due to an underlying psychiatric disorder or other causes (poor medical awareness, doctor-patient relationship). Mostly, psychiatric drugs modifications were adopted among patients in treatment with antipsychotics (up to 19% of cases); the majority of DAAs and antipsychotics shared a same major hepatic landmark in which both were CYP activators or substrates, leading to an increased/decreased exposure to the other drug. Fortunately, the wide availability of new DAA-regimens has nowadays reduced the need of mandatory therapeutic changes. Therefore, our study suggests that in these cases caution is warranted, considering the risk of altering a previous stable mental condition, and a long period of patient monitoring before starting DAAs is desirable. On the contrary, changes should be avoided if not strictly required.</p>
