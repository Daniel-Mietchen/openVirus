<p id="Par77">The coexistence of HCV-infection with cognitive disorders is well known, based on studies demonstrating the entrance of HCV in CNS as well as the higher exposure to HCV-infection in patients with psychiatric comorbidities due to more frequent risk behaviors compared to the general population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, if depression and/or anxiety have been reported in about a third of HCV-infected patients according to different studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], the prevalence of psychotic disorders (such as schizophrenia, delirious disorder) among HCV infected subjects is not well established, but is estimated about 4% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In our analysis, the overall proportion of HCV-infected patients with psychiatric comorbidity who underwent antiviral therapy was lower than in the above mentioned studies (about 12%), even if restricted inclusion criteria were used, as only patients under a psychiatric treatment were considered eligible.
