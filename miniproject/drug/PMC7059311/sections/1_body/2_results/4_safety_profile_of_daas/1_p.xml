Patients receiving RBV more frequently showed AEs during treatment in comparison with subjects treated with RBV-sparing regimens. Erythropoietin use and a RBV dose reduction were reported in 2 (1.3%) and 4 (2.7%) patients, respectively. No statistically significant differences in terms of occurrence of AEs were observed between the two groups. Psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety episodes and mood disorders were reported only among group A patients.
