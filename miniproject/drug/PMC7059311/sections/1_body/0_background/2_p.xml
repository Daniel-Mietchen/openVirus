The recent introduction of IFN-free therapeutic regimens based on direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) has revolutionized HCV therapy and viral cure associated with improved quality of life is now a reality in the vast majority of patients. The last therapeutic regimens approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) are pangenotypic, once-daily, all-oral DAA combinations that have the potential to close the gaps in the current DAA treatment portfolio. Eight-twelve weeks of treatment is now the standard of care and viral eradication can be achieved in &gt; 95% across different patient populations [
