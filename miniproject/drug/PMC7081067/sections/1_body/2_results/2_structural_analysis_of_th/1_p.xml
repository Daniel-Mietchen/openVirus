<p>The SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 proteins exhibit 96 % sequence identity to each other (Figure 1
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">(Fig. 1)</xref>). Figure 2
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">(Fig. 2)</xref> shows the 3D representation for Bat-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 main proteases and indeed, very similar structures were observed, particularly when comparing SARS-CoV proteases, although very different to the one of HIV-1. Interestingly the SARS-CoV-2 protease shares 21/29 amino acids involved in the drug interaction with SARS-CoV protease, while this later exhibits only 21 amino acids involved in this interaction (Figure 3
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">(Fig. 3)</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 protease has an active site with a surface accessible to solvent of 356Å and SARS-CoV only 256 Å (Figure 3
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">(Fig. 3)</xref>).
