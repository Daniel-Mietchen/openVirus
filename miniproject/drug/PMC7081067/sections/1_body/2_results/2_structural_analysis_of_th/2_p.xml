 <italic>n silico </italic>data demonstrated that the different protease inhibitors, used against HIV-1, could interact with the active site of SARS-CoV-2 protease producing an interaction with a binding energy lower than -6.9 Kcal/mol. However, the compound that produced the strongest interaction with the active site was saquinavir, with a binding energy of -9.6 Kcal/mol (Table 1
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T1">(Tab. 1)</xref>). Binding energy of SARS-CoV-2 main protease to Saquinavir (SQV) and LPV were slightly higher, but similar, to the one of HIV-1 protease (Table 1
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T1">(Tab. 1)</xref>). The interaction of LPV, SQV and RTV with the SARS-CoV-2 main protease is shown in Figure 4
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">(Fig. 4)</xref>, the different amino-acids involved in the interaction with all these drugs are also shown.
