<p>In order to contribute with further studies related to developing more effective drugs, in this work was evaluated a broad library of protease inhibitors available in the ZINC database (over 100 compounds) and PubChem (over 200 compounds). After molecular docking, compounds were prioritized based on binding energies. The top 20 compounds were clustered using a hierarchical matrix and represented into a heat map (Figure 5
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">(Fig. 5)</xref>). These compounds could be clustered into three big groups based on their chemical structures. Also, the binding energies and chemical motives for each compound are shown in Table 2
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T2">(Tab. 2)</xref>. Interestingly, in the output of this virtual screening at least 5 compounds, representatives of these chemical clusters with binding energy around -8.2 Kcal/mol, were obtained. These scaffolds could be used as leading compounds to further chemical optimization to develop more potent inhibitors. The structure and main ADME parameters for each inhibitor are shown in Figure 6
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">(Fig. 6)</xref>, in general the 5 compounds shown, have physicochemical parameters under the expected values for a good drug.
