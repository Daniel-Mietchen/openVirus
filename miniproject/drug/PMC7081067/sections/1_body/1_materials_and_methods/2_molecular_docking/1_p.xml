<p>The coordinates for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 main proteases were obtained from the protein data bank, PDB code 1UJ1/2GX4 and 6LU7 respectively. Also, HIV-1 protease bounded to lopinavir under PDB code 1MIU and Bat HKU4 coronavirus PDB code 2YNB were evaluated. The PDB files to be used under further computational analysis were optimized by removing co-crystallized molecules and all crystallographic water molecules. Hydrogens were added and partial charges were assigned to all atoms. The obtained PDB files for each protein were further submitted to restrained molecular mechanics refinement. All molecular dynamics simulations described in this study were performed with NAMD 2.12 (Phillips et al., 2005[
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]), Vega ZZ 3.1.0.21 (Pedretti et al., 2004[
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; Vanommeslaeghe et al., 2010[
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]) as described in Ortega et al. (2019[
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]). Following, structural analysis of the binding pocket was developed by using CASTp 3.0 software using the http://sts.bioe.uic.edu/castp/ server. The ligand-binding pocket located in the catalytic site was obtained manually and then verified by a priori docking approach with lopinavir by using the Achilles Blind Docking server (SÃ¡nchez-Linares et al., 2012[
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). The 3D structure of each inhibitor was obtained from PubChem. Also, public libraries for protease inhibitors were obtained from PubChem and ZINC databases. Molecular docking was performed with VINA/VegaZZ 3.1.0.21 and 30 runs conducted for each compound. The results were prioritized according to the predicted binding energy in kcal/mol. The results obtained from the docking simulation were visualized with the Biovia Discovery Studio Visualizer 17.2.0 software.
