<p>In addition, to contribute to further development of antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2, in this work experimental compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 protease were evaluated by virtual screening. Some compounds showed comparable binding energy values to the SARS-CoV-2 protease than to those observed for SQV, LPV and RTV. ADME (for Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) parameters estimation for new drugs, significantly helps to reduce the pharmacokinetics-related failure in clinical phases. These results evidence that these compounds could be suitable for further medicinal chemistry optimization to produce the second generation of inhibitors more specific and potent against SARS-CoV-2.</p>
