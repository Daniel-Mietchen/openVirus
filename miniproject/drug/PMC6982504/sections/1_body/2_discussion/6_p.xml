<p>In the retrospective analysis, there were no significant differences between CMV‐induced thrombocytopenia and CMV‐related secondary ITP in terms of age, sex, and platelet count at diagnosis.
 <xref rid="ccr32581-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> Interestingly, antiviral therapy was required in 8 of the 23 patients with CMV‐induced thrombocytopenia, while no patients with CMV‐related secondary ITP required antiviral therapy. Furthermore, some patients with CMV‐induced thrombocytopenia showed complicated clinical courses such as refractory or chronic courses, compared with CMV‐related secondary ITP. The data of bone marrow examination did not give new knowledge about CMV‐induced thrombocytopenia and CMV‐related secondary ITP, because a few patients underwent bone marrow examination.
