<p>Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT) is the most common cause of severe thrombocytopenia in newborns.
 <xref rid="ccr32581-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> Typical patients with NAIT develop petechiae within minutes of birth, followed by ecchymosis and cephalohematoma.
 <xref rid="ccr32581-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> After delivery, the greatest risk of hemorrhage is in the first 96 hours of life. Thrombocytopenia in patients with NAIT resolves naturally within 1‐2 weeks after birth.
 <xref rid="ccr32581-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> Because there were also no hemorrhagic episodes in his perinatal period, we judged that there was no association between thrombocytopenia and NAIT in this case, although anti‐human platelet antigen alloantibodies were not tested.
