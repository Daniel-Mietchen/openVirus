<p>In a 38‐day‐old infant, either congenital or acquired CMV infection can occur. Thrombocytopenia often occurs in patients with congenital CMV infection.

 <xref rid="ccr32581-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> indicating acquired CMV infection. The detection of CMV‐DNA in the dried umbilical cord is useful to prove congenital CMV infection.
 <xref rid="ccr32581-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> In preterm babies, acquired CMV infection can occur through breast milk because of the low level of anti‐CMV antibodies transmitted via the placenta.
 <xref rid="ccr32581-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> Because the status of maternal CMV infection was not evaluated, the infection route of CMV remained to be determined in our case. CDC recommends that congenital CMV infection should be diagnosed based on the presence of CMV‐DNA in the urine, saliva, or blood, within 3 weeks after birth. Infection cannot be diagnosed using tests that detect antibodies to CMV.
 <xref rid="ccr32581-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> Moreover, congenital CMV infection cannot be diagnosed using samples collected more than three weeks after birth because testing after this time cannot distinguish between a congenital infection and an infection acquired during or after delivery.
 <xref rid="ccr32581-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> In our case, we could not access other samples within 3 weeks after his birth to detect congenital CMV infection and the possibility of false‐negative results of CMV in the dried umbilical cord cannot thus be ruled out. Therefore, we could not rule out congenital CMV infection completely.
