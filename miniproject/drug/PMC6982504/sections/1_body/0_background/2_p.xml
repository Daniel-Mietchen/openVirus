<p>Most cases of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection are asymptomatic or self‐limited in immunocompetent patients. However, CMV infection occasionally induces severe thrombocytopenia.

 <xref rid="ccr32581-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia due to the inhibition of platelet production and destruction of existing platelets.
