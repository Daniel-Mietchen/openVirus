<p>The hostâ€™s cellular metabolism provides the necessary energy (ATP), biosynthetic building blocks, and other important molecules required for viral replication. In DENV infection, a major change occurs in the central carbon metabolism, especially in glycolysis, whereby the expression of both glucose transporter I (GLUTI) and hexokinase II (HK-II) is up-regulated and glucose consumption is increased in DENV-infected cells. DENV activates the glycolytic pathway for viral metabolic requirements and life cycles, including energy, replication, and biosynthetic building blocks [

Glucose and glutamine serve as the main carbon sources in healthy cells and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle generates ATP using the oxidation of glucose via glycolysis. However, in some cases, glutamine serves as an ATP generator in the TCA cycle instead of glucose, so that it can be utilized for biosynthetic processes (

As DENV activates the host glycolytic pathway for generating their necessary building blocks, pharmacologic regulation of glycolysis significantly blocks infectious DENV production. Krystal and colleagues reported that glycolysis inhibition through sodium oxamate and 2-deoxy-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose (2DG) treatment can result in a significant reduction in DENV replication [
