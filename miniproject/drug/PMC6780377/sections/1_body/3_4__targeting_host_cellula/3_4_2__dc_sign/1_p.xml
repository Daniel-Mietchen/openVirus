<p>DC (dendritic cell) is a cell surface attachment factor present in every tissue [
 <xref rid="B88-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. It is known as Cluster of Differentiation 209 (CD209) and was found to regulate DC trafficking and T-cell synapse formation expressed by human immature dendritic cells in the plasma membrane capable of recognizing DENV. It not only recognizes DENV, but also allows its surface transport through the process of endocytosis, resulting in cell infectivity (

 <xref rid="B92-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], many authors posit that DENV is handed over to another unidentified co-receptor for movement throughout the cells [
 <xref rid="B90-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Findings yielded by a large number of studies indicate that DENV can recognize cell surface DC-SIGN, as well as move into the plasma membrane through various co-receptors. For example, HIV co-receptor CCR5 allows viral attachment, resulting in entry into the cell [

 <xref rid="B22-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], receptors that mediate DC-SIGN are potential targets for DENV antiviral treatment. Several compounds, such as glycomimetic DC-SIGN ligand and plant lectins from

These findings can potentially be utilized in novel strategies aimed at enhancing the efficiency of a wide spectrum of antiviral therapies to block DENV virus uptake.
