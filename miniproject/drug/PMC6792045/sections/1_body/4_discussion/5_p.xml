<p>Anti-CVA4 serum could alleviate the early clinical symptoms of the neonatal mice and the surviving animals fully recovered. However, it had no therapeutic effect on late-stage infected neonatal mice, which may be because the late illness onset of the neonatal mice (≥3 dpi) had irreversible systemic inflammatory responses and/or established nervous system damage. Similarly, severe cases of HFMD caused by EVA71 infection usually progress rapidly. Although the proportion of critically ill patients with EVs infection is ≤1.1%, the number of annual cases exceeds one million in China [
