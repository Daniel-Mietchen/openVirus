<p>The infection model provides a foundation for the evaluation of the efficacy of novel antiviral and vaccine candidates. EVA71 vaccines have been successfully developed employing mouse [

 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] models. Similarly, based on animal models, CVA16, CVA6 and CVA10 vaccines are currently under development [

 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Due to the significant increase in the incidence of CVA4-associated HFMD infections worldwide in recent years [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], it is urgently required to establish a CVA4 infection model for evaluation of both inactivated and attenuated live CVA4 vaccines and for the screening of existing and novel antiviral drugs. In this study, we found inoculation of CVA4 by the i.m. route caused the most rapid onset of illness in the neonatal ICR mice, which we hypothesize may be attributable to the pronounced tropism and elevated replication of CVA4 in muscle tissue and the subsequent systemic dissemination of the virus through the circulatory system. Neonatal mice (â‰¤ 3 d) were most susceptible to CVA4 and showed high mortality rates. By optimizing these factors, a CVA4 infection model with high levels of repeatability for clinical scores, disease onset and duration of illness was established.
