<p>Human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells were kindly provided by the Shandong Center for Disease Control and Prevention. RD cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Invitrogen, USA). The RD cells inoculated with the CVA4 YT226R strain showed obvious cytopathic effects (CPE) after 24 h. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the strain belonged to the D2 genotype (Figure S1). After the virus supernatant was centrifuged and filtered through a 0.22 μm filter (Pall Corporation, Germany), CVA4 titre was quantified by the Reed-Muench method [
