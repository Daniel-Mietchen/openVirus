<p>In order to establish the CVA4 infection model, the optimal challenge dose was first experimentally determined, and the 3-day-old neonatal mice were inoculated with the YT226R strain prepared by a serial 10-fold dilutions with MEM (10
 <sup>7.0</sup>-10
 <sup>3.0</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mouse). In order to obtain the optimal age of the mice for infection, 1-, 3-, 7- and 9-day-old neonatal mice were selected, and 10
 <sup>4.0</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mouse of YT226R was inoculated via the intramuscular (i.m.) route. In order to obtain the optimal infection route, 3-day-old neonatal mice were inoculated with 10
 <sup>4.0</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mouse YT226R via the i.m., intraperitoneal (i.p.) or intracoelomic (i.c.) routes, respectively. Three-day-old neonatal mice in the negative control group were inoculated with the same volume of MEM via the i.m. route. After the neonatal mice were infected, the body-weight changes, clinical scores, and survival rates were observed and recorded daily. The clinical scores were based on the following criteria[
