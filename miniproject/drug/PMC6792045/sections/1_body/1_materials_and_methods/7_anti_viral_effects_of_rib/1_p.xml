<p>RD cells with a confluency of 80-90% in 96-well plates were inoculated with 10
 <sup>2.0</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> YT226R for 1 h. Ribavirin (20 μg) and IL-1β (1250 U), IL-6 (12.5 U), IFN-λ1 (125 ng), IFN-γ (25 U) and IFN-α2a (125 U) were added to the cells. CPE was observed at 16, 24, 32, 40 and 48 h after viral inoculation. The inhibition rate of CVA4 replication between 8 and 48 h post infection (hpi) was detected with the CCK8 kit (Solarbio Science &amp; Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). The viral load was determined by qRT-PCR.
