<p>The 3-day-old neonatal mice were challenged with 100 LD
 <sub>50</sub> of YT226R. Between 1 and 7 dpi, peripheral blood (PB) was collected from the infected group and the negative-control group randomly selected from the neonatal mice after anaesthesia. The serum was separated after PB coagulation. The concentration of IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α in the serum was determined with individual mouse ELISA detection kits (Multisciences Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China). Briefly, the serum was mixed with diluted antibody and then horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin and the chromogenic substrate TMB were added sequentially, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Optical density values at 450 and 630 nm were measured using a microplate reader and the cytokine concentration calculated by a linear equation. The theoretical limit of detection is 1.74 pg/mL (IFN-γ), 0.22 pg/mL (IL-4); 1.17 pg/mL (IL-6), 1.17 pg/mL (IL-10) and 1.63 pg/mL (TNF-α).
