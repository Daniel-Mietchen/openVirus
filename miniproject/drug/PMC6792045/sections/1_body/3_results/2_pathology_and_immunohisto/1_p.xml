<p>The 3-day-old neonatal mice were challenged with a lethal dose of the CVA4 YT226R strain (100 LD
 <sub>50</sub>) via i.m. administration. When the clinical scores of the neonatal mice reached 4, the animals were euthanized and the tissues were surgically removed, sectioned and HE staining was performed. Pathological examination showed a significantly widened alveolar space, vasodilatation, hyperaemia, and interstitial oedema with large numbers of a predominantly monocyte-based inflammatory cell infiltrate (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>(A)). The hind limb muscles and spinal muscles were severely affected, and both showed muscle fibre necrosis and muscle bundle rupture (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>(B,C)). In the late stage of infection, large numbers of a diffuse lymphocytic and mononuclear cell infiltrate were evident and associated with myocardial rupture (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>(D)). There were no obvious pathological changes in the tissues of the negative control group (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>(E–H)), indicating that CVA4 infection can cause severe pathology, tissue lesions and inflammatory reactions. In the Immunohistochemistry (IHC) experiments, the viral antigen of CVA4 was detected in hind limb muscle (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>(I)), spine muscle (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>(J)) and brain (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure. 2</xref>(K)) of neonatal mice, but not in intestine (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>(L)), which may be related to the route of infection. There was no antigen detected in the negative control groups (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>(M–P)).
