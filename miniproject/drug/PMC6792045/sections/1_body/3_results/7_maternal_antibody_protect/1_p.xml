<p>Six-week-old adult females were immunized twice with the inactivated CVA4 whole-virus vaccine supplemented with an aluminium hydroxide adjuvant. After delivery, the pups were administered with lethal doses of homologous or heterologous CVA4 strains and other EVs: CVA6, CVA16 and EVA71 on postnatal day 3, respectively. It was found that the weight gain of the YT226R (CVA4) group was normal during the observation period without obvious symptoms. The survival rate was 100%, and the maternal antibody could prevent the infection of the CVA4 heterologous strains, including H337, LY124R, and LC16114 (see Figure S2 in the supplemental material). However, the symptoms of the CVA16, EVA71, and CVA6-infected mice were severe, and all mice died by 6, 7, and 8â€…dpi, respectively. The weight gain in the CVA16, EVA71, and CVA6 treated groups was significantly decreased (

In summary, the CVA4 vaccine could induce humoral immune responses in adult females, and the maternal antibody could provide 100% protection against homologous and heterologous CVA4 challenge; however, there was no cross-protective effects elicited by the CVA4 immune response to afford protection to CVA16, EVA71 and CVA6
