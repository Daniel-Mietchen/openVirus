<p>Coxsackievirus A4 (CVA4) belongs to the family 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> of linear, non-enveloped, positive polarity single-stranded RNA viruses, which principally cause herpangina and hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in children [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Prior to 2009, viral pathogens associated with HFMD included enterovirus A71 (EVA71) and CVA16; however, in recent years, other types of enteroviruses (EVs), such as CVA4, CVA6 and CVA10 have increased in prevalence [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2–3</xref>]. Numerous outbreaks of CVA4 have occurred during recent years in different regions in China, such as Fujian [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], Shandong [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], Sichuan [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], Yunnan [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and Jiangsu [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Other countries, such as Thailand [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], Australia [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Italy [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] have also reported CVA4 infections. Genetic recombination between CVA4 and other EVs has been described generating novel emerging strains which may be associated with more severe disease [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although the majority of CVA4 and EV infections are usually subclinical, these agents are highly contagious and exhibit a broad spectrum of disease presentation in symptomatic cases ranging from mild symptoms such as erythematous maculopapular exanthema [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] to severe outcomes such as aseptic meningitis, myocarditis and acute flaccid paralysis [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Given the increased frequency of CVA4 circulation globally [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], evidence for complex spatiotemporal dynamics in Asia-Europe [
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and the emergence of novel CVA recombinants with the potential to spread rapidly in immunologically naïve populations [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], greater focus is required both on surveillance and also the development of prophylactic and therapeutic approaches.
