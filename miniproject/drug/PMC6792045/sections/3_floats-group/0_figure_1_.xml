  <p>Establishment of the CVA4 infection model. The CVA4 infection ICR mouse model was established by optimizing three factors: challenge dose, challenge route and mouse age. The body weights (A, B, and C), clinical scores (D, E and F), and survival rates (G, H and I) in each group of neonatal mice (
   <italic>n </italic>= 10–15) were measured. The LD
   <sub>50</sub> was calculated as 10
   <sup>2.0</sup> TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/mouse. *
