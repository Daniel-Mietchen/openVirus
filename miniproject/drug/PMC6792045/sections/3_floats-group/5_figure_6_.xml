  <p>Anti-CVA4 effects of ribavirin and cytokines 
   <italic>in vivo</italic>. One hour after the 3-day-old neonatal mice (
   <italic>n </italic>= 10–15) were challenged with YT226R, ribavirin and different cytokines were administered for the first time. Ribavirin and the cytokines were re-administered at 24 hpi. The body weights (A) and clinical scores (B) and survival rates (C) of the neonatal mice were measured.
