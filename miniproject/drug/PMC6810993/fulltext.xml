The randomized clinical trial compares the effectiveness of Accessible Care (low-threshold care in a syringe service program located in New York City) with Usual Care (referral to existing services) in facilitating linkage, engagement, and retention in HCV care. Eligible participants were HCV RNA positive and had injected drugs in the past 90 days. We compared the percentage of participants in each arm linked to HCV care (defined as one visit with HCV treatment provider), and initiated direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment within 6 months of enrollment.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Results</title><p>Among the 65 participants, the mean age is 41.2 years; 28% are females; 73% homeless; 6% black, 51% Latina/o and 39% white. 82% of participants had injected drugs in the last 30 days, with an average of 13.2 injections/month (median 10). Nearly all participants had health insurance, 88% public insurance, 6% uninsured. Thirty-two participants were randomized to the Accessible Care arm. Within 6 months of enrollment 79% of the Accessible Care arm and 25% of the Usual Care arm had linked to HCV care, and 69% and 13% had been started on DAA therapy, respectively. Of the 26 participants in the Accessible Care arm started on DAA therapy, the median time from enrollment to treatment initiation was 87.5 days [range 22&#x02013;180].</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Among HCV-infected PWID enrolled at a syringe service program, higher rates of linkage to care and treatment initiation were seen in the Accessible Care arm where stigma- and shame-free treatment was located within a community-based location.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Disclosures</title><p>
