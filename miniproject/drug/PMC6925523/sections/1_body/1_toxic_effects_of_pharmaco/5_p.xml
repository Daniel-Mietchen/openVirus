<p>Genetics also influences susceptibility to mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunction. For example, the mtDNA genetic variant at 16 189 from T to C has been associated with increased oxidative damage, altered antioxidant status and onset of type two diabetes [

 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Furthermore, different mtDNA haplogroups have been increasingly associated with individual susceptibility to toxic side effects observed in some patients [

 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Haplogroups, distinct patterns in single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in mtDNA, naturally arise from human evolution and have been shown to result in different bioenergetic capacities, ROS production and apoptotic capabilities [

With these different haplogroups influencing mitochondrial function, it has since been shown that specific haplogroups increase susceptibility to toxic side effects of drug use; for example, the 4917G allele in patients with haplogroup T and the subhaplo group L02a are associated with NRTI-induced peripheral neuropathy [

 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The accumulation of SNPs in mtDNA, combined with the use of drugs that affect mitochondrial function, is therefore a major determinant in the development of idiosyncratic drug-induced adverse effects [
