<p>Mitochondrial toxicity is also associated with other drug classes with responses being significantly influenced by patient–patient variability in mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial toxicity is also associated with other drug classes, with the effects being significantly influenced by differences in mitochondrial function caused by patient–patient variability. Patients with diagnosed mitochondrial disorders, in particular those carrying A1555G and C1494T mutations in human mitochondrial 12S rRNA, are acutely sensitive to aminoglycoside antibiotics, which can result in deafness [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Age-related deafness (presbyacusis) is extremely common in western societies affecting half of all people over 75 years of age. An impact on mitochondrial function by many common medications on age-related deafness cannot be ruled out [

Statins which lower lipid levels, illness and mortality for individuals at high risk have become the most commonly prescribed drug class in the world. However, like other drugs, these are also associated with mitochondrial toxicity [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Recent studies have shown the presence of mitochondrial-induced myopathies brought on through reduced respiratory enzyme activity, calcium leakage and ROS-induced oxidative stress in patients being treated with statins [

The reported incidence varies between 5% and 30% with the milder disease being more common than the very rare rhabdomyolysis reported at 1 in 10 000 patients. Chemotherapeutic agents are renowned for adverse side effects. Drugs must be potent in order to combat the highly resistant cancer cells; however, many chemotherapy agents cause the generation of excessive ROS, which results in oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Although this affect limits the efficacious potential of these agents, mitochondrial signalling pathways associated with ROS are essential for cellular function and are linked to various processes including the activity of phosphatases [

 <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>, reduced glucose availability leads to increase mitochondrial respiration and mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) production that actually delays worm aging [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Control over mtROS signalling is an exciting new area of research which presents opportunities to regulate appetite and food intake by the actions of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) in the brain (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]). UCP2 likely controls mtROS indirectly via alteration of mitochondrial fuel utilization [

 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Pharmacological regulation of mtROS will be an important area in the future with opportunities to regulate many cellular pathways including wound healing [
