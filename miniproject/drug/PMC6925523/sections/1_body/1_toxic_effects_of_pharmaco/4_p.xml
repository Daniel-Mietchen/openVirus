<p>Patient-to-patient variation in treatment benefits and adverse toxicity is potentially linked to the variation in mitochondrial function found between individuals and declines with aging as it is also influenced by cell type, gender, state of immunity, and number and severity of pathogenic infections [

 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Mitochondria become larger, less numerous and less efficient with age as continuous ROS-associated protein, lipid and nucleic acid damage result in an increase in mitochondrial dysfunction over time [

 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The result of this decline is a decreased ability to remove damaged mitochondria and ultimately leads to the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria [
