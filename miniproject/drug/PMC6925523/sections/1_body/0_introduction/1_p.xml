<p>Mitochondria are intracellular membrane-bound organelles that act as the cells ‘powerhouse’ due to their principal function in synthesizing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) required for a multitude of processes and reactions. This is achieved through the coupling of electron transport and the creation of an electrochemical gradient to the synthesis of ATP. The gradient is created by the translocation of protons across the inner membrane to the intermembrane space by three unique oxidoreductases [
