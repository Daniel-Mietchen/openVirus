<p>A diverse range of mitochondrial functions have been identified in addition to their crucial role in aerobic respiration and ATP production. Mitochondria dictate cell survival and death via opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and play a crucial role in calcium homeostasis and buffering [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, mitochondria have been found to be key players in steroid and hormone signalling, energy sensing, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cofactor synthesis [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The biosynthesis of critical cofactors is an important role of the organelle including the highly eukaryotic-conserved, formation of iron–sulfur clusters and the biosynthesis of haeme, biotin and lipoic acid [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. More recently, it has emerged that mitochondria serve as key immune regulators, shaping both beneficial and detrimental immune responses during pathogen infection, inflammatory diseases, cancer and aging [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This pivotal role in cell biology explains the severe and multisystem clinical symptoms which occur as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction and highlights the need for increased research on the role of mitochondria in health and disease. To maintain integrity, mitochondria are under strict quality control measures involving fission/fusion [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], mitophagy and proteasomal degradation, which can selectively remove both damaged proteins and dysfunctional mitochondria [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Mitophagy is particularly important in differentiated cells where attempts at modulating it are being explored in order to enhance removal or turnover of damaged mitochondria associated with disease or aging [

 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].
