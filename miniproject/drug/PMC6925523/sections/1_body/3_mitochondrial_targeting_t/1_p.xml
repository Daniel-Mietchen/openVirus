<p>In 2018, 17 million new cases of cancer were reported worldwide with 9.6 million deaths from the disease [

Otto Warburg was the first to suggest mitochondrial involvement in the disease upon the observation that malignant cells have elevated uptake of glucose, which undergoes fermentation to lactate even in the presence of oxygen. This indicates a metabolic switch from OXPHOS to aerobic glycolysis, later named the ‘Warburg effect’ [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], and fuelled the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction was the cause of tumour progression. Positron-emission tomography imaging, which monitors tumour glucose utilization, is the main clinical approach to determine in a non-invasive manner, treatment effectiveness and tumour recurrence [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The glucose signature was believed to reflect the glycolytic nature of the tumour; however, recent evidence suggests that this may not be the case, as functional mitochondria are essential for malignant cell survival and oncogenesis [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. This was highlighted by reduced tumour growth and progression in mice when cancer cells are made mtDNA deficient (ρ0) or when the mtDNA transcription factor A is knocked out causing mtDNA depletion [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Other data suggest that mtDNA mutations in cancer are not linked to the development or spread and that cancer cells require the presence of active mitochondria to survive [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Targeting cancer mitochondrial function is an exciting area with new drugs identified and several drugs (Metformin; IM156 Immuniomet; IACS10759 MD Anderson CC; AG-636 Agios; CPI-839; CB-839 Calithera) currently being tested in clinical trials across a wide range of tumour types [

 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Mitochondrial targeted drugs are presently being explored in combination with chemotherapy [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>,
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] and radiotherapy [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. These combinatorial studies will most likely extend to immunomodulatory agents in the near future.
