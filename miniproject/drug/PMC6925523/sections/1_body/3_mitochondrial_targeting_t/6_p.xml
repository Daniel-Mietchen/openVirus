<p>In summary, many mitochondrial-specific, drug-induced adverse effects have proved useful in reducing tumour growth and sensitizing tumour cells to standard of care therapies. This is due to modulation of mitochondrial metabolism, induction of ROS-mediated apoptosis and regulation of the mitochondrial-induced cell death pathways through mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and mitochondrial permeability transition. Therapeutic selectivity remains a main concern when using drugs with mitochondrial toxicity as they have the potential to induce severe and unpleasant clinical symptoms if healthy cells are affected.</p>
