<p>An increasing number of studies addressing the phenomenon of cancer cell and metabolic-reprogramming conclude the essential nature of the switching for both cell survival and resistance to anticancer therapies [

 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. These bioenergetic adaptations depend greatly on mitochondrial function. Complex I's role in the glycolytic switch is one example as it has been found to be essential in several tumour types [
