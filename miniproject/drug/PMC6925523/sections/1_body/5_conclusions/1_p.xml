<p>Much of the evidence to date indicates that a variety of drugs, particularly antivirals and chemotherapy agents, are capable of inducing mitochondrial dysfunction through mtDNA depletion, increased ROS production and uncoupled OXPHOS [

Mitochondrial dysfunction results from off-target effects from these drugs rather than being the main mode of action; however, we have shown that modulating mitochondrial function could be beneficial in the treatment of a variety of diseases such as cancer, diabetes and chronic viral infection. This can be achieved through alterations in mtDNA biogenesis, metabolic rewiring and up-regulation of the immune system. The great challenge to achieve beneficial effects will selectivity and how to maintain mitochondrial outputs in normal healthy tissue while modulating mitochondrial function, or pathogen levels in target tissues.
