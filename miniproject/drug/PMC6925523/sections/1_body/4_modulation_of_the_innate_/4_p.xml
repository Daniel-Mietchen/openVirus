<p>As just described, recent studies have revealed an important role for mitochondria in the immune response. There is much to understand in this emerging field as the specific functional role that mitochondria assume is immune cell specific. Because these roles manifest themselves through different forms such as enhanced/reduced ROS or altered mtDNA copy number-modulation of mitochondrial morphology, a variety of opportunities are thus presented for drug manipulation of mitochondria. Manipulating mtROS production, for example, has the potential to drive an increased immune response through both increased innate immune signalling and increased release of mtDNA for PRR stimulation. Up-regulating immune activation via altering bioenergetics or increasing mtDNA release/sensing could be beneficial not only in clearing both viral and bacterial infections, but also be effective tools in engaging the immune system to destroy cancer cells. Indeed, several drugs that increase STING activation are being developed or are in clinical trials for cancer therapy. These drugs perhaps may be paired with other chemotherapeutics that cause mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to the increased sensing of mtDNA and other mitochondrial ligands to augment anti-tumour immunity at both the innate and adaptive levels. On the contrary, long-term drug-induced mtDNA depletion has been shown to inhibit interferon and PRR-mediated signalling and therefore can blunt innate immune responses [

Therapeutics that down modulate mitochondrial function in immune cells may be beneficial in diseases where hyper-activation of the immune system causes life-threatening symptoms, such as autoimmunity and sepsis. Thus, future research into compounds that dampen mitochondrial function or improve mitochondrial quality control may yield new therapies for a wide array of immunological and inflammatory disorders.
