<p>Mitochondria also play an important role in the immune response such as during activation of the innate response and through direct stimulation of specific pathways. Pathogen clearance relies heavily on various signalling cascades involved in the maturation, expansion and functioning of immune cells. As these processes require significant amounts of energy, it is not surprising that mitochondria are involved in the innate immune system through their role in cellular bioenergetics and signalling. An important signalling role of mitochondria has already been well established, for example during key steps of apoptosis and autophagy mediated through the generation of ROS and the regulation of calcium [

Mitochondria exert their modulatory effects on the innate immune system primarily through various cell-signalling events, usually activated on the entry of pathogenic RNA, dsDNA and dsRNA into the cell. In addition, a recent paper by Dhir et al. [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>] showed that mitochondrial derived dsRNA can induce antiviral signalling by triggering a type I interferon response. In both the innate and adaptive immune systems, rewiring of mitochondrial function is required for optimal function of both phagocytic cells and lymphocytes. Indeed, naive T-cells must switch from a metabolically quiescent to a metabolically active state in order to become fully activated. This increased metabolic activity is achieved through enhanced mitochondrial metabolism and indicates that the important role the organelle plays in the immune response [
