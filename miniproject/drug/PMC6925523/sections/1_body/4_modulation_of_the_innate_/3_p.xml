<p>The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is also a key pathway in mtDNA-dependent immune responses. Oxidized mtDNA is able to directly bind to the inflammasome to induce IL-1β production [

 <italic>in vitro</italic> as rotenone and antimycin A treatments produced both increased mtROS levels and NLRP3 inflammasome activity [

 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. The activation of the inflammasome causes cleavage-mediated release of caspase-1 from procaspase-1 resulting in the activation of IL-1B and IL-18, which contribute to an increased pro-inflammatory response. Induction of mild-to-moderate mitochondrial dysfunction through drug therapy could increase cytosolic mtDNA and ROS production from impaired ETC function. These changes could potentially enhance the activation of TLR9, STING and NLRP3 inflammasome-regulated pathways causing increased inflammatory responses and potentially more efficient pathogen and infection clearance. However, care must be taken if using drug therapy to enhance an immune response as there exist a chance of initiating a pro-inflammatory state.
