  <title>Oxygen consumption of Ewing sarcoma in the presence of Bithionol or Meclizine.</title>
  <p>Ewing sarcoma cell lines TC71 and A673 were seeded at 50k cells/well (with and without treatment) in an oil-layered sealed system under varying glucose levels. Fluorescence lifetime was monitored using an oxygen sensing probe (MitoXpress Xtra, Agilent [
