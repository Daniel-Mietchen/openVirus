Background</div> <p id="Par1">Commercially available antiviral drugs, when used in the treatment of viral infections, do not always result in success. This is an urgent problem currently that needs to be addressed because several viruses including influenza and paramyxoviruses are acquiring multi-drug resistance. A potential solution for this emerging issue is to create new antiviral drugs from available compounds of natural products. It is known that the majority of drugs have been developed using compounds derived from actinomycetes, which are naturally occurring gram-positive bacteria. The purpose of this study was to investigate the antiviral properties of extremophilic actinomycetes extracts from strains that were isolated from extreme environments in Kazakhstan.</p> </div> <div class="methods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Methods</div> <p id="Par2">Five strains of extremophilic actinomycetes isolated from the unique ecosystems of Kazakhstan were extracted and tested for antiviral activity against influenza viruses (strains H7N1, H5N3, H1N1 and H3N2) and paramyxoviruses (Sendai Virus and Newcastle Disease Virus). The antiviral activity of these selected extracts was tested by checking their effect on hemagglutination and neuraminidase activities of the studied viruses. Additionally, actinomycetes extracts were compared with commercially available antiviral drugs and some plant preparations that have been shown to exhibit antiviral properties.</p> </div> <div class="results" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Results</div> <p id="Par3">The main findings show that extracts from strains K-192, K-340, K-362, K-522 and K525 showed antiviral activities when tested using influenza viruses, Sendai Virus, and Newcastle Disease Virus. These activities were comparable to those shown by Rimantadine and Tamiflu drugs, and "Virospanï¿½? and "Flavovirï¿½? plant preparations.</p> </div> <div class="conclusions" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusions</div> <p id="Par4">We identified several extracts with antiviral activities against several strains of influenza viruses and paramyxoviruses. Our research findings can be applied towards characterization and development of new antiviral drugs from the active actinomycetes extracts.</p> </div> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Background</div> <p id="Par151">Antibiotic-resistance is one of the most serious global health issues currently because the consequences are increased mortality and morbidity in humans and animals [<a href="#CR1">1</a>, <a href="#CR2">2</a>]. However, the development of new antibiotics is compromised due to several complications such as challenges in finding natural compounds that possess characteristics suitable for a good pharmacological response when applied in the treatment of infections. There is also cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit issue that pharmacological companies face whereby the financial and other industrial resources outweigh the need for new drugs. Moreover, naturally derived compounds have complex chemical structures that make them difficult to first be discovered and then to create new drugs from these compounds [<a href="#CR2">2</a>]. The complexity of the studied preparations suggests the breadth of therapeutic use. Therefore, in our studies we investigated the presence of antiviral properties of new preparations that were isolated from extremophilic microorganisms.</p> <p id="Par16">Research highlights that drug-resistance in type A influenza virus is of high concern since it led to three pandemics in the twentieth century and can still do so in the future [<a href="#CR3">3</a>â€“<a href="#CR5">5</a>] . Genetic mechanisms that alter two main surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase caused the influenza viruses to develop resistance to already available antivirals [<a href="#CR4">4</a>]. Therefore, it was suggested that continuous antigenic variations in the virus can result in a new outbreak due to infections by the influenza virus [<a href="#CR4">4</a>].</p> <p id="Par17">Other viruses that serve as a threat to the animal populations come from the family <i>Paramyxoviridae</i>, specifically Newcastle disease virus and Sendai virus [<a href="#CR6">6</a>]. For example, the Newcastle disease virus is distributed worldwide and has the potential to cause large economic losses in the poultry industry [<a href="#CR7">7</a>, <a href="#CR8">8</a>]. The Sendai virus, also known as murine and human parainfluenza virus type 1, severely infects the respiratory system of rodents and only mildly in humans, respectively [<a href="#CR9">9</a>]. Thus, it is crucial to undertake research that focuses on the development of new compounds for advancing drug-based therapies against viral infections such as influenza and paramyxoviruses.</p> <p id="Par18">Known sources for new antibiotics are naturally derived compounds; such compounds can be produced by actinomycetes. Actinomycetes are gram-positive bacteria that can be cultivated from soil and marine samples. Majority of actinomycetes can live in extreme environments, such as those found in saline soil distances and saltwater [<a href="#CR10">10</a>]. A vast majority of well-known anti-infective commercial drugs particularly antibiotics (such as streptomycin, neomycin and chloramphenicol) are derived from naturally produced compounds that originate from Actinobacteria particularly the actinomycetes strains from <i>Streptomyces</i> genus [<a href="#CR11">11</a>]. Several studies have reported actinomycetes producing novel metabolites with antiviral activities against several pathogenic viruses which include Western equine encephalitis virus, HIV-1, Zika virus, acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus type 1 as well as influenza A and B viruses [<a href="#CR11">11</a>â€“<a href="#CR14">14</a>].</p> <p id="Par19">The genomic RNA (3â€²-5) of Newcastle disease virus that is 15,186 nucleotides long encodes the nucleocapsid, P/V proteins, matrix or membrane protein, fusion protein, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase glycoprotein and large proteins [<a href="#CR6">6</a>, <a href="#CR15">15</a>, <a href="#CR16">16</a>]. The structure of genomic RNA of the Sendai virus, which is 15,384 nucleotides long, is like the Newcastle disease virus except in having the PCV proteins and hemagglutinin glycoprotein only [<a href="#CR6">6</a>]. From the structural composition of paramyxoviruses, we can see their similarity with influenza viruses in that their genomes also encode the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase glycoproteins. Therefore, the effects of actinomycetes extracts on these viruses in our study were checked by specifically assessing antiviral activity targeting these 2 glycoproteins. In this study, we investigated the antiviral properties of extremophilic actinomycetes extracts from strains that were isolated from extreme environments in Kazakhstan against the influenza viruses (strains H7N1, H5N3, H1N1, H3N2) and paramyxoviruses (Sendai Virus, Newcastle Disease Virus).</p> </div> <div class="methods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

The rest of the actinomycetes cells were separated by centrifugation at 13,000â€‰rpm. The native solution obtained after filtration and centrifugation was extracted using n-butanol (in a ratio 5:1). Extraction was further carried out in the refrigerator at 4â€‰Â°C for 24â€‰h. The n-butanol layer was separated on a separatory funnel and filtered through a filter paper. The collected n-butanol fraction was concentrated in a vacuum on a rotary evaporator "RV-10 Basicï¿½? to a dry residue, and the extracted substances were dissolved in chemically pure ethanol (80%) in an amount of 3â€‰ml, and stored in the refrigerator until further analysis.

Toxicity testing of Actinomycetes preparations</div> <p id="Par55">Toxicity of the 30 preparations described above were tested using three different assays; effect of the preparations to induce 50% lysis of erythrocytes (Ð¢C<sub>50</sub> mean value, mg/ml), effect of the preparations to induce 50% death of chicken fibroblast cells (Ð¢C<sub>50</sub> mean value, mg/ml) and effect of the preparations to induce 50% death of chicken embryos (Ð¢C<sub>50</sub> mean value, mg/ml). The results of investigation are presented in Additional file <a href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S1, Additional file <a href="#MOESM2">2</a>: Figure S2 and Additional file <a href="#MOESM3">3</a>: Figure S3. In these assays, the lower concentrations of preparations to induce the measured effect indicated a higher level of toxicity. We observed that the level of measured toxicity varied according to the doses of the preparations as well as the assays. Furthermore, the toxicity effects vary according to the different biological models used (when tested using either 2% chicken erythrocytes, chicken fibroblast cells, or 10-days chicken embryos) for the toxicity tests. Overall, lower toxicity was observed when preparations were tested on the chicken embryos, while higher toxicity in preparations tested on chicken fibroblast cells. Strain K-525 showed the least amount of sample preparation needed to kill 50% of the erythrocytes under neutral conditions, while CBS preparations required the highest concentration (TC<sub>50</sub>) to destroy 50% of the erythrocytes. Overall, the CBS and CBN as growth conditions resulted in lower toxicity of preparations since these samples required the highest concentrations to kill 50% of chicken fibroblasts. We found that actinomycetes grown in 2â€‰N, 1â€‰N, and 1S, and 2S conditions showed higher toxicity towards chicken fibroblasts when compared to culture broth preparations. The ability of sample preparations to induce the death of chicken embryos when tested showed that the 1â€‰N preparation condition also showed high toxicity for preparations from all strains except for K-362. As expected, the preparations CBS showed relatively low toxicity in comparison to other conditions for all selected preparations. Furthermore, strain K-340 showed the lowest toxicity (highest TC<sub>50</sub>) for preparation 1S, when compared to preparations 1S for other strains which exhibited comparatively high toxicity. From the output of Kruskal-Wallis H test that was run for each individual strain separately used in hemolytic activity testing, it was shown that there was no statistically significant difference in toxicity between 6 different extracts, since all <i>p</i>-values were more than 0.05 (<i>p-</i>valueâ€‰=â€‰0.4159) for all strains analyzed.

In the remaining preparations, the CBS showed almost the same NI<sub>50</sub> values, which were higher compared to 2â€‰N and 2S conditions that had the lowest NI<sub>50</sub> values from all 6 growth conditions in K-192, K-340, and K-362 (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2</a>c). Overall, K-192-2S, K-340-2S, K-362-1S are the most active in inhibiting neuraminidase activity of the H5N3 since these extracts required the lowest concentrations (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2</a>c).</p> <p id="Par65">The effect is close to the one observed for H5N3 and for H7N1 with slight differences in NI<sub>50</sub> values for 1â€‰N for K-525, 1S for K-192, 2â€‰N for K-522 and 2S for K-522 (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2</a>d). The most active extracts were for strains K-340 grown in 2S condition, K-362 in 2â€‰N and 1Sconditions against H7N1 neuraminidase activity.</p> <p id="Par66">Figure <a href="#Fig3">3</a> shows the EIC<sub>50</sub> of tested preparations that were effective in inhibiting neuraminidase activity of the investigated influenza virus strains. Interestingly, one extract (K-362-1S) inhibited the activity of influenza virus strains resistant to commercial antiviral drugs (A/Vladivostok/2/09, H1N1 and A/tern/South Africa/1/61, H5N3).</p> <p id="Par67">The middle effective concentration of tested preparations (EC<sub>50</sub>, mg/ml) that caused 50% inhibition of virus infectious activity was determined (Fig. <a href="#Fig4">4</a>a-f). Extracts of CBN and CBS preparations demonstrated lower virus-inhibition activity against all investigated strains of influenza virus and paramyxoviruses in comparison with the extracts of biomass of extremophilic actinomycetes such as K-362-2â€‰N, K-192-2S, K-340-2S and K-362-2S (Fig. <a href="#Fig4">4</a>a-f). Overall, the biomass preparations of most (but not all) strains grown in saline (2S) conditions were found to be most effective in inhibiting the Influenza A viral subtype, PMV-1/Beadette and Sendai. strain 960, followed by the 1S preparations (extracts of culture broth of strains grown in saline (extreme) conditions). Results from these Figures were further analyzed for more meaningful interpretation to determine the SI-index as described in the section below. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 4</span></a></div>   <p><b>a</b> - <b>f</b> Average effective virus-inhibiting concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>,mg/ml) of preprarations against influenza virus strains H3N2 (<b>a</b>), H1N1 (<b>b</b>), H5N3 (<b>c</b>), H7N1 (<b>d</b>) and PMV-1/Beadette (<b>e</b>), Sendai. strain 960 (<b>f</b>).

SI-index of actinomycetes preparations to determine the effective viral inhibiting activity</div> <p id="Par68">Further in experiments on chicken embryos, the effective dose of preparations capable of inhibiting 50% of reproduction of tested viruses was estimated. The selective index (SI-index) against ortho- and paramyxoviruses, determined by the ratio of the average toxic substance concentration (TC<sub>50</sub>) to the average effective virus-inhibiting concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>), was calculated accordingly the guidelines ("Pre-clinical Drug Research Guideï¿½?). The results of the analysis are presented for preparations that possessed marked antiviral properties, showing SI-index greater than or equal to 10 (Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>).</p> <p id="Par69">It was established that the culture broth of actinomycetes strains K-192, K-340 and K-362 (having SI index of 0) were not able to inhibit the reproduction of all investigated influenza virus strains and paramyxoviruses. Four extracts of culture broth of actinomycetes strain K-192-1â€‰N, K-340-2â€‰N, K-340-1S and K-522-1â€‰N also did not express antiviral activity in the tested interval of doses (having SI index of 0). However, culture broth of actinomycetes strains K-525 and K-522, and actinomycetes extract K-522-1S, K-525-1S, K-525-1â€‰N, K-522-2â€‰N, K-340-1â€‰N had good SI-index in the relation of at least one of tested viruses (Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>).</p> <p id="Par70">Thus, extract of the biomass of extremophilic actinomycetes strain K-362, grown in neutral conditions of cultivation (K-362-2â€‰N) demonstrated high virus-inhibition activity against all investigated strains of influenza virus (Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>). Also, it was found that 3 extracts of the biomass of extremophilic actinomycetes, strains K-192, K-340 and K-362 grown in the presence of high salt concentration (extracts K-192-2S, K-340-2S, K-362-2S) possessed high antiviral activity against all investigated strains of influenza virus, including the drug-resistant strains (Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>).</p> <p id="Par71">An SI value that is higher than 10 is considered a good selective index that can give an idea about the selectivity of actinomycetes preparations on selectively killing the virus, and not the host. Overall, specific antiviral action of K-340-2S, K-362-2â€‰N, K-362-1S, and K-362-2S had shown SI-index to be more than 10 against all strains of influenza type A viruses investigated. Additionally, both K-362-1S and K-362-2S had the highest SI with a value of 40 against H3N2, H1N1, and H5N3. Only K-192-1S and K-192-2S extracts had good antiviral specificity result against PMV-1/Beadette, SI being 10, whereas the effective SI against Sendai, strain 960 was found in K-192-1S, K-340-1â€‰N, K-362-2S, K-522-CBN, K-522-1S, K-525-CBN, K-525-2â€‰N, K-525-1S and K-525-2S.</p> </div> <div class="comparisonofactinomycetespreparationswithcommercialantiviraldrugsandplantpreparations" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Discussion</div> <p id="Par75">We found in this study that several extracts from strains K-192, K-340 and K-362 (preparations K-192-2S, K-340-2S, K-362-2â€‰N, and K-362-1S) exhibited significant antiviral activities against the tested influenza viruses displaying antiviral SI values higher than those obtained by testing with the commercially available drugs Tamiflu and Rimantidine. In general, samples of the actinomycetes coming from CBN and CBS had lower toxicity than other preparations against studied ortho- and paramyxoviruses. Comparison of virus-inhibition activity of selected extracts of extremophilic actinomycetes with virus-inhibition properties of commercial anti-flu drugs Rimantadine and Tamiflu and herbal preparations "Virospanï¿½? and "Flavovirï¿½?, have shown that all selected extracts of extremophilic actinomycetes were comparable in anti-viral activity with commercial and plant preparations by the indices of selective index (Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>).</p> <p id="Par76">It was assumed that with all variables and observations being independent, the results obtained showed true effect because the methodology used to conduct all experiments was based on standard protocols and guidelines, and thus random errors were minimized. We found that the toxicity of investigated actinomycetes preparations depended on the conditions of cultivation and varied on different biological models used for toxicity hemolytic activity testing. The lower toxicity was observed on the model of chicken embryos, whereas the higher one was on the culture of chicken fibroblasts cells during hemolytic activity testing. Overall, samples of actinomycetes culture broth possessed the lower toxicity in comparison with the extracts of actinomycetes biomass. The results of toxicity testing which were found not to be significantly different based on the output of the Kruskal-Wallis H test (comparing the 3 assays used) were used to determine the intervals of doses suitable for antiviral activity analysis. This was based on the SI values (calculated based on the ratio of average toxic substance concentration (TC<sub>50</sub>) to average effective virus-inhibiting concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>)). Similar to the approach we described here for our study, many other researchers have modified nutrients and other physicochemical factors, and also used statistical optimization approaches to enhance production and identification of several bioactive compounds [<a href="#CR11">11</a>]. Interestingly, a set of 13 antiherpetic antiviral derivatives known as fattiviricins identified from the producer organism <i>Streptomyces microflavus,</i> were also shown to have potent activity against some enveloped RNA viruses such as the influenza A and B viruses [<a href="#CR14">14</a>]. AH-135Y produced from the culture filtrate of <i>Streptomyces albovinaceus</i> strain number AH-135 which was reported to be a new glutarimide antibiotic, was shown to be active against HSV-1 as well as influenza virus A and RSV [<a href="#CR14">14</a>]. However thus far no study has reported antiviral activities against our tested viral strains in extracts from actinomycetes strains grown in-vitro in saline and alkaline culture conditions, enhancing the possibility of the novelty of active compounds within our active extracts. Furthermore, our preliminary investigations on the identity of producer strains with antiviral activities that we have in our collection (data not presented here) do not include the two strains reported here (<i>Streptomyces microflavus</i> and <i>Streptomyces albovinaceus</i>), further supporting the idea that our active antiviral compounds described in this study are novel.</p> <p id="Par77">Hemagglutination activity testing showed inhibition of only one influenza virus strain- H1N1. The least concentration of 2S preparations in K-192, K-340 and K-522 and 2â€‰N preparations in K-362 and K-525 was required to inhibit hemagglutination activity, thus indicating high effectiveness. However, the CBS preparations of the most strains showed less effectiveness in inhibiting hemagglutination activity of H1N1. The K-192-1â€‰N, K-192-2â€‰N, and K-192-2S extracts were able to suppress the neuraminidase activity of all tested influenza virus strains. In addition, extracts K-192, K-362 in 2â€‰N, 1S and 2S conditions had the ability to suppress the neuraminidase activity of epidemic-significant H3N2 influenza virus strain. Also, these strains were more effective in neuraminidase inhibition than in 1â€‰N, CBN and CBS conditions. Overall, 2S and 2â€‰N preparations were the most effective in neuraminidase inhibition of influenza virus H1N1 for all strains, while the most effective strain was K-525. Moreover, K-362-1S extract suppressed neuraminidase activity of influenza viruses A/Vladivostok/2/09 (H1N1) and A/tern/South Africa/1/61 (H5N3) resistant to commercial antiviral drugs. Interestingly one recent study reported the identification of an antiviral butanolide from the culture broth of <i>Streptomyces</i> sp. SMU03 which inhabit the intestines of <i>Elephas maximus</i>, which displayed broad and potent activity against a panel of influenza viruses including the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes [<a href="#CR15">15</a>]. Given that this compound was found to interfere with the early stage of influenza A virus lifecycle, it was postulated that the target could be the HA2 subunit of hemagglutinin enzyme. From the results of our study, we found that most of our preparations that exhibited antiviral activities were effective to suppress the neuraminidase activity, and not the hemagglutinin enzyme activity.</p> <p id="Par78">Analysis of the virus-inhibition has shown that 8 preparations: culture broth of strains K-525 and K-522 and actinomycetes extracts K-522-1S, K-525 -1S, K-525-1â€‰N, K-522-2â€‰N, K-362-1â€‰N, and K-340-1â€‰N possessed significant virus-inhibition activity against ortho- and paramyxoviruses. The highest antiviral activity was demonstrated within 5 extracts, which were K-192-2S, K-340-2S, K-362-2â€‰N, K-362-2S, and K-362-1S. These extracts can block the reproduction of all investigated strains of influenza virus. Overall, 2S extracts of actinomycetes demonstrated a higher antiviral activity than CBS extracts of all actinomycetes strains except K-525, when investigated on influenza type A and paramyxoviruses. However, the K-525 strain was the most effective in inhibiting Sendai strain 960 for all 6 extracts, when compared with other actinomycetes strains. Fifteen preparations obtained from actinomycetes, cultivated under extreme and neutral conditions, had SI-index greater than or equal to 10, thus indicating good antiviral specificity. Even when the exact composition of the active components within the extracts are yet to be identified, we have demonstrated in this preliminary study the great potential of discovering novel antiviral compounds that can be further characterized to produce therapeutically effective antivirals for treatment of infections caused by our tested viral strains. As previously mentioned, several studies reported antiviral activities of natural compounds that originated from Actinobacteria whereby some of the antiviral mechanisms of actions of these compounds have been elucidated [<a href="#CR11">11</a>â€“<a href="#CR14">14</a>]. A recent study reported that one of the two novel antimicrobial compounds isolated from the culture broth of <i>Streptomyces</i> sp. AM-2504 showed antiviral activity against dengue virus [<a href="#CR16">16</a>]. As summarized in one report, Antimycin A1a isolated from <i>Streptomyces kaviengensis</i> was found to disrupt mitochondrial transport and pyrimidine biosynthesis in WEEV and that Ahmpatinin â€˜Bu from <i>Streptomyces</i> sp. CPCC 202950 inhibit the activity of HIV protease [<a href="#CR11">11</a>]. Yet another study showed that high-mannose type saccharide chains of gp120 are the molecular targets of actinohivin, which was isolated from <i>Longispora albida</i> which is a relatively new actinomycetes species, in its anti-HIV activity [<a href="#CR12">12</a>].</p> <p id="Par79">Even with the significant findings summarized here, there are some limitations of this study which we are currently addressing and incorporating for designs of future studies. The active compounds responsible for these antiviral activities are yet to be identified but we are currently working towards the goal of identification of the producer strains, active antiviral compounds within the extracts and elucidation of the antiviral mechanism of actions. Since this is a preliminary screening study of selected extracts from our collection, it represents the first step in our efforts to identify extracts and producer strains with promising potential to be further researched for development of efficacious antiviral therapeutic agents. The strength and uniqueness here is that this represents the only study reporting antiviral activity from actinomycetes producer strains that are also extremophiles grown in optimized culture environment that mimics the environment that these strains were isolated from. K-192-2S, K-340-2S, K-362-2â€‰N, K-362-2S and K-362-1S extracts were comparable with virus-inhibition properties of herbal preparations "Virospanï¿½? and "Flavovirï¿½?.</p> <p id="Par80">Our previous study showed that the plant extracts Virospan and Flavovir were prepared by extraction of plant tissues using 5 ethyl acetate and ethyl alcohol [<a href="#CR26">26</a>, <a href="#CR27">27</a>]. The final preparations tested in in-vitro experiments on chicken embryos showed that Virospan in a dose of 0.2â€‰mg inhibited reproduction of influenza A virus, specifically H5N3 and H3N2 subtypes by 40%, and by 60% when 1.0â€‰mg of the preparation was added [<a href="#CR27">27</a>]. Additionally, in-vivo experiments showed that residual infectivity of influenza A virus H3N2 in the lungs of infected mice after addition of 200 micrograms of the Flavovir extract decreased by 0.501â€‰g. These results were comparable with the effect of Relenza and Remantadin, while Tamiflu showed a decrease in 0.71â€‰g [<a href="#CR27">27</a>]. The fact that our extracts with comparable activities to our established plant extracts Virospan and Flavovir which also showed very good SI index is highly promising for further identification and characterization. Therefore our extracts should be developed further potentially as an effective antiviral medication. A similar study reported active antiviral activity of 27 plant extracts from Nigeria against 3 serotypes of echoviruses which suggested the significance of these extracts to be further developed as therapeutic antiviral agents [<a href="#CR28">28</a>].</p> <p id="Par81">The most promising results were that, extract preparations K-192-2S, K-340-2S, K-362-2â€‰N, and K-362-1S in this study exhibited higher SI values compared to Rimantadine and Tamiflu, which are well established antivirals with the mechanism of antiviral actions on viral replicative cycle and inhibiting the neuraminidase enzyme, respectively [<a href="#CR29">29</a>, <a href="#CR30">30</a>]. Our findings thus indicate that these extracts are great potential producers of new antiviral drugs. One of the possible mechanisms of antiviral action would be as inhibitors of the neuraminidase enzyme found on the influenza virus surface which would prevent budding from the host cell, viral replication, and infectivity.</p> </div> <div class="conclusions" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusions</div> <p id="Par82">Overall, we found that the strains of extremophilic actinomycetes K-192, K-340, and K-362 are interesting for further research as possible producers of biologically active substances with antiviral activity. Based on results of SI indexes higher than 10, it can be suggested that this study identified specific preparations of extremophilic actinomycetes that can be considered as a promising source for isolation and study of compounds that can block the reproduction of influenza virus type A. Future studies will focus on isolation and characterization of active compounds responsible for the antiviral actions followed by elucidation of the mechanism of action for the viral inhibitory activities.</p> </div> <div class="supplementary-material" title="supplementary-material"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
