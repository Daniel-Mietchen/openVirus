<p id="Par29">Second, toxicity analysis using chicken fibroblast cells (10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) was estimated by the method of dehydrogenases activity detection (MTT-test), which is based on the ability of dehydrogenases of live cells to reduce the non-colored form of 3–4,5-dimetilazol-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium (MTT-reagent) to the blue form of crystal formazan. MTT-reagent (Calbiochem, USA), which was dissolved in buffered saline was added in a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. Then, the MTT solution (0.1 ml) was placed in the plate wells with cell culture preliminarily washed from the culture media. After 1-h incubation of MTT with cells, plate wells were washed with buffered saline and then 0.1 ml of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) was added. Optical density in the wells was measured using the spectrophotometer “Tecan” M200 (Switzerland) at 535 nm.
