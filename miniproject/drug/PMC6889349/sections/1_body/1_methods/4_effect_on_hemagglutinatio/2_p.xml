<p id="Par35">Different doses of tested samples were mixed with equal volume of viruses with hemagglutination titer of 1:256. After 30 min incubation at 37 °C, hemagglutination activity was determined by a standard method using 0.75% erythrocyte solution [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As a control, buffered saline, pH 7.2 was used. Hemagglutination inhibition activity was calculated by comparison of hemagglutination titers in a control and tested sample.
