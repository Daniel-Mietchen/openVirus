<p id="Par31">Antiviral analysis was done to test the activity of the studied actinomycetes extracts on hemagglutination and neuraminidase activity of selected viruses. The action on the hemagglutination activity was tested using influenza viruses (strains H7N1, H5N3, H1N1, and H3N2) and paramyxoviruses (Sendai virus and Newcastle disease virus). The action of actinomycetes extracts on the neuraminidase activity on influenza viruses (strains H7N1, H5N3, H1N1, and H3N2) was also investigated. Further, the study of the virus-inhibition activity of 10 actinomycetes extracts on the influenza viruses (strains H7N1, H5N3, H1N1, and H3N2) and paramyxoviruses (Sendai virus and Newcastle disease virus) on the model of chicken embryos was performed. Finally, the virus-inhibition activity of the actinomycetes extracts was compared with preselected plant extracts (Virospan and Flavovir) and commercial antiviral drugs (Rimantadine and Tamiflu).</p>
