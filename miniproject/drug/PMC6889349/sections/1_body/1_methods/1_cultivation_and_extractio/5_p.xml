<p id="Par26">To prepare the extracts of actinomycetes cell biomass, the actinomycetes mycelium obtained after separation from the culture broth was relieved of moisture residues under pressure. The biomass wrung to 75% moisture were weighed and extracted with chemically pure ethanol (96%) in a ratio of 1:3, and the extracts were separated by filtration through a filter paper. The extraction was further carried out in the refrigerator for 24 h. The obtained extracts were concentrated in a vacuum on a rotary evaporator “RV-10 Basic” to a dry residue, and the extracted substances were dissolved in chemically pure ethanol (80%) in an amount of 3 ml and stored in the refrigerator. Extracts prepared from mycelium (or cell biomass) are designated as “sample 2”; for example, culture broth from strain K-192 is labeled as “K-192-2”.Thus, extracts of culture broth (CB), cell-free culture broth and cell biomass contained metabolites of extremophilic actinomycetes.</p>
