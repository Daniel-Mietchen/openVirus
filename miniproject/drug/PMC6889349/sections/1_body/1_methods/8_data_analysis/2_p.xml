<p id="Par45">The actions of extract preparations on the hemagglutination activity of test-viruses were calculated based on the average effective inhibition concentration of extract preparations (EIC
 <sub>50</sub>, mg/ml) capable of inhibiting 50% of viral hemagglutination activity (HI
 <sub>50</sub>). The same calculation procedure was applied to determine the capacity of tested preparations to inhibit 50% of neuraminidase activity (NI
 <sub>50</sub>).
