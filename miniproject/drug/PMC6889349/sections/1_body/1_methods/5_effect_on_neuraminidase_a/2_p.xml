<p id="Par37">The reaction was carried out in the black, 96-well, flat-bottom plates with plastic lids (NUNC, USA). Tested viruses were diluted in a 1:5 ratio in enzyme buffer, followed by 7 four-fold dilutions in MES. Aliquots of 25 μl of each dilution were added to the wells. As a positive control, enzyme buffer were used, instead of virus-containing material.</p>
