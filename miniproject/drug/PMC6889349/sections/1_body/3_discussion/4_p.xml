<p id="Par78">Analysis of the virus-inhibition has shown that 8 preparations: culture broth of strains K-525 and K-522 and actinomycetes extracts K-522-1S, K-525 -1S, K-525-1 N, K-522-2 N, K-362-1 N, and K-340-1 N possessed significant virus-inhibition activity against ortho- and paramyxoviruses. The highest antiviral activity was demonstrated within 5 extracts, which were K-192-2S, K-340-2S, K-362-2 N, K-362-2S, and K-362-1S. These extracts can block the reproduction of all investigated strains of influenza virus. Overall, 2S extracts of actinomycetes demonstrated a higher antiviral activity than CBS extracts of all actinomycetes strains except K-525, when investigated on influenza type A and paramyxoviruses. However, the K-525 strain was the most effective in inhibiting Sendai strain 960 for all 6 extracts, when compared with other actinomycetes strains. Fifteen preparations obtained from actinomycetes, cultivated under extreme and neutral conditions, had SI-index greater than or equal to 10, thus indicating good antiviral specificity. Even when the exact composition of the active components within the extracts are yet to be identified, we have demonstrated in this preliminary study the great potential of discovering novel antiviral compounds that can be further characterized to produce therapeutically effective antivirals for treatment of infections caused by our tested viral strains. As previously mentioned, several studies reported antiviral activities of natural compounds that originated from Actinobacteria whereby some of the antiviral mechanisms of actions of these compounds have been elucidated [
