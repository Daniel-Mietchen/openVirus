<p id="Par81">The most promising results were that, extract preparations K-192-2S, K-340-2S, K-362-2â€‰N, and K-362-1S in this study exhibited higher SI values compared to Rimantadine and Tamiflu, which are well established antivirals with the mechanism of antiviral actions on viral replicative cycle and inhibiting the neuraminidase enzyme, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Our findings thus indicate that these extracts are great potential producers of new antiviral drugs. One of the possible mechanisms of antiviral action would be as inhibitors of the neuraminidase enzyme found on the influenza virus surface which would prevent budding from the host cell, viral replication, and infectivity.
