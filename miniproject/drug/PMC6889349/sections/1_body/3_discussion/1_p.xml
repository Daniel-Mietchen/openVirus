<p id="Par75">We found in this study that several extracts from strains K-192, K-340 and K-362 (preparations K-192-2S, K-340-2S, K-362-2 N, and K-362-1S) exhibited significant antiviral activities against the tested influenza viruses displaying antiviral SI values higher than those obtained by testing with the commercially available drugs Tamiflu and Rimantidine. In general, samples of the actinomycetes coming from CBN and CBS had lower toxicity than other preparations against studied ortho- and paramyxoviruses. Comparison of virus-inhibition activity of selected extracts of extremophilic actinomycetes with virus-inhibition properties of commercial anti-flu drugs Rimantadine and Tamiflu and herbal preparations “Virospan” and “Flavovir”, have shown that all selected extracts of extremophilic actinomycetes were comparable in anti-viral activity with commercial and plant preparations by the indices of selective index (Table
