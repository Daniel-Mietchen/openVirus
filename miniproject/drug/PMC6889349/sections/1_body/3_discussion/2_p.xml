<p id="Par76">It was assumed that with all variables and observations being independent, the results obtained showed true effect because the methodology used to conduct all experiments was based on standard protocols and guidelines, and thus random errors were minimized. We found that the toxicity of investigated actinomycetes preparations depended on the conditions of cultivation and varied on different biological models used for toxicity hemolytic activity testing. The lower toxicity was observed on the model of chicken embryos, whereas the higher one was on the culture of chicken fibroblasts cells during hemolytic activity testing. Overall, samples of actinomycetes culture broth possessed the lower toxicity in comparison with the extracts of actinomycetes biomass. The results of toxicity testing which were found not to be significantly different based on the output of the Kruskal-Wallis H test (comparing the 3 assays used) were used to determine the intervals of doses suitable for antiviral activity analysis. This was based on the SI values (calculated based on the ratio of average toxic substance concentration (TC
 <sub>50</sub>) to average effective virus-inhibiting concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>)). Similar to the approach we described here for our study, many other researchers have modified nutrients and other physicochemical factors, and also used statistical optimization approaches to enhance production and identification of several bioactive compounds [

 <italic>Streptomyces microflavus,</italic> were also shown to have potent activity against some enveloped RNA viruses such as the influenza A and B viruses [

 <italic>Streptomyces albovinaceus</italic> strain number AH-135 which was reported to be a new glutarimide antibiotic, was shown to be active against HSV-1 as well as influenza virus A and RSV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However thus far no study has reported antiviral activities against our tested viral strains in extracts from actinomycetes strains grown in-vitro in saline and alkaline culture conditions, enhancing the possibility of the novelty of active compounds within our active extracts. Furthermore, our preliminary investigations on the identity of producer strains with antiviral activities that we have in our collection (data not presented here) do not include the two strains reported here (
 <italic>Streptomyces microflavus</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptomyces albovinaceus</italic>), further supporting the idea that our active antiviral compounds described in this study are novel.
