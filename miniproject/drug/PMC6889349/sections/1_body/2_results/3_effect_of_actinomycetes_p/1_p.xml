<p id="Par56">The influence of tested samples which are preparations of extremophilic actinomycetes (actinomycetes biomass extracts, culture broth extracts, and cell-free culture media) on the hemagglutination activity of orthomyxoviruses (influenza viruses strains H7N1, H5N3, H1N1, H3N2) and paramyxoviruses (NDV, Sendai virus) was studied. The effects of preparations on the hemagglutination activity of test-viruses were calculated to determine effective inhibition concentration of preparation (EIC
 <sub>50</sub>, mg/ml) that inhibited 50% of viral hemagglutination activity.
