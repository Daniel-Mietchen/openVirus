<p id="Par57">We determined that most of the extremophiles actinomycetes preparations did not inhibit hemagglutination activity of most of the tested influenza viruses (strains H7N1, H3N2, and H5N3) and paramyxoviruses. However, as shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, several preparations were found to inhibit hemagglutination activity of influenza virus H1N1.
