 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b summarizes 6 selected preparations from strains K-192, K-340, K-362 and K-525 grown in neutral or saline conditions that were effective in inhibiting 50% of the hemagglutination activity of the influenza virus H1N1. K-525-2S exhibited the lowest effective inhibition concentration and hence is the most effective preparation specifically at 0.008â€‰mg/ml when compared to the other 5 selected preparations that inhibited 50% of hemagglutination activity of influenza virus H1N1.
