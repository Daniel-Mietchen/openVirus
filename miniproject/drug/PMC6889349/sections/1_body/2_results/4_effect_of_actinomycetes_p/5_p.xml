<p id="Par64">The highest (and hence the least effective) concentration in strains K-522 and K-525 required to inhibit neuraminidase activity of the H5N3 was from CBS preparation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). In the remaining preparations, the CBS showed almost the same NI
 <sub>50</sub> values, which were higher compared to 2 N and 2S conditions that had the lowest NI
 <sub>50</sub> values from all 6 growth conditions in K-192, K-340, and K-362 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). Overall, K-192-2S, K-340-2S, K-362-1S are the most active in inhibiting neuraminidase activity of the H5N3 since these extracts required the lowest concentrations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c).
