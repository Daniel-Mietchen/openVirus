<p id="Par63">The smallest concentrations required to inactivate neuraminidase activity of the H1N1 were in the 6 preparations from strain K-525 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Preparations 2S and 2â€‰N required fewer concentrations for all 5 strains to inhibit the neuraminidase activity in comparison with the remaining preparations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). In 4 CBS preparations for all except for the K-525 strain, nearly the same concentrations were needed to inhibit neuraminidase activity of H1N1. Also, strains K-192 and K-362 showed relatively similar results for the effect on neuraminidase activity when grown in CBN (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Overall, it can be observed that CBN and CBS preparations of the K-192, K-340 and K-362 exhibited the least activity for the extracts in inhibiting neuraminidase of H1N1 virus.
