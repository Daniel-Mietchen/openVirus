<p id="Par67">The middle effective concentration of tested preparations (EC
 <sub>50</sub>, mg/ml) that caused 50% inhibition of virus infectious activity was determined (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a-f). Extracts of CBN and CBS preparations demonstrated lower virus-inhibition activity against all investigated strains of influenza virus and paramyxoviruses in comparison with the extracts of biomass of extremophilic actinomycetes such as K-362-2 N, K-192-2S, K-340-2S and K-362-2S (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a-f). Overall, the biomass preparations of most (but not all) strains grown in saline (2S) conditions were found to be most effective in inhibiting the Influenza A viral subtype, PMV-1/Beadette and Sendai. strain 960, followed by the 1S preparations (extracts of culture broth of strains grown in saline (extreme) conditions). Results from these Figures were further analyzed for more meaningful interpretation to determine the SI-index as described in the section below.
