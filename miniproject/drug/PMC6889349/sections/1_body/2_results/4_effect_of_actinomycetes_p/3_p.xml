<p id="Par62">The quantitative measurement of specific inhibition of neuraminidase activity in influenza virus H3N2 in 5 selected strains of actinomycetes is indicated by mean and standard deviation measures of neuraminidase inhibition (NI) of the H3N2 virus. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a we observed that 5 selected strains grown in certain neutral or saline conditions were effective in inhibiting 50% of the neuraminidase activity of the influenza virus H3N2. K-192 and K-362 strains grown in 2 N, 1S and 2S conditions both required lower concentrations of preparations (and hence more active) to inhibit the neuraminidase activity of the H3N2 in comparison with 1 N, CBN and CBS conditions of growth (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Among all 5 strains, the 2 N condition required relatively lowest amount of the extract to inhibit the neuraminidase activity, hence it is the most active preparation against H3N2 virus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). On the other hand, the CBS as a condition is among the least effective in inhibiting neuraminidase activity for all 5 strains. Interestingly, the 2S preparation required small amounts of the extract in all strains except K-525, where it showed the highest concentration used, thus was the least active (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a).
