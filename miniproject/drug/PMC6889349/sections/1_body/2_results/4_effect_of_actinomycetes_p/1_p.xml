<p id="Par60">The effect of the tested preparations (extracts of extremophilic actinomycetes, cell-free culture fluid) on neuraminidase activity of influenza A viruses with various types of neuraminidases (N1, N2, N3), including strains belonging to epidemically significant strains and strains resistant to commercial antiviral drugs, was studied. The capacity of tested preparations to inhibit of neuraminidase activity of influenza viruses was estimated as effective concentration of tested preparations (EIC
 <sub>50</sub>, mg/ml) capable to inhibit 50% of neuraminidase activity (NI
 <sub>50</sub>).
