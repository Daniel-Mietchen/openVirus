<p id="Par68">Further in experiments on chicken embryos, the effective dose of preparations capable of inhibiting 50% of reproduction of tested viruses was estimated. The selective index (SI-index) against ortho- and paramyxoviruses, determined by the ratio of the average toxic substance concentration (TC
 <sub>50</sub>) to the average effective virus-inhibiting concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>), was calculated accordingly the guidelines (“Pre-clinical Drug Research Guide”). The results of the analysis are presented for preparations that possessed marked antiviral properties, showing SI-index greater than or equal to 10 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
