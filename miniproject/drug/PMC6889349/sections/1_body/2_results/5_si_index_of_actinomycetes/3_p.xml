<p id="Par70">Thus, extract of the biomass of extremophilic actinomycetes strain K-362, grown in neutral conditions of cultivation (K-362-2â€‰N) demonstrated high virus-inhibition activity against all investigated strains of influenza virus (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Also, it was found that 3 extracts of the biomass of extremophilic actinomycetes, strains K-192, K-340 and K-362 grown in the presence of high salt concentration (extracts K-192-2S, K-340-2S, K-362-2S) possessed high antiviral activity against all investigated strains of influenza virus, including the drug-resistant strains (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
