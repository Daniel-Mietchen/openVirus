<p id="Par18">Known sources for new antibiotics are naturally derived compounds; such compounds can be produced by actinomycetes. Actinomycetes are gram-positive bacteria that can be cultivated from soil and marine samples. Majority of actinomycetes can live in extreme environments, such as those found in saline soil distances and saltwater [

A vast majority of well-known anti-infective commercial drugs particularly antibiotics (such as streptomycin, neomycin and chloramphenicol) are derived from naturally produced compounds that originate from Actinobacteria particularly the actinomycetes strains from

Several studies have reported actinomycetes producing novel metabolites with antiviral activities against several pathogenic viruses which include Western equine encephalitis virus, HIV-1, Zika virus, acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus type 1 as well as influenza A and B viruses [
