<p id="Par151">Antibiotic-resistance is one of the most serious global health issues currently because the consequences are increased mortality and morbidity in humans and animals [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, the development of new antibiotics is compromised due to several complications such as challenges in finding natural compounds that possess characteristics suitable for a good pharmacological response when applied in the treatment of infections. There is also cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit issue that pharmacological companies face whereby the financial and other industrial resources outweigh the need for new drugs. Moreover, naturally derived compounds have complex chemical structures that make them difficult to first be discovered and then to create new drugs from these compounds [
