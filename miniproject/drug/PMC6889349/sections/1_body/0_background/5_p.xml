<p id="Par19">The genomic RNA (3â€²-5) of Newcastle disease virus that is 15,186 nucleotides long encodes the nucleocapsid, P/V proteins, matrix or membrane protein, fusion protein, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase glycoprotein and large proteins [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The structure of genomic RNA of the Sendai virus, which is 15,384 nucleotides long, is like the Newcastle disease virus except in having the PCV proteins and hemagglutinin glycoprotein only [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. From the structural composition of paramyxoviruses, we can see their similarity with influenza viruses in that their genomes also encode the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase glycoproteins. Therefore, the effects of actinomycetes extracts on these viruses in our study were checked by specifically assessing antiviral activity targeting these 2 glycoproteins. In this study, we investigated the antiviral properties of extremophilic actinomycetes extracts from strains that were isolated from extreme environments in Kazakhstan against the influenza viruses (strains H7N1, H5N3, H1N1, H3N2) and paramyxoviruses (Sendai Virus, Newcastle Disease Virus).
