   <bold>a</bold> The effect of preparations on the hemagglutination inhibition (HI mean, mg/ml) of influenza virus H1N1. Tested samples were mixed with equal volume of viruses with hemagglutination titer of 1:256. After 30 min incubation at 37 °C, hemagglutination activity was determined by a standard method [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Hemagglutination inhibition activity was calculated by comparison of hemagglutination titers in the control and tested sample.
