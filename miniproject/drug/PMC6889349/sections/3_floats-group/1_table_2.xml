 <caption>
  <p>Specific antiviral action (SI-index) of preparations obtained from extremophilic actinomycetes against ortho- and paramyxoviruses. SI was determined by the ratio of average toxic substance concentration (TC
   <sub>50</sub>) to average effective virus-inhibiting concentration (EC
   <sub>50</sub>). SI-index greater than or equal to 10 marked good antiviral action of actinomycetes extracts that specifically killed the virus. The actinomycetes extracts K-340-2S, K-362-2 N, K-362-1S, K-362-2S demonstrated high virus-inhibition activity against all investigated strains of influenza virus. Only the extracts K-192-1S and K-192-2S showed good SI against PMV-1/Beadette virus strain. For strain K-525 extract of biomass grown in saline conditions, K-525-2S, had higher SI indexes against tested viral strains than extracts from culture liquid or biomass extract grown in neutral condition. Overall, biomass extracts grown in saline conditions had better specific antiviral action than extracts grown from culture liquid in neutral conditions
