<p>Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors (age, sex, OST, cirrhosis, history of previous anti-HCV therapy, genotype, parallel drug use, comorbidity and HIV coinfection) that might be associated with SVR rate or LTFU. Univariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that age &lt;45 years (OR 3.269, 95%CI 1.289-8.289; P=0.013), parallel drug use (OR 2.547, 95%CI 1.023-6.342; P=0.044) and genotype 3 (OR 4.659, 95%CI 1.322-16.420; P=0.017) were significantly associated with LTFU. Multivariate analysis showed that age &lt;45 years (OR 3.600, 95%CI 1.361-9.521; P=0.010) and genotype 3 (OR 5.443, 95%CI 1.492-19.861; P=0.010) were significantly associated with LTFU (
