<p>We enrolled 174 patients who started therapy with DAAs between 1 September 2014 and 1 June 2018 and were due for SVR12 testing by 31
 <sup>st</sup> December 2018. The baseline characteristics of our cohort are shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The patients had a mean age of 48Â±9.2 years and most were male (83.9%). Of the 174 PWID, 91 (52.3%) were attending OST programs during the DAA treatment period and 68 (39.1%) revealed parallel active drug use. Four patients (2.3%) had HBsAg detectable and were receiving tenofovir fumarate 245 mg daily, while 8 (4.6%) patients with HIV/HCV coinfection were under highly active antiretroviral therapy. Previous HCV treatment experience was reported by 44 of the 174 (25.3%) patients and 72 patients (41.4%) had evidence of cirrhosis. The most prevalent genotype was genotype 3 (61.5%), with genotype 1 following at a rate of 23%. There were no patients infected with genotype 5 or 6. Two patients had decompensated liver disease at baseline with Child-Pugh-Turcotte scores C and B, and model for end-stage liver disease scores 18 and 10, respectively. The DAA regimens and the number of patients per regimen are shown in
