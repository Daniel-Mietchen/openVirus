<p>In this study we reported real-world experience of more than 3 and a half years from a cohort of PWID with chronic HCV infection treated with DAAs. Our results clearly showed that DAAs are very effective and well tolerated in this population, achieving an SVR in 96.5% of the patients who had an HCV RNA test available by the 12
 <sup>th</sup> week post therapy. However, in the ITT analysis a drop in SVR12 rate (79.9%) was recorded. This was attributed mainly to the LTFU patients, highlighting that guaranteeing the follow up and SVR12 visit represents a challenging goal.
