<p>Serum HCV RNA testing 12 weeks after treatment completion and long-term follow up is of major clinical importance. It may be argued, however, that in the era of HCV elimination, post-therapy testing and care may not be the priority; however, a lack of SVR documentation, reinfection rate assessment after therapy and surveillance for the early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma are important clinical issues from an individual point of view [

Our analysis showed that PWID who were &lt;45 years old and those infected with genotype 3 were at higher risk for LTFU. The higher risk behavior in the younger population and the rather earlier stages of HCV disease may explain the association between age and LTFU rates. This finding was also reported in a recent review that included 1909 PWID [

It is known that HCV is transmitted through injecting networks, which have significant differences in epidemiological and disease-related characteristics. Our analysis is not sufficient to confirm or rule out the likelihood that genotype 3 predominates in networks composed of individuals with a chaotic lifestyle and a higher probability of failure to comply with treatment and follow-up schedules [
