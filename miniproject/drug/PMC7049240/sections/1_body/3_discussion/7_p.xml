<p>Our study had several limitations, mostly related with the design. It was a single-center retrospective analysis and therefore the results should not be generalized without caution. Incomplete or missing data, entry errors and differences between active or former drug users are possible in a study with such a design. However, despite the above limitations our data points were complete (&gt;95%) as regards the vast majority of the parameters analyzed. Furthermore, we included patients who represented all subgroups of PWID in real-world settings who had completed at least a 12-week follow-up period after treatment. Patients with parallel drug use and HBV or HIV coinfections, reflecting those with more hazardous behaviors, were not excluded from our analysis, giving our results extra validity.</p>
