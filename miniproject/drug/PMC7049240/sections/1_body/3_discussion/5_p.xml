<p>Treatment adherence-enhancing strategies, including special nurses engaged in hepatitis C treatment in the hospital settings, could be a promising approach to deal with the problem of LTFU in this marginalized population. However, the implementation of such an approach is problematic, as it is associated with a cost increase that is not feasible for the majority of countries; our data are therefore of clinical importance, because intensifying support and follow-up visits only for those PWID who are at higher risk of being lost could reduce the LTFU rates.</p>
