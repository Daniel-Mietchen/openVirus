<p>The efficacy of DAA therapy in PWID with HCV infection has been examined in 2 large prospective studies, in a number of 
 <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses and in several real world studies [

 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The well-organized prospective selection of the patients, in combination with the meticulous follow-up methodology, might be the explanation for the high adherence and SVR12 rates. The 96.5% SVR12 rate in our patients who had an HCV RNA test 12 weeks post treatment is comparable with the results of these prospective studies, demonstrating that DAAs can offer high SVR rates in PWID, similar to those reported in the general population. However, one might argue that the practices and methodology of prospective clinical trials cannot be reproduced in the real world, particularly in PWID groups. In the ITT analysis we clearly observed lower SVR12 rates: 79.9% of our population achieved SVR12, with the absence of HCV RNA testing after treatment completion being the main reason for the lower SVR12. Our data are in accordance with other real-world studies that reported SVR12 rates ranging between 80-87% [

 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Furthermore, the percentage of 10.3% LTFU after treatment completion was similar to that in several real-world studies [

 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], although others [
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] reported significantly lower LTFU rates (0.6-2%). The different LTFU rates across the studies might be related to the context of treatment delivery and follow up (i.e., frequency of study visits, engagement in active follow up by study personnel, patient-friendly schedule of appointments), the special characteristics of the PWID treated and the definition of LTFU in the real-world setting. In our cohort we observed that 55 patients underwent SVR12 lab testing after the 12
 <sup>th</sup> post-therapy week, while the mean time to SVR12 was 19 weeks after treatment completion; therefore, an extended follow up in the PWID population might be a reasonable option for SVR12 assessment.
