    <p>Direct acting-antivirals (DAAs) are highly effective for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>Compared to the general population, DAAs have shown similar efficacy in clinical trials in people who inject drugs (PWID) and have HCV infection</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>There has been evidence for lower response rates for PWID in a real-life setting</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>Adherence to DAA therapy and loss to follow up (LTFU) during treatment are major concerns regarding antiviral treatment in the PWID population</p>

  <bold>What the new findings are:</bold>

 <p>
  <list list-type="bullet">
   <list-item>
    <p>Our real-world data confirm the high rates of sustained virological response (SVR) following DAA therapy in PWID</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>Approximately 1 of 10 PWID was LTFU during or after treatment completion, with no SVR test available</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>LTFU seems to be related with younger age and genotype 3</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>Parallel drug use was associated with a trend towards LTFU</p>
