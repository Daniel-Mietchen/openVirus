<p>Overall, DAA therapy was well-tolerated and safe; 3 patients discontinued treatment for non-liver-related reasons and 1 with decompensated disease at baseline died from liver failure. In addition, the most common adverse event was anemia, which was observed in 2 cirrhotic patients receiving ribavirin. Neither of these patients needed to discontinue treatment and their anemia improved with ribavirin dose reduction. In addition, none of the treated PWID developed hepatocellular carcinoma between treatment initiation and SVR12 testing.</p>
