<p>Greece has expressed its willingness to contribute to the WHO strategy for HCV elimination, by scaling-up treatment for HCV infection in both the general population and the vulnerable population of PWID. The prevalence of HCV infection in Greece is estimated to be between 0.83% and 1.79% [

In the present study, our primary objective was to evaluate the clinical outcome of HCV treatment with DAAs in a Greek cohort of PWID, as assessed by SVR12, and secondarily to define factors that may influence this outcome. This national-based approach aims to add extra knowledge to the international guidelines that encourage physicians to treat HCV-infected PWID.
