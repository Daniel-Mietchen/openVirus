<p>We conducted a retrospective analysis of a cohort that included PWID with chronic HCV infection who had been treated with DAAs in our tertiary liver center in Athens. More specifically, we analyzed data from all PWID who had detectable serum HCV RNA for at least 6 months and had started antiviral treatment with DAAs between 1 September 2014 and 1 June 2018. Individuals were classified as PWID if they had a history of any illicit drug injection at any time. Those who reported a history of illicit drug injection during the last 12 months or had a positive urinalysis were classified as PWID with parallel drug use. A history of previous anti-HCV therapy, decompensated liver disease, liver transplantation, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfections, or parallel drug use were not considered exclusion criteria in our analysis. Opioid substitution treatment (OST) programs included substitution therapies with buprenorphine or methadone in a structured program under the supervision of a multidisciplinary health care team. Patients presented to our center either of their own volition or via collaboration with the practitioners at the addiction programs.</p>
