<p>The specific DAA treatment was determined according to the physicianâ€™s judgment, taking into account the HCV genotype, and the presence of cirrhosis and comorbidities. During the treatment period, all patients were assessed monthly in our department for treatment compliance, or earlier if possible adverse effects of therapy were present. SVR12 was defined as at least one polymerase chain reaction test with undetectable HCV RNA, 12 weeks after treatment completion. Individuals who did not complete the SVR12 testing within 24 weeks after treatment completion were considered as LTFU. Failure to respond to antiviral therapy was defined as detectable HCV RNA any time after treatment completion.</p>
