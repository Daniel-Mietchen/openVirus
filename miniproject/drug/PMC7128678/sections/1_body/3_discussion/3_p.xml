 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> with cell surface glycolipids. This in-silico strategy was applied to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the antiviral mechanisms of CLQ and CLQ-OH against SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, it was shown that CLQ and CLQ-OH bind readily to sialic acids with high affinity, including the typical 9-O-SIA subtype recognized by coronaviruses 
 <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Next, it was shown that CLQ and CLQ-OH also bind to sialic-acid-containing gangliosides. Based on these data, the drugs may also recognize the sialic acid residues of glycoproteins. Further studies will help clarify this point.
