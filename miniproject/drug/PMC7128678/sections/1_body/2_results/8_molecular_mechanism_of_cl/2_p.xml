<p id="para0021">With the aim of establishing whether CLQ and CLQ-OH could prevent the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to plasma membrane gangliosides, the initial NTD–GM1 complex was superposed with a drug–GM1 complex (
 <xref rid="fig0009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> ). To improve clarity, the ganglioside is not presented in 
 <xref rid="fig0009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>. This superposition shows that the NTD and the drug (CLQ-OH in this case) share the same spatial position when bound to GM1, so GM1 cannot bind the viral protein and the drug simultaneously. This is due to the fact that the NTD and the drugs (CLQ and CLQ-OH) bind to GM1 with a similar mechanism controlled by a dyad of functional interactions: a hydrogen bond and a geometrically perfect CH-π stacking interaction. In the case of the NTD, the hydrogen bond involves Asn-167, whereas CH-π stacking is mediated by the aromatic ring of Phe-135 
 <xref rid="fig0006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>(b). On one hand, Asn-167 establishes a network of hydrogen bonds with the GalNAc residue of GM1. On the other hand, the flat aromatic ring of Phe-135 stacks on to the cycle of the Glc residue of GM1. In the case of CLQ and CLQ-OH, it is the nitrogen-containing ring of the drug that stacks on to the Glc ring 
 <xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>(c). Note that both the Phe-135 (in red) and CLQ-OH (in green) rings are located in the same position (
 <xref rid="fig0009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). The other CLQ-OH molecule, which covers the tip of the sugar part of the ganglioside, interacts with the GalNAc ganglioside 
 <xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>(b). When the NTD is bound to the ganglioside, the side chain of Asn-137 is found in this exact position (
 <xref rid="fig0009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Thus, once two CLQ-OH (or two CLQ) molecules are bound to a ganglioside 
 <xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>(e,f), any binding of a SARS-Cov-2 S protein to the same ganglioside is totally prevented. The energy required to overcome this steric incompatibility is estimated to be several hundred kJ.mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, which is far too high to occur.
