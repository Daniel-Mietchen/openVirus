<p id="para0016">It was reasoned that if the RBD is engaged in functional interactions with the ACE-2 receptor, it would be interesting to search for potential ganglioside-binding sites on the other cell-accessible domain of the S glycoprotein (i.e. the NTD). The NTD contains approximately 290 amino acid residues. The tip of the NTD was of particular interest, as it displays a flat interface
