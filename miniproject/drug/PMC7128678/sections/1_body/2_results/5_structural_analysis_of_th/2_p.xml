<p id="para0015">The next step of this study was to determine how SARS-CoV-2 could interact with plasma membrane gangliosides, and whether such interaction could be affected by CLQ and CLQ-OH. The global structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein 
 <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> is shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> (a–d). It consists of a trimer of S proteins, each harbouring two distinct domains distant from the viral envelope: the receptor-binding region (RBD) and the NTD.
