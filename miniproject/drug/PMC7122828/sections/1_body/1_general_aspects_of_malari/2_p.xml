<p id="Par12">The life cycle of the protozoan is divided between a host and an insect vector, as briefly described below and illustrated schematically in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">8.2</xref>. (
 <bold>I</bold>) By stinging the host, the sporozoite form of 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, lodged in the mosquito’s salivary glands, is injected into the bloodstream until it reaches the liver. (
 <bold>II</bold>) In hepatic cells, the sporozoites reproduce asexually generating other cells called merozoite (not all merozoites reproduce asexually, some develop sexually). (
 <bold>III</bold>) The merozoites destroy the erythrocytes, causing anemia in the host and initiating a series of reproductive cycles. (
 <bold>IV</bold>) Some merozoites will become immature gametocytes, precursors of male and female gametes. (
 <bold>V</bold>) By re-stinging the host, the gametocytes will be collected and matured in the mosquito’s digestive system. (
 <bold>VI</bold>) The fusion of gametocytes will result in zygotes (also named as ookinetes) that will subsequently be converted into sporozoites, which migrate to the salivary glands of the mosquito, thus initiating a new infectious cycle (Rabinovitch et al.
