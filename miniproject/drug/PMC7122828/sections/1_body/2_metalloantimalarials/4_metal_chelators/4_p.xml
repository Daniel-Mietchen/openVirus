<p id="Par40">The intensity of the antimalarial activity of iron chelators correlates with their hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance, as they can be capable of permeating cell membranes (Scheibel and Rodriguez 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">1989</xref>). Experimental studies with amino-terminal derivatives of desferrioxamine showed a preserved ability to bind to iron(III) species and a corresponding reduction to bind to iron(II) (Glickstein et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1996</xref>). Moreover, iron (III) forms stable complexes with coordination number equal six (Mabeza et al.
