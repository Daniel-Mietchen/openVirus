 <bold>complex 17</bold>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">8.5</xref>) was synthesized by attaching N-methylanthranilic acid to the N-terminus, leading to a higher antimalarial activity. Zinc–desferrioxamine (Zn-DFO) complex exhibited increased permeability and improved antimalarial activity when compared to free DFO. A metal substitution reaction occurs inside the erythrocyte, forming the Fe(III)-DFO complex, which is more stable than the Zn-DFO complex (Loyevsky et al.
