<p id="Par39">Some characteristics are very important for effective iron-chelating, such as a hydrophilic–hydrophobic balance, the structure of the hex dentate ligand, a selectivity for iron(III), and high affinity for iron and for others cations. The affinity for iron is a main prerequisite for antimalarial activity of an iron-chelating drug, with values of affinity constants iron(III) chelators ranging from 10
 <sup>24</sup> to 10
 <sup>38</sup>, according to the literature. The classic chelator desferrioxamine (DFO) (

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">8.5</xref>), for example, presents an affinity constant value of 10
 <sup>31</sup>, forming a stable complex with iron and, therefore, a high antimalarial activity. The chelator must have additional affinity for other metals such as calcium, magnesium, and zinc, as their removal may be detrimental for the parasite (Goodwin and Whitten
