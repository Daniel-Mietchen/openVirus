<p id="Par46">Until the present moment, ferrochloroquine or ferroquine (FQ) (
 <bold>complex 18</bold>, Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">8.6</xref>) is the most successful metal-based drug for malaria therapy. This compound was described in 1997 as the first chloroquine derivative containing a ferrocene molecule, incorporating the ferrocene to the lateral side chain of chloroquine (Biot et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1997</xref>). Although there are structural similarities between chloroquine and FQ, the in vitro activities against 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> of these compounds are distinct. FQ has high efficiency against chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasite strains, reaching efficiencies 20 times higher than chloroquine. FQ exhibited high activity in vivo against 
 <italic>P. yoeli, P. vinckei</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> strains (Biot et al.
