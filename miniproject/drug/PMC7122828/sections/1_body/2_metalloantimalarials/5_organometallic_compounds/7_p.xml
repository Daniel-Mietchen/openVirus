<p id="Par50">In vitro tests against 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains demonstrated that the antiplasmodial activity of FQ conjugates and thiosemicarbazones was higher than for free thiosemicarbazone. Also, FQ-TSCs (

 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">8.7</xref>) displayed higher efficiency against four 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> strains with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values at micromolar range (Biot et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2007</xref>). Hydroxyferroquine derivatives were also tested, and Wani et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2015</xref>) observed that they exhibited antiplasmodial activity and antiviral effects against coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome. Hydroxyferroquine (FQ-hydroxy) derivatives (

 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">8.7</xref>) represent thus an excellent alternative to treat malaria infections caused by coronavirus in some specific geographical regions.
