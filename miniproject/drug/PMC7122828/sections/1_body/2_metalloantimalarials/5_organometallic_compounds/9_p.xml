<p id="Par52">Benzothiazoles exhibit appreciable biological activity, and recently, Adams et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2017</xref>) evaluated antimalarial activity of ferrocenyl-containing benzothiazoles (
 <bold>Complex 22</bold>–
 <bold>24</bold>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">8.7</xref>). According to the authors, these compounds presented antiplasmodial activity against CQ-resistant and CQ-sensitive strains. They also observed that ferroquine derivatives were not able to inhibit the formation of β-hematin, indicating that FQ and its derivatives have different mechanisms of action.
