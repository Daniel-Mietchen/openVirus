<p id="Par54">The development of ferrocene chemistry led to the investigation of ruthenocene analogues as antimalarial agents. Ruthenoquine (RQ) (

 <bold>complexes 26</bold> and 
 <bold>27</bold>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8.8</xref>) were synthesized and presented good inhibition of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> growth, with similar mechanism of action as FQ (Beagley et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR06">2002</xref>). All the results available up to the present moment point to an enormous potential of ferroquine and its derivatives for the development of antiplasmodial agents.
