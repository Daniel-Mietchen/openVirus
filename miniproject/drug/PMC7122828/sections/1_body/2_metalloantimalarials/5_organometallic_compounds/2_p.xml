<p id="Par45">The first organometallic compounds for application in medicine, salvarsan (arsphenamine) and neosalvarsan, were based in arsenic and reported by Paul Ehrlich to treat syphilis and trypanosomiasis (Salas et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2013</xref>). Several organometallic complexes were prepared and valued as potential antimalarial agents, with ferrocene exhibiting the hightest antimalarial activity (Wani et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2015</xref>). Ferrocenes are highly liposoluble, stable, and nontoxic and have accessible redox potential, which make them very attractive to therapeutic applications (Van-Staveren and Metzler-Nolte
