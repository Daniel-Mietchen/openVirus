<p id="Par49">These previous interesting results stimulated the synthesis of several ferroquine derivatives, such as thiosemicarbazones, trioxaferroquines, ferrocene dual conjugates, hydroxyferroquines, and benzothiazoles (Wani et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2015</xref>; Adams et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2017</xref>). Thiosemicarbazones (TSCs) correspond to a very important class of compound for medicinal chemistry (Leovac et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2007</xref>), with interesting biological effects, including antimalarial activity (Bahl et al.
