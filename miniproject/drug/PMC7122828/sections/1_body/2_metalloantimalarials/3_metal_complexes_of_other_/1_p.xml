<p id="Par34">In a very informative review on gallium(III) complexes as new promising metal-based drug candidates, Lessa et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2012</xref>) mentioned the complex of general formula [Ga-3-Madd]ClO
 <sub>4</sub>, where H
 <sub>2</sub>-3-Madd = 1,12 bis-(2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl)-1,5,8,12-tetraazododecane, active against chloroquine-resistant FCR-3 and Indo-1 lineages at low micromolar concentrations. The complexes [Fe-3-Eadd]ClO
 <sub>4</sub> (
 <bold>complex 8</bold>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">8.4</xref>) and [Ga-3-Eadd]ClO
 <sub>4</sub> (
 <bold>complex 9</bold>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">8.4</xref>), where H
 <sub>2</sub>-3-Eadd = 1,12-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-ethyl-benzyl-1,5,8,12-tetraazadodecane, were investigated in respect to their antimalarials activities against HB3 (chloroquine-sensitive) and Dd2 (chloroquine-resistant) 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains. The results revealed that both complexes were effective against the HB3 chloroquine-resistant strains, but were 10–30 times less potent against Dh2 chloroquine-resistant strains. In the case of HB3 strains, both complexes were good inhibitors of hemozoin formation and modest to Dh2 strain. According to the authors, these results suggested that due to the similar antimalarial activities of the complexes, gallium(III) can replace iron(III) in biological environments.
