  <p>Life cycle of influenza virus and anti-influenza virus drugs. Influenza virus is incorporated into the cell via endocytotic pathway and viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP) which consists of viral genome RNA, viral polymerases and nucleoprotein is released into the cytoplasm. vRNP is transported into the nucleus where transcription and replication occur. In replication step, complementary RNA is synthesized, and then, progeny vRNPs are synthesized from complementary RNP (cRNP). Progeny vRNPs are transported to cytoplasm by binding to matrix protein 1 (M1) and nuclear export protein (NEP). Budding of progeny virion is occurred under plasma membrane with viral membrane proteins (HA, NA and M2). Amantadine and rimantadine inhibit M2 ion channel activity, and therefore, inhibit release of vRNP into cytoplasm. VX-787 and S-033188 inhibit transcription of viral mRNA by binding to viral polymerase complex. Favipiravir and ribavirin inhibit viral RNA synthesis. Zanamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir and laninamivir octanoate all inhibit neuraminidase activity of NA by binding to the active center of the enzyme, and therefore, inhibit release of progeny virion from the cell surface.
