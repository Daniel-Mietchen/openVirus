<p id="Par15">HBV is a small enveloped hepatotropic DNA virus with an ~3.2 kb partially double-stranded, relaxed circular DNA genome that encodes polymerase, precore (HBV e antigen), core (capsid), surface antigens (small, middle and large) and HBx protein (transcriptional activator). As shown in 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, the virus enters hepatocytes by binding to the cellular receptor(s), which includes sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide.

 </sup> Following release of the nucleocapsid, relaxed circular DNA is transported into the nucleus and converted into covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). The cccDNA is quite stable in the form of a minichromosome and serves as a template for the transcription of all viral mRNAs. Among these mRNAs, the 3.5 kb pregenomic RNA is translated into polymerase and core proteins, which is then encapsidated together with polymerase that serves as a RNA replicative intermediate. The pregenomic RNA is reverse transcribed into minus-strand DNA and degraded by the RNase H activity associated with the polymerase during this process. HBV polymerase subsequently synthesizes plus-strand DNA with various lengths, which generates relaxed circular DNA. Finally, the matured nucleocapsids are released from infected cells after the acquisition of an envelope that contains the surface antigens in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus to produce progeny virions, or to be recycled to the nucleus to supply the cccDNA pool.
