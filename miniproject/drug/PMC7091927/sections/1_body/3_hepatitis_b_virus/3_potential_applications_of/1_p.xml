<p id="Par17">Approved nucleos(t)ide analogs competitively inhibit DNA elongation of viral polymerase after the conversion to triphosphate form by cellular enzymes. Although nucleos(t)ide analog inhibitors can be highly effective in preventing liver disease progression, these drugs are not curative and require long-term use, which is associated with a risk of drug-resistance and side-effect. To overcome these drawbacks, several nucleos(t)ide analogs are currently in preclinical and clinical trials, which indicates that active site of the DNA polymerization remains an indispensable drug target for HBV treatment. Indeed, a new tenofovir derivative, tenofovir alafenamide (Vemlidy), was recently approved and its improved pharmacological properties contribute to the reduction of nephrotoxicity. To date, microbial metabolites have yielded various nucleos(t)ide analogs, as mentioned above, including oxetanocin A and its derivative that exhibits anti-HBV activity.
