<p id="Par23">Drug repositioning (also known as drug repurposing) is of growing interest to reduced time and cost associated with drug developments. Cyclosporine A (CsA) is an approved immunosuppressive drug and it has been revealed that CsA is effective against viruses such as HIV, human papillomavirus, influenza virus, HCV, coronaviruses and human cytomegalovirus.

 </sup> CsA can be isolated from

 </sup> The antiviral mechanism of CsA involves the inhibition of the correct folding of viral proteins by cyclophilins. CsA exerts immunosuppressive effects as the CsAâ€“cyclophilin A complex is formed by the inhibition of calcium-dependent phosphatase activity by calcineurin, which leads to the inhibition of key activators of T cells. Therefore, CsA derivatives that lack the inhibitory activity of calcineurin, but maintain the inhibitory activity of cyclophilins have been semi-synthesized.

 </sup> A CsA derivative, alisporivir (DEB025), with ribavirin has been studied as an anti-HCV drug and is the subject of a clinical trial.
