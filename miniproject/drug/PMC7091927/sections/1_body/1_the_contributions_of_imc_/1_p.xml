<p id="Par4">Nucleos(t)ide analogs are a major class of approved antiviral drugs that exert therapeutic effects through incorporation into viral DNA and RNA to inhibit virus replication. To date, they have been used as a versatile platform to develop both narrow and broad-spectrum antivirals. Moreover, natural products have provided some motivation to develop new nucleos(t)ide analogs.

 </sup> Two arabinosyl nucleosides, spongouridine and spongothymidine, were isolated from marine sponges and subsequently contributed to the synthesis of vidarabine (arabinosyladenine), which is used for the treatment of herpes simplex virus infections. Professor Umezawa and colleagues identified nucleoside analogs from actinobacteria, such as formycin,
