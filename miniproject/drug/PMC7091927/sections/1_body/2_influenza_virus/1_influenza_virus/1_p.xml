<p id="Par7">Seasonal influenza is acute respiratory infections caused by influenza viruses. There are three types of seasonal influenza viruses—type A, B and C; influenza A and B viruses cause outbreaks and epidemics. The World Health Organization estimates that annual epidemics caused by influenza A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and B viruses result in ~3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and 250 000 to 500 000 deaths, globally.

 </sup> Furthermore, an influenza pandemic, such as those of the ‘Spanish’ influenza in 1918 (H1N1),’ ‘Asian’ influenza in 1957 (H2N2),’ ‘Hong Kong’ influenza in 1968 (H3N2),’ ‘Russian’ influenza in 1977 (H1N1)’ and 2009 H1N1 influenza (swine-origin H1N1), occurs when new influenza A virus against which the human population has no immunity emerges as a consequence of ‘genetic reassortment’.

 </sup> As these epidemics and pandemics still occur, the continued discovery and development of new antiviral drugs and vaccines against influenza infections are required. A total of eight drugs (matrix 2 (M2) inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine), NA inhibitors (zanamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir and laninamivir octanoate) and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors (ribavirin and favipiravir) have been approved for the treatment of influenza infections.
