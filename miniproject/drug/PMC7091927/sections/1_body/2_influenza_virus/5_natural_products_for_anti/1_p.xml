<p id="Par13">All of the approved and clinical trial drugs mentioned above are synthesized, but natural products for anti-influenza virus drugs have been screened and studied. NA has been targeted for the anti-influenza virus activity of natural products because high-throughput assay systems for measurements of NA activity have been constructed. Reported natural products that show inhibition of NA can be classified into five groups: flavonoids, oligostibenes, coumarins, diarylheptanoids and others.

 </sup> HA is also targeted for the screening of anti-influenza virus drugs. A novel compound with a pentacyclic structure, stachyflin isolated from 
 <italic>Stachybotrys</italic>, inhibits conformational changes of HA at low pH, thereby inhibiting membrane fusion between virus and host cells.
