 </sup> and was approved in 1966 to treat influenza A virus infections. The target of amantadine is M2 integral membrane protein, which exhibits H

 </sup> Acidification in the virion interior is necessary to allow the viral genome to diffuse away from the endosomal membrane. Amantadine inhibits proton translocation by binding to the transmembrane domain of the M2 protein tetramer, thereby inducing the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm

However, amantadine and rimantadine, a derivative of amantadine, are not currently used to treat influenza virus infections because drug-resistant viruses can emerge rapidly (both the A/H1N1pdm and A/H3N2 seasonal epidemic strains have the amantadine-resistance S31N mutation) and the central nervous system side effects are particularly common in patients treated with amantadine.
