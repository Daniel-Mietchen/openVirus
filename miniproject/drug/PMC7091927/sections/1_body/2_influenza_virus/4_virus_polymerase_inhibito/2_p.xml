<p id="Par12">Two approved drugs, ribavirin and T-705 (favipiravir), inhibit influenza viral RNA synthesis (
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Ribavirin is a synthetic nucleoside analog that is metabolized to the triphosphate form (Ribavirin-TP).

 </sup> Ribavirin-TP inhibits the RNA polymerase complex of influenza virus by competing with ATP and GTP.

 </sup> Ribavirin has not been used to treat influenza virus infection, but has been used for HCV infections along with pegylated interferon. T-705 is a pyrazine derivative that is metabolized to T705-4-ribofuranosyl-5′-triphosphate in cells.

 </sup> T705-4-ribofuranosyl-5′-triphosphate acts as a specific inhibitor of influenza virus RNA synthesis. T705-4-ribofuranosyl-5′-triphosphate directly inhibits viral RNA synthesis and is incorporated into synthesized RNA in the monophosphate form (T-705RMP) without chain termination.

 </sup> The incorporated T-705RMP can induce the mis-incorporation of incorrect nucleotides, so a large fraction of progeny virions from T-705-treated cells do not exhibit infectivity. T-705 has been approved for use against pandemic influenza infections in Japan.
