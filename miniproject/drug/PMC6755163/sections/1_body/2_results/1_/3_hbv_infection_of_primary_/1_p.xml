<p>HBV infection was performed using concentrated viral stocks prepared from HepAD38 cells (
 <xref rid="b20-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). According to our preliminary data, the hNTCP-complemented PPHs could be maintained for &gt;2 weeks post-HBV infection, whereas hNTCP-complemented PRHs could be maintained for 1 week (data not shown). Therefore, the experimental period was limited to 7 days post-infection (dpi). Following infection with HBV (MOI=1,000), all cell types without hNTCP exhibited either negative or reduced secretion of HBsAg/HBeAg, indicating that these cells were resistant to HBV infection. Following hNTCP complementation, Huh7D and PPHs, but not PRHs, were positive for HBsAg/HBeAg secretion, with continuously increased secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg until the end of culture (
