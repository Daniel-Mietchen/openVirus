<p>The use of animals close to 
 <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and 
 <italic>M. mulatta</italic> in the divergence tree for the isolation of primary hepatocytes may facilitate the HBV post-entry lifecycle. Based on the single-copy homologous genes of seven species (
 <xref rid="b18-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), a divergence tree was generated (
 <xref rid="f1-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The divergence years were estimated to be in the following order: 
 <italic>M. musculus</italic> and 
 <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> (84.9 million years) &gt; 
 <italic>O. cuniculus</italic> (69.8 million years) &gt; 
 <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and 
 <italic>M. mulatta</italic> (59.9 million years) &gt; 
 <italic>S. scrofa</italic> and 
 <italic>T. brasiliensis</italic>. Primary hepatocytes isolated from 
 <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and 
 <italic>M. mulatta</italic> fully support the HBV post-entry lifecycle, whereas hepatocytes from 
 <italic>M. musculus</italic> and 
 <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> are resistant (

 <xref rid="b6-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In addition, bats, such as 
 <italic>T. brasiliensis</italic>, carry pathogenic hepadnaviruses that are antigenically related to HBV and are capable of infecting human hepatocytes (
 <xref rid="b19-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), indicating that 
 <italic>T. brasiliensis</italic> hepatocytes may also facilitate the HBV post-entry lifecycle as hepadnaviruses are highly host selective. Notably, hepadnavirus has been detected in 
 <italic>S. scrofa</italic> (domestic pigs) (
 <xref rid="b20-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="b21-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and 
 <italic>O. cuniculus</italic> (rabbits), which may also be infected by an HBV-like virus (
 <xref rid="b22-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Therefore, easily obtained laboratory animals, such as pigs and rabbits, may be suitable as potential hosts for HBV infection after hNTCP complementation.
