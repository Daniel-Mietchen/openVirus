<p>PPHs and PRHs were isolated by a two-step collagenase digestion and plated on collagen-coated culture plates. PPHs were maintained in PMM (
 <xref rid="b4-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) for &gt;2 weeks and exhibited a typical highly differentiated morphology, such as spherical bright nuclei and a polarized shape (
 <xref rid="f2-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). However, PRHs rapidly deteriorated in PMM and died within 2 days (data not shown). Following optimization, PRHs could be maintained in PMM supplemented with 10% FBS for approximately 10â€“14 days and exhibited a typical highly differentiated morphology (
 <xref rid="f2-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The difference in maintenance medium between PPHs and PRHs indicated that PPHs may more closely resemble PHHs compared with PRHs, which matched the evolutionary distances identified in the divergence tree (
