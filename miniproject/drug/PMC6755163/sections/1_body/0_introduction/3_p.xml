<p>In the presence of hNTCP, hepatocytes from primates are susceptible to HBV infection, whereas mouse and rat hepatocytes resist HBV infection (

The generation of an easily obtained primary cell model for HBV infection based on other laboratory animals may be valuable for fundamental research on HBV infection and antiviral drugs. To achieve this goal, evolutionary distance was assessed based on single-copy homologous genes of seven species. The hepatocytes from candidate animals (pigs and rabbits) were then isolated, cultured and infected with hNTCP-recombinant lentivirus, followed by HBV infection. Anti-HBV drugs were also screened in the hNTCP-complemented hepatocytes.
