<p>The pooled patient serum used for this study was reported elsewhere (
 <xref rid="b8-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="b9-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), of which personal permissions were obtained from HBV-infected patients. HBV particles purified from patient serum were described previously (
 <xref rid="b12-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Briefly, Nycodenz (Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Ltd.) was dissolved in Hepato-STIM Hepatocyte Defined Medium (BD Biosciences). Serum from patients with HBV (viral load &gt;10
 <sup>8</sup> copies/ml) was loaded onto the Nycodenz gradient (range, 8–50%) in 11×34 mm polycarbonate centrifuge tubes (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). The samples were centrifuged in a TLS55 swing-out rotor (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) for 45 min at 200,000 × g at 20°C. Subsequently, 155 µl aliquots were consecutively removed (fractions 1 to 8). Fractions 6 and 7 were pooled with 8.4×10
 <sup>8</sup> HBV copies/ml, as measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR).
