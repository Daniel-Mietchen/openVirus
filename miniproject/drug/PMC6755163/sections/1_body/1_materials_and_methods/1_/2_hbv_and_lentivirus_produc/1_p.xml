 <xref rid="b11-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). HepAD38 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. For the production of HBV particles, HepAD38 cells were maintained in Williams E medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 5 µg/ml insulin, 18 ng/ml hydrocortisone and 2–2.5% DMSO. The culture media was collected at an interval of 3–4 days. Concentrated HBV infectious particles were repaired as previously reported (

The supernatant was then filtered through a 0.45-µm filter to remove any further debris. Subsequently, the supernatant was loaded into an ultrafiltration device with an intercepted molecular weight of 100 kDa (EMD Millipore) and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 30–60 min. The final volume for ultrafiltration was 250–500 µl, with a starting volume of 15 ml. The concentrated supernatant was collected and stored at −80°C. The hNTCP-recombinant lentivirus was produced as previously described (
