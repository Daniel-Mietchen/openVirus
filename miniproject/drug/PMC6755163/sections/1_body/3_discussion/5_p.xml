<p>Lempp 
 <italic>et al</italic> (
 <xref rid="b27-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) have reported that hNTCP is the limiting factor in HBV infection in pig hepatocytes, which was also demonstrated in the present study. In addition, the possibility of 
 <italic>O. cuniculus</italic> facilitating the HBV post-entry lifecycle was assessed and subsequently excluded from the present study, which supplemented the literature on potential animal hosts for HBV infection.
