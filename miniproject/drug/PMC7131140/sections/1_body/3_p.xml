<p id="para40">There are two main ways of treating viral infections: antibodies or small-molecule drugs. Antibodies are large proteins that bind to viruses and trigger their destruction. It can take our immune systems two weeks after a new infection to produce enough antibodies to fight it off. But this can be accelerated by injecting people with antibodies made by cells grown in a vat. This can keep viruses in check until your immune response kicks in fully.</p>
