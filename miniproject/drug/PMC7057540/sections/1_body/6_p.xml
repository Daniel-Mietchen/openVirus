<p>Limitations of the Zhang 
 <italic>et al</italic> paper include the retrospective nature of the data, emphasizing safety, but not providing details regarding antitumor response among those with our without antiviral therapy. Nor was there data regarding the need for corticosteroids for CPI toxicity management among either group. Additionally, there was no quantitation of viral DNA among those already receiving antiviral prophylaxis (simply called detectable). These questions will need to be answered in prospective evaluations.
