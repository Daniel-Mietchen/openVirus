<p>Zhang 
 <italic>et al</italic> additionally evaluated the development of hepatitis in all 114 patients treated with CPIs.
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> They describe all grade hepatitis in 35 patients (30.7%), and categorized these as HBV-related hepatitis in five patients (4.4%) and immune-related hepatitis in 15 patients (13.2%). They state that other hepatotoxicity was due to disease progression in the liver (nine patients) or to cytotoxic drugs (six patients). Grade 3/4 hepatitis was noted in four each with HBV-related hepatitis and immune-related hepatitis, as well as one each due to cytotoxic drug therapy and hepatic lesion progression. Twenty of 35 patients with all grade hepatitis had complete normalization of liver enzymes after a median of 3.5 weeks of antiviral treatment. Six patients required steroids for immune-related hepatitis and none experienced HBV reactivation. These findings provide useful guidelines for the management of cancer patients with chronic viral hepatitis or viral antigen positivity who are candidates for treatment with CPIs. The Zhang data provides encouraging support that antiviral prophylaxis is effective and safe in the setting of CPI therapy, both in terms of suppression of reactivation and management of immune-related hepatitis and suggests that careful viral monitoring will allow ongoing treatment.
