<p>A recent study of more than 3000 newly diagnosed cancer patients undergoing treatment at nine academic and nine community oncology institutions affiliated with the US Southwest Oncology Group Cancer Research network reported on the prevalence of HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and HIV infection among persons newly diagnosed with cancer.
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> As noted in this report, currently, in the US universal hepatitis viral screening is not routine in oncology practice. However, among the screened patients, the observed rate of prior HBV infection was 6.5% and chronic HBV was 0.6%. The observed rate of prior HCV infection was 2.4%. Importantly, eight patients with chronic HBV and 22 patients with HCV were newly diagnosed in this study. Additionally, four patients with HBV and 23 patients with HCV had no identifiable risk factors for viral infection. The authors conclude that in view of their study defining a level of unawareness of prior viral infection at the time of cancer diagnosis, screening for HBV and HCV may be warranted
