<p>Currently, there is enthusiasm for further evaluation of CPI therapy in patients with HCC, due to early reports of responsiveness to anti-PD-1 treatment. Prospective clinical trials are ongoing, in which chronic hepatitis viral carriers are required to receive antiviral therapy. In these trials, patients with HCC are routinely screened for viral markers which are utilized to monitor the course of treatment as well as the effectiveness of antiviral therapy.
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> These trials will provide important prospective data on management of virally infected patients receiving CPIs. However, another important observation from the Zhang report is that the majority of patients described with positive HBV antigen undergoing PD-1 inhibition therapy had cancer diagnoses other than HCC, including nasopharyngeal, melanoma, and non-small cell lung cancer, among others. The approach in Asia is to screen all cancer patients, regardless of diagnosis, for hepatitis virus infection, given the known high prevalence. This practice remains a question in other parts of the world, although viral screening prior to anti-CD20 therapy has become more common in the West.
