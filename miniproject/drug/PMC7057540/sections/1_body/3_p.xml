<p>In endemic geographic areas, cancer patients with chronic hepatitis viral infection are routinely managed with antiviral prophylaxis and treatment. Such patients were initially excluded from early clinical trials, particularly of immune-mediated therapy. Nevertheless, as CPIs have gained approval and availability, their use in this patient population has increased with the concomitant use of antiviral management, as has been done with other immunological agents such as anti-CD20 agents, among others. As of 2017, there were no reports of CPI related HBV reactivation.

 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Loomba and Liang comment that the mechanism of CPIs should perhaps not induce reactivation,
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> but given that enhanced cellular immune response is a component of HBV reactivation, CPI-related reactivation is still a potential concern. The exact mechanism of the complex interactions with this class of drugs and chronic HBV is yet to be fully elucidated.
