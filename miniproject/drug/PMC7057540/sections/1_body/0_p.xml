<p>Worldwide, more than 350â€‰million people have chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, with about 75% located in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Observations regarding HBV reactivation following perturbations of the immune system continue as a major research area in hepatology.
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> This is a subject critical to oncology, stem cell and solid organ transplantation, inflammatory diseases, and autoimmunity.
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> In oncology, evaluations have identified components leading to reactivation to include host tumor type (and relationship to viral etiology), viral serological status, the class of drug planned, and the duration of immune-perturbing therapy. In all of these clinical settings, components leading to reactivation include viral replication with direct viral cytotoxicity as well as immune reactivation following immune suppression leading to immune-mediated hepatic injury.
