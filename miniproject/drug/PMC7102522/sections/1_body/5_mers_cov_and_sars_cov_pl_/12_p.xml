 <italic>et al.</italic> reported the novel class of peptidomimetic MERS-CoV3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors that embody a piperidine moiety 
 <xref rid="bib0580" ref-type="bibr">[116]</xref>. These inhibitors were designed based on the dipeptidyl aldehyde bisulfite adduct inhibitor, designated GC376 (
 <bold>84</bold>, 
 <xref rid="fig0060" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref> ), which was clinically demonstrated for its efficacy. Attachment of the piperidine moiety to a dipeptidyl component permits the resultant hybrid inhibitor to engage in favorable binding interactions with the S3and S4 subsites of the enzyme. Some of these peptidomimetics showed excellent inhibition of MERS-CoV as well as the SARS-CoV infections (see, for example, compounds 
 <bold>85</bold>,
 <bold>86,</bold>
 <xref rid="fig0060" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>). Compounds 
 <bold>85</bold> and 
 <bold>86</bold> displayed potent inhibition toward MERS-CoV in both enzyme and cell-based systems, with low cytotoxicity (CC
 <sub>50</sub>&gt;100 μM).
