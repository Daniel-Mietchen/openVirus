<p id="par0175">It was reported that mature SARS 3CL protease is subject to degradation at the188Arg/189Gln site 
 <xref rid="bib0600" ref-type="bibr">[120]</xref>. Therefore, R188I mutant protease with high activity and stability was prepared. Kenichi et al were involved in developing inhibitors SARS 3CL R188I mutant protease. As a result, the compound

 <sub>50</sub> value of 98 nM 
 <xref rid="bib0590" ref-type="bibr">[118]</xref>. However, due to problems like enzymatic digestions of peptide chains and α-proton racemization, these compounds are not further taken forward. To solve this problem, they designed another derivative Sk23 (

 <xref rid="bib0605" ref-type="bibr">[121]</xref> with serine backbone against the mutant protease. The compound Sk23 (
 <xref rid="fig0055" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>) showed a weak inhibitory activity. In a way to develop small molecule inhibitors, they further investigated the structural modifications on the inhibitor SK23 and found isoserine backbone could be an alternative to the serine

 <xref rid="fig0055" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>) showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value 43 μM against the mutant protease. The compound further characterized for its microbial and cytotoxicity activities. However, it did not show inhibitory activities for any screened microbials and no cytotoxicity.
