<p id="par0145">Park 
 <italic>et al.</italic> assessed the inhibitory activity of polyphenols derived from 
 <italic>B. papyrifera</italic> against SARS- and MERS-CoVs 
 <xref rid="bib0515" ref-type="bibr">[103]</xref>. The isolated polyphenols markedly inhibited 3CL and PL CoV proteases of both SARS and MERS. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of these compounds, though higher than those of peptide-derived inhibitors, were still in the low micromolar range. In particular, the isolated compounds exerted significant SARS-CoV PL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitory activity through noncompetitive inhibition. Compounds 
 <bold>53</bold> and 
 <bold>54</bold>, showed the most potent PL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitory activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 9.2 and 3.7, respectively. Additionally, they performed detailed protein-inhibitor SPR-binding analyses of compound 
 <bold>54</bold> with SARS-CoV PL
 <sup>pro</sup>. Compound 
 <bold>54</bold> strongly inhibited the cleavage of both ubiquitin and ISG15 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 7.6 and 8.5 μM, respectively).
