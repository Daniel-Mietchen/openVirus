 <sup>pro</sup> but were inactive against SARS-CoV PL
 <sup>pro</sup>, suggesting the structural difference in the binding mode of both PL proteases. This was supported by the recent X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV PL
 <sup>pro</sup> complex with the lead inhibitors 
 <bold>50</bold> and 
 <bold>51</bold>. These structures revealed that inhibitors did not bind to the catalytic site of SARS CoV PL
 <sup>pro</sup> but to the BL2 loop, which appears to prevent the accessibility of substrate to the active site, and thereby inhibiting the enzymatic activity. Structural and sequence analysis at BL2 loop of SARS-CoV PLproand MERS CoV PL
 <sup>pro</sup> suggested that they both have a difference in key amino acid residues that are responsible for inhibitor binding. For example, Y269 and Q270 are responsible for inhibitor binding in SARS-CoV PL
 <sup>pro</sup>, whereas T274 and A275 in MERS CoV PL
 <sup>pro</sup>. These findings suggest that making dual inhibitors targeting PL
 <sup>pro</sup> of SARS-and MERS-CoVs is difficult.
