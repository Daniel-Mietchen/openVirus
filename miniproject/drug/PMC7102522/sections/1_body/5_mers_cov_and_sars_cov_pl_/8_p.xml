 <xref rid="bib0565" ref-type="bibr">113</xref> and could serve as potential leads for the future drug development for anti-coronavirus therapy. Pyrazolone based neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors 
 <bold>68–70</bold> (
 <xref rid="fig0050" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>) were reported to inhibit the MERS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> with moderate potencies in the range of 5.8-7.5 μM. The pharmacophore moieties phenyl at R3 and carboxylate, either R1 or R4 were suggested to be essential for the antiviral activity 
 <xref rid="bib0570" ref-type="bibr">[114]</xref>. A dipeptidyl transition state 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitor GC376 (
 <bold>71</bold>) inhibited the activity of MERS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.6 μM by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay

 <bold>72</bold>) as well as its derivatives 
 <bold>73</bold>-
 <bold>74</bold> displayed inhibition for MERS-CoV with EC50 values of 0.5 μM, 0.5 μM, and 0.8 μM in cell culture
