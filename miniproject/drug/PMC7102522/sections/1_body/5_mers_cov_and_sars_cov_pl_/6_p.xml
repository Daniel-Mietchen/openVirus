 <sup>pro</sup> are cysteine proteases, which are analogs to the main picornavirus 3C protease, a family of viruses that also cause respiratory illness. A broad-spectrum anti-CoV inhibitor N3 (

 <sup>pro</sup> with an IC

 <sup>pro</sup> was similar to the mechanism to other CoVs 
 <xref rid="bib0520" ref-type="bibr">[104]</xref>, as the inhibitor binds with the interface of domain I and II of MERS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> with an EC
