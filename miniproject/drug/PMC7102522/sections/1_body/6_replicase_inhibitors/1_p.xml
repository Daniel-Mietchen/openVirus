<p id="par0185">Helicases are ubiquitous proteins that are required for a wide range of biological processes, such as genome replication, recombination, displacement of proteins bound to NAs and chromatin remodeling. Helicase (nsP13) protein is a critical component, required for virus replication in host cells, and thus may serve as a feasible target for anti-MERS and anti-SARS chemical therapies.</p>
