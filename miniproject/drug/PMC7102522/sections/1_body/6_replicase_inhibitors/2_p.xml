 <xref rid="bib0620" ref-type="bibr">124</xref> reported a small 1,2,4-triazole derivative 
 <bold>87</bold> (SSYA10-001, see 
 <xref rid="fig0060" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>) that inhibited the viral NTPase/helicase (known as nonstructural protein 13, nsp13) of both SARS-and MERS-CoVs. The antiviral activity of 
 <bold>87</bold> inhibits MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV replication with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 25 μM and 7 μM, respectively, and no significant cytotoxicity was observed up to the concentration of 500 μM. There have been, so far, no helicase inhibitors approved antiviral therapy and thus compound 
 <bold>87</bold> could serve as a potential lead for the development of effective broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus drugs.
