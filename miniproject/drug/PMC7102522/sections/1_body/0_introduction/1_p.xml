<p id="par0005">Coronaviruses (CoVs) primarily cause multiple respiratory and intestinal infection in humans and animals 
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Although the history of CoVs began in the 1940’s 
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, the identification of first human CoVs were reported in the 1960’s, as causative agents for mild respiratory infections. Subsequently they were named as (i) human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E) and (ii) HCoV-OC43 
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. In the 1970’s, the discovery of new viruses, studies about the mechanism of action as well as the replication and pathogenesis of CoVs were active among virologists. This led to discovery of another four new human coronaviruses, namely (iii) HCoV- Hong Kong University 1 (HKU1) 
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> (iv) HCoV-NL63, (v) severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and (vi) Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. The first four CoVs are universally circulated and contribute approximately one-third of common cold in humans 
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, in severe cases, they can cause life-threatening pneumonia and bronchiolitis in children and immunocompromised individuals 
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> such as those undergoing chemotherapy and those with HIV-AIDS 
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Besides that, these four coronaviruses have been associated with enteric and neurological diseases 
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. In 2003, SARS-CoV was identified as a causative agent during the global pandemic SARS. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the emergence by SARS-CoV had affected 8422 cases in 32 countries, 916 of which died with the fatality rate of 10-15% 
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Following this outbreak, ten years after, another highly pathogenic coronavirus MERS-CoV epidemic surfaced in Middle Eastern countries in 2013 
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. However, the major outbreak was happened in the Republic of Korea in 2015 
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The virus infection was majorly observed in adults, although it can affect any age of people 
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Within a short time, the virus affected a total number of 1401 individuals, 543 of which died with the mortality of rate of ∼39% worldwide, while in Saudi Arabia alone it was 37.5%
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.In the last two decades, there have been extensive studies on theses human coronaviruses, especially on SARS- and MERS-CoVs that led not only to understand coronaviruses biology but has also driven the discovery of new therapeutics for in case if any future outbreaks. In this review, we focus on the recent development of inhibitors targeting coronaviruses.
