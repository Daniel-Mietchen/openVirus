 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) as a therapeutic intervention for SARS patients was associated with an increased 30-day mortality rate (adjusted OR = 26.0, 95% CI = 4.4–154.8). However, disseminated fungal infection and avascular osteonecrosis occurred following the prolonged systemic corticosteroid therapy

A randomized, placebo-controlled study showed that plasma SARS-CoV RNA levels in weeks 2-3 of the illness were higher in patients given hydrocortisone (n = 10) than those given normal saline (n = 7) in the early phase of the illness, suggesting that early use of pulsed methylprednisolone (
 <bold>3</bold>) might prolong viremia. In the case of patients with MERS, the combination of ritonavir (
 <bold>2</bold>) + interferon α2a or interferon α-2b resulted in no significant effect on clinical outcome; case-control study showed significantly improved survival (14 out of 20 and 7 out of 24 in the treated and control groups, respectively; P = 0.004) at 14 days, but not at 28 days
