<p id="par0020">The replication of coronavirus begins with the binding of its spike protein (S) on the cell surface molecules of the host. This receptor recognition is important for initiating virus entry into the host cells, thereby playing a major role in the tissue and host species tropism of viruses. The receptors used by all human CoV are known (see
