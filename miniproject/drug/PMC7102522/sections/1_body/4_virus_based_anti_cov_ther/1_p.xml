<p id="par0095">Despite their high species diversity, CoVs share key genomic elements that are essential for the design of therapeutic agents. The large replicase polyprotein 1a (pp1a) and pp1ab are processed and cleaved by two viral proteases, PL
 <sup>pro</sup>, and the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, to produce non-structural proteins (NSPs) such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and helicase, which are involved in the transcription and replication of the virus
