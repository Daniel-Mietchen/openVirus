<p id="par0120">Snijder et al reported alisporivir, a non-immunosuppressive cyclosporin A-analog (structure not shown), inhibited the replication of different human coronaviruses, including 229E, MERS- and SARS-coronavirus in low micromolar concentrations 
 <xref rid="bib0435" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>. Theinvestigation suggest that alisporivir inhibits MERS- and SARS-CoV replication by cell-culture based screening assays relying on the rapid cytopathic effect (CPE) observed in coronavirus-infected cells.
