 <xref rid="fig0065" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13</xref>), are membrane-binding photosensitizers that produce singlet oxygen molecules to induce changes in the properties of lipid membranes and prevent fusion between viral and target cell membranes. They exhibit broad-spectrum activities against numerous enveloped viruses and may be active against CoVs
