<p id="par0265">Several nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors have broad-spectrum activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses. Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitors such as ribavirin and mycophenolic acid inhibit an important step in 
 <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of nucleic acids (discussed earlier). Mizoribine, another IMPDH also proved to inhibit the synthesis of nucleic acids. Mizoribine (

 <xref rid="fig0070" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref> ), an approved immunosuppressant in organ transplantation with limited adverse side effects, has shown 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against HCV and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and was considered as an alternative to ribavirin/IFN combinations for treatment of HCV infections 
 <xref rid="bib0845" ref-type="bibr">[169]</xref> Mizoribine exerts its activity through selective inhibition of inosine monophosphate synthetase and guanosine monophosphate synthetase, resulting in the complete inhibition of guanine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation into nucleotides. The chemotherapeutic gemcitabine has shown 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (discussed earlier). Remdesivir (development code GS-5734, or 
 <bold>110</bold>, 
 <xref rid="fig0060" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>) is an antiviral drug, a novel nucleotide analog prodrug. It was developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections, though it has subsequently also been found to show reasonable antiviral activity against more distantly related viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, Junin virus, Lassa fever virus, and MERS-coronavirus 
 <xref rid="bib0850" ref-type="bibr">[170]</xref>. Remdesivir was rapidly pushed through clinical trials due to the 2013â€“2016 West African Ebola virus epidemic crisis, eventually being used in at least one human patient despite its early development stage at the time. Preliminary results were promising and it was used in the emergency setting for the 2018 Kivu Ebola outbreak along with further clinical trials.
