<p id="par0235">The entry of CoVs into host cells via the endosomal and/or cell surface pathways is facilitated by host proteases that cleave and activate S protein. Cathepsins are cysteine proteases that are involved in the endosomal pathway and can be inhibited by cathepsin inhibitors such as K11777 (

 <xref rid="bib0745" ref-type="bibr">[149]</xref>. These compounds seem to be safe and effective against various parasitic infections in animal models and have broad-spectrum activities against enveloped RNA viruses such as CoVs (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63), filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg viruses) and paramyxoviruses
