<p id="par0070">In a search of potential anti-viral agents against CoVs, de Wilde et al identified four drugs such as chloroquine (
 <bold>7</bold>), chlorpromazine (
 <bold>8</bold>), loperamide (
 <bold>9</bold>) and lopinavir (
 <bold>10</bold>) from the screening of FDA approved drugs library (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) 
 <xref rid="bib0325" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. They all were able to inhibit the replication of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV as well as HCoV-229E in the low micromolar range, which suggest that they could be used for the broad spectral anti-viral activity. As a mode of action, 7 inhibited the replication of MERS-CoV in a dose-dependent manner with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.0 μM and the inhibition contributed to the blockade of the virus at a very early stage. Compound 7 was previously reported as an effective anti-viral agent against flavivirus, influenza virus, HIV 
 <xref rid="bib0330" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, Ebola virus 
 <xref rid="bib0335" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, and Nipha-Hendra virus 
 <xref rid="bib0340" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Chlorpromazine (
 <bold>8</bold>) was another hit compound resulted from the screening and inhibited the replication of MERS-CoV with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 4.9 μM. Chlorpromazine (
 <bold>8</bold>) is the first antipsychotic drug developed for the treatment of schizophrenia 
 <xref rid="bib0345" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref> and mechanistically it inhibited the clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It has also been reported to inhibit the replication of hepatic C virus 
 <xref rid="bib0350" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref> (HCV), alphavirus 
 <xref rid="bib0355" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-2) 
 <xref rid="bib0360" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref> and other coronavirus SARS-CoV 
 <xref rid="bib0365" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. The mechanistic study of chlorpromazine (
 <bold>8</bold>) on MERS-CoV indicated that it inhibited the virus at both an early and postentry stage, suggesting that an effect on clathrin-mediated endocytosis was not only the sole antiviral mechanism. Loperamide (
 <bold>9</bold>), an antidiarrheal opioid receptor agonist, which reduces intestinal motility 
 <xref rid="bib0370" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>, inhibited the replication of MERS-CoV. Additionally, it inhibited the other two coronaviruses in the low micromolar range (4 to 6 μM). Lopinavir (
 <bold>10</bold>) is an anti-HIV protease inhibitor, which also inhibited the replication of MERS-CoV with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 8.0 μM. It was previously reported to inhibit the SARS-CoV main protease (Mpro) 
 <xref rid="bib0375" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref> and therefore, it was presumed that it might also target the M
 <sup>pro</sup> of MERS-CoV.
