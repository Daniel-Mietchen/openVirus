  <p>Electrophoresis analysis in nondenaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel of single-stranded oligonucleotides S1* and S2*, duplex (S1* + S2*) and their complexes with helicase UL9. Lanes 1 and 2, electrophoresis mobilities of the free oligonucleotides S1* and S2*, respectively. Lanes 3 and 4, mobilities of complexes of the oligonucleotides S1* and S2* with the protein UL9, respectively. Lanes 5 and 6, mobilities of the duplex (S1* + S2*) in the absence and presence of OBP, respectively. The mixture of OBP with duplex (S1* + S2*) was incubated for 60 min at 42°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) in the presence of 5 mM dithiothreitol; 15 mM MgCl
   <sub>2</sub>, 10% (v/v) glycerol; .01% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 3 mM ATP. The reaction mixture was then cooled to 25° C and loaded on a 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel with a .4 mm thickness and acryl/bis-acrylamide ratio of 29:1. Electrophoresis was carried out for 130 min at 650 V and temperature 22 °C.
