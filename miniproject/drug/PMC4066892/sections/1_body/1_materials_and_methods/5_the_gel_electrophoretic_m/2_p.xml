<p>Equimolar amounts of two or three single-stranded oligonucleotides (S3, S7 and S8) were mixed in 100mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8). The oligonucleotides were annealed by heating at 90 °C and then allowing the samples to cool to room temperature overnight. The duplexes were isolated by nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel with subsequent elution. Duplexes were precipitated with one volume of isopropanol, washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and dissolved in water. The duplexes were incubated with 2 µl OBP (3 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> M dimers) for 1 h at 39° C in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) in the presence of 5 mM dithiothreitol; 15 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 10% (v/v) glycerol; .01% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 10 mM ATP. The reaction mixtures (10 µl) were loaded in a nondenaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel with a .4 mm thickness. Radioactive bands were visualized by phosphoimager.
