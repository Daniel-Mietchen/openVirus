<p>Absorption spectra were measured on a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were measured on a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter. The experiments were performed in 20mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 4mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 10% glycerol, .18 M NaCl, .01% Triton X-100, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Prior to the experiments, bis-netropsins were dissolved in a small volume of ethanol (≈20 μl) and then added in the buffer solution. The quenching of the donor fluorescence by the nonradiative transfer of the electron excitation energy from the donor to the acceptor (
