<p>Pt-bis-Nt and Pt*-bis-Nt contain a glycinated cis-diammino-platinum-group which bridges two netropsin-like fragments. 15Lys-bis-Nt and Lys-bis-Nt contain a triglycine and cadaverine residue, respectively, as a linker between two netropsin-like fragments. Synthesis of Pt-bis-Nt and related molecules were carried as described elsewhere (
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Grokhovsky et al., 1992</xref>). The main distinction of di-N-propyl pyrrolecarboxamide fragment of each bis-netropsin from the parent antibiotic netropsin (Nt) was that the N-methylpyrrole ring replaced N-propylpyr-role, the C-terminal amidine group of netropsin was replaced by the tertiary amine residue and the guanydylacetic acid residue was replaced by glycine residues. These replacements enhanced the stability of bis-linked netropsin derivatives in aqueous solutions. Concentrations of bis-linked netropsin were determined spectrophotometrically by using a molar extinction coefficient of 42,000 M
