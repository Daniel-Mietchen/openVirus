<p>In these studies, we also used duplexes formed upon annealing of the oligonucleotides S12 and S11 or S10 and S11 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, panel B). These fluorescent DNA fragments contained Box I and Box II sequences which are separated by the A + T spacer. The weak binding site for helicase (Box III) was absent. The fluorescence spectra of the duplexes (S10 + S11) and (S12 + S11) recorded in the absence and presence of OBP are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>. Here, curves 1 and 2 correspond to the fluorescence spectra of the duplexes (S10 + S11) and (S12 + S11) in the absence of helicase UL9. These spectra practically coincide. After addition of the OBP, the fluorescence intensity of the duplex (S12 + S11) carrying both the fluorophore and the quencher diminishes significantly (nearly 4-fold), while that of the system containing the (S10+S11) duplex carrying no quencher, decreases by about 20% in the presence of OBP. Clearly, in the latter case, we deal with the quenching effect which is associated with the interaction of OBP with the fluorophore conjugated with (S10 + S11) duplex.
