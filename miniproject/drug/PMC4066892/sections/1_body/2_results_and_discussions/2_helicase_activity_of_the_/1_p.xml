<p>Annealing of the S5 and S2 oligonucleotides gives a duplex containing an A + T-rich segment and nucleotide sequences corresponding to Boxes I and III in OriS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In solution, the oligonucleotide S5 can spontaneously form hairpin-shaped structures one of which is enriched with GC pairs present in Boxes I and III. Its melting temperature determined in this study is 83 °C. The second hairpin is enriched with AT base pairs, it is unstable and fully melts at 45 °C (
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Aslani et al., 2001</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). In free solutions, the oligonucleotides S5 and S6 assume stem and loop structures in which the 5′- and 3′-ends are held at a short distance from one another. This led us to suggest that under conditions where the binding of UL9 helicase to the duplex is coupled with strand separation and formation of a stem-loop structure in each strand, the donor and acceptor molecules tethered with the 5′- and 3′-ends of the oligonucleotide S5 become spatially approximated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This leads to the quenching of the donor fluorescence by the acceptor. The structure of the S5 oligonucleotide is reminiscent of a molecular beacon, viz., a hairpin-shaped single-stranded oligonucleotide labeled with a fluorophore at one end and a quencher at the other end. In solution, the oligonucleotide can form stem and loop structure stabilized by intramolecular pairing of Box I and Box III sequences. The stem holds the fluorophore and the quencher close to each other, a feature responsible for the quenching of the fluorophore fluorescence by the FRET mechanism. The loop portion of the beacon probe sequence can be designed to be complementary to the target single-stranded oligonucleotide. During hybridization, the loop portion of the beacon is paired with the target oligonucleotide segment. A rigid rod-like structure is formed between the beacon probe and the target oligonucleotide, while the beacon stem disrupted. As a consequence, the fluorescence intensity increases dramatically. This provides a basis for the application of molecular beacon probes as sensitive tools for detecting target sequences in single-stranded DNA. Molecular beacon probes can also be used to monitor helicase action (
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Belon et al., 2010</xref>). We found that the fluorescence intensity of the free S5 oligonucleotide is lower than that of the duplex (S5 + S9) carrying the fluorophore and the quencher which are separated by a larger distance. After addition of OBP to the S5 oligonucleotide and the (S5 + S9) duplex in the absence of ATP and ICP8, the fluorescence intensities decrease (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, panel A). Substantially lower quenching was observed on adding OBP to the oligonucleotide S4 and duplex (S4+ S9) containing no quencher. Evidently, in these systems, the quenching is not attributed to the energy transfer process and mediated by direct contact of OBP with the fluorophore. The fluorescence spectra of the (S5 + S9) duplex and the single-stranded oligonucleotide S5 recorded in the absence and presence of OBP are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, panel A. Curves 1 and 2 represent the fluorescence spectra of the (S5 + S9) duplex in the absence and presence of OBP; curves 3 and 4 correspond to the fluorescence spectra of the free oligonucleotide S5 0.18 M NaCl and its complex with OBP, respectively. Curves 5 and 7 represent the fluorescence spectra of (S4 + S9) duplex and oligonucleotide S4, respectively.
