 <sub>D,OBP</sub> and

 <sub>DA,OBP</sub> are the fluorescence intensities of the donor in the complexes of OBP with the duplexes (S10 + S11) and (S12 + S11), respectively. The DNA oligomer concentrations and the molar ratio of helicase to DNA oligomer for these two complexes practically coincide. The estimated values of distances between the fluorophore and quencher are based on

 <sub>DA,OBP</sub>/
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>D,OBP</sub> for complexes of OBP with the duplexes (S10 + S11) and (S12 + S11) is ≈.35 and the distance between the fluorophore and the quencher, 
 <italic>R</italic> ≈ 57 Å. Since linear DNA contains 63 base pairs, our FRET studies indicated that on binding of OBP dimers to Boxes I and II the DNA underwent structural changes for which interactions between bound helicase dimers are responsible. These results are supported by electron microscopy data suggesting that the interaction between OBP dimers bound to Boxes I and II results in DNA bending (by approx. 90°) and destabilization of AT base pairs in the AT spacer (

In addition, there is evidence that binding of OBP to negatively supertwisted DNA-containing OriS converts the structure of the AT spacer into a form sensitive to digestion by micrococcal nuclease and to oxidation by potassium permanganate (
