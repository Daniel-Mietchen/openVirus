<p>Similar results were obtained for complexes of OBP with duplexes (S5 + S2) and partial duplex (S5 + S9) and (S4 + S9). In the absence of OBP, the distance between the fluorophore and the quencher in the partial duplex (S5 + S9) is equal to 79 Å. It markedly exceeds the value of 51Å determined for the fluorophore-quencher distance in the single-stranded oligonucleotide S5. In the presence of OBP (4.9 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup> M), the fluorescence intensity measured for partial duplex (S5 + S9) decreases reflecting the change in a distance between the fluorophore and quencher. The experimental value of
