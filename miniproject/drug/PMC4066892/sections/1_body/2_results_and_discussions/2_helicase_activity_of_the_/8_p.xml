<p>A model consistent with the FRET data is that in which two DNA duplexes each forming the 1:1 complex with OBP dimer associate to form a 4-ways Holiday junction (HJ) containing Box I and Box III inverted repeats. It is noteworthy that OriL contains two pairs of Box I and Box III sites which are separated by AT-rich segment. In contrast, OriS contains Box I and Box II sequences separated by AT-rich segment, but it has only a single copy of Box III sequence. X-ray diffraction studies show that two DNA strands in the antiparallel 4-ways HJ preserve their usual helical conformations, with the other two strands undergoing conformation changes and serving as the crossover strands (

 <italic>E. coli</italic> helicases RuvAB, UvrD, and RecG which play key roles in DNA recombination, repair and replication processes (

 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Gopal, Guo, &amp; Van Duyne, 1998</xref>) and some endonucleases bind and resolve HJs (

 <italic>E. coli</italic> protein RuvA recognizes HJ and in combination with another protein RuvB catalyzes migration of branch point and unwinding of HJ (

 <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Rafferty et al., 1996</xref>). In the 3D structure of a complex formed by RuvA tetramer with synthetic HJ, the alpha-helix-hairpin-alpha-helix (HhH) domains of RuvA monomers are implicated in hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction with sugar-phosphate backbone of four HJ arms (

 <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Nishino et al., 1998</xref>; 
 <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Rafferty et al., 1996</xref>). Each RuvA monomer contains two consecutive HhH domains related by approximate twofold symmetry which are bridged by a connector alpha helix (

 <xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Shao &amp; Grishin, 2000</xref>). This structural unit is designated as the (HhH)
 <sub>2</sub> motif. A characteristic feature of (HhH)
 <sub>2</sub> motif is that the hairpin loops are enriched by glycine and proline residues and often contain hydrophobic residues surrounded by two glycine residues (

 <xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Shao &amp; Grishin, 2000</xref>). In the (HhH)
 <sub>2</sub> motif of RuvA monomer, the hairpin loops are separated by 30 residues. The structure of (HhH)
 <sub>2</sub> motif is known to be stabilized by interactions between hydrophobic residues present in characteristic positions in alpha helices and hairpin loops (

 <xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Shao &amp; Grishin, 2000</xref>). An important property of HJ is its ability to undergo branch migration through regions of sequence homology. This process involves the melting and annealing of base pairs and results in movement of the branch point along the arms of the junction. The HJ may be considered as an intermediate for conversion of each DNA strand into the hairpin-like form stabilized by complementary pairing of Box I and Box III sequences in OriS.
