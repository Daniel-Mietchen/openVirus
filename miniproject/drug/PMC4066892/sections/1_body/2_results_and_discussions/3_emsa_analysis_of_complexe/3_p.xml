<p>In the oligomer (S3 + S7 + S8) and partial duplexes (S5 + S9), (S4 + S9), and (S3 + S6) the upper oligonucleotide strand contains single-stranded tail at 3′-end. To obtain the (S3 + S7 + S8) oligomer or (S5 + S9) duplex, the complementary strands at equimolar concentrations were annealed at 90°C with subsequent 8–10 h cooling to room temperature.</p>
