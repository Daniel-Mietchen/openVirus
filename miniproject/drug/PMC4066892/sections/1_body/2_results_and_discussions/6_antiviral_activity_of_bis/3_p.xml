<p>In this study, 15Lys-bis-Nt and Lys-bis-Nt were used in the form of .075% and .15% polyethyleneglycol (PEG-600)-based ointments. Their pronounced curative effect on skin injuries in HSV1-infected guinea pigs was commensurate to that of 5% acyclovir-based ointment. The virus-containing inepidermic material was rubbed into dehaired scarified zones (âˆ¼5 cm
 <sup>2</sup> each) 48 h after the appearance of the first hyperemic symptoms. The ointment was applied two times a day for five days. In the control group, specific symptomatology (herpetic skin rash) appeared on day 5 after infection and was especially well pronounced by day 10. Complete recovery occurred on day 12.
