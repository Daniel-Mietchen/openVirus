 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figure 11</xref> shows the EMSA analysis of the products present in the reaction mixture after incubation of the oligomer (S3* + S7* + S8*) with OBP and ATP for 30 min at 37 °C and subsequent cooling of the reaction mixture to room temperature. EMSA studies show that the amount of free radioactively labeled oligomers (S3* + S7 + S8*) in the solution decreased after addition of OBP. Slowly migrating species are formed that may represent a 4-ways HJ built by two oligomers (S3* + S7* + S8*) each forming a 1:1 complex with OBP. After incubation of the reaction mixture at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of ATP and Mg
 <sup>+2</sup> ions, the presumed complex of HJ with OBP (designated as X+UL9) partially dissociates, and a slowly migrating complex of OBP with a folded form of oligonucleotide S3* is observed. In addition, free (S3* + S7* + S8*) oligomers and oligonucleotide S8* are also present in the reaction mixture (

 <sup>+2</sup> ions is reminiscent of complexes of UvrD and RecG helicases with synthetic HJs (
