<p>The time courses of the fluorescence intensities of the reaction mixtures containing single-stranded oligonucleotide S6 and duplex (S3 + S6) in the presence of OBP and ATP are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref> (panels A and B). In the absence of OBP, substantial quenching is observed in the single-stranded oligonucleotide S6 in comparison with duplex (S3 + S6). It reflects the fact that oligonucleotide S6 exists in a hairpin-like conformation in solution. Addition of OBP to the (S3 + S6) duplex leads to approximately fivefold decrease in the intensity of fluorescence at 559 nm, whereas a ninefold decrease in the fluorescence intensity is observed for a mixture of the single-stranded oligonucleotide S6 and OBP under the same conditions.
