<p>In the presence of Pt-bis-netropsin, the quenching process induced after addition of OBP proceeds more slowly. The characteristic time of the reaction (

 <sub>1</sub>) increases from 36 to 65 min (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figures 10</xref>, panels A and B). The addition of ATP to the reaction mixture containing OBP and (S3 + S7 + S8) oligomers leads to an increase of the fluorescence intensity at 559 nm, reflecting a change in the distance between the fluorophore and quencher. The average distance between the donor (R6G) and the acceptor (Cy5) may increase due to a partial dissociation of the oligonucleotide S8 from the ternary complex (S3 + S7 + S8).
