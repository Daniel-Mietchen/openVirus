 <sub>0</sub> is the fluorescence intensity of the free (S3 + S7 + S8) oligomer excited at 620 nm and measured at 670 nm. ATP added to the reaction mixture in the absence of Pt-bis-netropsin stimulated the time-dependent quenching of the fluorescence at 670 nm, which reflected the unwinding and partial dissociation of the S8 oligonucleotide. In the free solution, the S8 oligonucleotide can spontaneously fold into a hairpin-like structure. The conversion is accompanied by quenching of the Cy5 fluorescence (
