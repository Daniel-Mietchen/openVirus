<p>On the DNA fragment used in footprinting studies, Pt-bis-Nt protects the A + T cluster present in OriS as well as DNA segments containing two symmetry-related tetramers composed of adenine and thymine residues which are separated by one or two GC base pairs. One obvious example is the DNA segment carrying the sequence 5′-TATAGGTATA-3′. In this DNA region a clear footprint is observed at concentration as low as 3.3 µM Pt-bis-Nt. Interestingly, in the presence of Pt*-bis-Nt, the protective effect is not observed at this site, even at 3 times higher concentration.</p>
