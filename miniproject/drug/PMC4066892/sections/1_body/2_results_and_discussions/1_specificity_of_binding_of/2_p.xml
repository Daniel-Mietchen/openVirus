<p>As can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, both bis-netropsins protect the A + T cluster from cleavage by DNase I. From the concentration dependencies of the protective activity, we conclude that Pt-bis-netropsin at low extents of binding exhibits a stronger affinity for the A + T cluster and protects a longer DNA region than Pt-bis-netropsin under the same conditions. Previous studies showed that Lys-bis-Nt and 15Lys-bis-Nt also bind selectively to long clusters of AT base pairs (
