<p>In the present studies, we used OBP and fluorescently labeled OriS DNA fragments. Prior to experiment, the HSV1 UL9 gene (strain L
 <sub>2</sub> from the State Virus Collection of D.I. Ivanovsky Institute of Virology) was amplified by PCR, inserted into plasmid pET14 and expressed in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. The recombinant UL9 protein forms specific complexes with Boxes I and II in OriS and is endowed with helicase and ATPase activities (
