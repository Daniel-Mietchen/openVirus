<p id="Par68">The multidrug resistance offered by carbapenem-resistant 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (CRE) (family: Enterobacteriaceae; class: Gammaproteobacteria) against third-line antibiotics can be attributed to its ability to develop biofilm(s). Such process involves adhesion and quorum-sensing induced colonization, leading to biomass development. Studies conducted at INMAS by our group have explored the anti-adhesion, anti-quorum sensing and anti-biofilm potential of 05 pre-standardized potent herbals (Thakur et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2016a</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">b</xref>). 
 <italic>Berberis aristata</italic> (PTRC-2111-A) exhibited maximum potential vis-Ã -vis these activities, while 
 <italic>Holarrhena antidysenterica</italic> (PTRC-8111-A) showed only anti-quorum sensing potential as compared to standards/antibiotics. These findings are in line with the molecular docking analysis of phytoligands against Lux S and Pilin receptors. Additionally, pairwise correlation analysis of the tested activities with qualitative, quantitative and bioactivity functional descriptors revealed that an increased content of alkaloid, moderate content of flavonoids and decreased content of tannins supported anti-adhesion, anti-quorum sensing and anti-biofilm potential activities. Besides, nitric oxide and superoxide scavenging activity correlated with anti-quorum sensing activity. The findings indicated clearly that 
 <italic>B. aristata</italic> (family: Berberidaceae) and 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> (family: Theaceae) are potent herbals with significant therapeutic potential for the management of CREs (Fig.
