<p id="Par65">The rapid development of antimicrobial resistance amongst microbes poses serious public health concerns. As per the WHO, antibiotic resistance is a major threat to global health, food security and development in todayâ€™s scenario. Though antibiotic resistance develops in microbes naturally, the extensive and indiscriminate use of antibiotics in humans and animals accelerates the process leading to the development of antibiotic resistance leading to plethora of microbes becoming drug-resistant posing grave concerns to humanity. Increasingly, diseases like pneumonia, tuberculosis and gonorrhoea are becoming harder to treat as the antibiotics used to treat them are becoming ineffective. Antibiotic resistance is fast becoming a major problem necessitating to longer stays in hospital and resulting in higher medical costs and increased mortality. Developing countries cannot afford the additional financial burden posed by this major problem. In addition, multidrug-resistant microbes can also pose biothreat concerns if used inappropriately by certain nefarious people to disrupt military as well as civil populations.</p>
