<p id="Par69">Further we carried out studies using an aquo-ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> (PTRC-31911-A), standardized using Fourier-transform infrared analysis, which revealed the presence of seven common functional groups (Thakur et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2016a</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">b</xref>). Combinations of PTRC-31911-A with third-line antibiotics (n = 5) were tested against carbapenem-resistant 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Combination modality revealed synergistic behaviour (fractional inhibitory concentration indices &lt; 1) with tigecycline, ertapenem, meropenem, colistin and augmentin. The lead combination of PTRC-31911-A + ertapenem or meropenem showed maximum augmentative potential at a dose of 50 and 100 μg/mL, respectively, with nearly fivefold decrease in minimum inhibitory concentrations as compared with the respective antibiotics alone. The synergistic effects implied that the antibacterial combinations of PTRC-31911-A and ertapenem, meropenem, colistin, tigecycline or augmentin are more effective than monotherapy with either of these antibiotics.
