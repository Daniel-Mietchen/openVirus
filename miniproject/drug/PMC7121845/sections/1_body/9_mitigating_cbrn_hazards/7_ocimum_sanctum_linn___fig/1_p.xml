<p id="Par62">The radioprotective properties of tulsi (
 <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic>) have been demonstrated at INMAS and taken to phase II clinical trials at the Advanced Centre for Treatment Research and Education at the Tata Memorial Centre in Mumbai. Undoubtedly, the preliminary results have been promising; however, the limitation of using total body irradiation as a clinical model for testing of radiation countermeasures has to be kept in mind, and its extrapolation to normal individuals who might be exposed to radiation needs to be considered in an unbiased manner. The radioprotectors developed at INMAS can ameliorate the adverse effects of radiotherapy in cancer patients and have immense potential.
