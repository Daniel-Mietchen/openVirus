<p id="Par63">From a military perspective, behavioural radioprotectors are of immense importance since they can help improve the performance of soldiers and emergency first responders who may have to operate during crucial rescue and recovery missions during radiological/nuclear incidents. They can also be used by Air Force fighter pilots and in a naval setting. At INMAS, we have investigated 
 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic>, 
 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> and 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> and found them to render efficient behavioural radioprotection in rodent model system if administered prior to radiation exposure (Goel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2006</xref>; Haksar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2006</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2009</xref>). A fairly narrow window of protection currently makes them appear suitable only for planned radiation exposures. However, their efficacy in postirradiation scenario and validation in higher animal models remains to be done.
