 <italic>Hippophae rhamnoides</italic> has been tested for its anti-dengue potential (Jain et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2008</xref>). Dengue virus occurs as four distinct serotypes, viz. dengue 1, 2, 3 and 4. Symptomatic dengue virus infection ranges from a self-limited febrile illness and dengue fever to a more severe disease, dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. Medical treatment of dengue poses serious issues as virtually no targeted therapeutic agents are available to treat the disease and consequently whatever treatment is given is mostly supportive in nature. Jain et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2008</xref>) evaluated the anti-dengue activity of 
 <italic>Hippophae rhamnoides</italic> leaf extract in dengue virus type II infected blood-derived human macrophages. The dengue virus-infected cells were treated with 
 <italic>Hippophae rhamnoides</italic> leaf extract and compared with the commercially available antiviral drug – ribavirin. The extract was able to maintain the cell viability of dengue-infected cells at par with ribavirin, along with the decrease and increase in TNF-α and IFN-γ, respectively. Anti-dengue activity of 
 <italic>Hippophae rhamnoides</italic> extract was further determined by the traditional plaque assay. The results suggested that the 
 <italic>Hippophae rhamnoides</italic> leaf extract has significant anti-dengue activity and has potential for the treatment of dengue.
