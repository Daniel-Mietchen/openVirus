<p id="Par71">There is a dearth of antiviral drugs in modern systems of medicine due to the rapid rate of mutation found in viruses. Viral pathogens pose a serious threat, especially the clinical viruses (HIV, hepatitis viruses, etc.), natural emerging viruses (avian and swine influenza strains, SARS, novel H1N1, H1N5, etc.) and viruses relevant to potential bioterrorism (Ebola, smallpox, etc.) (Rider et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2011</xref>). Unfortunately, there are relatively few prophylactics or therapeutics available for management of viral diseases and pandemics (Arora et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2010f</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2011</xref>). A plethora of medicinal plants exhibit promise for the treatment of viral infections, as several of them possess potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity (Arora et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2011</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2013</xref>). In the past, evaluation of antiviral activity of medicinal plants was constrained in view of the highly infectious nature of viruses and lack of suitable separation techniques for the identification of antiviral components. Development of vector-based strategies, in which non-infectious molecular clone of a virus is used for antiviral screening purposes and advancement in separation technologies, has offered promise for medicinal plants usage in modern antiviral drug discovery (Mukhtar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2008</xref>). With increase in the virulence of viruses, emergence of new viral strains and non-availability of broad-spectrum synthetic drugs, there is a need to explore plants for the development of new and potent antiviral drugs.
