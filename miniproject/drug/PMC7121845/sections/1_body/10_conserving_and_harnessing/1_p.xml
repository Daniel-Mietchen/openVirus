<p id="Par77">Defence Institute of High Altitude Research (DIHAR) has established a permafrost-based plant germplasm storage facility and modern laboratory at Chang La top (5360Â m AMSL) in Ladakh exploiting the naturally existing sub-zero temperature in the region for most parts of the year (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig32" ref-type="fig">32</xref>). The facility provides an insurance against both incremental and catastrophic loss of the plant diversity. The preserved diversity of the genes will serve as a safety net for current and future food security in an era of global warming and climate change. The facility is being utilized by DRDO and ICAR for storage of germplasm of economically important plant species for posterity. The facility will serve as a backup of important germplasm for posterity.
