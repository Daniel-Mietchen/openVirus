<p id="Par10">DRDO has been making concerted efforts towards research and development of herbal products with the aim of providing solutions to the unique problems faced by the Armed Forces. Some areas of research where DRDO is focussing its attention vis-Ã -vis herbal technology development are highlighted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Documentation of traditional knowledge on herbs of some of the inaccessible areas of the country, mainly high altitude, desert and remote regions of the country, has been carried out. Research to generate scientific data on herbs and their products are under way to explore their potential as antioxidants, immunomodulators, CBRN countermeasures and antistress agents, which would help in improving and protecting the health of troops who are exposed to various occupational and other hazards.
