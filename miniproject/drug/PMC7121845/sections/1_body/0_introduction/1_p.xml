<p id="Par2">India’s military is a human-intensive workforce with nearly 1.3 million defence personnel and over 2.0 million personnel in reserve. In addition, to cater to the nation’s security needs – both external and internal – India has over 1.0 million paramilitary personnel. The military personnel are deployed in diverse harsh environmental conditions to guard national sovereignty under diverse geoclimatic conditions and diverse terrains exposing them to unique conditions that are not perhaps encountered anywhere elsewhere on the globe. Homeland security is an important component of national security. The paramilitary and military personnel inevitably have to participate in low-intensity conflict (LIC) theatres also. Besides, the Indian military has always risen to the occasion and helped in disaster management, whenever there has been a natural calamity. The Indian military personnel have also been an integral part of several successful UN peacekeeping missions.</p>
