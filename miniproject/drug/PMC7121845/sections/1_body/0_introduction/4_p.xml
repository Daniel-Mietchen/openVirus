<p id="Par5">The operational needs of the Indian Defence Forces necessitate operations under unforgiving and inhospitable environments, which can severely impact both physical and cognitive performance of the personnel. The Life Sciences laboratories of DRDO are engaged in R&amp;D with the aim to develop processes, products and technologies and effective strategies to protect and enhance the operational efficiency of the Indian Armed Forces. The mandate of the Life Sciences laboratories in Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is to optimize performance of the of the human-intensive combat force, create soldier-system fit in the various weapon development programmes and help them in meeting the unique operational requirements in conventional and nonconventional warfare situations. The R&amp;D activities of the laboratories are focussed on recruitment, selection and development of appropriate human capital, development of intricate life support systems and technologies to protect against extreme and toxic/lethal environments, promotion of health and well-being of warfighter and development of strategic support systems. The fields of research encompass protective equipments and clothing, physiological-psychological aspects, protection against nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) warfare and high-altitude agro-animal technologies to meet fresh food requirement of troops at high altitudes, exploiting bioenergy as emergency fuel and meeting instant food requirements for high-altitude battlefield operations.</p>
