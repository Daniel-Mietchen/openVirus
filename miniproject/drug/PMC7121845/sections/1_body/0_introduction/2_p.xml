<p id="Par3">Keeping the physical and mental health of soldiers is paramount from an operational perspective. In addition, they need to be updated and trained to be able to utilize state-of-the-art technologies. They need to be ever vigilant, be prepared for handling any situation and protecting national interests in a rapidly changing world. In order to keep the military fighting fit for operations, there is a need to equip the soldiers with state-of-the-art technologies, often disruptive technologies, products, processes and requisite paraphernalia with a human engineering perspective to support them and handle today’s VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) environment. DRDO well realizes that this can be only accomplished through continuous, concerted R&amp;D with a focus on new technologies and product development, synergizing the private industry sector along with academia. Today’s military operations have to be conducted seamlessly, irrespective of environmental stressors like sub-zero temperatures, torrential rains, snow, extremes of humidity, lashing winds, extreme heat, etc. and/or in a nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) environment. In the Indian military context, the environmental hazards posed due to the geographical locale often prove more lethal to the health of a soldier than the military operation itself. More than the threat from enemy bullets is the threat of fluid loss from the body under desert conditions or frostbite and high-altitude pulmonary oedema on mountaintops in winter. High pressure of the water column can limit the performance of submariners. Even those who escape sickness may face problems of performance at altitudes in the Eastern and Western Himalayas, where the atmosphere is rarefied due to low oxygen availability. In fact in Siachen sector, more lives have been lost due to the environmental conditions rather than military operations in this ruthless sector.</p>
