<p id="Par7">The Life Sciences group of laboratories of DRDO have made significant contributions towards improving the health and performance of soldiers deployed at high altitude, cold, desert, under water, both in air and space and low-intensity conflict areas. The various labs have also made immense progress in agriculture and food technology for adverse environments such as extreme altitude, space, etc. Further, these labs are also engaged in the development of novel technologies to detect, decontaminate and protect against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) threats. Research in the various laboratories and sponsored projects cover an entire gamut of areas ranging from biomedical, food and high-altitude agro-animal and bioenergy research. Development of herbal technologies is an important area of research where attention is being focused in DRDO, in keeping with prevalence of rich traditions of diverse systems of medicine in India that have been tried, tested and proved over a period of thousands of years. Perhaps no other system of medicine has stood the test of time for such a long period.</p>
