The low-intensity conflicts usually involve contiguous regions/states and ultimately aim to destabilize and weaken the nation. India has witnessed several low-intensity conflicts of varying nature, degree and contexts, and these pose immense problems to law enforcement agencies in general and the military in particular for handling such issues with a sense of responsibility. Use of force under difficult inevitable circumstances often results in death or maiming of local populations leading to immense furore, e.g. the use of pellet guns to disperse mobs in North India resulted in serious eye injuries to several people. Subsequently, the Supreme Court of India ruled that being a welfare state, it is the duty of the government to ensure safety of its people as well as security forces. With a view to managing LIC operations less fatally, oleoresin-based products like Capsispray™/Capsigrenade™ – an eco-friendly, less-than-lethal weapon, based on oleoresin extract of chilli (Bhut Jolokia,
