<p id="Par42">In snowbound areas of the high mountains, one of the major problems encountered is frostbite, which if not treated timely can lead to irreparable tissue damage leading to amputation of the affected parts. DRDO has attempted to develop appropriate prophylactics and curative measures to solve this problem often encountered by soldiers operating at high altitude. Based on extensive research, an 
 <italic>Aloe vera</italic>-based cream has been developed by DRDO for the management of frostbite – the cream is non-greasy and does not cause any sweating or flaking and does not freeze even at low temperature (0 °C). Besides its application for management of cold injuries, this cream can be used for treating burns, wounds, ulcers, cracked and chapped skin and cuts and as an antiseptic dressing.
