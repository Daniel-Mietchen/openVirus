<p id="Par79">Amongst vectors, mosquitoes are responsible for causing major vector-borne diseases in India and other tropical countries. Use of repellents and insecticides is the best possible methods to keep mosquitoes at bay.

It is a formulation of essential oils of traditional herbs, is non-toxic as compared to the commercially available products, has natural fragrance and is eco-friendly. The herbal formulation wards off insects and, therefore, has immense potential for use in hot and humid areas, where vector-borne diseases are most prevalent.
