<p id="Par78">The Indian Armed Forces personnel are deployed at various locations and different geoclimatic locales. They are constantly exposed to a variety of bloodsucking insects such as mosquitoes, blackflies, ticks, mites, rat flea, sandflies and leeches during their operational postings. Insects are carriers (vectors) of dreaded diseases such as malaria, dengue, chikungunya, etc. Various methods have been used for the ecological condition with certain limitations. Application of insecticide residual spraying causes inconvenience to children and older persons and can cause toxicity. A better method would be to use personal protection measures to protect human from the painful bites of bloodsucking organisms such as mosquito, sandfly, blackfly, rat flea and bedbugs.</p>
