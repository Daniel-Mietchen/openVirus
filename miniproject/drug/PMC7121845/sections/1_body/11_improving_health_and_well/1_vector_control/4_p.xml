<p id="Par81">Control of mosquito-borne diseases at larval stage is said to be one of the best approaches to limit the control of diseases. With this aim, Defence Research Laboratory (DRL), Tezpur, has isolated a bioactive entomopathogenic bacterium, 
 <italic>Bacillus sphaericus</italic> GC Sub Gr. IV, which is effective against mosquito larvae. The isolated bacterium has been formulated as a bio-larvicide for controlling mosquito larvae at the breeding sites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig34" ref-type="fig">34</xref>). The bio-larvicide is derived from nature and is eco-friendly, and the effective dose rate of the formulation is 0.1–0.2 kg/ha.
