<p id="Par85">Vitiligo or leucoderma is a chronic auto-immune dermal disease with virtually no reasonably effective treatment available in modern system of medicine. Frequently even systemically administered steroids are not effective. It is a social stigma and is caused mainly due to decreased synthesis of melanin pigment by the skin resulting in white patches and discolouration of the affected areas. The current treatment modalities have not been able to provide any satisfactory solution. Defence Institute of Bioenergy Research (DIBER) has developed a polyherbal topical cream and oral mixture of seven herbs (lukoskin) for curing vitiligo without side effects upon long-term application (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig36" ref-type="fig">36</xref>). The combination therapy was found to inhibit reoccurrence of white patches besides preventing blister formation and has no side effects. Lukoskin enhances melanin synthesis, is a non-toxic herbal product and prevents hyper pigmentation and restores normal skin texture.
