<p id="Par25">An oriental fungus that has been used for promoting health and longevity in the Himalayan tracts of India, China, Japan and several other Asian countries has been used to develop a medicinal formulation - DIP-G-Fit for enhancing performance in soldiers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). The fungus grows at high elevations in the Himalayas and has been recognized as a very powerful medicinal mushroom for several hundred years. It is widely used due to its numerous pharmacological properties including antistress, antifatigue, immunomodulatory, health-promoting and longevity-enhancing properties, etc. and is quite popularly accepted as a dietary supplement in Western countries. In preclinical studies conducted at DIPAS, supplementation of DIP-G-Fit enhanced exhaustion time in experimental animals significantly both under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. DIP-G-Fit can be extremely useful for enhancing performance of soldiers posted at high altitude and improving endurance in sports personnel.
