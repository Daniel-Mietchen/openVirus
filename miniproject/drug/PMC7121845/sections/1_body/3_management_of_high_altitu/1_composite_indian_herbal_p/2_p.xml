<p id="Par12">CIHP I was tested for its adaptogenic activity using C-H-R animal model. CIHP I helped in improving resistance to C-H-R-induced hypothermia and enhanced post-stress recovery to regain Trec 37 °C. In Border Security Force volunteers, CIHP I intake was found to restrict combat stress-induced deterioration in both physical and mental performance (Srivastava et al.

 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), was tested for its adaptogenic action using C-H-R animal model. The acclimatization to hypoxia of extreme altitude was facilitated by the administration of CIHP II during exposure (Grover et al.

Both CIHP I and II augmented oxygen delivery to biological system by increasing red cell 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid levels during hypobaric hypoxic exposure and improved cellular membrane permeability and maintenance of blood glucose and muscle glycogen levels. CIHPs also regulated the mobilization of lipids from adipose tissue and their preferential utilization for thermogenesis as compared to carbohydrates (Grover et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1999</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2000</xref>). The above studies conducted at DIPAS have indicated that the Ayurvedic herbal preparations/rasayanas with adaptogenic activity increase the high altitude and cold tolerance and relieve the incapacitating effect of stress on operational performance.
