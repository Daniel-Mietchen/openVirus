<p id="Par16">The high-altitude medicinal plant species, viz. 
 <italic>Hippophae salicifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>Hippophae rhamnoides turkestanica</italic>, are widely distributed in the Himalayan region and possess adaptogenic properties, which alleviate high-altitude stress. 
 <italic>Hippophae salicifolia</italic> has been shown to have potential application in high-altitude stress management (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Rathor et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2015</xref>) evaluated the mechanism of action of both the species against multiple stresses [cold-hypoxia-restraint (C-H-R)]. They reported the adaptogenic activity of 
 <italic>Hippophae salicifolia</italic> in facilitating tolerance to CHR in rats. Pretreatment with 
 <italic>Hippophae salicifolia</italic> significantly attenuated reactive oxygen species production, protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation and also helped maintain antioxidant status. Pretreatment of 
 <italic>Hippophae salicifolia</italic> resulted in decreased protein oxidation, and protein homoeostasis was sustained by regulation of heat shock proteins (HSP70 and HSP60). Interestingly, heme oxygenase-1, vascular endothelial growth factor and nitric oxide level were also increased in 
 <italic>Hippophae salicifolia</italic> pretreated rats proving its adaptogenic activity against cold-hypoxia-restraint. Conclusively, aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Hippophae salicifolia</italic> could be used as an adaptogen for high-altitude-associated multiple stress.
