<p id="Par47">Seasickness is a form of motion sickness; it is hardly fatal, but symptoms such as nausea, stomach cramps and vomiting caused can be quite debilitating, affecting performance of the seafarers. In critical military operations, seasickness can impede mission accomplishment. The Indian Navy had reported that the Somalian pirates use a plant called khat (
 <italic>Catha edulis</italic>) for alleviating symptoms of seasickness and improving performance.

IBG-15 was found to be more effective and safe in alleviating CTA as compared to
