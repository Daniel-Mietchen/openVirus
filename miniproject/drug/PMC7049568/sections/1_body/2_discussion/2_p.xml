<p id="p0055">Current influenza vaccine formulations typically generate strain-specific immune responses and are reformulated every year to match the circulating virus strains. The effectiveness of influenza vaccines is largely dependent on the antigenic closeness of the vaccine virus strain with that of the circulating virus, as well as the attack rate. A meta-analysis showed a pooled vaccine effectiveness rate of 70% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 55%–80%) for matched viruses and 55% (95% CI: 42%–65%) for unmatched strains. The overall vaccine effectiveness of the 2018–2019 influenza vaccine against both influenza A and B viruses is estimated to be 40%.

 </xref> However, the effectiveness of influenza vaccines in young children and older adults is comparatively lower due to weaker immune systems in these populations. Hence, apart from prophylactic intervention strategies, therapeutic interventions with antiviral drugs play a central part in the treatment of influenza viral infections. Three classes of drugs are licensed to treat against influenza. They include M2-ion channel inhibitors (amantadine approved in 1966), neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir approved in 2000), and a viral polymerase inhibitor (baloxavir marboxil [Xofluza] approved in 2018).

 </xref> However, amantadine and its derivatives are no longer used because 100% of circulating influenza viruses are resistant to them.

 </xref> The majority of circulating H1N1 viruses prior to the 2009 pandemic became resistant to oseltamivir, and the incidence of oseltamivir-resistant viruses of currently circulating pandemic H1N1 strains has been reported.

 </xref> Hence it is important to develop next-generation antivirals that confer protection against viruses that are resistant against currently licensed drugs. Instead of targeting viral components to inhibit viral replication, we targeted host innate immune components to create an antiviral state to suppress viral growth. We have shown earlier that activating the RIG-I pathway inhibited the growth of influenza viruses irrespective of their genetic makeup, drug sensitivity status, and pathogenicity both
