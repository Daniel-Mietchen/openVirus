 </xref> In this study, we have designed a dual-function shRNA that can activate the RIG-I-mediated antiviral responses and also knock down the NS1 protein of influenza virus. In order to assess the functionality of our dual-function shRNAs, A549 cells transfected with all 5′-PPP-NS1shRNAs or their capped 5′ 7-methylguanosine (m7G)-NS1shRNAs lead to significant upregulation of RIG-I (up to 40-fold; 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C) and IFN-β (up to 200-fold; 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D), as compared with transfection control and capped counterparts of NS1shRNAs and capped scrambled shRNA, where the triphosphate moiety at the 5′ end was blocked by a synthetic cap analog, m7G. We also assessed the ability of these dual-function NS1shRNAs to suppress production of NS1 by the influenza virus. A549 cells were mock transfected or transfected with 5′-PPP-shRNAs or their m7G-capped counterparts, and 24 h later infected with A/Brisbane/9/2007 influenza virus. 80%–90% knockdown in NS1 mRNA levels was achieved with all NS1shRNAs with 5′-PPP or without 5′-PPP (m7G-capped), as compared with transfection control (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E). Interestingly, scrambled shRNA with a 5′-PPP also suppressed NS1 to the similar extent as other 5′-PPP-NS1shRNAs by virtue of the triphosphate moiety at the 5′ end, which activates RIG-I-mediated antiviral responses. However, scrambled shRNA without the 5′-PPP moiety (m7G-capped) behaved in a manner similar to the transfection control because of the lack of NS1 silencing ability, as well as the absence of the 5′-PPP moiety (
