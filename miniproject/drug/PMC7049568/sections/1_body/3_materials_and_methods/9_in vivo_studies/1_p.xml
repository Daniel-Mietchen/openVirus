<p id="p0120">Female BALB/c mice, 6–12 weeks old (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA), were anesthetized with isoflurane and administered (5 mice/group) 25 μg of 5′-PPP-NS1shRNA, capped-NS1shRNA, Is9.2 synthetic RNA, or PBS complexed with 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>-jetPEI according to the manufacturer’s protocol (6 μL/mouse; Polyplus-transfection, San Diego, CA, USA), intranasally, in a volume of 40 μL. Control mice were immunized with 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>-jetPEI alone. 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>-jetPEI is a linear polyethylenimine that mediates efficient nucleic acid delivery into animal models. All shRNA constructs were administrated on day −1, 0, 1, 2, or 3. Mice were challenged on day 0, intranasally, with ten 50% mouse infectious doses (MID
 <sub>50</sub>) of mouse-adapted A/PR/8/34 virus in a final volume of 50 μL under anesthesia. Mice were observed for any clinical signs, such as ruffled fur, lethargy, huddling together, or labored breathing, which are indicative of morbidity or sickness. Mouse lungs were harvested on day 4 postchallenge and immediately frozen and stored at −80°C in a freezer. Animal research was conducted under the guidance of the CDC’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International-accredited animal facility.
