<p id="p0090">DNA templates, composed of a T7 promoter followed by desired target sense sequence, loop, target antisense, HDV ribozyme, and ends flanked with a restriction enzyme site (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B), were created by primer annealing using two separate oligos (25 pmol each) with a 40+ bp complementary overlap region and DNA polymerase extension. PCR conditions consisted of: 94°C for 5 min followed by 3 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s, and final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The DNA oligos were custom-made in an in-house CDCDSR/BIOS Oligo service center. 5′-PPP-NS1shRNAs were synthesized using a T7 Pol-based 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription kit (Ambion MEGAscript T7 High yield transcription kit; Austin, TX, USA), as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reaction was carried out for 16 h followed by treatment with DNase I (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) to digest the DNA template, and the RNA was purified using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), followed by ethanol precipitation. m7G-capped NS1shRNAs were prepared by replacing the guanosine triphosphate (GTP) in the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reaction with a 12:1 ratio of m7G(5′)PPP(5′)G cap analog:GTP. The 5′-PPP-RNA and capped RNA used in this study were prepared as previously described.
