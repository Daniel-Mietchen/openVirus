<p id="p0080">NS1 RNA was subjected to a bioinformatics approach (mppRNA) to predict regions of accessibility in target RNAs that are subject to post-transcriptional gene silencing therapeutics. mppRNA uses three algorithms: MFold, SFold, and Oligowalk. MFold identifies the most stable secondary structure and a neighborhood of less stable structures. SFold uses a Boltzmann energy sampling algorithm to assess the access probability across the entire secondary structural folding space. OligoWalk assesses the local folding energy along the target RNA. Details of the approach and the underlying algorithms can be found elsewhere.

Strong peaks of accessibility were identified in the map that were used as small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting sites.
