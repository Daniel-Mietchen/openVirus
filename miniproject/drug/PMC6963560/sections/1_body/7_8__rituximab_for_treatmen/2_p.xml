<p>A long-term (mean follow-up, 72.5 months) prospective, single-centre and open label study has been recently published- 31 patients (27 infected with HCV) with symptomatic MC (MC type 2 in 29 patients and MC type 3 in two patients) received RTX [
 <xref rid="B38-pathogens-08-00176" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. There were 16 patients with diffuse MPGN, 26 patients with peripheral neuropathy, and seven with severe skin ulcers. RTX was given at a dose of 375 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> according to a ‘4 plus 2 protocol’ (four doses at 1, 8, 15 and 22 days, followed by two further doses 1 and 2 months later). Five individuals also received intravenous therapy with corticosteroids (500 mg/day of methylprednisolone for three consecutive days). No additional immunosuppressive medications or antiviral agents were administered. We observed complete disappearance of pre-treatment manifestations in all patients with purpuric changes and non-healing vasculitic ulcers, and in 80% of peripheral neuropathies. Cryoglobulinemic nephropathy consistently improved during the observation period, starting from the second month after RTX (serum creatinine from 2.1 ± 1.7 to 1.5 ± 1.6 mg/dL,

 <sub>4</sub>) were observed and no adverse clinical events were noted [
