RTX is a monoclonal antibody directed at the lymphocyte membrane-protein CD20 and it gives selective depletion of CD20 positive B lymphocytes. Thus, RTX abolishes IgM production and cryoglobulins. Two RCTs have demonstrated the superiority of rituximab mono-therapy as compared with conventional immunosuppressive therapy (i.e., corticosteroids, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and plasma exchange) for the management of HCV-associated cryoglobulinemic vasculitis in individuals for whom prior IFN therapy failed to give disease remission, or in patients who were not eligible for IFN therapy [
