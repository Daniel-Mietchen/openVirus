<p>Patients with mild or moderate forms of HCV-induced glomerular disease (stable kidney function and/or non-nephrotic proteinuria) should be treated with DAAs. Patients with HCV-induced glomerular disease who are resistant or intolerant to DAA therapies should be given immunosuppressive agents. In all cases, treatment with antiproteinuric agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin-receptor blockers should be considered to achieve a maximal antiproteinuric response. Diuretics and anti-hypertensive agents should be given where clinically requested.</p>
