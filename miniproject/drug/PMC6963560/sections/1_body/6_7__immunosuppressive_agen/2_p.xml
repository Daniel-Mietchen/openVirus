 <xref rid="pathogens-08-00176-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows that the management of HCV-related glomerular disease is based on the clinical manifestations of glomerular disease. Patients showing a cryoglobulinemic flare or severe glomerular damage induced by HCV should be treated first with immunosuppressive agents (with rituximab as first-line agent) with or without plasma exchange. Current practice is to treat with immunosuppressants until the acute phase of disease is overcome. After that, treatment with DAAs is suggested. The initial approach includes immunosuppressive therapy alone or combined therapy (immunosuppressive drugs and DAAs), according to the decision of the clinician.
