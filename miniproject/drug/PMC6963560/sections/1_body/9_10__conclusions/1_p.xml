<p>The present review shows that antiviral therapy with DAA combinations provides high rates of virological response even in patients with HCV-related glomerular disease. Tolerance was satisfactory with no serious adverse events. Viral response is accompanied with some clinical benefit and immunosuppressive therapies are required in many cases. Patients with HCV-induced glomerular disease are still a difficult-to-treat group even at the time of DAAs. Whether the advent of newer DAAs will reduce the need of immunosuppressive drugs for HCV-related glomerular disease is a topic of active research.</p>
