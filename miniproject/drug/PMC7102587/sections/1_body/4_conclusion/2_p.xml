<p id="p0095">Although evidence of chloroquine and HCQ is limited (based on the experimental data and only two small human trials), considering the potentially favorable benefit-risk balance of chloroquine and HCQ in absence of any other valid treatment option, we believe that such treatment could be useful in the current context of pandemic COVID-19 outbreak. We have summarized current consideration and proposed line of management in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">TableÂ 3</xref> . The low cost of chloroquine and HCQ could also be an effective strategy to counter COVID-19 (especially in patients with diabetes and other co-morbidities in whom mortality is high) in resource constrained and COVID-19 overburdened heath care systems in middle- and low-income counties including India.
