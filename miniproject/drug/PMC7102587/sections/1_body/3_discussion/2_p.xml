<p id="p0075">The antiviral activity of chloroquine and HCQ have been identified in the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies and the growth of many different viruses have been inhibited in the cell culture line by both the agents, including the SARS coronavirus. Mice studies have also demonstrated activity of these agents against human coronavirus OC43, enterovirus EV-A71, Zika virus and influenza A H5N1. However, no benefit of chloroquine was seen in the prevention of influenza and dengue infection in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial [

 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Similarly, chloroquine was active in 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies but not in the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies against ebolavirus, nipah and influenza viruses [

 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>]. Data of chloroquine against chikungunya virus is even more intriguing. While chloroquine had satisfactory antiviral activity against chikungunya 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, animal studies showed increase in virus replication, aggravation of fever and incomplete viral clearance [
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Human trials of chloroquine showed no improvement in chikungunya acute illness and rather an increase in chronic arthralgia was observed during post-illness period, compared to the controls [
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The role of chloroquine against Human Immunodeficiency Virus was inconclusive [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The only viral disease where chloroquine was modestly effective so far before COVID-19 era was chronic hepatitis C suggesting an increased virological response to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, the results of chloroquine and HCQ so far done against COVID-19, more promising than previous trial in other viral diseases. Moreover, these drugs are of low cost, reasonably safe (see below), and widely available in countries where malaria is endemic.
