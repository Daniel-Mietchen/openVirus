<p id="p0050">Since the structure and mechanism of action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are exactly same except an additional hydroxy moiety in one terminal in HCQ, both act as a weak base that can change the pH of acidic intracellular organelles including endosomes/lysosomes, essential for the membrane fusion. It is believed that both the agents could be effective tools against SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 [

Some data show HCQ effectively inhibited both the entry, transport and the post-entry stages of SARS-CoV-2, similar to the chloroquine and one study found HCQ to be a more potent agent than chloroquine in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2
