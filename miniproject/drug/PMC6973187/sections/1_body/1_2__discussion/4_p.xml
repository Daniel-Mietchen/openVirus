<p>Treatment of HAdV infection in immunocompromised patients is ineffective without immune reconstitution [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Cidofovir requires regular intravenous dosing but only achieves low in vivo activity due to low intracellular levels (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>), and therefore poor results [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This might obtain viral control but hardly ever viral clearance. Cidofovir is most effective as prophylaxis with increasing titres on stool samples, plasma PCR's or early onset disease [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The side effect profile includes nausea, vomiting, myelosuppression and severe renal tubulopathies [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. During treatment the direct and indirect costs increase due to in-hospital toxicity monitoring and mandatory adequate hydration.
