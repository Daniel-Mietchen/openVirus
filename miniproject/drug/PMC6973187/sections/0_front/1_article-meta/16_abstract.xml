 <p>Immunocompromised patients, including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), HIV, and malnourished patients, are at increased risk for viral infections with high incidences of morbidity and mortality. In HSCT patients, the infection risk is increased until immune reconstitution is re-established. Therapy with standard of care antiviral drugs, for example Cidofovir, is expensive, requires prolonged administration, and has unfavorable toxicity profiles. Our case describes the successful use of Brincidofovir (CMX001), a lipid-conjugate of the nucleotide analog Cidofovir, in a 9-year-old post-HSCT girl with disseminated adenovirus infection. The increased efficacy of Brincidofovir (BCV) against multiple viral infections, limited toxicity, and oral-administered schedule opens options in different resource settings.</p>
