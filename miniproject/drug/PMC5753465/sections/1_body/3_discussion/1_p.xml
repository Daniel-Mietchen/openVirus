<p id="Par33">Treatment of DENV is presently a global infection and it is a viral disease for which there is no licensed therapeutic agent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Treatment and diagnosis via new molecular-based techniques have become a new hope for early control, but are still exclusive because of their costs and normalization. DENV is the most important factors transmitted by mosquitoes worldwide and causing viral disease, almost 100 million cases of dangerous DENV each year, resulting in severe and life-threatening [

However, we have not completed a comprehensive outlook of all miRNAs expression regulation target genes through virus-human interactions in patients of DENV. A few human miRNAs might show antiviral miRNAs. When some delusive antiviral miRNAs were blocked by locked nucleic acid-modified antisense oligoribonucleotides, the hosts miss carriage to suppress viral replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Otherwise, in few cases, human miRNAs expression might be corroborated by viruses to reshape the human intracellular medium to benefit viral replication [
