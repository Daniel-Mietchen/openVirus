<p id="Par7">Nowadays miRNAs (miRNAs) has carried out numerous cautions and applications because several experimental studies have concluded that miRNAs could perform important roles in various biological processes including viral infection, differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism, cell proliferation, development, aging, signal transduction, as well as the development and progression of the human complex illness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, miRNAs have close associations with the development, progression, and prognosis of many human illnesses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], furthermore, miRNAs are widely identified to be correlated with physiological processes: including apoptosis, differentiation, growth and stress responses, also pathological processes: including prognosis, initiation and progression of various illnesses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. miRNAs are small (18â€“25 base long) noncoding RNAs, which were identified as vital ingredients of immune precision and other biological processes, such as development infection and inflammation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Indeed miRNAs have a primary function in the early differentiation of B cells and maintaining the regulatory T-cell lineage, additionally, they regulate the differentiation of dendritic cells and macrophages via toll-like receptors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Recently, microRNAs have caused great excitement as diagnostic and therapeutic signatures of the DF [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, arguments for the possibility of a major function of microRNAs in controlling target genes of DF were increased [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. So, our studies on joint activation and inhibition of endogenous miRNAs try to fight against dengue fever that includes effects on the initial Immune reaction.
