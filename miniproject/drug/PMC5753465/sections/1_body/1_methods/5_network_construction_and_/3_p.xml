<p id="Par15">Mi–T–P network was set up by overlaying the miRNAs-target gene network with related function pathway. Initially functional pathways defined by the KEGG database (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and then constructed by combining the predict targets and their related function pathways, the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID knowledgebase) (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] were used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] to test for enriched DEmiRs targets function and to identify biological themes among them. For each miRNAs expressions, the DAVID web service provided a ranked list of functionally relevant annotation clusters that represent a summary of several annotation categories, including GO [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], KEGG [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and BioCarta pathways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In these networks, degree is used to characterize the connectedness of a node. The degree of a node is the number of edges associated with it. The topological properties of these networks were analyzed using the Network Analysis plugin and CentiScaPe 1.2 of Cytoscape 3.2.0, a popular bioinformatics package for biological network visualization and data integration, was used to generate all displayed networks [
