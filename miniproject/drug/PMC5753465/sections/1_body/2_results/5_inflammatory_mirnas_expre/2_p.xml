<p id="Par30">In order to clarify the effect of Acetaminophen as anti-inflammatory therapy and to find the relationships between the active ingredients of miRNAs and their targets, the network was generated by connecting the potential miRNAs 14 and the potential targets 24 associated with the DENV. The mean number of potential targets per potential compound was 1.045. Among the 14 potential miRNAs, 2 have high degree distributions and each of them hits more than 10 and 6 potential targets (hsa-miR-107, hsa-miR-320d). All of the 24 targets showing down-regulations were linked by 2 until 10 miRNAs and some of them are verified in previous research (Fig.
