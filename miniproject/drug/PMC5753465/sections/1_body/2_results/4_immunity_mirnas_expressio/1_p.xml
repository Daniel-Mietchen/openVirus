<p id="Par26">The integrative analysis of miRNAs expression recognizes a network inference of target immune response and functional interactions occurring in dengue infections patients. The result of miRNAs expression and reconstruction of a regulatory network in plasma-induced dengue symptoms post treatment by RDN with LRD are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>. The resultant Mi-T-P network which consisted of 38 differentially up-regulated expressed miRNAs and 239 integrative targets correlated with miRNAs, sorting from 2 to 64 degree and 44.4% of the genes being targeted by at least 2 miRNAs and their corresponding 12 functional annotations. The names of unique genes that are potential targets of miRNAs are PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog) showing the highest degree (Degree = 12), RELA (Proto-Oncogene, NF-KB Subunit, Degree = 12), TRAF6 (TNF Receptor Associated Factor 6, Degree = 11) and IL6 (Interleukin 6, Degree = 11). Functional pathway analysis of anti-correlated target genes revealed various overrepresented biological processes including regulation of programmed cell death and apoptosis, regulation of cell proliferation, protein amino acid phosphorylation, immune response and response to cytokine stimulus with degree of 94, 85, 72, 57 and 55, respectively. The information of these parameters has been listed in the Additional file
