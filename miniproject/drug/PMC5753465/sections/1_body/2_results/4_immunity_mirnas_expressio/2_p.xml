<p id="Par27">With post-treated Acetaminophen medicine as a single therapy, there is a weak correlation between miRNAs expression and their targets. (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) shows miRNAs differential expression in the supernatant of blood samples of patients. Among the up-regulated, M003 (miRNAs, hsa-miR-200c-3p) has the highest number of target candidate (degree = 10), followed by M002 (degree = 6), M005 (degree = 5), M001 (degree = 2) and M004 (degree = 1), indicating the one-target properties of ingredients. Results also showed 23 anticorrelated targets with the number of targets per miRNAs ranging from 2 to 8; and genes being targeted by one miRNA and their corresponding 12 functional annotations. The highest degree miRNAs are differently expressed compared with the patients treated with Acetaminophen therapy (regulation of programmed cell death and apoptosis, regulation of cell proliferation and protein amino acid phosphorylation with degree of 11, 10 and 10, respectively), which may be due to the effect of Acetaminophen on the expression of miRNAs in response to dengue virus. The detailed information of these miRNAs expressions, immune target genes and functional pathway post-treated with Acetaminophen are listed in the Additional file
