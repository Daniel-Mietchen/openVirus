<p id="Par25">In general, RDN Injection combined with LRD oral administration can induce the expression of miR-128a, miR-389 and miR-9 to suppress dengue virus replication. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] Previously reported that in vivo miR-128a, miR-389 and miR-9 suppresses dengue virus replication by promoting NF-kB–dependent IFN production. After 3 days’ post treatment with Acetaminophen, LRD and RDN, we carried out the GO enrichment and clustering analysis to find out the targets associated with the physiological features of dengue infections related to immune and inflammatory response.
