 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> shows the miRNAs and their targets. In total, this network consists of 588 nodes (89 miRNAs and 499 targets) and 1497 edges. This indicates that many targets are hit by only one miRNA, while some targets can be adjusted by numerous ligands. In the interactions between miRNAs and targets, for those active miRNAs expression, M005 exhibited the highest number of target candidate (degree = 134), followed by M002 (degree = 102), M013 (degree = 93), M017 (degree = 73) and so on. As for the candidate targets, DDX3X (DEAD-Box Helicase 3, X-Linked) showed the highest degree (Degree = 18), with PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog, Degree = 17), RORA (RAR Related Orphan Receptor A, Degree = 15), PPP3R1 (Protein Phosphatase 3 Regulatory Subunit B, Alpha, Degree = 14), suggesting that DDX3X and PTEN might be potential targets for dengue disease and they were modulated through related miRNAs. The detailed information of these miRNAs expressions and target genes response to DENV are listed in the Additional file
