<p id="Par23">Microarray analysis demonstrated that aberrant miRNAs expression was a remarkable characteristic in plasma after infection with DENV. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> showed that Mi-T-P network consisted of 87 plasma miRNAs which were differentially down-regulated, 399 candidate genes were up-regulated and their corresponding 12 functional annotations. M005 (degree = 71) exhibited the highest active miRNAs expression, followed by M012 (degree = 59), M002 (degree = 58) and M009 (degree = 45), indicating the multi-target properties of ingredients, which is the summary of the action mode of miRNAs expression. The targets with highest degree are listed in (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Among these targets, PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog, degree = 21) showed the highest degree, that is PTEN could interact with the most nodes in the network, which plays a key role in regulating the network as the hub target. Moreover, PTEN was followed by DDX3X (DEAD-Box Helicase 3, X-Linked, degree = 19), ADRB2 (Adrenoceptor Beta 2, degree = 17) and VEGFA (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A, degree = 16) which are potential therapeutic targets genes for DENV. The detailed information of these miRNAs expressions, target genes and functional pathway are listed in the Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S2. In summary, the inhibition of these six of 399 proteins (DDX3X, PTEN, RORA, PPP3R1, VEGFA, and ADRB2) may significantly decrease the replication of a DENV replicon.
