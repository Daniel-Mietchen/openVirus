  <p>Network diagram of miRNAs expression and predicted target genes response to dengue virus infection without treatment (
   <bold>a</bold>) miRNAs-gene target relationship. A miRNA and a target are linked if the target protein is hit by the corresponding miRNA. 
   <bold>b</bold> miRNAs-target-function pathway network. A miRNA and a target are linked if the target protein is hit by the corresponding miRNAs. Similarly, a target and a functional module are linked if the target is involved in this biological process. Node size is proportional to its degree and the letters are node labels
