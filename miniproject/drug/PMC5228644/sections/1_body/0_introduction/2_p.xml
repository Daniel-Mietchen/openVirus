 </sup> Since these diseases are associated with high mortality in the presence of chronic HCV (CHC), antiviral therapy for HCV infection could theoretically improve prognosis by preventing the development of LC or HCC. However, a substantial proportion of patients with CHC do not receive antiviral therapy.

 </sup> Moreover, previous peg-interferon plus ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV)-based regimens are less effective and have higher side effect rates than direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents and are contraindicated in patients prone to severe adverse events.
