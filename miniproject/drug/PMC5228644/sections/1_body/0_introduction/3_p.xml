<p>Although previous studies have reported that the achievement of sustained virologic response (SVR) on antiviral therapy reduces the risk of HCC development, the majority were limited due to use of a conventional IFN regimen.

 </sup> After the introduction of the more effective PEG-IFN/RBV therapy, several studies reported that failure to achieve SVR on PEG-IFN/RBV therapy, an advanced age, and LC were associated with unfavorable long-term outcomes or HCC development.
