<p>In the no-treatment group, HCC developed in 94 (13.7%) patients during a median follow-up duration of 21 months. In this group, the 2-, 4-, and 6-year cumulative HCC development rates were significantly greater for male than female patients (10.9%, 15.4%, and 20.0% vs 8.4%, 10.0%, and 15.0%, respectively,
