<p>A total of 1176 patients were enrolled in the study (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>); baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Median patient age was 51 years (range, 18–95 years), and 696 (59.2%) were male. LC was present in 230 (19.6%) patients, and all were in a compensated state. Genotype 1 was the most common (n = 433, 36.8%), and the majority (n = 391, 90.3%) of them were genotype 1b. Median follow-up duration was 31 months (range, 6–144 months). The SVR (+) and SVR (−) subgroups contained 306 and 183 patients, respectively, and the no-treatment group contained 687 patients. One hundred thirty-nine (55.4%) and 141 (71.9%) of genotype 1 (n = 251) and 2 (n = 196) patients administered PEG-IFN/RBV achieved SVR, respectively. In the treatment group, there were 456 (93.3%) treatment naïve patients. Median age was greater and the frequency of LC was higher in the no-treatment group than in the treatment group or the 2 SVR subgroups, respectively (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).
