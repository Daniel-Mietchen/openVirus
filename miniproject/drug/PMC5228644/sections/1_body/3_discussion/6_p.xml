<p>In HCC, carcinogenesis is a multistep process, although the mechanism involved has yet to be elucidated. Nonetheless, LC is a well-known risk factor of HCC development regardless of underlying liver disease, and thus, cirrhotic patients are candidates for active surveillance program of HCC development.

 </sup> In addition, cirrhotic patients with HBV infection have been actively treated with antiviral drugs.

 </sup> Although the previous guideline recommended cirrhotic patients with HCV infection can be treated using PEG-IFN/RBV, it is also stated that suitable patients should have compensated liver function and acceptable hematological indices.

 </sup> Furthermore, PEG-IFN/RBV has been frequently related to hematologic abnormalities, such as, neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, and as shown in our previous study, about 5% of patients experienced severe hematologic side effects.
