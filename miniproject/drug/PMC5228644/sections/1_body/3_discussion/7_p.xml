<p>On the other hand, recently recommended DAA agents have been associated with grade 3 or 4 hematologic abnormalities in fewer than 1% of treated patients.

 </sup> and in the present study, multivariate analysis showed that LC was an independent risk factor of HCC development in patients with CHC regardless of PEG-IFN/RBV therapy. The above-mentioned evidence strongly suggests that cirrhotic patients with CHC need to be actively treated with highly active oral DAA agents to reduce the risk of HCC development. Although recent studies reported that HCC recurrence has been unexpectedly higher in patients with CHC who receiving DAAs, they were retrospective studies, and enrolled patients were not randomized.
