<p>In the present study, HCC occurred in 9.7% of all 1176 study subjects over a median follow-up of 31 months. In the treatment group, the 6-year cumulative HCC development rates were 1.1% and 9.8% in the SVR (+) and SVR (âˆ’) subgroups, respectively, and in the no-treatment group, the 6-year cumulative HCC development rate was substantially higher at 17.8%. Furthermore, among all study subjects, the risk of HCC development was significantly greater for older patients, in those with cirrhosis, in those who did not achieve SVR on PEG-IFN/RBV, and in those in the no-treatment group. Interestingly, older age, presence of cirrhosis, and failure to achieve SVR were found to independently predict HCC development even among patients in the treatment group.</p>
