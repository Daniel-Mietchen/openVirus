<p>In the present study, the risk of HCC development was significantly higher in the SVR (−) than in the SVR (+) subgroup, which occurs with previous results.

 </sup> This suggests that increasing SVR rates reduce HCC development risk in patients with CHC. In fact, SVR rates for genotypes 1 and 2 in the treatment group of the present study were a low as 55.4% and 71.9%, respectively. However, recently recommended first-line antiviral regimens, such as, sofosbuvir-based or daclatasvir/asunaprevir-based regimens, in the treatment-naïve CHC patients have reported to have SVR rates of up to 98% to 100% in treatment-naïve CHC genotype 1 patients with treatment durations as short as 12 or 24 weeks.

 </sup> Moreover, in genotype 2 patients, sofosbuvir-based regimens have been reported to have high SVR rates of more than 95%.

 </sup> Although long-term treatment outcomes, such as, HCC development rates have not been reported for these new drugs, it can be expected that the higher SVR rates achieved will be reflected by decrease in HCC development rates. Therefore, active antiviral therapy based on these new regimens needs to be considered to achieve high SVR rates in patients with treatment-naïve CHC.
