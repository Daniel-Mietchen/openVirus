<p>In 2016, Liu and Chen [
 <xref rid="B122-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>] summarized in a review paper an interesting perspective of nanotechnology use in HIV/AIDS vaccine development. Their overview underline the potential of various nanomaterials and nano-architectures to be used as HIV vaccine carriers or adjuvants due to proven capabilities to improve delivery, permeability, stability, solubility and pharmacokinetics of traditional HIV vaccine approaches. The authors exhibit also the desired features of nano-carriers and adjuvants with high benefits-cost ratio.
