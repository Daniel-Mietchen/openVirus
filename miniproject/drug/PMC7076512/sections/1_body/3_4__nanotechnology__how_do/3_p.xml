<p>It is a given fact that nanotechnology is defined as the application of materials on the nanometer scale. According to the literature data results, namomaterials designed with different shapes and morphologies display numerous advantages for use in antiviral therapy, namely: nanometric size that permits drug delivery through impermeable barriers [

 <xref rid="B119-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>], virucidal activity against a series of viruses (HIV, HSV, HBV, etc.) due to biomimetic properties [
 <xref rid="B120-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>], increased specificity, improved antiviral delivery and controlled drug release to the target [
 <xref rid="B121-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>] through engineered moieties, decrease the emergence of drug resistance, personalized therapy possibility, protection of the drugs and low adverse drug side effects mainly due to the composition.
