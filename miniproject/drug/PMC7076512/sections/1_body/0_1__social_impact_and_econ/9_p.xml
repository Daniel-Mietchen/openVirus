<p>As mentioned above, all the available reports present crude estimates rather than precise measures of the economic costs of the illness, because most of the costs are calculated directly on interventions or on medical budgetary chapters, without taking into account the societal losses. Moreover, different approaches are discrepant (can be explained, at least in part, with the influence of compliance to treatment and possible under sampling of subpopulations in the data set) [

The costs of an intervention have to be compared with the results of interventions because the effectiveness of treatments and the efficiency can produce societal gains that must be offset by losses [
