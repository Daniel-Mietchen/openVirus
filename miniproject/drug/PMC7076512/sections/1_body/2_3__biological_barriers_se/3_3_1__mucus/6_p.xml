<p>The nanotechnology field offers a great deal of drug delivery modalities in order to overpass the biological barriers, deliver efficiently the incorporated active principle in a controlled and targeted manner, reduce circulating drug levels and attenuate the renal damage. A recent review points out the nanogels based on the above-mentioned materials capabilities as an adequate example to pass through these types of biological barriers [
