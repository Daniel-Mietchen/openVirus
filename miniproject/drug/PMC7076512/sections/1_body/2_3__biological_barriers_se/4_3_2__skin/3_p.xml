<p>Analysing the literature data, we can suggest that there are different processes and mechanisms that govern the penetration of small/large molecules through skin barrier. According to Schneider et al. [
 <xref rid="B97-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] review there are two general pathways for skin absorption: through skin appendages or through the stratum corneum and the underlying layers. The lipophilic statum corneum medium determines the first mechanism of skin penetration, namely absorption of lipophilic compounds [

More examples are available but the conclusion is the same: “the full understanding of the penetration or absorption processes is still under evaluation” due to the challenges associated with delivering complex burdens through the skin barrie [
