<p>ATV. Low brain permeability and antiretroviral drug resistance are two of the most important disadvantages of ATV. This PIs drug has been encapsulated in SLNs and studied as nanosystems for brain delivery using hCMEC/D3 as a blood-brain barrier in vitro model, HCMEC/D3 being human brain microvessel endothelial cell line. Average ATV had an important increase regarding the cellular uptake once delivered through average nanosystems (around 167 nm) [
