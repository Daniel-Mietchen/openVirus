<p>Lamivudine—LAM, a water-soluble drug with two main drawbacks: its half-life is only 2 h and has a deficient bioavailability, especially in paediatric patients (68%) [

 <xref rid="B177-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>]. The physico-chemical characterization of the obtained NPs has shown an adequate size of the NPs and a good stability. In vitro drug release tests indicate that NPs can support the drug delivery for 24 h, indicating a less frequent administration [

 <xref rid="B177-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>] have reported a more complex study, where LAM-polymeric non-cytotoxic NPs have been included in films for drug delivery through the buccal mucosa barrier. Four mucoadhesive polymers: polyvinyl alcohol—PVA, polyvinyl pyrrolidone—PVP, sodium carboxymethylcellulose—SCM, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose—HPMC have been used to prepare the films. Moreover, Ozturk et al. [
 <xref rid="B141-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>], obtained PLGA NPs loaded with LAM and proved that are physicochemical stable and slowly released the drug, a great property attributed to ester end-group of PLGA. Because these NPs were intended for oral administration, the authors evaluated the gastrointestinal stability of the NPs in vitro, using different fluids of biological interest with pH in the range 1.2–7.4 phosphate buffer solution, intestinal fluid phosphate buffer solution, physiological serum and distilled water; the tests have been developed at 37 °C for 24 h. The results indicated that PLGA NPs are promising intestinal targeted drug delivery system for LMA, being stable in tested media.
