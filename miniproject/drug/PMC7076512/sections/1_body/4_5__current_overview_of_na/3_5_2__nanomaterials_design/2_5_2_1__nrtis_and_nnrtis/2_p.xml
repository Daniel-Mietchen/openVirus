<p>AZT, a high bioavailable drug, has serious side effects, the most common being bone marrow suppression, toxicity for some organs, neutropenia and anaemia. Specific target drug delivery using different nanosystems is a promising solution [
 <xref rid="B140-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. ATZ has been incorporated in hybrid NPs based on alginate and stearic acid-poly ethylene glycol. C6 glioma, neuro brain and Hela cells have been used to study the cellular uptake and the cytotoxicity of the NPs in vitro. The results proved that these nanosystems are nontoxic and have significant brain cellular uptake, suggesting that they can be used for more complex internalization in brain cells studies [

In another study, sol-oil chemistry has been used to prepare small NPs lactoferrin loaded with AZT (50â€“60 nm in size), stable in biological simulated fluids (gastric and intestinal). Antiviral activity of NPs has been analysed using SupT1 Cells infected with HIV-193IN101 virus and the results suggested that the encapsulation of AZT in lactoferrin does not influence the drug activity. The NPs loaded with AZT and the drug alone have been orally administrated to Wistar rats of both genders, the performed assays (bone marrow micronucleus, histopathological and biochemical analysis) showing that AZT loaded in NPs is more efficient and less toxic, compared with the soluble form [
