<p>Efavirenz—EFV, one of the most used NNRTIs in clinical practice, is a poorly water-soluble drug, and the incorporation in different drug delivery nanosystems being a solution for this drawback. Patel et al. [
 <xref rid="B156-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>] obtained nanosuspensions—NS based on povidone polymer- polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) K30, poloxamers steric stabilizer (188 and 407) and an anionic electrostatic stabilizer (sodium lauryl sulphate, a steric stabilizer—SLS). Compared with the drug alone, an important improvement of saturation solubility has been noticed for the NS with EFV. The incorneporation of EFV in NS increased the absorption of the drug in rat intestine in situ, and very important the oral bioavailability in the studies on Albino rabbits. Lactoferin used to prepare NPs loaded with ATZ [

 <xref rid="B146-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>], based on the same preparation technique: sol-oil chemistry. Compared with free EFV, the encapsulation of the drug in NPs showed a reduced toxicity to peripheral blood mononuclear cells, Jurkat T cells and B16-F10 cells, an increased anti-HIV-1 activity and improved oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profile in studies on rats.
