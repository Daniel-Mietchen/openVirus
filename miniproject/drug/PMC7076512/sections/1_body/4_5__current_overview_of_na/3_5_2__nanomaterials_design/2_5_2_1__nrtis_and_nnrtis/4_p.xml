<p>In clinical practice, LAM is frequently administrated together with AZT, therefore this combination of drugs is being studied for target delivery using different types of NPs. Sankar et al. [
 <xref rid="B142-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>] used PLGA, methylmethacrylate-sulfopropylmethacrylate—MMA-SPM, poly lactic acid—PLA, and poly methyl methacrylate—PMMA to prepare different types of NPs by emulsion polymerization, as drug delivery nanosystems for ATZ (52%) and LMA (58%). In vivo acute toxicity has been studied in mice; the results proving the fact that the drug doses loaded in the NPs are not toxic. ATZ-LAM PLGA NPs seemed to be the most promising nanosystems.
