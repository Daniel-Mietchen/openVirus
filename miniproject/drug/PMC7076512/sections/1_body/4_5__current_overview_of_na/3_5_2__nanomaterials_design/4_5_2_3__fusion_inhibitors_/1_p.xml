<p>ENF is a fusion inhibitor that is incapable to cross the cerebrospinal fluid. Fiandra et al. [
 <xref rid="B116-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>] proved that by including it into a nanosystem composed from magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) synthesized by solvothermal decomposition in organic solvent followed by fluorescent labelled PMA coating could solve ENF drawback. In vitro model (co-colture of RBMVECs and astrocytes) and in vivo model (Balb/c mice) studies proved that nanoconjugated ENF could penetrate BBB.
