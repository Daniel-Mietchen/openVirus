<p>Cagno et al. [
 <xref rid="B168-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>] conducted a research study concerning broad-spectrum antiviral products, which usually mimic heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), as well-preserved target of “viral attachment ligands” (VALs). The antiviral effect relies on the binding mechanism of the nanoparticles to the virus surface, thus preventing virus-cell attachment. In most cases, the reversibility of these bonds is reported [

The aforementioned authors have designed antiviral nanoparticles of virucidal effect based on long and flexible linkers simulating HSPG, leading to irreversible viral deformation. Of the synthesized compounds, the most notable virucidal effect was found in the AuNPs coated with a 2:1 mixture of decanesulfonic acid (MUS) and 1-octanethiol (OT). MUS allows a multivalent binding [

The enhanced activity of MUS:OT-NPs was assigned to the new construct using MUS linker that caused local distortions and then a global virus deformation, leading to irreversible loss of infectivity. The MUS:OT-NPs exhibited efficient virucidal effect against HSV-1 and HSV-2, human papilloma virus (HPV-16), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), dengue and lenti virus. The in vivo testing on Balb/c mice infected with RSV reveals the efficacy of MUS:OT-NPs treatment that prevented the pulmonary dissemination of the infection. These results are in agreement with previous published data [
