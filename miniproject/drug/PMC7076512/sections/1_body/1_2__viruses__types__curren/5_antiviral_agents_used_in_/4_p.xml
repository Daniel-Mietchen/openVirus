<p>The conventional treatment (prophylaxis or therapy) of an influenza virus infection, as a major public health concern worldwide, is designed to target viral proteins and could be used, either alone or in combination [
 <xref rid="B57-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. These include also amantadine and neuraminidase inhibitors (zanamivir and oseltamivir), that have been encapsulated into nanoparticles as specified in 
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-12-00171-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Potent vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitors, namely diphyllin and bafilomycin, previously shown to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity represent another possibility against influenza virus infection [

 <xref rid="B60-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Briefly, the antiviral mechanism of amantadine is based on nterference with the viral protein, M2 (an ion channel), the protein needed for the viral particle to become uncoated once it is taken inside the cell by endocytosis [

Also, oseltamivir carboxylate mechanism implies a selective inhibition of influenza virus neuraminidase enzymes, which are glycoproteins found on the virion surface, very important for viral entry into uninfected cells, for the release of recently formed virus particles from infected cells, and for the further spread of the infectious virus in the body [
