In the following paragraph the authors describe the pharmacological mechanism of the medicines for HIV treatment that were included/encapsulated/incorporated into nanomaterials. The representative nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) zidovudine (AZT) is phosphorylated intracellular by kinases specific to AZT 5′-triphosphate, a metabolite responsible for termination in elongation of proviral DNA because it is incorporated by reverse transcriptase into nascent DNA but lacks a 3′-hydroxyl group. Resistance to AZT is associated with mutations at reverse transcriptase codons 41, 44, 67, 70, 210, 215, and 219 [

Also, lamivudine (LAM), another NRTI agent, enters cells by passive diffusion, and then is converted to the monophosphate by deoxycytidine kinase, and undergoes further phosphorylation by deoxycytidine monophosphate kinase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase to yield lamivudine 5′-triphosphate, which is the active anabolite [

Tenofovir disoproxil is a derivative of adenosine 5′-monophosphate lacking a complete ribose ring, and it is the only nucleotide analogue currently marketed for the treatment of HIV infection, being active against HIV-1, HIV-2 and HBV. After a rapid hydrolysis, tenofovir is formed, being then phosphorylated by cellular kinases to its active metabolite, tenofovir diphosphate which is a competitive inhibitor of viral reverse transcriptases and is incorporated into HIV DNA, causing chain termination [
