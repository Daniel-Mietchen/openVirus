<p>In 2018, an interdisciplinary team of virologists and biochemists, which developed low-cost and “cell-friendly” nanogels that can efficiently prevent viral infections, addressed these challenges [
 <xref rid="B203-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>]. Here, the flexible, nontoxic and broad-spectrum nanogels based on dendritic polyglycerol sulfate mimic cellular surface receptors where several viral families bind. The designed nanogels can multivalently interact with viral glycoproteins, shield virus surfaces, and efficiently block infection since they act as robust inhibitors for these viruses.
