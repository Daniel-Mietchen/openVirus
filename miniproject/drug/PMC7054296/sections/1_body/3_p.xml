<p id="Par4">Taken together, we propose that CRISPR/Cas13d system is potentially a straightforward, flexible, and rapid novel approach for the treatment and prevention of RNA virus infection. Future studies determining the safety and efficacy of this system in eliminating 2019-nCovÂ (SARS-CoV-2) and other viruses in animal models are needed before its therapeutic application to patients. If proven to be effective, this therapeutic approach will provide patients worldwide with more options to fight against life-threatening viruses that have the potential to evolve and develop resistance rapidly.</p>
