<p id="Par2">Our group has implemented a flexible and efficient approach for targeting RNA in the laboratory using CRISPR/Cas13d technology (under review), and here we propose that this system can be used to specifically chew up 2019-nCov (SARS-CoV-2) RNA genome, hence limiting its ability to reproduce. To functionally disrupt the virus, we will specifically use guide RNAs (gRNAs) that concomitantly target ORF1ab and S, which represent the replicase-transcriptase (ORF1ab) and the spike (S) of the virus. The Gilead’s NUC inhibitor, remdesivir, having a similar chemical structure to HIV reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, is currently being tested in clinical trials for 2019-nCov (SARS-CoV-2), while a drug targeting the spike glycoprotein has also been tested in phase I trials for the treatment of HIV and SARS-CoV.
