  <title>Analysis of genomic variations between 2019-nCov(SARS-CoV-2) viruses from infected patients in different countries and a flexible CRISPR/Cas13d strategy for treating 2019-nCov(SARS-CoV-2) virus infection and countering its evolution.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold>, 
   <bold>b</bold> Sequence analysis of 2019-nCov(SARS-CoV-2) virus RNA genome with available complete sequences from 19 infected patients in China, USA and Australia. Lineage tree (
   <bold>a</bold>) and peptide sequence alignment (
   <bold>b</bold>) for a portion of the polypeptide ORF8 of 2019-nCov (SARS-CoV-2), showing sequence variation between the 2019-nCov (SARS-CoV-2) viruses from different patients. The sequences were extracted from GenBank then aligned with MUSCLE algorithm and visualized with Jalview. Red arrows in (
   <bold>b</bold>) indicate regions with variants. Geographical locations and GenBank IDs of the 19 patients are shown. 
   <bold>c</bold> A model for Cas13d cleavage of 2019-nCov (SARS-CoV-2) RNA genome. 
   <bold>d</bold> Number of guide RNAs that can be designed to cleave each peptide-encoding region of 2019-nCov (SARS-CoV-2) RNA genome without affecting the human genome. All possbile guide RNAs (gRNAs) containing 22 nt spacer sequences were generated for peptide-encoding regions of 2019-nCov (SARS-CoV-2) RNA genome then mapped to human genome with Bowtie. Guide RNAs with no alignment to human genome allowing up to 2 mismatches were considered to be specific to the 2019-nCov (SARS-CoV-2) RNA genome without human genome recognition. 
   <bold>e</bold> Schematic for AAV design carrying Cas13d effector and a three-gRNA array for treatment of patients with 2019-nCov (SARS-CoV-2) infection. ITR inverted terminal repeats.
