<p>There are several limitations to this study. First, we chose to permit only one response per LHD and allowed anyone within the LHD to respond. Thus, we received responses from SNS coordinators, health officers and other LHD personnel. It is possible that SNS coordinators and other health department staff, especially health officers, experienced the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic differently given their different roles. To account for this, we gave LHDs the flexibility of choosing the person who was most familiar with their antiviral response. Given that ninety eight percent of respondents stated that they knew "a lot" about their agency's antiviral response activities, we consider their perspectives to be a valid representation of the LHDs' experience.</p>
