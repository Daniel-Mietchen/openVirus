<p>Prior to 2009, state and federal agencies made substantial investments in antiviral drugs for use during a influenza pandemic, including the purchase of nearly 81 million courses of antiviral drugs. The large-scale deployment of this asset during the H1N1 influenza response provides us unique learning opportunity regarding the public health role in the management of antiviral activities at the local level, an area of the H1N1 influenza response that has not been well studied. Results of this study therefore offer an important descriptive account of LHD management of publicly purchased antivirals in California, and provide practitioners, policy makers, and academics with a practice-based assessment of these events. The issues raised and the challenges faced by LHDs during H1N1 should be leveraged to inform public health planning for future pandemics and other emergency events that require medical countermeasure dispensing activities.</p>
