<p>The need for the public health management of antiviral drugs during an influenza pandemic did not take public health officials by surprise. Prior to 2009, public health agencies and community partners had been actively engaged in preparedness activities in anticipation of antiviral utilization during an influenza pandemic. Among those efforts were large-scale purchase of antiviral drugs and the development of plans to appropriately use these medications to treat influenza illness and to reduce the impact of a pandemic [

However, given few opportunities to observe real-world response to an influenza pandemic, the preparedness community's understanding of state and local readiness for implementing a large-scale antiviral program has been limited. As a result, pre-pandemic assessments have reached wide-ranging conclusions regarding this preparedness capacity. In 2008, a federal assessment of pandemic influenza State Operating Plans found that "there are very few gaps in State readiness for antiviral drug distribution" [

While these reports may, at first, seem contradictory, the findings illuminate the differences in the roles, responsibilities, and capacities of health departments at the state and local levels. For many states, including California, the primary responsibility for managing local antiviral drug activities resides with Local Health Departments (LHDs) in order to enable local control, planning, and implementation [
