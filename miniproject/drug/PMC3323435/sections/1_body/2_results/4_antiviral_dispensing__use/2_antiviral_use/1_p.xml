<p>Potential uses of antiviral drugs include treatment, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and post-exposure prophylaxis. LHDs were asked about allowable uses for publicly purchased antivirals in their community and the target groups for each allowable use (Tables 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). In addition to the target groups presented in Tables 3 and 4, several LHDs further specified that restrictions on populations eligible for publicly purchased antivirals for treatment were lifted when antivirals were not commercially available. Regarding prophylaxis, LHDs noted that publicly purchased antivirals were dispensed to uninsured or underinsured persons, children, and household members of ill persons early in the pandemic in order to slow transmission of the virus.
