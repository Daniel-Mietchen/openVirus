<p>Sixty-one LHDs were invited to participate in this study. Forty-four local health departments completed the survey, resulting in a 72% response rate. These counties represent 74% of the population of California. Participating agencies did not statistically differ from non-participating agencies with respect to the size of population served by the health department (chi-square with two degrees of freedom = 5.64, 
 <italic>p </italic>= 0.35) or median household income (t = 0, 
 <italic>p </italic>= 0.60). There was a borderline significant difference in the geographic distribution of responding counties (chi-square with two degrees of freedom = 5.64, 
 <italic>p </italic>= 0.06), with the lowest participation in the southern region (46%) compared to the inland region (81%) and the coastal region (76%) [
