<p id="Par5">Chloroquine (CQ) and its less toxic derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are well known for their immunomodulating effects in rheumatology. For decades, these drugs have been used for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. The justification for their use in COVID-19 is largely based on the knowledge of their intracellular action [
