<p id="Par3">The affection of the lower airways in severe COVID-19 is driven by uncontrolled immune-mediated inflammatory response. T lymphocytes are the main target cells in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to COVID-19, triggering cytokine storm with subsequent exhaustion of immune response [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Importantly, there is no association between the viral load and severity of the disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The cascade of the disease pathways is reminiscent of systemic immune disturbances, particularly those in severe rheumatic flare. Based on the current knowledge of COVID-19 pathophysiology and clinical manifestations, the rationale for searching specific antivirals along with immune-modulating drugs is justifiable. A quick search through the US National Library of Medicine Clinical Trials registry (

Ongoing research brings about hope for developing evidence-based anti-rheumatic therapies for the viral disease.
