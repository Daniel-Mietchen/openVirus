<p>In spite of tremendous advancements in antiviral drugs, there are several problems with the existing antiviral treatments, including safety and efficacy limitations, as well as their high costs (

 <xref rid="B197" ref-type="bibr">Revuelta-Herrero et al., 2018</xref>). The catastrophic rise in viral infections and related mortality urged a growing need to provide safe and effective drugs to treat viral diseases. It has yet remained a challenge due to the small number of targets in viruses, the rapid evolution of viral genes, the rapid emergence of drug-resistant pathways, and the appearance of new viral strains through mutations (

 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Gogineni et al., 2015</xref>). Recent developments in the investigation of novel cellular and molecular mechanisms of virus invasion and replication have provided alternative or additional innovative and effective therapeutic strategies. There are several natural compounds already with proven antiviral value in preventing and/or attenuating viral diseases or that are waiting to be evaluated for therapeutic applications. Anthocyanins are believed to display an array of beneficial actions on human health and well-being. Due to our increasing understanding and awareness of the potential beneficial human health effects, research on anthocyanins has recently intensified. A growing number of studies have recently shown the diverse beneficial effects of anthocyanins in vegetables and fruits, including the anti-cancer, anti-diabetes, ant-aging, anti-allergy, cardioprotection, anti-mutagenesis, and antimicrobial effects (

Besides, considering the inhibitory effects of anthocyanins on different pathways involved in virus life cycle, they would be hopeful antiviral therapies. Several other biological and pharmacological effects of anthocyanins are incessantly being investigated.
