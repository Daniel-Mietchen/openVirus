<p>Additional studies should include the investigation of other effective and novel plant-derived antiviral lead-compounds, with synergistic effects for a more favorable treatment outcome capable of enhancing immunity and reducing the cost, toxicity, and viral resistance, as well as finding their virus-specific targets and related pharmacological mechanisms of action. Synthetic campaigns could adjust these lead-compounds to find even more efficient drugs against several viral infections. Drug delivery must also be improved by new technologies using novel nano-formulation. Nonetheless, it is crucial to confirm the effects of plant-derived lead-compound in clinical trial studies.</p>
