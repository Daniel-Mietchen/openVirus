<p>Vázquez-Calvo et al. studied the effect of anthocyanin, delphinidin, and cyanidin on the viral infections of flaviviruses family, including west nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), and zika virus (ZIKV). The results showed that delphinidin reduced WNV. Further assays discovered that delphinidin generally interfered with the attachment, adsorption, and entrance stages of the viral cycle and has a direct effect on the virus particles executing a virucidal activity. The same inhibitory activity of WNV variants was reported with acidic pH variation in the endosomal system for viral fusion. It was also shown that anthocyanins exhibiting antiviral activity against WNV is initiated by a virucidal activity instead of an inhibitory activity of viral fusion that was dependent on pH. Delphinidin also decreased the viral activity of DENV and ZIKV. Finally, delphinidin was reported to disrupt the viral activity of three viruses of the flaviviruses family in the cell culture (
