<p>Swaminathan et al. assessed the activity of cyanidin, delphinidin, pelargonidin as three anthocyanins against 430-cavity of InfV neuraminidase and their binding site using molecular docking and mass spectrometry. Regardless of structural similarity, these compounds had differences not only in the position but also in the number of OH groups in the benzyl substituent connected to the chromenylium ring. The precise distinction in the binding site features was exhibited by molecular docking and mass spectrometry. Delphinidin and cyanidin, with the most number of OH substituents, bound firmly and had more inhibitory properties than pelargonidin with only one OH substituent at 4Â´ position. Finally, the position and number of OH groups of anthocyanins were shown to affect their antiviral activity (
