<p>Nano-medicine employs biodegradable and biocompatible nanoparticles to target administration routes, pharmacokinetics, and bioavailability of the target drug. Nanoparticles are regarded as sub-micron-sized particles with good dispersion, regular spherical shape, molecular forces, and surface chemical bonds (

Nano-formulations could potentiate the existing drugs with antiviral activity through the positive modulation of pharmacokinetics and enhancement of bioavailability. Additionally, nano-medicine enhances the therapeutic window for antiviral medicines
