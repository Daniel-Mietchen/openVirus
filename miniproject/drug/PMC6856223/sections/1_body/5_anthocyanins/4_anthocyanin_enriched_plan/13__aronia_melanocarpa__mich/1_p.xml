 <xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr">Oszmiansk and Sapis (1988)</xref>. The most-observed anthocyanins in 
 <italic>A. melanocarpa</italic> fruit juice (AMFJ) were cyanidins, which were mainly in the form of aglycone (
 <xref rid="B231" ref-type="bibr">Valcheva-Kuzmanova et al., 2003</xref>). Valcheva-Kuzmanova et al. reported that AMFJ, rich in anthocyanins, decreased the activity of hemagglutination of two InfV subtypes. The OH group in location 3 was shown to be responsible for the pharmacological antiviral mechanism of 
 <italic>A. melanocarpa</italic> anthocyanins to the highest inhibition level of HSV-1 replication (
 <xref rid="B247" ref-type="bibr">Wleklik et al., 1988</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bae et al., 2000</xref>). According to the results, the complex formation between the virion and anthocyanins influenced the adsorption stage of InfV infection (
 <xref rid="B231" ref-type="bibr">Valcheva-Kuzmanova et al., 2003</xref>). In another study, the anti-infV activity of chokeberry was evaluated. This plant showed cross-reactivity against InfV through anti-hemagglutinin activity by masking the hemagglutinin head in a non-specific circumstance. It is also inhibiting the viral proteins, which are impressing the maturation by blocking cellular signaling pathway (
 <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2013</xref>). So, in viral infections, promising effects might be expected from AMFJ through stimulation of the immune system.
