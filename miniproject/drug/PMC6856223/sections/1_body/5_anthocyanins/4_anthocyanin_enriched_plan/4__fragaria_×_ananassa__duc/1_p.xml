<p>An analysis of the anthocyanins of strawberry varieties reported by Garcia‐Viguera et al. introduced cyanidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-rutinoside in fresh and frozen fruit (

The extracts were evaluated for in vitro anti-HSV activity. They showed that aromas and camarosa cultivars had the highest TA, but camino real cultivar presented the lowest TA. The two first cultivars also showed the most activity against the herpes virus, while the camino real cultivar had the lowest activity. Finally, the authors suggested a relationship between the amount of anthocyanins and the detected anti-HSV for the strawberry’s cultivars (

They revealed that the concentrations equal to or greater than 20µg/ml of strawberry’s anthocyanins completely inhibited HSV-1 (
