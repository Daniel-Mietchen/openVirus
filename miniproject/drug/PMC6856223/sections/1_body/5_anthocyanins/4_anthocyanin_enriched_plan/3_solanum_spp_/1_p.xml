<p>As red potatoes, 
 <italic>Solanum stenotomum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> were surveyed potential sources for natural red colorants, especially anthocyanins and contained pelargonidin-3-rutinoside-5-glucoside acylated with 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid as major anthocyanins (
 <xref rid="B198" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez‚ÄêSaona et al., 1998</xref>). Only the anthocyanins of red-fleshed potato were observed to possess antiviral effects till now (
 <xref rid="B270" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2009</xref>). Hayashi et al. investigated the activity of red-fleshed potato anthocyanins against the InfV A and B viruses. According to the results, the purified 
 <italic>Solanum</italic> sp. anthocyanin, pelanin, pelargonidin, pelargonidin 3-
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaroylglucose-5-malonylglucose, and pelargonidin 3-
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaroylglucose-5-glucose were effective against the InfV B virus. They also reported that the inhibitory impact of anthocyanins against InfV A and B viruses arose from their molecular structure, synergistic effects, and coexisting components of tuber (

 <xref rid="B270" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2009</xref>). Valadares et al. investigated the antiviral effect of 
 <italic>S. paniculatum</italic> against murine encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCv), human herpes virus type 1 (HHV-1), and vaccinia virus strains Western Reserve (VACV-WR). According to the results, the extract of 
 <italic>S. paniculatum</italic> inhibited the replication of HHV-1, but exhibited no effect on VACV-WR and EMCv (
 <xref rid="B230" ref-type="bibr">Valadares et al., 2009</xref>). Javid et al. also studied the anti HCV activity of chloroform extract of 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic> seeds (SNS). As reported by the authors, the chloroform extract of SNS reduced the expression or function of HCV NS3 protease in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, NS3 may have extra effects involved in interference with host cell functions, like inhibition of protein kinase A-mediated signal transduction or cell transformation. Besides, the antiviral activity of SNS is a target for therapeutic development of new antiviral compounds for acute and chronic HCV, where NS3- mediated processing of the polyprotein is essential for HCV RNA replication and maturation (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Javed et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, the antiviral effects of 
 <italic>Solanum</italic> sp. anthocyanins are believed to belong to the synergistic or additive effect of them with other coexisting pigments, which inhibit the replication and decrease the expression of protease for RNA replication and maturation. Therefore, this species is a conspicuous source of antiviral agents and could become a structure template for the development of new antiviral therapy.
