<p>Cyanidin, peonidin, pelargonidin, delphinidin, petunidin and malvidin glycosides as a wide variety of anthocyanins were isolated and quantified in the 24 wild and cultivated berry fruit species using high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) (

In their study, Glomb et al. examined the methanol extract of wild berries (raspberry and strawberry of the Rosaceae, and lingonberry and bilberry of the Ericaceae family) against the representatives of Orthomyxo-, Paramyxo- and Picorna-viridae. The antiviral effects of methanolic extract, anthocyanin and non-anthocyanin fractions were evaluated on Picornaviridae [e.g., coxsackievirus B1 (CV-B1) and poliovirus type 1 (PV-1)], Paramyxoviridae (e.g. human respiratory syncytial virus A2 (HRSV-A2)), and Orthomyxoviridae such as InfV A. According to the results, the methanolic extracts of all types of berries inhibited the replication of InfV A and CV-B1. The total extract of strawberry and bilberry inhibited the highest degree of CV-B1 replication. Lingonberry, strawberry, and bilberry extracts also inhibited the InfV A virus. All of the anthocyanins fractions of wild berries had a potent effect and inhibited the replication of InfV A; however, they did not show any significant activity against the other tested viruses (
