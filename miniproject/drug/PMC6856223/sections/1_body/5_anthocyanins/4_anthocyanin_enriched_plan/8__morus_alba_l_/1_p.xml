<p>Cyanidin hexoside, cyanidin rhamnosylhexoside, cyanidin galloylhexoside, petunidin rhamnosylhexoside, pelargonidin hexoside, delphinidin hexoside, and delphinidin acetylhexoside as a part of anthocyanins, were reported in the extracts of mulberry (known as 
 <italic>Morus alba</italic> (MA)) fruits with different distributions and contents (
 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">Natić et al., 2015</xref>). MA belongs to the Moraceae family, with antiviral activity to combat hepatitis B and C viruses (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Jacob et al., 2007</xref>). Kim et al. studied the antiviral activities of MA and its juice (MAJ) and seed (MAS). MAJ fixed the glutathion (GSH) levels in the infected cells and showed ferric ion-reducing and DPPH radical scavenging activities. In the phenolic compound of MAJ, cyanidin-3-rutinoside had the highest amount and indicated a weak inhibition against InfV B in pre-treatment stage. The suggested mechanism of action of this extract against InfV would be a direct inhibition at the phase of attachment or internalization and intervention with the ROS-mediated cell damage caused by InfV infection. Finally, the results suggested that MAJ was more potential to be considered as a lead compound with antiviral activity against pre- and co-treatment but not post-treatment stage of InfV with no cytotoxicity against MDCK cells (

 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Nam et al. studied the anti-inflammatory properties of mulberry extract (ME) against adenovirus 36 (Ad36) in mice. The mixture of ME compound (1-deoxynojirimycin, kuromanin chloride, and resveratrol) and ME inhibited the virus replication by 50% and 70%, in contrast with the control group. Moreover, the ME reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokines, like monocyte chemoattractant protein‐1 (MCP-1) and TNF-α, and also decreased the concentration of macrophages and infiltrating immune cells in the fat layers of epiderm. Therefore, it can be concluded that the dietary ME might lead to prevention or treatment of obesity and inflammation caused by Ad36 (
 <xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">Na et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the authors asserted that MAJ might be useful in the prevention of foodborne viral infection, treatment of obesity and inflammation caused by Ad36 and may have a prosperous future in the prevention and treatment of viral disease.
