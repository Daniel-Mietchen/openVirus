<p>The sugar residues of anthocyanin may be acylated by caffeic, sinapic, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric, and ferulic acids, and occasionally by acetic acid, malonic acid or 
 <italic>p</italic>-hydroxybenzoic acid. The position of the C-3 in sugar is sometimes substituted by acyl (

 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Goto, 1987</xref>). The acidic pH of anthocyanins causes the following principal equilibrium types, including the quinonoidal base, which captures proton and produces the flavylium cation with a resonating system, picking up H
 <sub>2</sub>O and leading the reaction for producing the anhydrobase or carbinol, and the chalcone types (

The stability of anthocyanins depends on major parameters like oxygen, chemical structure, pH, light, solvents, concentration, processing and storage temperature, the presence of proteins, enzymes, metallic ions, flavonoids, and presentment of ascorbic acid preserve from sugars and oxidation (
