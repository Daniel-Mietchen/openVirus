<p>The current studies also confirmed the role of host immune modulators toward antiviral effects, as the agonist of toll-like receptor-3 or 7 (TLR-3 or 7), showed the potential antiviral effects (

It is now well known that several other therapeutic targets can improve the clinical outcome of our current standard treatment, such as programmed death 1 (PD-1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing molecule 3 (TIM-3) (
