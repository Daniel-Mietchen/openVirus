<p>Following uncoating, nucleic acid synthesis is the third step of the viral life cycle, which is mediated by viral enzymes, including RNA polymerase, DNA polymerase, and reverse transcriptase. So, these enzymes have been considered as alternative targets in many viral infections such as HBV (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">De Clercq, 2015</xref>), herpes simplex virus-1/2 (HSV-1/2) and HIV-1. There are more targets and, also, more drugs against HIV in comparison to other viruses. Viral polymerase inhibitors are classified into nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTIs), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) (

 <xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">Montaner et al., 2010</xref>). Despite a rapid mutation for the first-generation NNRTIs (e.g., nevirapine, efavirenz, delavirdine) as the efficacy limitation agent (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">de BÃ©thune, 2010</xref>), the second generation NNRTIs (e.g., etravirine, rilpivirine) possess a flexible structure and overcome common NNRTI resistance-associated mutations (

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). Altogether, most antiretroviral therapies did not eradicate the viral infection. Instead, they limited the immune recovery and their long-term use results in resistance and toxicity (
