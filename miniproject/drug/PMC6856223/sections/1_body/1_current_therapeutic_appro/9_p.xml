<p>From the antiviral drugs restrictions point of view, there is no suitable vaccine or therapeutic option for many viral infections. Conventional antiviral drugs are limited by the inadequate response, the rapid development of resistance, and adverse effects. It is well established that using even standard and the same doses of antiviral drugs may result in different inter-individual serum concentrations and clinical outcomes, the reasons for which may be multifactorial including differences in concomitant medications, underlying diseases, treatment compliance, genetic factors, and gender-related metabolism. This noticeably influences the antiviral efficacy, consequent resistant variants, and the toxicity incidence. Drug hypersensitivity reactions, which vary in clinical manifestations, severity, and frequency, are among other adverse effects of a few antiviral drugs (

 </xref>). Altogether, the best antiviral agents would include those more effective, having less resistance and which pose low toxicity. Therefore, the development of innovative and novel therapeutic and preventive strategies for viral infections is of particular importance. Further research is necessary to increase our knowledge about antiviral drugs adverse effects, to discover unknown mechanisms of novel therapies and to develop new antiviral agent (e.g. plant-derived) with innovative pharmacological mechanisms.
