<p>The interaction between the virus and the host cell membrane or receptor(s) is the first phase of the viral life cycle called fusion/entry. Fusion/entry inhibitors have been more provided for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment (

A novel lipopeptide known as myrcludex B also blocks taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP); the co-receptor which is crucial for either hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis D virus (HDV) entry into hepatocytes (
