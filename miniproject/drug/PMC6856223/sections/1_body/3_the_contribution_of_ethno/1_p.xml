<p>In the past few years, some natural products and synthetic compounds had potential 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antiviral activities. Among them, only a few have been approved for clinical use by western health (
 <xref rid="B239" ref-type="bibr">Vlietinck and Berghe, 1991</xref>). However, some agents have been in drug development, including both preclinical and clinical assessment, and have led to more prospects for discovering new antiviral agents with promising future. Among these antiviral substances, some are natural compounds which were isolated from medicinal plants used in complementary and traditional medicine, such as polysaccharides (

 <xref rid="B178" ref-type="bibr">Özçelik et al., 2011</xref>), depsides (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Hassan et al., 2019</xref>) and amino acids (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 1998</xref>). The number of secondary metabolites showed a unique antiviral mechanism of action and have a promising future for clinical research (
