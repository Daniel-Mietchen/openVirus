<p>Developing antivirals for potential bioterror agents and emerging pathogens is difficult for a small company, but it is also very important. Endemic viral diseases wreak havoc in developing countries, are emerging in new locations and continue to exist as biowarfare threats. We have had a number of recent examples of the rapidity with which an emerging viral disease can impact mankind. HIV was first reported in the United States in 1981, and now there are almost a million people in this country, and some 40 million in the world, who are living with HIV/AIDS. Other more recent emerging diseases are SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), and avian flu, which have the potential to cause major pandemics.</p>
