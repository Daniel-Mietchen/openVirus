<p>A dispersive development model is also necessary for moving these types of antivirals through development, especially animal efficacy testing (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). We have set up essential collaborations with appropriate academic laboratories, federal officials, private facilities, and the Department of Defense to capture all the expertise required to study and test antivirals. In the case of smallpox, there are numerous surrogate animal models being studied across the United States, and elsewhere, and we have availed ourselves of as many of those animal models as possible to address potential FDA concerns. Also, access to certain viruses, such as variola virus, are highly restricted and work can only be done at limited sites under high level containment. In the case of variola virus, work can only be done in the BSL-4 laboratory at the CDC. Without all these collaborations, it would not have been possible to develop ST-246.
