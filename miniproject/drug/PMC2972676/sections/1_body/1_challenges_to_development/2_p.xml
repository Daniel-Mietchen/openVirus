<p>The first challenge that drug developers face is the paucity of available information about many of these exotic pathogens. Because these are primarily tropical diseases, endemic in developing countries, relatively little research attention and funding has been focused on them until recently. The hemorrhagic fever viruses are commonly lumped together into a group of “similar” diseases caused by four very different types of viruses: arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, filoviruses, and flaviviruses. While it is true that the clinical symptoms produced by these viruses are similar, each of the viruses has a different genome and replication strategy, so it is highly unlikely that a single drug will be developed that can treat all of these diseases.</p>
