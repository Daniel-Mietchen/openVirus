<p id="Par13">Each 25 µl reaction buffer contained 50 ng of genomic DNA, 300 µM primers and 100 µM probe. Real-time PCR was performed by using the jCycler instrument (Bio-Rad, USA) and cycling condition of 95 °C for 2 min. followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 15 sec, 57 °C for 20 sec and 72 for 20 sec. All samples were run in duplicate. Absolute mtDNA and nDNA copy numbers were calculated using serial dilutions of plasmids with known copy numbers. RNA was isolated using phenol/chloroform method, DNA was digested by DNase treatment (DNA–Free, Ambion, Austin, USA). One µg of RNA was transcribed into cDNA using random–hexamer primers and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad USA).</p>
