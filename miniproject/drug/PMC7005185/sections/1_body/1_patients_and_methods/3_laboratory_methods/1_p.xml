<p id="Par12">Total DNA was extracted from PBMCs with Pure Link Genomic DNA isolation Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad USA). A real-time PCR method was utilized to quantify mtDNA. Primers and probes utilized for the detection of mitochondrial (mt) DNA/RNA and nuclear (n) DNA/RNA were designed using the Beacon Design software (Bio-Rad USA). The primers and labeled probes in the cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COII) gene were: forward primer (5′-AATTCCCGGACGTCTAAACC-3′) reverse primer (5′-ACGGGCCCTATTTCAAAGAT-3′) and probe (5′-FAM- ACCGGGGGTATACTACGGTC-3′). For nDNA detection GAPDH gene GAPDH forward (5′-GGAACCTCTCCTGGTCCTGTTG-3′), reverse primer (5′-GTCCCCGCACCTCCAG AAAC3′) and probe (5′-VIC-ATGGCGGCTTCTGCGGCGGAGA-3′) were used.</p>
