<p id="Par10">Each patient was interviewed on risk factors for HBV infection. Demographic characteristics, therapeutic history and HBV infection stage by calculating APRI and Child-Pugh scores, laboratory parameters and HBV-DNA levels were obtained from clinical records. A complete antiviral therapy history was collected. Total antiviral therapy duration was defined as the duration (months) of antiviral therapy, independently of the drug regimen, including current and previous therapies whereas current therapy duration was defined as the duration (months) of the last antiviral therapy regimen. The study visit included the measurement of following parameters: arterial blood pressure, BMI and anthropometric measures. The presence of body shape changes (BSC) was evaluated with a self-reported questionnaire and confirmed by the physician during the study visit. The possible signs of lipodystrophy were related to peripheral lipoatrophy, central fat accumulation, and lipomatosis, including buffalo hump, fat accumulation in abdomen, mammary region, lipomatosis and fat loss in the face, arms, legs and buttocks. BSC were considered present when the patient had signs of lipoatrophy/lipoaccumulation in at least three body sites. Patients with history of decompensated cirrhosis and HCC were excluded.</p>
