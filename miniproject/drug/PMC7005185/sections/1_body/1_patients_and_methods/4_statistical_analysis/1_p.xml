<p id="Par15">The statistical analysis was performed using StatSoft STATISTICA Software, release 6.0. The difference in categorical variables among groups was evaluated using usual chi-square or Fisher exact test, when appropriate, whereas non-parametric Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U-test were used to compare continuous variables. The correlations between continuous variables were studied using the Spearmanâ€™s correlation test. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to evaluate possible predictors of mtDNA/nDNA and mtRNA/nRNA ratio.</p>
