<p id="Par49">Our data suggest that HBV-infected patients receiving 1
 <sup>st</sup> generation NA therapy may have significant differences in BSC and mitochondrial damage with respect to HBV-infected naïves and HBV-negative controls, which is statistically significant despite the relatively small number of cases. Furthermore, BSC were significantly more prevalent in long-term NA-treated HBV-infected patients, especially in those currently or previously exposed to lamivudine + adefovir.
