 </sup>. In our study, we evidenced a significantly lower mtRNA concentration in HBV infected patients exposed to NA therapy with respect to HBV infected na√Øve patients and HBV negative controls. In addition, NA-treated patients with BSC have significantly lower levels of mtRNA when compared with those without. We also found a significant negative correlation between mtRNA levels and NA therapy duration.
