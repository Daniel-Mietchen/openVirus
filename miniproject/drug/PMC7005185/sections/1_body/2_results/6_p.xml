<p id="Par22">We analyzed 52 patients according to single drug regimen after excluding the 2 patients receiving lamivudine monotherapy. mtDNA/nDNA ratio levels were significantly higher in patients on therapy with lamivudine + adefovir (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) compared to those receiving entecavir (p = 0.025), to Group B (p = 0.00006) and Group C (p = 0.00003). Patients receiving tenofovir had significantly higher mtDNA/nDNA ratio levels when compared to Group B (p = 0.0006) and Group C (p = 0.038) and had higher levels when compared to patients receiving entecavir, tough not significantly. Patients receiving entecavir had significantly higher levels when compared to Group C (p = 0.023), whereas no difference was found with Group B (Fig.
