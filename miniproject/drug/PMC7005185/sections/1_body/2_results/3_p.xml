<p id="Par19">The demographic, clinical and therapeutic characteristics of these patients and of naïve HBV patients are illustrated in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. No statistical difference was found in age, gender, BMI, known infection duration, AST, ALT or creatinine levels and APRI score values. Median total antiviral therapy duration was 37 months (IQR 24–60) in patients currently receiving entecavir, 73 months (IQR 57–108) in those receiving tenofovir and 96 months (IQR 66–150) in those treated with lamivudine + adefovir. The only statistically significant difference in total therapy duration was between entecavir and tenofovir treated patients (p = 0.001) whereas, even if the median total treatment duration was even longer, only a trend toward significance was observed when comparing entecavir and lamivudine + adefovir (p = 0.087). Among patients receiving tenofovir, 12/20 (60%) were previously treated with lamivudine + adefovir, 3 (15%) with lamivudine, 2/20 (10%) with lamivudine + entecavir and 3/10 (15%) have received only tenofovir monotherapy. Among patients treated with entecavir, 5/12 (41.7%) have been previously treated with lamivudine, 1/12 (8.3%) with lamivudine + adefovir and 6/12 (50%) have been treated only with entecavir. No statistical difference was found in age, gender, BMI, known infection duration, AST, ALT or creatinine levels and APRI score values when considering separately patients currently receiving entecavir monotherapy, tenofovir monotherapy and lamivudine + adefovir.
