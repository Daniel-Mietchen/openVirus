<p id="Par23">Similarly, patients on therapy with lamivudine + adefovir showed significantly lower mtRNA/nRNA ratio values when compared to patients receiving tenofovir (p = 0.027) and entecavir (p = 0.011). Patients receiving lamivudine + adefovir had also significantly lower mtRNA/nRNA ratio levels in comparison with Group B (p = 0.0039) and Group C (p = 0.0000001). Furthermore, no statistical difference between entecavir and tenofovir recipients was observed (Fig.
