<p id="Par40">These data are in line with clinical data showing elevated levels of IL-6 in sputum of asthmatic children during virus-induced exacerbation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and IL-4 triggered airway responsiveness in asthmatic patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Additionally, a study of Massoud and colleagues showed that IL-4 and IL-6 are involved in converting induced regulatory T (T
 <sub>reg</sub>) cells into T
 <sub>H</sub>-17 like cells, therefore potentially contributing to asthma severity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Thus, reduced levels of IL-4 and IL-6 by rupintrivir could abolish the ongoing inflammation triggered by T
 <sub>H</sub>-2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-6 in asthmatic patients.
