<p id="Par36">Antiviral drugs such as rupintrivir may have an immune-modulatory effect in experimentally induced allergic asthma with subsequent RV infection. We infected lung slices of HDM-sensitized asthmatic mice ex vivo. Our results imply that tissue slices of allergic mice showed a reduced epithelial and antiviral response to RV infection ex vivo. At the same time T
 <sub>H</sub>-2 cytokines such as IL-4 were increased. Rupintrivir reduced RV-induced cytokines IL-4 and IL-6 in lung slices of asthmatic mice in comparison with slices of untreated asthmatic animals. While the response to RV infection of lung slices of asthmatic mice was expected, the data for the efficacy of rupintrivir in RV-infected lung slices of asthmatic mice are new.
