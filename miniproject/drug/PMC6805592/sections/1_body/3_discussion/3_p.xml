<p id="Par38">Our results show that RV infection ex vivo differs between lung slices obtained from asthmatic and healthy mice. RV induced a normal antiviral response in lung tissue of healthy animals. We observed increased levels of IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, MCP-1, TNF-α, IP-10, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-17A. In contrast, PCLS of asthmatic mice showed reduced levels of epithelial cytokines type I (IFN-α/β) and NK-cell secreted type II (IFN-γ) IFN response to RV infection. These cytokines act both directly as antivirals as well as indirectly by regulating the activity of natural killer cells, phagocytosis of macrophages, and adaptive immune responses [

 <sub>H</sub>-2 cytokine IL-4. This is in line with results received from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy and asthmatic subjects, where RV infection also increased IL-4 expression in asthmatic subjects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. IL-33 and IL-17A levels were elevated in the tissue and BAL of asthmatic mice. Studies have shown elevated levels of epithelial-derived IL-33 in asthmatic patients [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] leading to airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. IL-17A is secreted by T
 <sub>H</sub>-17 cells and is involved in mucosal as well as epithelial host defense [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Graser and colleagues showed that IL-17A was responsible for RV clearance in epithelial cells. IL-17A levels were diminished in asthmatic children infected with RV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In accordance with our study, ex vivo infection reduced IL-17A levels in lung slices of asthmatic animals. This indicates that lung tissue of asthmatic mice is capable of reacting to the viral infection but with a reduced capacity of inducing protective immune responses. These results confirm an impaired antiviral response towards RV infection under allergic conditions in vivo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Asthmatic patients experimentally infected with rhinovirus showed more severe disease, increased viral burden and stronger airway inflammation in comparison to infected healthy individuals [
