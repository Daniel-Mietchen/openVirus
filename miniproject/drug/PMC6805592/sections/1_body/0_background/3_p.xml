<p id="Par15">Rupintrivir (AG7088, developed by Agouron Pharmaceuticals) is a synthetic 3C protease inhibitor, with potent in vitro activity against viral serotypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The 3C protease is essential for cleaving the polyprotein precursor into structural proteins and enzymes that are required for viral replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In in vitro cell cultures of BEAS-2B (an immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line) rupintrivir has shown potent antiviral activity as well as reduced RV-induced interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 release compared with untreated cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. During a phase-II clinical trial, rupintrivir failed to show beneficial effects in patients with naturally acquired colds with no underlying chronic respiratory disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In this double-blinded clinical trial, rupintrivir was applied within 36â€‰h of cold symptoms emergence, and showed only moderate efficacy. Although antiviral drugs against the common cold failed to relieve symptoms in healthy individuals, patients with prolonged chronic lung diseases may benefit from a drug preventing symptom amplification. The effect of rupintrivir in allergic asthma is unknown and has not been investigated so far. We hypothesize that the effect of the antiviral drug rupintrivir is altered under asthmatic conditions and may result in beneficial effects in prevention of exaggerated T
