 <sub>H</sub>-2 cytokine IL-4 was observed ex vivo in tissue from HDM-sensitized mice upon RV infection, whereas RV had no effect on IL-4 secretion in PCLS from non-sensitized mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Rupintrivir attenuated the IL-4-induced exaggeration in RV infected PCLS of HDM-sensitized mice by reducing the IL-4 levels from 1520 to 763 pg/mg. The overall levels of IL-5 increased in PCLS of HDM-sensitized mice, but were not exaggerated by the RV infection. IL-13 levels remained unaltered in both groups. RV induced a pro-inflammatory response in both non-sensitized and sensitized lung tissues, resulting in enhanced secretion of IL-6 in non-sensitized tissue (16 vs. 43 ng/ mg), however, it was more pronounced in tissue of HDM-sensitized mice (58 vs. 98 ng/mg). The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was elevated in PCLS from both groups upon viral infection with 218 vs. 348 pg/mg in the non-sensitized group, and 1112 vs. 1530 pg/mg in the HDM-sensitized group. The overall levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were exaggerated in RV-infected slices from the HDM-sensitized group. Rupintrivir showed no effect on IL-6 or IL-10 in tissue from non-sensitized animals, however, it resulted in reduced levels of IL-6 (98 vs. 52 ng/mg), and IL-10 (1530 vs. 1246 pg/mg) in tissue of HDM-sensitized mice. IL-33 remained unchanged upon viral infection in both groups when compared to the corresponding UV-inactivated control, although the overall level of IL-33 was higher in the HDM-sensitized group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). UV-inactivated RV did not trigger pro-inflammatory or T
 <sub>H</sub>-2 cytokine secretion compared to uninfected medium control.
