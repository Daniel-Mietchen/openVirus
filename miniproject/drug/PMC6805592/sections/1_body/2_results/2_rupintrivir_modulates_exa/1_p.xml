<p id="Par30">To gain first insight about the efficacy of rupintrivir in lower respiratory tract infections under asthmatic conditions, the cytokine response to RV infection and the effect of rupintrivir on this response were analyzed ex vivo in lung tissue of HDM-sensitized and non-sensitized mice. Viability of PCLS was not affected throughout the infection experiment as confirmed by confocal imaging of calcein AM / ethidiumhomodimer-1 (EthD-1) stained slices (Additional file
