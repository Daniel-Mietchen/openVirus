<p id="Par31">PCLS from HDM-sensitized and non-sensitized mice were infected with RV for 48 h. Infection caused a slight accumulation of dead cells around airways although that increase was not sufficient to change the total number of dead cells. The viral load in tissue culture supernatant was quantified 48 h p.i. as infectious units (IU) assessed by dilution plating on HeLa cells and calculation of tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) based on observation of cytopathic effects. The virus load detected in infected tissue was not changed in comparison to the initial inoculum of 10
 <sup>5</sup> IU/mL. Similar results were obtained by PCR (data not shown). Each lung slice contained only one cross-sectioned airway with a diameter of about 500 μm. Accordingly, only one circular layer of airway epithelial cells lining this airway can be infected by RV. Consequently, as the total number of airway epithelial cells in lung tissue sections ex vivo is very low (compared to conventional cell culture infections), and not all airway epithelial cells get infected, the number of virions released from those cells is also low (data not shown). Thus, any additional increase of virus load based on active viral replication in these few cells was not detectable by TCID
 <sub>50</sub> or PCR beyond the initial virus amount present in supernatant of lung slices under these experimental conditions.
