<p id="Par32">PCLS isolated from non-sensitized mice showed a strong antiviral response to active viral infection, which resulted in enhanced secretion of IFN-α (0.4 vs. 112 pg/mg), IFN-β (31 vs. 779 pg/mg), IFN-γ (7 vs. 25 pg/mg), MCP-1 (73 vs. 313 ng/mg), TNF-α (2.5 vs. 3.2 ng/mg), and IP-10 (9 vs. 60 ng/mg) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This antiviral response was impaired under the experimental conditions in lung tissue of HDM-sensitized mice. Reduced levels of IFN-β (267 vs. 500 pg/mg), MCP-1 (28 vs. 87 ng/mg), TNF-α (1.2 vs. 2.1 ng/mg), and IP-10 (18 vs. 41 ng/mg) were observed. RV-induced release of IFN-α was comparable between PCLS of non-sensitized with 112 pg/mg and HDM-sensitized mice with 125 pg/mg.
