<p id="Par33">RV-infected PCLS were also treated with rupintrivir. The amount of virus measured by TCID
 <sub>50</sub> or PCR was not reduced by treatment with rupintrivir (data not shown). Rupintrivir showed no reduction of RV-induced cytokine release in PCLS of non-sensitized mice. Rupintrivir reduced IP-10, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 close to baseline levels in lung tissue of HDM-sensitized mice ex vivo, but had no effect on the interferon response (IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-γ). UV-inactivated RV did not trigger antiviral cytokine secretion (IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-γ) compared to uninfected medium control (Fig.
