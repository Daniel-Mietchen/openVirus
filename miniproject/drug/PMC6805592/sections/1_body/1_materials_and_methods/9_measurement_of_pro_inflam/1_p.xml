<p id="Par26">Mouse IFN-α, IFN-β, IL-6, MCP-1, and IP-10 were quantified using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (ELISA Duosets, R&amp;D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-17E/IL-25, IL-17F, IL-33, and TNF-α were measured using a mouse U-PLEX Biomarker Group 1 (ms) assay from Meso Scale Discovery (MSD; Gaithersburg, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and measured with a MSD Sector Imager 2400. Cytokine concentrations were calculated based on a 4-fold serially diluted standard. Data analysis was conducted using the Discovery Workbench software. The cytokine content of each sample was related to the total protein content (pg cytokine/mg total protein).</p>
