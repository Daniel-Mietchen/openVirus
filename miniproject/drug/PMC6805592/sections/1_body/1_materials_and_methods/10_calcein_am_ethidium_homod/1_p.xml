<p id="Par27">Viability of PCLS was assessed by Calcein AM/ethidium homodimer-1 staining as described before [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. From each PCLS, triplicates of 30 μm thick 3D stacks were analyzed using IMARIS 7.4.0 software (Bitplane Scientific Software, Zurich, Switzerland), as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The ratio of counted dead cell nuclei (ethidium homodimer-1 positive) to total volume of cytoplasm of living cells (calcein stained) was calculated as dead cell nuclei/10
 <sup>6</sup> μm
 <sup>3</sup> cytoplasm volume.
