<p>Discovery of novel small molecules that inhibit major IE gene expression can be accomplished using cell-based assays designed to target the early steps of HCMV replication including IE expression but also virus attachment, entry and capsid transport steps [

 <xref rid="B362-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">362</xref>]. One such assay utilizes an engineered variant of the HCMV laboratory strain AD169 that expresses IE2 with a C-terminal yellow fluorescent protein tag (AD169
 <sub>IE2-YFP</sub>) [
 <xref rid="B362-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">362</xref>]. IE2-YFP levels in the nucleus of infected cells are quantified using high-content confocal microscopy and hit inhibitory compounds identified via a decrease in nuclear fluorescent signal and therefore a decrease in IE2-YFP protein levels. This IE2-YFP cell-based reporter assay was used to screen a 2080 bioactive compound library and identified one lead compound, the cardiac glycoside convallatoxin. This compound exhibited potent anti-HCMV activity (EC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the low nanomolar range) without significant cellular cytotoxicity [

 <xref rid="B363-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">363</xref>]. However, it should be noted that convallatoxin has been discounted as a hit from a different screen due to toxicity [

 <xref rid="B367-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">367</xref>]. Inhibition of HCMV by cardiac glycosides is effective against clinical and GCV-resistant strains and exhibits additive activity when administered to cells in combination with GCV [

 <xref rid="B366-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">366</xref>]. Members of this compound family have been used clinically for the treatment of heart conditions such as congestive heart failure, although toxicity and dosage issues mean that they are increasingly replaced with synthetic drugs such as ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers [
 <xref rid="B368-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">368</xref>]. Clinical development as antiviral drugs has not yet been undertaken, but medicinal chemistry approaches have demonstrated the ability to improve antiviral activity and selectivity [
