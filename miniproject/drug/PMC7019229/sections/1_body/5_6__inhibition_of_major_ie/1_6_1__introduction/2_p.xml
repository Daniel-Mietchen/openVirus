<p>Small molecules that inhibit IE gene expression have been identified using a variety of strategic approaches; (i) exploitation of existing compounds that inhibit cell signalling pathways modulated by HCMV infection to facilitate MIEP activation and IE gene expression, (ii) targeted-screening of compound libraries composed of molecules that inhibit key cellular signalling components, e.g., kinase inhibitors, (iii) cell-based assays designed to discover novel molecules that target the early steps of HCMV replication and (iv) testing of compounds that have anecdotal evidence suggesting that they may have antiviral activity. Groups of related compounds have been identified using a combination of these approaches. Key groups of molecules are discussed below, although it should be noted that, in general, the small molecules that have thus far been identified have not had their mechanism of action fully elucidated. </p>
