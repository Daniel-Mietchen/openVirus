<p>Inhibition of major IE gene expression can be achieved by identification of small molecules that directly or indirectly inhibit activation of the MIEP and thus prevent IE gene transcription and translation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00110-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The complexity of MIEP regulation and its dependence on host cell signalling pathways and transcription machinery (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot1-viruses-12-00110">Section 2.1</xref>) means that numerous host factors are potential drug targets. Activation of key host cell signalling pathways is dependent on post-translational phosphorylation events mediated by kinases, and thus kinase inhibitors have been largely implicated in IE gene expression inhibition. Host “epigenetic” factors are also potential targets to lock down IE transcription and hence inhibit viral replication and reactivation from latency. In addition, viral proteins are known to be directly involved in IE gene expression or regulation of host cell signalling pathways exploited by HCMV to activate IE gene expression. However, compounds targeting these viral proteins are considered beyond the scope of this review, as they would contribute to their own specific drug classes.
