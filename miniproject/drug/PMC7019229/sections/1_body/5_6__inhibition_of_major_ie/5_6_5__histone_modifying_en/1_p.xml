<p>Major IE gene expression is also regulated by “epigenetic” modifications, including histone post-translational methylation, which can result in repressed gene expression [
 <xref rid="B358-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">358</xref>]. Histone demethylases are required to remove repressive “epigenetic” marks to promote IE gene expression and hence HCMV productive infection or reactivation from latency [
 <xref rid="B358-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">358</xref>]. Histone demethylase inhibitors (e.g., ML324, a JMJD2 demethylase family inhibitor) have been shown to potently inhibit HCMV IE gene expression [

 <xref rid="B360-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">360</xref>]. These demethylase inhibitors also repress IE gene expression from the related Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), and importantly they have been shown to potently inhibit HSV-1 infection and reactivation from latency [

 <xref rid="B360-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">360</xref>]. These results suggest that compounds that target histone demethylases and possibly other histone modifying or chromatin remodeling enzymes may have potential as HCMV inhibitors [
