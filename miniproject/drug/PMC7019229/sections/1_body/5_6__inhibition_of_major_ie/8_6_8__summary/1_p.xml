<p>Overall, a variety of approaches utilizing existing knowledge to repurpose known compounds or screening campaigns to discover novel compounds has successfully identified a wide variety of IE gene expression inhibitors. These inhibitors exploit host cell factors and signalling pathways utilized by HCMV to activate the MIEP and thus offer the hypothetical advantage of a reduced risk of drug resistance. A major challenge associated with the development of these compounds is the complexity in elucidating their relevant host cell targets and mechanism of action. Characterization of these compounds has been predominantly conducted in vitro. However, a few compounds have been progressed to in vivo testing using the MCMV model, and clinical testing of artesunate produced mixed clinical outcomes that warrant further investigation. Overall, compounds that inhibit HCMV IE gene expression merit future investigation and development as potential antivirals.</p>
