<p>This review provides an update on the regulation of HCMV major IE gene expression and IE1 and IE2 protein functions. We discussed existing clinically approved therapies and why major IE gene expression and IE1/2 protein functions are considered potential alternative targets for anti-HCMV strategies. We outlined the various molecular and chemical approaches that are being used to target major IE gene expression and protein function. Advances in molecular approaches, particularly genome-editing technology, are opening up new promising strategies for targeting HCMV. However, further research and development are required before this novel technology can be translated clinically. Key groups of small chemical inhibitors targeting major IE gene expression or IE1/2 protein function are highlighted in the review. A major challenge associated with the vast majority of these compounds is the complexity in elucidating their relevant targets, many of which are host cell proteins, and mechanism of action. Basic research to determine this knowledge will highlight the value of these compounds as chemical tools to further understand regulation of major IE gene expression and/or IE1/2 protein functions. It will also promote further in vivo and clinical testing of these molecules, which is currently limited to only a few studies and compounds. A key advantage of targeting major IE gene expression and IE1/2 function is the potential to inhibit reactivation from latency, a property that existing therapies, which target viral replication, do not achieve. However, testing key compounds for this attribute is mostly lacking due to the specialized methodology and limitations of in vitro cell-based latency models. Yet, the identification of compounds that repress latency is becoming more pressing as organ and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation has become more common. Existing anti-HCMV drugs are also not approved for use during pregnancy because of their teratogenic and embryotoxic effects in animal studies, yet the need for antiviral therapy in congenitally infected neonates for improved long-term outcomes is increasingly appreciated. Finally, IE1/2-directed drugs are not expected to confer cross-resistance to or interfere with the activity of existing drugs currently approved for HCMV monotherapy. They may therefore be combined with these drugs for combination therapies with improved efficacy. Overall, “bright and early” events in HCMV infection deserve more attention as a promising antiviral strategy against HCMV.</p>
