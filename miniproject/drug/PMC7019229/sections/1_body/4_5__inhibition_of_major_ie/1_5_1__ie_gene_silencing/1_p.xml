<p>Silencing IE gene expression is expected to exert significant pleiotropic antiviral effects due to the multi-functional roles played by IE gene products in HCMV replication, latency and pathogenicity (see

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-viruses-12-00110">Section 3</xref>). Molecular approaches can efficiently target IE gene expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00110-f002">Figure 2</xref>), and initial feasibility of this approach has been demonstrated via the antisense oligonucleotide Fomivirsen (also known as ISIS 2922 or Vitravene). Fomivirsen is a 21-base synthetic oligonucleotide complementary to IE2 mRNA sequence with phosphorothioate linkages to enhance nuclease resistance. It exhibits potent HCMV antiviral activity with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the sub-micromolar range [

 <xref rid="B296-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">296</xref>]. Fomivirsen’s mechanism of action is primarily thought to block IE2 gene expression by sequence-dependent hybridization to its target mRNA that results in reduced IE2 protein levels due to mRNA degradation via RNaseH recognition of the DNA:RNA hybrid complex [

 <xref rid="B297-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">297</xref>]. This is not, however, the sole mechanism of action, as other sequence-dependent and sequence-independent effects have been reported to contribute to its antiviral activity [

 <xref rid="B298-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">298</xref>]. Fomivirsen, developed by Isis Pharmaceuticals in collaboration with Novartis Opthalmics, was in 1998 the first oligonucleotide-based therapy to be approved for clinical use by the FDA [
 <xref rid="B299-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">299</xref>]. It was approved for treatment of HCMV-induced retinitis in HIV/AIDS patients via local intravitreous injection, and its clinical effectiveness was demonstrated in small-scale clinical trials [

 <xref rid="B302-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">302</xref>]. Fomivirsen is no longer marketed, due to a significant decline in HCMV-induced retinitis cases in HIV/AIDS patients following the successful implementation of antiretroviral therapy and the availability of alternative treatments [
 <xref rid="B299-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">299</xref>]. Despite its discontinuation for commercial reasons, Fomivirsen’s development has provided convincing proof-of-concept evidence that inhibition of IE gene expression can be an effective HCMV antiviral therapeutic strategy.
