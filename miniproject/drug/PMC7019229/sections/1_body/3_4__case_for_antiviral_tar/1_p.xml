<p>Antiviral strategies for HCMV have long relied on a single molecular target, the viral DNA polymerase. Even more recently approved antivirals and candidate drugs under development are directed at viral targets involved in late molecular processes of HCMV replication including DNA packaging. At this late stage, infection is fully established and adverse immune-related effects including inflammation have been triggered. In fact, immunopathogenic rather than cytopathogenic origins have been proposed for some HCMV disease including pneumonitis in allogeneic transplant recipients [

 <xref rid="B277-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">277</xref>]. Similarly, in mouse models of pneumonitis MCMV replication was not sufficient to cause disease [

 <xref rid="B223-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>]. The chemokines produced upon IE1 expression included C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) ligands CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11, which have been implicated in a large variety of inflammatory and other immune-related disorders including transplant dysfunction or rejection [
