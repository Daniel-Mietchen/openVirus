<p>We consider the major IE gene and proteins promising alternative or complementing targets for anti-HCMV strategies for various reasons. Targeting the expression or function of IE1/2 would interfere with infection at a “bright and early” stage before all other currently approved systemic drugs. MIEP- or IE1/2-targeted drugs are predicted to prevent or dampen inflammation even before viral replication commences. Since IE1/2 are also powerful antagonists of intrinsic immunity and the IFN response, compounds targeting their expression or function are expected to confer susceptibility to these host responses providing a novel mechanism of action. In addition, the IE1/2-targeted drugs exhibit potential for “epigenetic therapy” as both viral proteins exert their functions in part via histone modifications, again providing a novel mechanism of action. These drugs are expected to interfere not only with an ongoing productive infection but also with early stages of reactivation, since both the MIEP and IE1/2 function are likely required for this process. Conceivably, even viral persistence may be inhibited based on the observation that IE1x4 mediates viral genome replication and maintenance during latency. Finally, IE1/2-directed drugs are not expected to confer cross-resistance to or interfere with the activity of existing compounds approved for HCMV monotherapy. They may therefore be combined with these drugs for combination therapies with improved efficacy.</p>
