<p>Due to the medical importance of HCMV, the absence of effective ways to prevent infection and the shortcomings of existing therapeutic drugs, it is imperative to develop novel antiviral strategies involving new molecular targets and mechanisms of action. All approved drugs currently available to prevent or treat HCMV disease target viral enzymes expressed in the early phase and critical for late processes in the infection cycle. In contrast, molecular events before the onset of HCMV DNA replication have been largely neglected with respect to antiviral approaches. This review will outline our current understanding of the regulation at the HCMV major IE gene and the functional characteristics of IE proteins derived from this gene. We will further highlight past, present and future antiviral strategies aimed at IE gene expression and protein function for improved intervention with HCMV infection and disease.</p>
