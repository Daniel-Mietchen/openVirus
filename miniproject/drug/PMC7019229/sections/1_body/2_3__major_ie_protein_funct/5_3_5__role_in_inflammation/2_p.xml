<p>Adaptive antibody as well T cell responses are thought to be important for long-term control of HCMV. Studies on T cell immunity in HCMV have traditionally focused on pUL83/pp65 and IE1. However, it has become clear that both IE1 and IE2 are highly immunogenic CD4+ and CD8+ T cell antigens adding to their complex roles in the immune response to HCMV infection [
