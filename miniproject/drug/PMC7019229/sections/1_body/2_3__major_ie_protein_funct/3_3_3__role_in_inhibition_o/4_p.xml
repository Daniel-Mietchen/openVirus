<p>Finally, both IE1 and IE2 inhibit apoptotic cell death, which may be considered part of the intrinsic antiviral defence system [

 <xref rid="B258-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">258</xref>]. It appears that each IE protein can block extrinsic apoptosis pathways via activation of PI3K/AKT signalling, although additional mechanisms likely contribute including complex formation between IE2 and p53 [

 <xref rid="B261-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">261</xref>]. Despite the fact that the antiapoptotic potential of the two IE proteins has been clearly established in several overexpression settings, its true relevance to HCMV infection remains to be determined.
