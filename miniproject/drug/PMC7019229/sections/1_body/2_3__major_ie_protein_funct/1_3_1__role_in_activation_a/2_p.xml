<p>Many key findings from transient transfection assays about the impact of IE1 and IE2 on HCMV transcription were later corroborated by studies involving mutant viruses and global transcriptome analyses. These findings confirmed positive autoregulation at the MIEP by IE1 [
 <xref rid="B217-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">217</xref>], crs-dependent repression of the MIEP by IE2 and activation of viral early genes by IE1 and IE2 [

 <xref rid="B221-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">221</xref>]. In contrast, “promiscuous transactivation” by IE1 and IE2 was not replicated in transcriptome analyses of endogenous human genes. Instead of showing broad activation of gene expression from the human genome, the differential transcript profiles from cells individually expressing IE1 or IE2 were rather distinct with little or no overlap to the genes activated by the IE proteins in assays with transfected reporter plasmids. Following expression under conditions closely mimicking the situation during productive infection, IE1 turned out to be as significant a repressor as it is an activator of host gene expression in growth-arrested human fibroblasts [

 <xref rid="B223-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>]. Cells induced to express IE1 exhibited global repression of interleukin 6 (IL6)- and oncostatin M-responsive signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 target genes. This repression was followed by STAT1-dependent activation of type II IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), normally induced by IFN-γ, many of which encode immune-stimulatory proteins including proinflammatory chemokines [

 <xref rid="B224-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">224</xref>]. Moreover, in the presence of IFN-α or IFN-β, IE1 was found to inhibit the induction of type I ISGs by the trimeric complex of STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9 known as ISG factor 3 (ISGF3) [
 <xref rid="B225-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>,
 <xref rid="B226-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">226</xref>]. The effects IE1 exerts on the human transcriptome are thought to result largely from direct physical interactions with STAT2 and STAT3 (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot4-viruses-12-00110">Section 3.4</xref>). While transcriptional regulation by IE1 appears to be dominated by pathways depending on proteins of the STAT family, IE2 has been shown to inhibit the induction of IFN and other antiviral cytokine genes via a mechanism involving NF-kB and STING (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot4-viruses-12-00110">Section 3.4</xref>). However, the transcriptome profile for IE2 in cycling human fibroblasts was dominated by genes regulating the cell cycle and DNA replication many of which are E2F-responsive [
 <xref rid="B227-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>]. This finding likely reflects the impact of IE2 on the cell cycle. IE2 promotes cell cycle progression from G0/G1 to G1/S and arrests cells at the G1/S interface, inhibiting cellular DNA synthesis, or at the G2/M interface [

 <xref rid="B228-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>]. Many human genes activated or repressed by isolated expression of IE1 or IE2 were also shown to be differentially regulated during productive HCMV infection.
