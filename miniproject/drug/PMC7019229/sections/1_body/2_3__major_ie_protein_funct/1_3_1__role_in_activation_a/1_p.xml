<p>IE1 and IE2 were initially identified as activators of transcription in reporter assays using transiently transfected plasmids [

 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In these assays, the IE proteins were shown to activate the HCMV MIEP (positive auto-regulation) and various viral early gene promoters. In addition, IE2 turned out to be a repressor of the MIEP (negative auto-regulation). In fact, IE2 sequence-specifically binds to the crs in the core promoter (

Furthermore, several heterologous viral promoters as well as cellular promoters proved to be responsive to activation by the IE proteins. The impact of IE1 and IE2 on transcription from a broad variety of promoters in transient transfection assays earned them the title “promiscuous transactivators”. IE2 usually appeared as the stronger activator compared to IE1 and, depending on the reporter construct, the two proteins often acted in an additive or synergistic manner. Activation by IE1 and IE2 was mapped to both upstream elements as well as core promoter regions including the TATA-box. Accordingly, numerous specific and basic transcription factors or transcription factor complexes were reported to interact with IE1 (e.g., CEBP, E2F1-5, SP1) and IE2 (e.g., AP1, CREB1, EGR1, SP1, TAF4, TBP, TFIIB, TFIID).
