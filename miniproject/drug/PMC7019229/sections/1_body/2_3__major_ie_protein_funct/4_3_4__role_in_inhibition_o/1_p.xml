<p>Post-attachment events associated with HCMV entry and the recognition of virion components by pattern recognition receptors including foreign DNA sensors trigger the induction of cytokine and chemokine genes [

 <xref rid="B264-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">264</xref>]. Many of these cytokines and chemokines are important components of our innate immune system, especially type I, II and III IFNs. The synthesis and secretion of these IFNs activates signalling pathways that involve the phosphorylation of STAT family members including STAT1 and STAT2. Activated STAT proteins form homodimers or heteromeric complexes that subsequently bind to and stimulate transcription from promoters of ISGs many of which encode proteins that interfere with viral replication at various points.
