<p>While robust expression of the major IE gene is crucial for productive HCMV infection, the absence or low levels of IE proteins are linked to the establishment of latent infection. HCMV establishes latency in a subset of typically poorly differentiated susceptible cells including cells of the myeloid lineage. The MIEP is largely repressed in these cell types, although low levels of IE1 (and even IE2) may still be produced. A study led by the late Greg Pari proposed that a variant form of IE1 referred to as IE1x4 rather than the full-length protein is expressed in latently HCMV-infected haematopoietic progenitor cells [

Their results suggest that IE1x4 is required for latent viral genome replication and maintenance involving interactions with the cellular transcription factor SP1 and topoisomerase IIÎ². This report is in line with the idea that the IE1 CTD binds to mitotic chromosomes via the acidic patch formed by histones H2A-H2B on the nucleosome core particle (see
