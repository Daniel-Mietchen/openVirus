<p>Although it is generally assumed that IE1 and IE2 are required for HCMV reactivation from latency, there is little experimental evidence to confirm this notion. In a promonocytic cell-line, ectopic expression of IE1 and IE2 was sufficient for induction of viral early gene expression but not for production of infectious virus [

 <xref rid="B291-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">291</xref>,
 <xref rid="B292-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">292</xref>,
 <xref rid="B293-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">293</xref>]. Thus, while IE2 is almost certainly necessary for HCMV reactivation (being essential for viral replication) the importance of IE1 in this process remains ambiguous.
