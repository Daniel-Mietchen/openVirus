<p>IE1 and IE2 are nuclear localized HCMV proteins expressed at the beginning of infection. They autoregulate the MIEP, activate viral early genes and modulate expression of cellular genes many of which are involved in the cytokine and chemokine response to infection. Regulation of viral gene expression by the IE proteins appears to result in part from chromatin-based mechanisms including histone modification, and at least IE2 shares properties with factors that actively control transcription. In addition, IE1 and IE2 regulate transcription more passively by targeting signalling effectors upstream of the genome such as STAT2/3 and STING, respectively. Both IE proteins are powerful antagonists of intrinsic and innate immunity predicted to be individually essential for HCMV replication in vivo. That said, IE1 and IE2 may contribute to HCMV pathogenesis even in the absence of viral replication.</p>
