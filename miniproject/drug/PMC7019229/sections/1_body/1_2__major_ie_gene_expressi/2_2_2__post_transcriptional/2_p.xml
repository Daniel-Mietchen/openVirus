<p>Translation of the IE1 and IE2 mRNAs is subject to control by viral non-coding RNAs [

 <xref rid="B191-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. For example, the HCMV long non-coding RNA 4.9 has been reported to bind to the MIEP and recruit repressor complex PRC2 to this region [

 <xref rid="B193-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>,
 <xref rid="B194-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>]. Likewise, HCMV miR-UL25-1 and miR-UL25-2 appear to be linked to reduced IE1 protein levels, although most likely indirectly via cellular targets [
