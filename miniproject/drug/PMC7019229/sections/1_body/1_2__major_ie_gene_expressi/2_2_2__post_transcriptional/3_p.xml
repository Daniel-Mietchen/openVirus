<p>The major IE mRNAs ultimately give rise to the IE1 (UL123) and IE2 (UL122) families of proteins with several members each. The largest, most abundant and by far best studied family members are the 72-kDa (491 amino acids) IE1 protein, also known as IE72, and the 86-kDa (579 amino acids) IE2 protein, also known as IE86. The two proteins share 85 amino acids encoded by exon 3 at their amino termini but are otherwise unrelated. For simplicity, they are referred to as IE1 and IE2 in this review.</p>
