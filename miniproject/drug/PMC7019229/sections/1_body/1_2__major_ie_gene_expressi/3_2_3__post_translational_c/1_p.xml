 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot2-viruses-12-00110">Section 2.2</xref>), the differences in metabolic stability contribute to the much higher steady-state levels of IE1 compared to IE2 observed during productive HCMV infection. Nuclear localization signals in IE1 and IE2 target the proteins to the cell nucleus, where they are found in various compartments including PML bodies, chromatin and the nucleoplasm [
