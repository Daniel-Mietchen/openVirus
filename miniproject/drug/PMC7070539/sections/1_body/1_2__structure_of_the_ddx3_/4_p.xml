<p>Several laboratories have intensively studied the substrate specificity of DDX3 ATPase/helicase for developing DDX3 inhibitors displaying antiviral/anticancer activities. In general, DDX3 helicase reveals biochemical features that are typical for RNA helicases, but this class of helicases has some specific functioning futures compared to processed helicases. In contrast to processed helicase, DDX3 helicase binds directly to oligonucleotide duplexes as an oligomer of two to three DDX3 molecules without translocation, and can completely separate short RNA-RNA or RNA-DNA duplexes using a single ATP molecule without its hydrolysis [
