<p>The DDX3 core consists of two RecA-like domains (

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Motifs Q, I, II, III, and VI are very important for both helicase and ATPase activities. The Q motif recognizes the adenine moiety of NTP, while motifs I and II bind the triphosphate moiety directly or through a Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> ion, which was shown using a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue, namely AMPPNP. As a result, ATP hydrolysis is performed by motif II. Motif V interacts with both the RNA and ATP. Motif III is associated with helicase activity. Motif V, together with Ia, Ib, and IV, is involved in RNA-binding and probably in helicase activity. Motif VI is responsible for the protein interaction with RNA during unwinding and ATP hydrolysis [

It is noteworthy that according to the crystal structure, interaction of the enzyme with single-stranded RNA leads to the formation of a closed form of the protein, thus promoting the formation of functional sites. The crystal structure of the DDX3 core model was extensively used to perform a virtual screening approach of different chemical compounds as potential inhibitors of the ATPase or helicase activities of DDX3 [
