<p>The general domain structure of the DEAD-box family presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01015-f001">Figure 1</xref> is based on the study of crystal structures of the human DDX3 core [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and its ortholog Drosophila Vasa [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], including their complexes with dsRNA, ADP, and a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue. It was shown that the structure of the cores was typical for other members of the DEAD-box family, whereas the differences are mainly localized in the tail fragments [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It should be noted that the crystal structures of full-length DEAD-box helicases have not been solved yet.
