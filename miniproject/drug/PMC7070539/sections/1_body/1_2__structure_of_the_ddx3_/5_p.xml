<p>This conclusion is strongly supported by the finding that the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog ADP-beryllium fluoride (ADP-BeF) can promote unwinding the short oligonucleotide duplex, although other non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs, ADP-aluminum fluoride (ADP-AlF4) and ADP-iminophosphate (ADPNHP), with structures similar to ATP do not provide RNA-RNA complex separation [

 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Probably, minor differences in the structures of these compounds do not allow strand separation. As supposed, ATP hydrolysis is required for dissociation and recycling the DDX3 helicase, but not for the unwinding process (

 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Substitution of the N7 nitrogen with carbon or the removal of the N6 amino group in the ATP molecule abrogates unwinding activity. These observations indicate the significance of the positions in nuclear bases for DDX3 functioning. There are some inconsistent data about substrate specificity of the DDX3 helicase. One series of publications showed that human DDX3 ATPase has wide substrate specificity and besides ATP, binds other rNTP, dNTP, as well as their L-stereomers [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It was also reported that ATPase activity is equally stimulated by the addition of DNA or RNA oligonucleotides. However, later publication presented the data that only ATP, but not dNTP or their analogs, are substrates of the DDX3 helicase. Moreover, ATPase activity is stimulated by DNA to a markedly lower level than that by RNA, and no significant ATPase activity in the absence of nucleic acid [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. A virtual analysis of the interaction of the nuclear base and ribose residue of NTP with DDX3 crystal structure did not show any possibility of the relaxed substrate specificity [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The primer position in the double-strand RNA-RNA duplex is also important for the DDX helicase activity in vitro [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The enzyme shows a greater preference for the 3′-unpaired region of the duplex compared to those with 5’-unpaired regions and the inability to separate DNA-DNA complete duplexes. Fully double-stranded complexes DNA-RNA but not DNA-DNA can be separated, but much slower.
