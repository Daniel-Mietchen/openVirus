<p>Several compounds among rodanine and triazine derivatives were discovered as inhibitors of ATPase activity of DDX3 at low micromolar concentration in vitro, but their anti-HIV activities in cell cultures were one order of magnitude higher compared with the cell-free system. Moreover, the compounds displayed rather high cytotoxicity [
