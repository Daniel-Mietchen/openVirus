<p>DDX3 is considered a potential new chemotherapeutic target for the treatment of viral infections and different types of cancer. There are about 50 human DEAD-box helicases involved in a variety of cellular and viral metabolic processes. In spite of the fact that interfering in cellular integrity poses a risk of toxic effects, some effective chemical inhibitors of DDX3 enzymatic activity have been developed, which suppress viral replication in cell cultures and display anticancer activity against a number of cancer types without significant toxicity. One of the inhibitors of DDX3, ATPase RK-33, was recommended for the preclinical stage against lung cancer. Moreover, RK33 increases radiosensitivity, which allows a reduction in the dose of radiation for cancer treatment. Little is currently known about the mechanisms for suppressing viral infections and regression of tumors with DDX helicase inhibitors. Sometimes published data are contradictory, which is probably due to different testing systems. To design new effective DDX inhibitors much work remains to be done to unveil the mechanism of suppression of virus replication and tumor repression. However, the results obtained allow us to hope that the chosen direction is correct and in the future will give new effective therapeutic drugs.</p>
