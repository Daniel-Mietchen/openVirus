<p>Cellular proteins and cofactors have attracted much attention as new targets for the development of antiviral/anticancer drugs. Viruses are intracellular parasites that use host metabolic machinery for their replication and emission of infection [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. More than 300 cellular proteins and co-factors participate in virus replication [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], but the most drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of viral infections include drugs targeting viral enzymes. In the case of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the main targets are the reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase, whereas only one drug (enfuvirtide, T-20, Fuseon) that blocks the cellular process of HIV fusion was approved for the treatment of HIV-infected people. For the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients, inhibitors of HCV NS3/4A protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B, and the nonstructural protein NS5A are used in clinics. The main problem with such an approach is the rapid development of viral resistance and escape of some genotypes/isolates from the action of the drugs. The use of host cell factors as targets for drug development can help to overcome the problem of viral resistance, since cellular proteins are much more conserved, and mutations in these proteins may alter cell viability [

 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The human DDX3 helicase, first identified in 1997 [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], is now considered as an attractive target for the development of novel pharmaceutical drugs [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The DDX3 helicase belongs to the large DEAD-box (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) family of ATP-dependent RNA helicases. The enzyme is a multifunctional protein implicated in all aspects of RNA metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and viral infection. The DDX3 helicase is involved in the replication of viruses belonging to different families: HCV [

 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], Japanese encephalitis virus [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and West Nile virus of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], HIV [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] of the 
 <italic>Retroviridae</italic>, hepatitis B virus (HBV) [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] of 
 <italic>Hepadnaviridae</italic>, Vaccinia virus of 
 <italic>Poxviridae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], Norovirus of 
 <italic>Caliciviridae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], influenza A virus of Orthomyxoviridae families [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and several others. Knockdown of DDX3 blocks the replication of several types of viruses without essential toxic effects (for example, see [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). DEAD-box helicases also attract a lot of attention as a target for the development of anticancer drugs, due to their role as oncogene in different types of tumors [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These data stimulated the synthesis of DDX3 inhibitors as antiviral/anticancer drugs. In order to design DDX3 selective inhibitors, a detailed knowledge of the substrate specificity of the enzyme, crystal structure, biochemical, and enzymatic properties of DDX3 is very essential.
