<p>Interestingly, HBV is not the only virus whose virions contain DDX3. Another example is herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) [

 <xref rid="B101-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], presumably by affecting the expression of viral genes and regulating virion assembly [
 <xref rid="B102-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. This could be a feature of various herpes viruses, as similar data point to DDX3 as a proviral gene for the replication of human cytomegalovirus, which also belongs to the 
 <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> family [
 <xref rid="B103-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. However, the mechanisms of their participation do not involve the regulation of interferon production and concomitant signaling, whereas in HCMV-infected cells it does enhance the production of IFNÎ² [
