<p>In contrast to the proviral effect of DDX towards HIV and HCV, DDX3 restricts HBV replication [
 <xref rid="B97-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. There is very little information on the mechanism for suppressing HBV genome replication by the DDX3 helicase. The first suggestion assumed that DDX3 inhibits virus replication by interacting with HBV DNA polymerase after DDX3 encapsulation, thus preventing the transcription stage [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, later, it was shown that the level of virus was independent of the interaction of HBV polymerase with DDX3 [
 <xref rid="B97-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. The second hypothesis assumed that DDX3 helicase competes with HBV DNA polymerase for the interaction with transcription factor TBK1/IKK(epsilon) blocking the interferon induction [
 <xref rid="B98-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. DDX3 overexpression could prevent the inhibitory effect of HBV replication. This assumption is consistent with the stimulation of the immune system by the over expression of DDX3 helicase [
