<p>Finally, DDX3 may be a cellular factor that also promotes the development of virus-associated pathologies. As discussed above, the HCV core via DDX3 promotes the formation of lipid droplets [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], thus contributing to the development of liver steatosis, one of the common liver diseases in chronic hepatitis C patients. An additional link between HCV-induced changes in lipid homeostasis and DDX3 is provided by the downregulation of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), achieved via HCV-induced suppression of DDX3 expression [

The expression of cytokines is controlled by the NFkB factor, whereas their subsequent maturation by the NLRP3 inflammasomes. DDX3 interacts with NFkB and suppresses its activity [

 <xref rid="B114-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Indeed, in the case of HIV, DDX3 also promotes Tat-associated neurotoxicity, and since it is one of the best studied inhibitors, the compound RK-33 suppresses the production of proinflammatory cytokines induced by Tat [
