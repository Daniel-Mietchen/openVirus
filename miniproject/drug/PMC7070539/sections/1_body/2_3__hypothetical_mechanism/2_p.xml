<p>Enhanced transport of RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by the DDX3 helicase can be partly explained by unfolding of the HIV RNA secondary structure by the DDX3 helicase or shaking off associated with RNA proteins. DDX3 is also involved in HIV replication at the level of translation [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], and export from nucleus precedes the activation of translation through the loading of 43S preinitiation complex on 5â€²-UTR [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and probably by overall promotion of 80S ribosome assembly [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Moreover, this hypothesis is based on the specific association of DDX3 with HIV translation factor Tat, which facilitates Tat-dependent translation of viral genes [
