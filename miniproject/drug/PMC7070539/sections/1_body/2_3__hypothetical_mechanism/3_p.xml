<p>In contrast to DDX3 functions facilitating viral mRNA transport and translation, DDX3 participates in the anti-viral innate immune signaling pathway, leading to type I IFN induction after phosphorylation by TBK1/IKKε and translocation into the nucleus, leading to the activation of the IFNβ promoter [
