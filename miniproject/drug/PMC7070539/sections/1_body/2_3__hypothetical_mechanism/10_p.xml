<p>In the case of the influenza A virus (IAV), DDX3 acts as an antiviral factor [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It interacts with NS1 and NP proteins [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. DDX3 is also recruited to viral replicase [
 <xref rid="B105-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>], presumably by interaction with PB1-F2 (a subunit of viral replicase) [
 <xref rid="B106-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. In the case of the latter, such interaction is significantly enhanced in the case of a highly pathogenic 1918 strain, and results in a co-degradation of both DDX3 and viral protein [
 <xref rid="B106-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. So, it could be one of the factors of an extremely high pathogenicity of this viral strain. Another factor is an NS1- and NP-induced DDX3-mediated formation of SGs [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The third one could be a DDX3-mediated induction of IFNβ through stimulator of interferon genes (STING) [
 <xref rid="B107-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]—another cytoplasmic sensor of viral nucleic acids. However, contrary data also exist. Diot et al. considered DDX3 as a proviral factor [
 <xref rid="B108-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. In this study, DEAD-box helicases were regarded as factors that promoted export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of influenza A virus mRNA. Replication of IAV was significantly impaired upon the silencing of 14 of 35 studied DEAD-box proteins, with DDX19 helicase being the most effective in reducing infectious IAV [
