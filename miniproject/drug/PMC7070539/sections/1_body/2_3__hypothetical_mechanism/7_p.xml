<p>Similar events occur for other members of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family and for Picornaviruses. DDX3 interacts with UTRs of the Japanese Encephalitis virus and with its NS3 and NS5A proteins also to promote late stages of the viral life cycle [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The West Nile virus sequesters DDX3 from P-bodies to sites of viral replication, thus affecting the functioning of these organelles but promoting its own replication [
 <xref rid="B96-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. So, the mechanisms by which DDX3 promotes the replication of HCV could probably be expanded to these viruses as well.
