<p>An alternative mechanism by which DDX3 facilitates HCV replication could be an alteration of lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis and homeostasis [

 <xref rid="B74-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Lipid droplets are the ER-derived organelles on which several viral proteins, including HCV core, are localized. Moreover, the initial step of virion assembly, namely HCV encapsulation into nucleocapsids, occurs at the LD-ER interphase, and HCV core and NS5A control this process [

 <xref rid="B76-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. LD biogenesis is induced by the interaction of DDX3 with 5′-UTR of the HCV RNA, which leads to relocalization of IKKα and concomitant SREBP activation [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. HCV core also triggers relocalization of DDX3 to LDs, although direct core-DDX3 interaction is not required for virus replication or virion production [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that DDX3 could also affect the initiation of replication or nucleocapsid formation via affecting NS5A, whose phosphorylation affects the interaction of viral RNA with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] or HCV core [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. DDX3 is also a regulator of casein kinase 1ε [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], one of the kinases that drives NS5A hyperphosphorylation [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Hyperphosphorylation of the NS5A protein is considered one of the factors that promotes transition from replication to virion assembly [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. However, DDX3 silencing does not affect the ratio between the hyperphosphorylated (p58) and basally-phosphorylated (p56) forms of the protein [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], so this interaction probably does not affect replication of the virus.
