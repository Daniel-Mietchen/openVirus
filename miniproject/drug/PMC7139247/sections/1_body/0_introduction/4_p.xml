<p id="para0009">To date, COVID-19 has spread rapidly in 72 countries, causing &gt;90 000 confirmed cases and over 2946 deaths as of 3 March 2020. Considering the global threat, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). However, there are no vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 or specific therapeutic drugs for this communicable disease.
