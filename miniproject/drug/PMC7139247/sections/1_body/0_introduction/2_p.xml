<p id="para0007">Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae, Order Nidovirales. There are four genera within the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, namely Alphacoronavirus (α-CoV), Betacoronavirus (β-CoV), Gammacoronavirus (γ-CoV) and Deltacoronavirus (δ-CoV)

The CoV genome is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA with a size varying between 26 kb and 32 kb, the largest genome of known RNA viruses. Both α- and β-CoV genera are known to infect mammals, whilst δ- and γ-CoVs infect birds. Two recent outbreaks of viral pneumonia caused by β-CoVs are severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In 2002, an outbreak of SARS was first reported in China and then spread quickly worldwide, resulting in hundreds of deaths with an 11% mortality rate
