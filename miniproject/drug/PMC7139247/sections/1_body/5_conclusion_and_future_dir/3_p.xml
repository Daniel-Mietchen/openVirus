<p id="para0040">We have been warned three times in recent years. CoVs are highly vulnerable to public-health intervention strategies, but the increasing incidence of CoV emergence in livestock animal populations and the identification of novel CoVs in reservoir species do not support this view. Therefore, in addition to developing new drugs and clinical trials of old drugs, the design and development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 is also needed. Lessons from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV suggest that SARS-CoV-2 research should focus on the establishment of animal models that recapitulate the various aspects of human disease and determinants of vaccine safety and efficacy.</p>
