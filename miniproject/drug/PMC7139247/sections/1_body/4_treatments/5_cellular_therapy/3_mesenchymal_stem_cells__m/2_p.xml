<p id="para0035">It is well known that MSCs have strong anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions. Umbilical cord blood and placenta are good sources of MSCs. Numerous studies have shown that treatment with MSCs can ameliorate acute/chronic lung injury and ARDS by suppressing the infiltration of immune cells to pulmonary tissues and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion

Besides routine antiviral treatment, it is important to treat cytokine storm syndromes, ARDS and acute lung injury in patients with severe COVID-19 to prevent progression of the disease and to reduce mortality. Thus, MSCs may be a promising therapeutic option.
