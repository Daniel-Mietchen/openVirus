<p id="para0028">Lopinavir/ritonavir was first known as a protease inhibitor that interferes with the replication and synthesis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), leading to the production of immature, non-infectious virus particles 
 <xref rid="bib0068" ref-type="bibr">[68</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0069" ref-type="bibr">69]</xref>. It has been reported that ritonavir and lopinavir can bind to the endopeptidase C30 of SARS-CoV-2 protease as evaluated by molecular models 
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. This suggests that lopinavir/ritonavir may exert an antiviral effect by inhibiting protein synthesis of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, several lines of evidence showed that treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir alone or in combination with other antiviral drugs was shown to improve the outcome of severe patients with SARS or MERS by ameliorating ARDS

 <xref rid="bib0072" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0073" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. Given that SARS-CoV-2 is similar to these two viruses, lopinavir/ritonavir may have a beneficial effect on COVID-19. Future studies are needed to test this possibility.
