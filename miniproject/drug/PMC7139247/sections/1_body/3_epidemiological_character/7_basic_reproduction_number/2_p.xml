<p id="para0019">The basic reproduction number is a very important threshold related to the transmissibility of the virus, which is usually expressed as R nought (R
 <sub>0</sub>). The R
 <sub>0</sub> can be implicitly defined as the average number of secondary infections produced by an infectious person. It is generally believed that if R
 <sub>0</sub> is &gt;1, the number of infected cases will increase exponentially and cause an epidemic or even a pandemic. Liu et al. reviewed the R
 <sub>0</sub> of SARS-CoV-2 and found that the estimates ranged from 1.4â€“6.49, with a mean of 3.28

 <sub>0</sub> of 2~5).
