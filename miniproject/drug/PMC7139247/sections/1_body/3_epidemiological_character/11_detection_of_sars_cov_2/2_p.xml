<p id="para0023">Rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to control the outbreak of COVID-19. Nucleic acid detection is a major method of laboratory diagnosis. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is a molecular biological diagnosis technology based on nucleic acid sequences. The complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences are available in GenBank. Thus, the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 can be detected by RT-qPCR or by viral gene sequencing of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, stool, sputum or blood samples

However, collection of these specimen types by healthcare workers requires close contact with patients, which poses a risk of spreading the virus to healthcare workers. Moreover, collection of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens may cause bleeding, especially in patients with thrombocytopenia
