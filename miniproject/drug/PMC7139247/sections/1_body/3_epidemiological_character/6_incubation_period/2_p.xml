 <xref rid="bib0046" ref-type="bibr">[46</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0047" ref-type="bibr">47]</xref>, indicating a long transmission period of SARS-CoV-2. It is estimated that SARS-CoV-2 latency is consistent with those of other known human CoVs, including non-SARS human CoVs (mean 3 days, range 2–5 days)

 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Moreover, it has been reported that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients during their incubation periods can effectively transmit SARS-CoV-2

 <xref rid="bib0052" ref-type="bibr">52]</xref>, which is different from SARS-CoV because most SARS-CoV cases are infected by ‘superspreaders’ and SARS-CoV cases cannot infect susceptible persons during the incubation period 
 <xref rid="bib0053" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Taken together, these data fully support the current period of active monitoring recommended by the WHO of 14 days.
