<p id="para0015">The initial source of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown, although the first cases were linked to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan city. Besides seafood, it is reported on social media that some wild animals including birds, snakes, marmots and bats were sold at the Huanan seafood market. It has been reported that environmental samples obtained from the marketplace have come back positive for the novel CoV, but the specific animal has not been identified 
 <xref rid="bib0033" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. More recently, several studies have suggested that bats may be the potential natural host of SARS-CoV-2

 <xref rid="bib0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">35]</xref>. The whole genome-wide nucleotide sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is 96% identical to a bat CoV 
 <xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from pangolins and it was found that the isolated pangolin CoV genomes have ~85.5â€“92.4% similarity to SARS-CoV-2 
 <xref rid="bib0036" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, suggesting that pangolin may be a potential intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted directly from bats or by an intermediate host requires further confirmation. Learning from the role of camels in MERS and civets in SARS, hunting for the source of SARS-CoV-2 will help determine zoonotic transmission patterns and stem the ongoing outbreak.
