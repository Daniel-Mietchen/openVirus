<p id="para0010">The SARS-CoV-2 genome (30 kb in size) encodes a large, non-structural polyprotein (ORF1a/b) that is further proteolytically cleaved to generate 15/16 proteins, 4 structural proteins and 5 accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7, ORF8 and ORF9)

 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> (
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). The four structural proteins consist of the spike (S) surface glycoprotein, the membrane (M) protein, the envelope (E) protein and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which are essential for SARS-CoV-2 assembly and infection. The spike surface glycoprotein plays a key role in its attachment to host cells and can be further cleaved by host proteases into an N-terminal S1 subunit and a membrane-bound C-terminal S2 region 
 <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Binding of the S1 subunit to a host receptor can destabilise the prefusion trimer, leading to shedding of the S1 subunit and transition of the S2 subunit into a highly stable postfusion conformation 
 <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In order to engage a host receptor, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit undergoes hinge-like conformational movements, which transiently hide or expose the determinants of receptor binding 
 <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[19</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">20]</xref>. These two states of the S1 subunit can be regarded as the ‘down’ conformation and the ‘up’ conformation. The former represents an inaccessible state of the receptor, whereas the latter corresponds to an accessible state 
 <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[19</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">21]</xref>. Therefore, understanding the structure and function of the spike protein can help to develop monoclonal antibody drugs and to guide the design and development of vaccines.
