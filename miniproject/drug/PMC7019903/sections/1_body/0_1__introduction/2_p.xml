<p>Orthohantaviruses are members of the Hantaviridae family, order Bunyavirales. Their tripartite, single-stranded, negative sense RNA genome codes for four proteins. The L segment, S segment, and M segment encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a nucleocapsid protein (N protein) and Gn and Gc glycoproteins, respectively. The two surface glycoproteins, before being exposed on the viral surface, are post-translationally processed via the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. These proteins interact with integrin receptors allowing viruses to enter new host cells [
