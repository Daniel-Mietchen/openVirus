<p>In recent years, our research group has published several 1(2)H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole, usually called benzotriazole, derivatives that have shown marked antiviral activity against many viruses [

 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00122" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00122" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The versatile biological behavior of benzotriazole and its derivatives have recently been described in an in-depth review [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00122" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Among these benzotriazole derivatives, the 5,6-dichloro1(2)phenyl-benzotriazole scaffold turned out to be endowed with high activity against several different viruses.
