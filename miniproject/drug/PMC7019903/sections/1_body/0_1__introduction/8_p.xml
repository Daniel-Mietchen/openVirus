<p>In general terms, these molecules showed little or no activity except for HTNV. Series 2 derivatives (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00122-f001">Figure 1</xref>) showed most interesting EC
 <sub>50</sub> values, so we performed the same broad antiviral screening on a series of 2-phenyl-benzotriazole from our library (3k-n and 4k-n) [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00122" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] or newly synthetized (3f, j and 4f, j), all showed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00122-f002">Figure 2</xref>, in order to better understand the role of substituent in position C5 and C6 on the benzotriazole moiety and describe structure-activity relationships (SARs).
