<p>Vero E6 cells were seeded at an initial density of 4 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL in 6-well plates, in culture medium (EMEM 25mM HEPES buffer) supplemented with 1% L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% NaPy, 1% NEAA, and 0.1% gentamycin. Cell cultures were then incubated at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere in the absence or presence of serial dilutions of test compounds. Cell viability was determined after 7 days at 37 °C by the crystal violet staining method.
