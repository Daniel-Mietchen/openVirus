<p>All experimental work involving viruses was performed in a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) containment laboratory. Hantaan (HTNV) (strain 76–118) (kindly provided by Prof. Dr. D. H. Krüger and Dr. Boris Klempa, Institute of Virology, Charitè University of Berlin) was used for all experiments. Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL 1586) were maintained in complete EMEM (minimum essential medium with Earle’s salt, 25mM Hepes supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate (NaPy), 1% non-essential amino acids NEAA, 0.1% gentamicyn). RBV was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). The primary antibody, rabbit anti-Malacky Ab, was obtained from Dr. Boris Klempa, Berlin. The secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) HRP conjugate (Cat. No. 170-6515, Bio-Rad, Inc., CA, USA). SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Cat. No. 34080, Thermo Scientific, MA, USA)</p>
