The mixture was stirred at 80 Â°C for 2 h (3j) or 24 h (3f, 4f, 4j). At the end, reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and the solids were obtained by filtration. Mother liquor was dried by evaporation obtaining further solid. The crude solids were purified by flash chromatography, using a mixture of petroleum spirit/ethyl acetate in a ratio 7/3 as eluent, followed by crystallization from ethanol.
