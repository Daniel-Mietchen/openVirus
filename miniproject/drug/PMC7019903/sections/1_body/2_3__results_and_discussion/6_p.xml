<p>Accordingly, to obtain a detailed insight on the efficacy of 2j, 2l, and 2n against HTNV, a yield reduction assay was performed. The reduction of virus titer in the presence of the active compound during a single round of viral infection was determined. Treatment with non-cytotoxic 20 µM concentration of 2j, 2l and 2n caused a significant reduction of viral titer (
