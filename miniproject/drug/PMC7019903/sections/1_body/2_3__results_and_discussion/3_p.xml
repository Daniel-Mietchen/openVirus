<p>From a structure–activity relationship perspective, the most relevant results concerned the potent and selective activity of two urea derivatives (2l and 2n) and one amide derivative (2j), all belonging to the series of the 5,6-dichloro-2-phenyl-derivatives. By contrast, none of the molecules of the series 5,6-dichloro-1-phenyl-derivatives exhibited anti-HTNV activity, with only the exception of the compound 1h (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 21 µM). Regarding the presence of the two chlorine atoms in positions C5 and C6 of benzotriazole, their elimination (3f, j-n) or substitution with methyl groups (4f, j-n) results in total loss of antiviral activity. Moreover, we can highlight that derivative 2l (R= NHCONH-propyl) showed an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 5 µM, but when decreasing or increasing the steric hindrance of the side chain with ethyl-group (2k) or butyl-group (2m), it turned out in a total loss of antiviral activity.
