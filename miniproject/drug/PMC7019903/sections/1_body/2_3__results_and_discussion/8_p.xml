<p>In our assay, benzotriazole derivatives 2n, 2l, 2j (20 µM) determined a very interesting reduction of viral titer compared to control cells infected in the absence of inhibitors. The production of the virus was significantly reduced upon treatment with 2l (3,08 log10). The same trend of reduction in viral loads was detected for 2n (2,41 log10) and 2j (2.14 log10). Conversely, in order to obtain a titer decrease, less than 2 logs (1,78 log10) if compared to untreated control, the reference molecule ribavirin needed to be added at 50 µM concentration. </p>
