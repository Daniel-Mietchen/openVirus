  <p>Regulation of EGCG antiviral activity by replacement of key amino acids in capsid. (
   <bold>a</bold>,
   <bold>b</bold>) The infectivity of rescued PCV2 mutants. The rescued PCV2 mutant virus was inoculated into PK-15 cells at MOI = 1.0; at 72 hpi the cell samples were detected by IFA (
   <bold>a</bold>), and the capsid expression was measured by immunoblotting (
   <bold>b</bold>). (
   <bold>c</bold>) One-step growth curve of PCV2 mutants. PK-15 cells were inoculated with mutant viruses at MOI = 1.0, TCID
   <sub>50</sub> at various time points were determined by IFA and calculated according to the Reed-Muench method. (
   <bold>d</bold>–
   <bold>i</bold>) Antiviral effect of EGCG on PCV2 mutants. PK-15 cells were infected by mutant viruses at MOI = 1.0 with 100 μM EGCG treatment during the whole infective process and the titers were detected by IFA at 72 hpi. Mean ± SD of three independent experiments were statistically analyzed using Student’s
