  <p>Verification of key amino acids involved in the interaction of EGCG with capsid. (
   <bold>a</bold>–
   <bold>f</bold>) The affinity impairment of capsid to EGCG induced by the key amino acid mutation. The Cy5 fluorophore labeled dcapsid mutants were incubated with two-fold serially dilutions of EGCG at room temperature for 15 min before being tested with MST, and the Kd values between EGCG and capsid mutants R51A (
   <bold>a</bold>), G54A (
   <bold>b</bold>), D70A (
   <bold>c</bold>), R73A (
   <bold>d</bold>), N75A (
   <bold>e</bold>) and D78A (
   <bold>f</bold>) were measured, respectively. (
   <bold>g</bold>) The eluted level of capsid mutants bound to the heparin column. Heparin column preloaded with dcapsid mutants was eluted with 0.5 mg/mL soluble heparin or EGCG. The eluted level of each mutants was analyzed using immunoblotting. Mean ± SD of three independent experiments were statistically analyzed using Student’s
