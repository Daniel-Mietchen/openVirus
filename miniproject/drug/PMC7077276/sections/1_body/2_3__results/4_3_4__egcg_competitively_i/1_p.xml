<p>PCV2 virions attached to host cells via direct interaction between viral capsid protein and cell surface heparan sulfate [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that EGCG might also bind to capsid, and competitively block the interaction between PCV2 capsid and HS. The microscale thermophoresis assay (MST) was utilized to evaluate the affinity between compounds and protein by measuring the dissociation constant (Kd). The Kd between dcapsid and EGCG was 98.03 ± 4.76 μM, indicating that EGCG could indeed bind to capsid (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f004">Figure 4</xref>a), and capsid’s affinity to EGCG was comparable to the affinity for heparin (an HS analog similar in structure to the sulfated domain of HS), or even a little stronger than the latter (Kd = 120.67 ± 4.73 μM) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f004">Figure 4</xref>b). However, the EC, which did not exhibit the inhibitory activity against PCV2 infection, could also bind to capsid with a 10-fold lower affinity than EGCG (Kd = 951.33 ± 6.81 μM) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f004">Figure 4</xref>c). These findings implied that the interaction between PCV2 capsid and HS might be hindered by EGCG. This was confirmed by heparin column chromatography assay. Briefly, the dcapsid protein was pre-loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose column, then eluted by the various competitor reagents. The results showed that approximately 40% protein fraction (42.33 ± 3.52%) could be eluted by the EGCG at a concentration of 0.05 mg/mL, similar to the eluted level of heparin (36.00 ± 6.25%), while in case of EC only 10.33 ± 4.50% protein sample was eluted from the heparin column (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f004">Figure 4</xref>d), which was significantly reduced compared to the level of EGCG or heparin competitor reagents. The eluted fraction was further increased when the concentration of competitor reached 0.5 mg/mL. In that case, the heparin and EGCG could elute 89.33 ± 4.16% and 90.00 ± 5.29% of total protein, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f004">Figure 4</xref>e), and the difference between then was still not significant. In summary, EGCG could directly interact with PCV2 capsid, competitively inhibiting the binding of latter to HS.
