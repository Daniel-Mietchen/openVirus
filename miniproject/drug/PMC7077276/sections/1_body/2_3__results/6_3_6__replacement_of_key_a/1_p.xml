<p>To further confirm the role of the key amino acids in capsid towards the antiviral activity of EGCG, we tried to use virus rescue strategy to generate mutant viruses and evaluate the regulation in EGCG’s antiviral activity. The circularized PCV2 genome with R51A, G54A, D70A, R73A, N75A, and D78A mutations were transfected into PK-15 cells, respectively. Also, the genome with the A135A mutation was designated as a positive control. Transfected cells were serially passaged and cultured to harvest the rescued virus particles, which were then inoculated into PK-15 cells to test the infectivity. The results of IFA showed that PCV2 (G54A), PCV2 (D70A), PCV2 (N75A) and PCV2 (D78A) could be detectable at 72 hpi, similar to PCV2 (WT) and PCV2 (A135A) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f007">Figure 7</xref>a–c), which might be due to the replacement of these key arginine residues related to HS binding ability would cause the impairment of virus binding to cell surface, which eventually lead to the inability of virions to complete the infection process [
