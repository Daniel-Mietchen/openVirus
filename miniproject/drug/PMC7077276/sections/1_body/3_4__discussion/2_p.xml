<p>Heparan sulfate is a linear, synthetic, acidic polysaccharide belonging to the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) family, which is widely distributed on the surface and in extracellular matrix of various mammalian cells [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. HS was attached to the protein core and consisted of repeating 1 to 4 linked disaccharide units, one of which is an α-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucosamine residue and the other is an anionic acid. HS chains acquired negative charge though epimerization and terminal sulfation processes, thereby facilitating HS in establishing electrostatic interaction with positively charged motifs and residues [

 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In general, these protein ligands possessed distinct HS binding region, which acted as a complementary structure for heparin-protein interactions [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Based on the known ligands’ structural details, the molecular modeling of protein-glycosaminoglycan revealed that HS binding regions formed a hydrophilic pocket wrapped around and folded over heparin oligosaccharides. The key factors to produce such hydrophilic pocket were the clusters contributed by basic amino acids, especially arginines and lysines [
