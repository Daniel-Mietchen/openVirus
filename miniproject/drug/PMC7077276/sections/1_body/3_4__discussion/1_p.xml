<p>As the most prominent component of GTCs, EGCG displayed broad and distinguished anti-viral activity compared to other GTC members [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Here, we showed that EGCG exhibited an inhibitory effect on the PCV2 infection at the concentration of 100 Î¼M, without causing significant toxicity to the host cells. EGCG acted directly on PCV2 virions rather than any cellular factors with or without the stimulation of virions, and EGCG inhibited virion attachment to host cells by competitively interacting with capsid with cell surface receptor, but it did not affect other post-binding stages.
