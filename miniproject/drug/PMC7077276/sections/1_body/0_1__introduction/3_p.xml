<p>The green tea catechins (GTCs) are polyphenolic compounds extracted from the leaves of 
 <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and have shown numerous beneficial properties, such as anticancer activity [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], anti-inflammatory ability [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], antioxidative properties [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], antibacterial function [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and antiviral effects [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. GTCs are predominantly comprised of four constituents: epicatechin (EC), epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], among which the EGCG is the major component of GTCs accounting for approximately 59% of the total polyphenols, and it is also the most complicated and principal constituent, possessing the activity against infection of several viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], influenza A virus [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], Zika virus [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], herpes simplex viruses 1 [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and hepatitis C virus [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The mechanisms of EGCG antiviral activity are complicated and diverse, depending on the specific virus infection process or host cell response, one of which is that EGCG interacts with viral structural proteins, consequently blocking the latter from recognizing or binding with cellular receptors. In previous reports, EGCG has been shown to interact with the influenza A virus hemagglutinin, disrupting the binding of envelope glycoprotein to cell surface sialic acid receptor [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. EGCG inhibited the interaction of HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 with the cellular CD4 molecule [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Regarding the GAGs receptors, EGCG could bind to the herpes simplex virus-1 glycoprotein gB and gD, which should interact with HS and 3-O-sulfated HS of cellular glycans, respectively [
