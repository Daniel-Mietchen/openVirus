<p>PK-15 cells seeded in the 96-well plates were added with 10-fold serially diluted virus samples. At 96 hpi (hours post-infection) the virus titers were determined by indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) with mAb 5E11 against PCV2 capsid and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. The 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated according to the Reed-Muench method. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) was defined as the number of plaques forming units (PFUs) computed as PFU = 0.7 Ã— TCID
 <sub>50</sub>.
