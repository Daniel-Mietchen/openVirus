<p>The purified dcapsid proteins were labelled with the Cy5 fluorophore based on the chemical reaction between the 
 <sup>108</sup>cysteine of capsid and Cy5-maleimide (PA25031, GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The labelled molecules were separated from the unreacted and excess dyes with a PD Mini-Trap G-25 desalting column, and mixed at 10â€“50 nM concentration with 2 fold serially dilutions of EGCG, EC or heparin in reaction buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.05% Tween-20, pH 7.4). The binding reactions were fixed into equal volume and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The mixtures were then enclosed in standard pretreated glass capillaries and analyzed with MST machine (Monolith NT.115, NanoTemper Technologies, Munich, Bavaria, Germany), and the Kd values of each reaction were computed by NanoTemper Analysis software (Version 2.1, NanoTemper Technologies, Munich, Bavaria, Germany).
