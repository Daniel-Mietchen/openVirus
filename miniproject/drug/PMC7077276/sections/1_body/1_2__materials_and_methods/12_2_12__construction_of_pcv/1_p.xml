<p>The whole genome of PCV2 strain HZ0201 was cloned and inserted into pMD18-T vector (Takara, Tokyo, Japan). Site-specific mutagenesis was performed using PCR to construct the mutants. The linear genomes of the WT and mutants were extracted, digested by 
 <italic>Eco</italic> RI restriction enzyme (NEB), cyclized by T4 DNA ligase (Takara), and transfected into PK15 cells for virus rescue with the jetPRIME
 <sup>Â®</sup> in vitro transfection reagent (Polyplus-transfection, New York, NY, USA). The transfected cells were maintained for 72 h, then continuously passaged and cultured. The rescued virus samples were harvested and inoculated to PK15 cells and the infectivity was evaluated with immunoblotting in an indirect immunofluorescence assay. The virus titers were calculated according to the Reed-Muench method.
