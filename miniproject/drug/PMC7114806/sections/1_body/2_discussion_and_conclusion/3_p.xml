<p id="Par19">The patientâ€™s medication history in this case showed no drugs taken before or after administration of LDV/SOF until the adverse reaction occurred, and there were no supplements or dietary supplements taken. Therefore, LDV/SOF is proposed as the cause of the suspected adverse effect. The symptoms of fever and cough that appeared to be the initial symptoms of the lung disorder appeared on day 8 (May 25, 20XX) after the start of LDV/SOF administration, and the patient was transported to the emergency department about one week later (day 16, June 2, 20XX). Laboratory examinations at our hospital showed an increase in white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein, but KL-6 did not show an increase. KL-6 has been used as a biomarker for interstitial pneumonia and has been reported to be increased in drug-induced lung disease. However, it has also been reported that it may not increase because of the pathological condition of lung injury [

It is considered that the clinical types of drug-induced lung diseases differ according to drug types. Therefore, we need to accumulate and consider more detailed reports.
