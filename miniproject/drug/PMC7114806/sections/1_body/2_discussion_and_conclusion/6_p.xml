<p id="Par22">When starting of administration LDV/SOF, treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in the patient had been already completed. While diagnosing interstitial lung disease, it caused by rheumatoid arthritis was ruled out because of no rheumatic symptoms and the shadow pattern of the lung CT image, and the test result for the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody was negative. Therefore, it is unlikely that interstitial lung disease developed because of rheumatoid arthritis. Hence, we considered that interstitial lung disease was caused drug-induced lung disease due to LDV/SOF. The diagnosis criteria for drug-induced lung disease caused by hypersensitivity reactions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] were as follows: (1) Lung disorder observed after starting drug administration (1–6 weeks). (2) Initial symptoms include fever, cough, dyspnea, and rash (positive for 2 or more items). (3) Peripheral blood images show eosinophilia or leukocytosis. (4) Drug sensitivity test is positive. (5) Reproduction of pulmonary injury is observed by accidental re-administration. The definitive diagnosis satisfies items (1) and (4) or (5). The suspicion satisfies (1) and (2) or (1) and (3). In this case, the only medication administered when the lung injury occurred was LDV/SOF, which is considered a suspected drug because it meets the criteria for “suspect” in the above-mentioned diagnostic criteria.
