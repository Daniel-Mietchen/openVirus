<p id="Par16">Subsequent biochemical test results showed HCV positivity, slightly increased ALT of 54 (U/L), and increased HCV-RNA of 5.6 (Log IU/mL). Treatment for hepatitis C was deemed to be necessary, and the patient was referred to the hospital. Oral administration of LDV/SOF was started (day 1, May 18, 20XX). On day 8 of dosing (May 25, 20XX), a fever of 38–39 °C and coughing were observed and then shortness of breath gradually appeared. There was no improvement in her condition, so the patient visited her primary care physician on day 16 of administration (June 2, 20XX). A chest roentgenogram showed bilateral shadows of ground glass in the lower lung fields, so the patient was brought urgently to the hospital on the same day. On the day of emergency transportation, blood tests, chest roentgenogram, computed-tomography scan and urine antigen tests were conducted at our hospital. Test results showed abnormal white blood cell count (10,100/μL), lactate dehydrogenase (941 U/L), platelets (57,000/μL), and C-reactive protein (CRP; 4.2 mg/dL) values, but sialylated carbohydrate antigen Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) value (303 U/mL) was within the normal value range. Chest roentgenogram demonstrated bilateral ground glass opacity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) in the lower lung fields, and chest computed tomography (CT) scans demonstrated significant ground-glass shadows in a mosaic pattern in the lower lobes of both lungs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Because the condition was acute in onset and CT imaging indicated interlobular septal thickening, which was relatively thick, causes other than infectious disease were considered. Therefore, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was urgently performed. No significant increase in the number of lymphocytes was detected, and the predominant cell differential was almost normal in the BAL fluid. Because the possibility of infection was low based on the results of imaging and BAL examinations, a drug-induced lung disease was suspected, LDV/SOF administration was discontinued, and steroid administration was started. Steroid pulse therapy with methylprednisolone sodium succinate was performed for 3 days starting the day after hospitalization (day 17, June 3, 20XX). After changing to prednisolone tablets for oral administration, the dose was gradually tapered. Blood and sputum cultures from the day of hospitalization were tested to rule out respiratory infection, and prophylactic azithromycin infusion was given until the results were known. An infectious disease was ruled out when the results of the blood and sputum culture showed no viable microbes and administration of azithromycin was discontinued after it had been administered for 5 days. On day 19 (June 5, 20XX), which was the fourth day after admission to our hospital, the patient coughed when taking deep breaths, but her dyspnea was improving. Because of the development of oral candidiasis, FLCZ 100 mg/day for 5 days was administered. On day 20 (June 6, 20XX), the respiratory condition improved and the auscultation findings tended to improve. On day 23 (June 9, 20XX), the white blood cell count, platelet count, and inflammatory marker levels improved. On day 27 (June 13, 20XX), the patient’s symptoms improved and she was discharged. During outpatient care on day 36 (June 22, 20XX), the cough remained but the shadow had almost disappeared on the chest roentgenogram (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). On day 46 (July 2, 20XX), 30 days of steroid administration was completed. There was no deterioration in subjective symptoms and imaging results after completion of steroid administration. A drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) was performed on day 64 (July 20, 20XX), but the result was negative.
