<p id="Par12">Interferon (IFN) and ribavirin have been used as the standard treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection and hepatitis C-compensated cirrhosis. The first hepatitis C virus (HCV)-specific direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) that directly inhibit the growth process of HCV were approved in 2011. DAAs were initially administered in combination with IFN, but in 2014 an IFN-free DAA treatment was approved. HARVONI Combination Tablet (ledipasvir acetonate/sofosbuvir [LDV/SOF]; Gilead Science Inc., Tokyo, Japan) is a drug with efficacy and an effect of “amelioration of viremia in serogroup 1 (genotype 1) chronic hepatitis C or type C-compensated cirrhosis.” This drug was approved for the treatment of genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C infection in the United States in 2014 and in Japan in 2015. Approval of LDV/SOF for additional indication for “amelioration of viremia in serogroup 2 (genotype 2) chronic hepatitis C or type C-compensated cirrhosis” was obtained in February 2018. It has been reported that administration of LDV/SOF to patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C, including those with compensated cirrhosis, resulted in 100% of the patients achieving a sustained virologic response after 12 weeks [
