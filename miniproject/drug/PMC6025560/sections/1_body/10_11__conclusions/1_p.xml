<p>Approximately 95% of the worldâ€™s population is infected with EBV, but most do not present disease. However, for those that do develop EBV-related illness there remains no directed small molecule therapy as antivirals used in clinical trials have been largely ineffective. Past antiviral attempts have primarily targeted viral replication and further research into new avenues of study, including targeting non-replication proteins, may be necessary to develop effective therapy for EBV infections. EBV-triggered disease can cause debilitating illness and death and antiviral therapy targeting EBV for all related indications remains a major unmet medical need.</p>
