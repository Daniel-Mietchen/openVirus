<p>However, neither acyclovir nor other drugs have any effect on latent infection, which is dependent upon persistent EBV episomes, the circular form of EBV genome, not the encapsulated linear form [
 <xref rid="B4-cancers-10-00197" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The episome is replicated by the same mechanisms used by cells once every cell cycle, maintaining a stable number through successive generations. It is not itself oncogenic, but serves as the molecular basis of the latent state of EBV infection [
 <xref rid="B5-cancers-10-00197" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. No inhibitors of EBV latent infection have materialized over the decades. Accordingly, despite prolonged suppression of viral replication, some latently infected cells will persist and will restore the population of the latent cells.
