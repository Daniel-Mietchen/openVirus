<p>In 2002, Malouf and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B12-cancers-10-00197" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reported a reduction in the incidence of PTLD in lung and heart-lung transplant recipients who received antiviral prophylaxis. They analyzed its incidence before 1996 and compared the impact of long-term antiviral prophylaxis on the development of PTLD in EBV-seronegative recipients between 1996 and 2000. In this study, none of the EBV-seronegative recipients receiving continuous antiviral prophylaxis developed PTLD, while in the historic group PTLD developed in 4.2% of the patients.
