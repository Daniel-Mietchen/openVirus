<p>The effects of ganciclovir (GCV) and valgancyclovir (VGCV) prophylaxis on EBV load was evaluated in a group of EBV-na√Øve pediatric renal transplant recipients who had received a graft from an EBV-positive donor, and therefore were at risk of primary infection with EBV [
 <xref rid="B11-cancers-10-00197" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Over the first post-transplant year, antiviral prophylaxis with VGCV or GCV resulted in a significantly decreased incidence of EBV primary infection: 9/20 (45%) in the prophylaxis group versus 8/8 (100%) in the non-prophylaxis group. There was a significantly lower EBV viral load depending on the type and intensity of the immunosuppressive therapy.
