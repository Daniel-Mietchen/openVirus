<p>Why is it that despite the profusion of drugs developed through the years that inhibit replication of the Epsteinâ€“Barr virus (EBV) their use clinically has been limited? The problem is illustrated by the commonest infection caused by EBV in Western countries: infectious mononucleosis (IM). First, its onset is insidious with nondescript sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, and splenic enlargement, along with lassitude that persists up to six months or longer while the virus has already been actively replicating for some time and shed from the oropharyngeal epithelial cells. Consequently, drugs given largely post-facto are too late. Infectious mononucleosis is essentially an immunologic condition triggered by EBV that is signaled by the atypical T-cell response in the blood. It therefore can be imagined that combined treatment with antiviral and immunosuppressive drugs might have an impact on infectious mononucleosis. However, in trials in which corticosteroid and antiviral drugs were administered together, the effects were marginal [
