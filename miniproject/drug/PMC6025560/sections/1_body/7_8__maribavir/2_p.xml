<p>Maribavir has marked activity against EBV through a unique dual effect, inhibition of viral DNA replication and of virus transcription [

 <xref rid="B26-cancers-10-00197" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In contrast to HCMV, the activity of MBV against EBV could not be ascribed to direct inhibition of the EBV PK (BGLF4). In fact, MBV treatment was shown to inhibit the phosphorylation of the EBV DNA processivity factor (BMRF1) [
 <xref rid="B20-cancers-10-00197" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Unlike ACV that has little effect on EBV RNAs, MBV inhibits the expression of multiple RNAs. Furthermore, the inhibitory profile of MBV transcripts appeared to be similar to that produced by an EBV mutant in which PK expression and activity were knocked out [
 <xref rid="B27-cancers-10-00197" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The result suggested that EBV largely affects EBV transcript levels through inhibition of BGLF4, although MBV does not directly affect the EBV PK [
 <xref rid="B28-cancers-10-00197" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Considering that EBV BGLF4 has at least 20 viral targets, MBV may also affect downstream targets indirectly.
