<p>The L-valine ester of H2G, (i.e., MIV-606, (valomaciclovir, VALM)) is a prodrug of H2G with higher oral bioavailability than the parent compound. Phase I/II clinical trials with VALM (
 <uri xlink:href="http://www.epiphanybio.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.epiphanybio.com</uri>) include a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial for infectious mononucleosis [ClinicalTrials.gov Trial: NCT00575185]. Subjects over the age of 15 with acute IM were randomized to 21 days VALM 4 g/day (11 patients) or placebo (10 patients) and followed for six months. Valomaciclovir subjects had faster clinical improvement than placebo recipients did as documented by comparing the slopes of the plots of physical exam/symptoms scores from each visit during the treatment period. Severity of illness improved more quickly in the VALM group, but rates were not statistically significant. Valomaciclovir afforded a significant decrease in median EBV load in the oral compartment versus placebo mirroring ACVâ€™s effect. The proportion of individuals who had at least a 2-log10 decrease in viral load in the oral compartment was also significantly greater in the treatment group than in the placebo group. This was the first study demonstrating the clinical benefit and the in vivo antiviral effect of VALM in acute IM.
