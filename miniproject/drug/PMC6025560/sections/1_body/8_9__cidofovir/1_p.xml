<p>Finally, there is some basis for using an antiviral drug in tumorous tissue. Cidofovir (HPMPC), a nucleoside analogue, has been used for treatment of papillomatosis in the hypopharynx and esophagus caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) [

This drug is not only known for its antiviral properties but also for its antiproliferative effects through a mechanism that remains unclear. In experiments with EBV-positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) xenografts in nude mice, injection into the tumor tissue with cidofovir suppressed growth of the NPC tissue [
