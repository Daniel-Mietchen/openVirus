<p id="Par37">HNP-1-3 and HD5 but not hBD1, hBD2 or HD6 have been shown to exhibit antiviral activity against HPV, which is the primary cause of cervical cancer in sexually transmitted infections (Buck et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2006</xref>). HNP-1-3 and HD5 block HPV infection by impairing virion escape from endocytic vesicles. A recent study also suggested that HD5 blocks viral entry by interacting with viral particles and blocking L2 cleavage, a necessary step for successful viral entry and post-entry events (Wiens and Smith 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2015</xref>). Detailed studies on HD5 and HPV interactions suggest that hydrophobic residues, in particular, Arg-28, are very important for the antiviral activity of HD5 against HPV and other non-enveloped viruses (Gounder et al.
