<p id="Par43">CMV is an enveloped virus that belongs to the 
 <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> family, and is the most common congenital infection, affecting up to 0.2–2.2 % of all live births (Huygens et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2014</xref>). Foetal or perinatal infections can have devastating neurological consequences for the baby. However, post-natal CMV infections are usually asymptomatic, establishing lifelong infections without severe consequences on immune competent individuals.
