<p id="Par36">Similar antiviral effects against HSV are displayed by θ defensins, as both rhesus θ defensins 3 (RTD3) and retrocyclins 1 and 2 (RC1 and RC2) have been demonstrated to inhibit HSV viral entry to cells (Yasin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">2004</xref>). Of these peptides, retrocyclin 2 was shown to interact with the viral glycoprotein Gb2, thus interfering with viral entry without causing significant cytotoxicity to target cells. Defensins often display an antiviral activity that spans different steps on the target virus cycle. In this regard, HNP-1 and HD5 are able to block HSV viral gene expression even when added after the virus infection, indicating that defensins are also able to block post-entry events in the HSV cycle.
