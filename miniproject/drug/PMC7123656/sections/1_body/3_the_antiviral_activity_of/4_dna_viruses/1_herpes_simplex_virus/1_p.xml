<p id="Par35">One of the first viruses which was shown to be inhibited by α-defensins was HSV-1, which was inactivated after incubation with HNP-1, -2 and -3, an effect that was abrogated by serum addition (Daher et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1986</xref>). Further work has shown that one β defensin (hBD3) and all six α-defensins inhibited HSV-2 infection (Hazrati et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2006</xref>). Interestingly, while HNP1-3 and HD5 interacted with the viral glycoprotein Gb2 present on the viral envelope, HNP-4 and HD6 bound to heparan sulfate and heparin, cellular receptors used for HSV-2 to gain entry to cells. All of these interactions have been shown to result in diminished viral entry. In contrast, the same study demonstrated that β-defensin 1 and 2 (hBD1 and hBD2) which lack anti-HSV-2 effects, do not bind to neither Gb2 nor heparan sulfate.
