<p id="Par39">JC polyomavirus (also known as John Cunningham virus) is a member of the family 
 <italic>polyoviridae</italic>, and chronically infects between 70–90 % of the human population. This pathogen only tends to cause clinical symptoms in immunocompromised individuals, where infection spreads to the central nervous system (Shackelton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2006</xref>; Wollebo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2015</xref>). In experimental studies, a panel of α and β-defensins were tested for their capacity to neutralize JCPyV infection, resulting in HD5 and hBD3 being able to block the infection when incubated at 100 μg/ml with the virus for 1 h before infecting SVG-A human foetal glial cells (Zins et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">2014</xref>). Interestingly, hBD3 showed significant cytotoxicity on cells at this concentration, whereas HD5 neutralized JCPyV in a dose-dependent manner (Zins et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">2014</xref>; Dugan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>). Of note, HNP1-3 and hBD1, 2 and 4 showed no anti JCPyV activity. Further experiments also showed that HD5 was able to interact with JCPyVvirions, stabilizing the viral capsid and thus preventing the viral genome release (Zins et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">2014</xref>), a novel mechanism of action for a peptide that is generally thought to employ detergent-like modes of antiviral activity.
