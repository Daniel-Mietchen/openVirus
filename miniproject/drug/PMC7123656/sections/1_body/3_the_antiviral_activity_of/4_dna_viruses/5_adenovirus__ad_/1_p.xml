<p id="Par42">It has been shown that hBD-1 and HD-5, when expressed on eukaryotic cell lines, showed potential to protect those cells against adenoviral infection, in particular from Av1CF2 (Gropp et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">1999</xref>). Different HAdV species show variable susceptibility to defensin actions. In this regard, HNP-1 inhibited HAdV A, B and C infection, while increased HAdV D, E and F infectivity (Smith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2010</xref>). HD5 showed similar actions, blocking HAdV A, B, C and E while increasing D and F infectivity. Interestingly, and similar to other non-enveloped viruses, HD5 interacts with adenoviral capsids preventing viral uncoating and avoiding its release from endocytic vesicles (Nguyen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2010</xref>; Smith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2010</xref>; Smith and Nemerow 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2008</xref>). Further studies confirmed that Arg-28 residues of HD5 are critical for the antiviral effects seen against adenovirus (Gounder et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2012</xref>). Much less is known about other defensins effects on adenovirus. However, HNP-1 was shown to be effective at a concentration of 50 μg/ml in blocking adenovirus-type 5 infection of 293 cells, whereas hBD-2 showed a reduced effect (Bastian and Schäfer
