<p id="Par57">VSIV belongs to the 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic> family and is an arthropod-borne virus primarily affecting rodents, cattle, swine and horses. Infected livestock or sand flies can be a source of infection for humans, which develops as mild flu-like symptoms (Kuzmin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2009</xref>). This enveloped RNA virus showed an intermediate susceptibility to direct inactivation by HNP-1 peptide, reducing its PFU/ml by 0.74 and 0.84 log
 <sub>10</sub> with 50 or 100 μg/ml of peptide, respectively (Daher et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1986</xref>).
