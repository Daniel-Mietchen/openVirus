<p id="Par59">Recombinant RC-1 peptide has shown to reduce DENV-2 viral replication in VERO cells when incubated directly with the viral particles, but also showed a moderate effect when pre-treating or treating cells post-viral entry (Rothan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2012</xref>). This study suggested that RC-1 impacts DENV-2 replication by inhibiting the activity of viral NS2B-NS3 serine protease. Interestingly further studies showed that human skin fibroblasts release HD5 and hBD2 upon infection with DENV-2 (Bustos-Arriaga et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2011</xref>).
