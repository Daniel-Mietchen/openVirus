<p id="Par46">It has been shown that a variety of defensin peptides can have an impact on HIV infection. HNP-1 is clearly deleterious for viral dissemination, having a direct effect against a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) of viral particles in the absence of serum, whereas in the presence of serum HNP-1 acts on host cells (Chang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2005</xref>). One of the suggested mechanisms for such cellular effects is the HNP-1 mediated inhibition of the PKC signalling pathway, which is required for viral uncoating (Fields et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1988</xref>). Importantly, this HNP-1 effect did not affect the expression of viral receptors CD4, CXCR4 or CCR5 (Chang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2003</xref>). Interestingly, as a part of its direct effects on HIV viral particles, HNP1-3 peptides were shown to interact with gp120, a viral glycoprotein, thus impairing viral attachment to cell membranes. This effect was further potentiated by HNP-1-3 interactions with cellular CD4. Both antiviral effects were reduced, but not completely abolished by the presence of serum (Demirkhanyan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012</xref>; Furci et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2006</xref>; Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2004</xref>). A closely related peptide, HNP-4 was also able to bind gp120 and CD4 (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2005</xref>). A more indirect but also effective anti-HIV effect of HNP-1-3 peptides is their capacity to increase the secretion of the C-C chemokines MIP-1α, MIP-1β and RANTES, which can bind to CCR5 to act as antagonists for viral R5 strains that use CCR5 as a co-receptor (Guo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2004</xref>).
