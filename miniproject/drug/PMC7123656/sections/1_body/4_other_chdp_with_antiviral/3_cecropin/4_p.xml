<p id="Par66">Cecropins have also been shown to have antiviral activity at early and late points in the viral infection and replication cycle. For example, both cecropin P1 and cecropin D have been shown to have antiviral activity at several stages in infection with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an infection which can have substantial financial impact in the pig industry. Cecropin P1 is a peptide initially thought to be produced in the porcine intestine (Lee et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">1989</xref>), but was later revealed to have been produced by the nematode, 
 <italic>Ascarissuum</italic>, which survives in the porcine gut (Andersson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2003</xref>). This peptide was shown to block attachment and replication of the virus in kidney and alveolar macrophage cell lines, and also reduced the number of infectious viral particles produced after infection in vitro (Guo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2014</xref>). The peptide was also shown to have immunomodulatory properties by preventing the onset of PRRSV-induced apoptosis. Similarly, cecropin D was recently shown to inhibit PRRSV attachment and replication, and also attenuated apoptosis induced by the virus (Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2015</xref>).
