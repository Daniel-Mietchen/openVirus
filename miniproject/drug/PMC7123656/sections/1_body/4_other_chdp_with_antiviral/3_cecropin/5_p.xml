<p id="Par67">The broad spectrum antiviral activity of cecropins is further evidenced by a study demonstrating that cecropin A could inhibit replication of Junin virus, the cause of Argentine hemorrhagic fever (Albiol Matanic and Castilla 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2004</xref>). The peptide inhibited Junin virus-related protein production in host cells, but the authors suggested that the antiviral effects were predominantly limited to later stages in the virus replication cycle, since the peptide did not appear to alter viral infectivity. Interestingly, the same study also demonstrated that cecropin A did not exhibit any inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, suggesting that any antiviral activity exhibited by these peptides is pathogen specific. It should be noted that all HSV-1 and HSV-2 contain a DNA genome, in contrast to HIV-1, Junin, PRRSV and Dengue, which are RNA viruses, and thus the activity of cecropins against other DNA viruses remains to be understood.
