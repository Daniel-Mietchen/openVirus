<p id="Par64">A recent study revealed that the mature form of an induced cecropin-like peptide found in the salivary glands of the female mosquito, 
 <italic>Aedesaegypti</italic>, had substantial antiviral activity against Dengue virus (Luplertlop et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2011</xref>). The virus utilizes 
 <italic>A.aegypti</italic> as a vector for transmission to humans and induces an innate immune response, characterized by the expression of a cecropin-like peptide, produced by up-regulation of the AAEL000598 gene. The peptide is subsequently cleaved from an immature form into a mature active form. Interestingly the immature (MK) form of the cecropin-like peptide was more active against all four strains of Dengue virus tested (Dengue-1, -2, -3 and -4) than the mature (GK) cleaved form. The authors also established that both the GK and MK forms of the peptide were active against Chikungunya virus, a pathogen also transmitted by the 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> mosquito that can cause fever and severe long lasting joint pain. Another study revealed that scorpine, a hybrid peptide with structural similarities to cecropins and defensins derived from the venom of the scorpion 
 <italic>Pandinus imperator</italic>, also exhibited antiviral activity against dengue virus by inhibiting the replication of Dengue-2 virus (Carballar-Lejarazu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>).
