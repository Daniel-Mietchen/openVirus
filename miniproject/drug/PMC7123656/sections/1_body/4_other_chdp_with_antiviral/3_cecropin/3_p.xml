<p id="Par65">Cecropin A is reported to inhibit HIV production by infected T-cells and fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner (Wachinger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">1998</xref>). The mechanism responsible for this inhibition was found to be reduced viral gene expression and synthesis of viral products, indicating that Cecropin has an antiviral role beyond that of direct interaction with the HIV virion.
