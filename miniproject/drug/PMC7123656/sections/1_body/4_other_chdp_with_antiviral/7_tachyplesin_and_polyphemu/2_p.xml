<p id="Par78">Tachplesin peptides have also been demonstrated to have activity against other viruses that affect humans. It was shown that Tachyplesin peptides were able to inactivate Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV; also known as vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus), a zoonotic member of the family 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic> that can infect cattle and cause disease in humans (Murakami et al.

The same study also identified that Influenza A (H1N1) was also moderately susceptible, although HSV-1 and -2, adenovirus-1, reovirus-2 and poliovirus-1 were not susceptible to the antiviral activities of the peptide. However, a subsequent study, which examined the antiviral activity of tachyplesin against HSV-1 and HSV-2 using an in vitro cytotoxicity model, did suggest that the peptide offered a moderate degree of protection against both virus strains (Yasin et al.
