<p id="Par69">In terms of their antiviral activity, dermaseptins have been shown to be highly effective against a broad range of viral pathogens, with activity that affects several steps in the infection and replication process. Dermaseptin-1 was initially identified to have antiviral activity against two viruses that are known to infect ectothermic animals; Frog virus 3 from the family 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic>, and Channel catfish virus, a member of the 
 <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> family (Chinchar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2004</xref>). This study provided indication that dermaseptin peptides possessed antiviral activity and subsequent studies were extended to examine the activity against human viral pathogens.
