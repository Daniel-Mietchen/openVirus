<p id="Par71">Other studies have revealed a possible role for Dermaseptins in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Dermaseptins have been shown to partially inhibit HIV virus infection of T-cells although cytotoxicity was observed at higher concentrations (VanCompernolle et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2005</xref>). Another study by Lorin et al. identified Dermaseptin S4 as having potential inhibitory activity against HIV-1 by inhibiting viral infection of human primary T-lymphocytes (Lorin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2005</xref>). The authors attributed this activity to a direct disruption of the virion and, while the parent peptide elicited cytotoxicity at higher concentrations, were able to reduce host cell cytotoxicity by reducing the positive charge of the native peptide through amino acid deletion or substitution. Notably, the modified peptides were also able to reduce HIV-1 binding to endometrial cells together with inhibition of capture and transmission of virus from dendritic cells to CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells. Dermaseptin S9 was also identified as having weak activity against HIV-1, but a mutant S9 peptide, where three lysine residues were replaced with arginines, exhibited potent inhibitory activity against HIV-1 although the mechanism underlying this observation remains unclear (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">2010</xref>).
