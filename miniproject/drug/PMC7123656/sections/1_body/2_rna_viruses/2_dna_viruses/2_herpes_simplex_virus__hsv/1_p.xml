<p id="Par25">Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and -2) are enveloped viruses of the family 
 <italic>Herpesviridae</italic>, that are widely found in humans and are particularly infectious. While they can be suppressed by some antiviral drugs, they are not normally susceptible to complete eradication from a host. A study by Yasin et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">2000</xref>) screened 20 host defence peptides to test their antiviral activity against HSV type 1 and 2 (Yasin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">2000</xref>). LL-37 was shown to have very little capacity to induce viral inactivation. However, the bovine cathelicidin, indolicidin, displayed potent antiviral activity against both HSV types.
