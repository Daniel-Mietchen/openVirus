<p id="Par27">It is known that a subgroup of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) will develop eczema herpeticum (ADEH) due to a disseminated infection with HSV (Wollenberg et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2003</xref>). Patients with AD have decreased expression of host defence peptides, and it has been suggested that a deficiency of LL-37 may cause patients with AD to be more susceptible to ADEH (Ong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2002</xref>). A study by Howell et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2006</xref>) showed that LL-37 exhibited direct antiviral activity against HSV-2 in vitro. In addition, a particularly physiologically relevant model was employed whereby human keratinocytes cells were pre-incubated with HSV for a period of 6 h before treatment with LL-37 for 18 h to assess whether intracellular viral replication could be inhibited with physiologic concentrations of LL-37 (Howell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2006</xref>). This study showed that the peptide was able to significantly reduce the levels of HSV gene expression in infected keratinocytes. In vivo studies using mice deficient in mCRAMP revealed higher rates of HSV replication compared to the wild type mice, indicating an important role for host defence peptides in controlling HSV in skin infection.
