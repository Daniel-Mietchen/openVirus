<p id="Par28">Interestingly, a recent study tested and compared two different approaches to fight HSV-1 corneal infection. A sustained release of LL-37 delivered through nanoparticles incorporated within corneal implants was compared with a cell-based delivery of LL-37 cDNA transfected into HCECs (human corneal epithelial cells). LL-37 released from implants showed an ability to inhibit HSV-1 activity, but did not clear HSV-1 from infected cells. HCEC producing LL-37 also showed direct anti-HSV-1 activity, although none of these approaches were able to completely eliminate the virus infection (Lee et al.
