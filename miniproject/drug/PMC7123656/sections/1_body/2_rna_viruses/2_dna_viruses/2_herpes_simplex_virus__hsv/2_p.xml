<p id="Par26">Other peptides which were investigated for anti-HSV activity include BMAP-27 and -28 (acronym of “bovine myeloid antimicrobial peptides”), which are cathelicidins found in bovine neutrophils. BMAP-27 and -28, and their synthetic 1–18 fragments, were analysed for their in vitro antiviral activity against HSV-1. Only BMAP-28 was shown to provide some protection in vitro against HSV-1 whereas all other peptides were ineffective at non-cytotoxic concentrations (Benincasa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2003</xref>). Another study examined the underlying mechanism for the potent antiviral activity of indocilidin observed against HSV type -1 and -2 in vitro, and suggested that the mechanism underlining the antiviral activity was related to the ability of the peptide to disrupt the viral envelope, thus inactivating the virus particles (Albiol Matanic and Castilla
