<p id="Par31">In summary, a review of the current literature shows that cathelicidins have antiviral properties against a broad spectrum of viruses; the underlying mechanisms likely involve a direct effect on viral particles as well as the capacity to modulate host immune responses that may contribute in the clearance of infection. A better understanding of how cathelicidins interact with virus particles directly, in addition to their effects on infected host cells, remains to be established. However, it is clear that cathelicidins are ideal targetable components of the innate immune system that can be used to inform the development of novel therapeutics with broad activity targeting a number of viruses (TableÂ
