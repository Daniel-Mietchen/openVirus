<p id="Par21">Junin virus (JV) is an enveloped virus of the 
 <italic>Arenaviridae</italic> family, which causes Argentine haemorrhagic fever (AHF). A study by Albiol Matanic and Castilla (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2004</xref>) assessed the antiviral effects of indolicidin against junin virus, although it was determined that this cathelicidin was not able to induce substantial rates of viral inactivation (Albiol Matanic and Castilla 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2004</xref>). However, the relatively low virucidal action of indolicidin against junin virus that was observed was thought to be due to direct inactivation of the virus particles, similar to the antiviral mechanisms proposed for the action of cathelicidins against HIV-1 (Robinson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">1998</xref>).
