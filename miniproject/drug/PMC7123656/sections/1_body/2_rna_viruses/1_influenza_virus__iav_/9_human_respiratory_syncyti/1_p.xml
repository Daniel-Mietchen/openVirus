<p id="Par23">RSV is an enveloped virus and a member of the 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family, and has been shown to be responsible for significant numbers of respiratory tract infections. It is the major cause of viral bronchiolitis in young children (Nair et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2010</xref>). A recent study demonstrated that human cathelicidin displays concentration-dependent antiviral activity against RSV in vitro at physiologically relevant concentrations of 25 µg/ml (Currie et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>). LL-37 inhibited RSV replication and decreased the spread of infection, and these effects were highest when the peptide was pre-incubated with RSV or added to cells simultaneously. This study demonstrated that LL-37 mediates direct effects against the virus particles, similar to the action of LL-37 against influenza A virus (Tripathi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2013</xref>). It was also demonstrated that a delayed LL-37 exposure, taking place 2 h after infection, resulted in the loss of antiviral effects which revealed the inability of the peptide to rescue infected cells. However, pre-treating cells with LL-37 prior to infection resulted in a reduction of infectivity, suggesting that the peptide is retained by the epithelial cells exerting a protective antiviral state. These results indicate that LL-37 can protect epithelial cells from viral infection through a mechanism distinct from direct antiviral activity. In addition, LL-37 was also shown to actively protect RSV-infected epithelial cells from cell death.
