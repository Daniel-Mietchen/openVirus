<p id="Par13">In in vivo studies, murine models receiving LL-37 or mCRAMP treatment showed a significant increase in survival compared to saline treated mice. Mice treated with PG-1 showed no significant alterations compared to the control group (Barlow et al.

This demonstrates that antiviral activities of cathelicidins are species-specific, and it was proposed that LL-37 protects against IAV infection through modulation of inflammatory response in the lungs. Mice infected with IAV exhibited a pronounced up-regulation of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines, although this was attenuated in LL-37-treated mice, suggesting that LL-37 modulates the inflammatory response by inhibiting excessive inflammation (Barlow et al.
