<p id="Par12">Studies have demonstrated the antiviral potential of several cathelicidins against influenza virus. A study by Barlow et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2011</xref> demonstrated the antiviral properties of human and murine cathelicidins in vivo and in vitro (Barlow et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2011</xref>). mCRAMP and LL-37, but not porcine cathelicidin PG-1, showed antiviral properties when pre-incubated with IAV in vitro. Tripathi et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2013</xref>) further demonstrated that pre-incubation of LL-37 peptide with IAV is necessary for optimal inhibition of IAV, although a host cell pre-treatment or a delayed treatment with exogenous LL-37 also inhibits IAV replication to an extent (Tripathi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2013</xref>). This reveals that LL-37 peptide has the ability to interact with epithelial cells although the most potent activity of the peptide involves direct interactions with the virus particles.
