<p id="Par14">In order to determine the effects of LL-37 on the cellular uptake and replication of IAV, qPCR was used to quantify viral infection and replication. The results showed that LL-37 did not reduce the number of virus particles associated with cells after 45 min of infection, although at 24 h post-infection, LL-37 caused a significant reduction in the amount of virus present in cells and in the cell culture supernatant (Tripathi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2013</xref>). Electron microscope images revealed that LL-37 had induced disruption of viral membranes, which may be one possible mechanism of antiviral activity.
