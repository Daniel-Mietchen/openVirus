<p id="Par15">Interestingly, pandemic IAV strains have shown to be more resistant to innate inhibitors of seasonal IAV strains, such as human and murine cathelicidins. A recent study compared the antiviral activities of LL-37 and derived fragments from LL-37 against seasonal and pandemic strains of influenza virus and revealed that the central fragment of LL-37 showed greater activity against the pandemic IAV strain than LL-37 in vitro (Tripathi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">2015</xref>). This finding suggests the possibility that synthetic derivatives of LL-37 with more potent antiviral activity could be used as a potential therapeutic for this infection.
