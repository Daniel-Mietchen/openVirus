<p id="Par18">A in vitro study by Bergman et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007</xref>) showed that LL-37 could inhibit HIV-1 replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), including primary CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells. This was shown to be independent of formyl peptide receptor-like-1 (FPRL-1) signalling, a receptor which is thought to be partially responsible for mediating some of the chemotactic and immunomodulatory effects of LL-37 (Bergman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007</xref>; Barlow et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2006</xref>). Another study examined the anti-HIV effects of LL-37 and its derived fragments, together with BMAP-18, a fragment derived from bovine cathelicidin BMAP-27, in vitro (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">2008</xref>). The peptide sequence order, aromatic residues and helical structures were examined and were shown to play an important role in HIV inhibition. Again, a central fragment of LL-37 (known as GI-20), and BMAP-18, were the most active against HIV-1 compared to LL-37 and BMAP-27. This study essentially provides new antimicrobial templates that could be used to develop novel anti-HIV therapies.
