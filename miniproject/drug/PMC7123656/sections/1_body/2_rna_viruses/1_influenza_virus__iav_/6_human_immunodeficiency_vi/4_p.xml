<p id="Par19">A more recent study examined the effects of LL-37 and its derived fragments on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, HIV-1 integrase and HIV-1 protease (Wong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">2011</xref>). It was shown that all peptides tested lacked the ability to inhibit translocation of HIV-1 integrase, an enzyme essential for HIV replication. The most potent inhibitory effects of the peptides were seen on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, and the central peptide, LL13-37, was revealed to have the strongest inhibitory activity.
