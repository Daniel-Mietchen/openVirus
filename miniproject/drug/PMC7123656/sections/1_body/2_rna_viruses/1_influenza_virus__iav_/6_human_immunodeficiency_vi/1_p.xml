<p id="Par16">HIV is an enveloped 
 <italic>lentivirus</italic> of family 
 <italic>Retroviridae</italic> that causes HIV infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). An estimate of 34.2 million people worldwide live with HIV and around 2.5 million new infections and 1.7 million deaths were detected in 2011 only (Piot and Quinn 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2013</xref>). The hallmark of this infection is the gradual loss of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells which leads to an acquired immune deficiency syndrome or AIDS (Simon et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2006</xref>). The production of up to 10
 <sup>10</sup> viral particles per day together with low fidelity of reverse transcription and recombination generate viral quasi-species in chronically infected subjects makes lifelong treatment with a combination of highly active antiretroviral drugs (HAART) the only option capable of keeping the infection controlled.
