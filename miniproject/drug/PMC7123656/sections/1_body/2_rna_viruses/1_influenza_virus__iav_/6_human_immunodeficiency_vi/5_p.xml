<p id="Par20">hCAP-18 has been shown to be strongly expressed in the epithelium of the epididymis, which suggests an important role of hCAP-18 in the antimicrobial protection of the reproductive male system (Malm et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2000</xref>). It has also been shown that vaginal fluid of healthy women has intrinsic anti-HIV-1 properties and these were conferred by cationic polypeptides. A depletion of cationic polypeptides caused a reduction of the intrinsic anti-HIV-1 activity (Venkataraman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2005</xref>) and, in addition to this, cervicovaginal secretions (CVS) of Kenyan women in HIV-serodiscordant relationships contained HIV neutralizing activity and CVS which revealed no intrinsic anti-HIV activity could be enhanced by the addition of recombinant LL-37 (Levinson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2012</xref>). Further studies have revealed that high concentrations of LL-37 were found in cervicovaginal secretions (CVS) collected from Kenyan sex workers with bacterial transmitted infections, which are associated with increased HIV acquisition (Levinson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2009</xref>). This finding does not seem to correlate with previous studies, where CVS contain HIV neutralizing activity conferred by cationic polypeptides. Therefore, there is a pressing need to determine the in vivo significance of LL-37 peptide in HIV infections.
