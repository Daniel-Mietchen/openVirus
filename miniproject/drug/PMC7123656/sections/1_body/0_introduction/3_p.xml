<p id="Par4">CHDP are small, evolutionarily conserved peptides with a positive charge that have broad spectrum activity against a range of pathogens, both in vitro and in vivo. In humans, there are two major families of CHDP; the cathelicidins and the defensins, however, more families exist in mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, arthropods and plants, each showing antimicrobial potential. While the antiviral activity of many peptides has been established in a significant number of studies, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism(s) of action involved remains elusive. Of particular interest are the immunomodulatory and inflammomodulatory activities of CHDP, from gaining a more fundamental understanding of innate responses to infection in addition to informing development of novel therapeutics. CHDP have been shown to have the capacity to modulate cell death pathways in infected cells, assist in the recruitment of immune cells to sites of infection, promote angiogenesis, alter immune cell differentiation and to mediate production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.</p>
