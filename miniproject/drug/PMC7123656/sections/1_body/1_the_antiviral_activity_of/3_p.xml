<p id="Par8">Mice express the cathelicidin mCRAMP (murine cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide), which has high sequence identity with hCAP18 and the porcine cathelicidin PR-39. mCRAMP shows similar expression and function patterns to its human ortholog (Gallo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1997</xref>) that is stored in neutrophil granules and is expressed by epithelial cells and leukocytes. mCRAMP knock-out mice have a high susceptibility to infections when compared to wild type mice (Huang et al.
