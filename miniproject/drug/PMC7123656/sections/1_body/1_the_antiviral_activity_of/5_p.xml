<p id="Par10">Cathelicidins play key roles in host defence via direct antimicrobial activity (Putsep et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2002</xref>), by acting as critical immunomodulatory molecules and in the control of inflammation. Recently, a number of studies conducted in humans, mice and other in vitro models have highlighted the potent antiviral activity of cathelicidins. Viruses that are most susceptible to cathelicidins include enveloped DNA and RNA viruses, and while all of the antiviral mechanisms remain to be elucidated, there does appear to be a direct effect on the viral envelope. However, non-enveloped viruses such as adenovirus can also be inactivated by cathelicidins (Gordon et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2005</xref>; Barlow et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2014</xref>). Therefore, the antiviral activity of these peptides likely comprises complex array of mechanisms that cannot all be explained by a direct effect on the virus particles.
