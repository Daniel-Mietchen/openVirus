<p id="Par6">Cathelicidins range from 12â€“88 amino acids in length and are characterised by the presence of an N-terminal signal sequence which directs the newly synthesised protein towards the secretory pathway, a conserved cathelin-like domain which has a high sequence homology with the porcine cysteine protease inhibitor, cathelin and a variable C-terminal antimicrobial domain which becomes the mature functional peptide upon proteolytic cleavage.</p>
