<p>Most relevant studies suggest that the prevalence of HBV in patients with rheumatic disease follows the pattern of the general population. Chronic HBV infection rates in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) have been estimated at 3.0% and 3.5%, respectively, whereas resolved HBV infection rate ranges between 13% and 50%.
