<p>From these limited data, it appears that the risk for HBVr in CYC-containing schemes is high, and occurs relatively early in HBsAg positive patients, while the respective risk in patients with resolved HBV infection is rather low. Prophylactic antiviral prophylaxis should be used for the former group. We believe that current evidence does not support universal antiviral protection for patients with resolved HBV infection prior to induction of remission with CYC-containing regimens.</p>
