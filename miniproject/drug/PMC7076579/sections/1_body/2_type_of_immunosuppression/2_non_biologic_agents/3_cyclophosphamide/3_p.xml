 </sup> Among 34 patients with chronic HBV infection not on antiviral prophylaxis, HBVr occurred in 15 (44%), whereas in contrast, only 3 (1.9%) patients with resolved infection experienced HBsAg seroreversion. However, in multivariate analysis, CYC was not associated with increased HBVr risk, and the main driver of HBVr in this cohort was an average prednisolone daily dose of &gt;5 mg.
