<p>While data from the rheumatology field are limited, Li and colleagues compared a standard prednisone regimen (1 mg/kg daily) 
 <italic>versus</italic> MMF (500–1000 mg twice daily) and lower prednisone dose (0.5 mg/kg daily) in HBsAg-positive patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome and ‘undetectable’ HBV-DNA (&lt;1.000 copies/mL).

 </sup> HBVr (defined as HBV-DNA &gt;1.000 copies/mL) during follow up was recorded in 64% (14/22) and 37% (7/19) of patients on standard prednisone monotherapy and MMF/lower prednisone combination, respectively (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.047), highlighting the role of high GC doses in the replicative potential of HBV. In a retrospective study of SLE patients with chronic or resolved HBV infection from Taiwan, MMF was not found to be among risk factors for HBVr.
