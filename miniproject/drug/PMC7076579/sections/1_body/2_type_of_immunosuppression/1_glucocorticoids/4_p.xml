<p>There is a relevant paucity of data looking into the effect of GC in HBVr risk specifically for patients with resolved HBV infection, but certainly this risk seems to be lower than in chronic HBV infection. In a retrospective Chinese study of a large HBsAg negative/anti-HBc positive population treated with at least one dose of systemic GCs for all indications, the incidence rate of HBsAg seroreversion was 1.8% at 1 year and 5.5% at 10 years. GC peak daily dose &gt;20 mg prednisolone equivalents and treatment duration for &gt;4 weeks were independent risk factors for a hepatitis flare but not for HBsAg seroreversion.

 </sup> The authors could not identify studies from geographical areas with less prevalent HBV infection to confirm this relatively high HBVr rate.
