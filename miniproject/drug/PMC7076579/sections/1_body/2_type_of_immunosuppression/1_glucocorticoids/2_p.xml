<p>There is robust literature evidence that even short courses of more than moderate-dose GC treatment in chronic HBV infection can lead to HBVr.

 </sup> Chemotherapy for chronically HBV-infected patients with lymphoma was less likely to cause HBVr in 9 months if it did not contain GCs (38%

 </sup> An HBVr incidence rate of 6.1% has been reported in chronic HBV patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) receiving GCs. The risk was higher among patients receiving systemic GCs, especially when they were used continuously (for at least 3 months) and in medium to high (&gt;20 mg/day) doses.

 </sup> Patients with chronic HBV infection and rheumatic diseases are also at risk for HBVr and hepatic flare when treated with GCs. For patients not receiving antiviral prophylaxis, and especially when GCs are used in combination with conventional and biologic agents, the hazard ratio (HR) has been reported at 5.1.

 </sup> Peak doses of &gt;40 mg prednisolone equivalents were associated with an adjusted HR for HBVr of 1.64.
