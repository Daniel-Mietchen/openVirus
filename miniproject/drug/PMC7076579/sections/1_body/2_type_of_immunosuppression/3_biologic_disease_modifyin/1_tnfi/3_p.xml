<p>On the contrary, it seems that the HBVr risk in resolved HBV infection patients treated with TNF inhibitors is significantly lower.

 </sup> In a recent meta-analysis of 468 published HBsAg negative/anti-HBc positive rheumatic patients treated with TNFi, Lee and colleagues reported an HBVr incidence rate of 1.7%.

 </sup> Similarly, in a prospective multicenter Italian study,

 </sup> no cases of HBVr were found among 146 resolved HBV infection patients treated with TNFi for a mean period of 56 months, whereas in a prospective Japanese study, the respective rate of HBVr was 4% (8/199).

 </sup> It is unclear why these differences in HBVr between European and Asian studies exist, but it could be due to different states of the underlying HBV infection (occult 
 <italic>versus</italic> resolved) or due to different HBV strains.
