<p>In the setting of resolved HBV infection, a few case reports of HBVr cases have been published.

 </sup> Three cases of HBVr in a recently studied Japanese cohort were reported on resolved HBV infection patients treated with ABA (total 
 <italic>n</italic> = 29, 10.3%).

 </sup> In another study, among 24 patients with resolved HBV infection on ABA treatment, three cases of HBVr were reported (12.5%),

 </sup> but these were mild elevations of HBV-DNA without overt hepatitis and without the need to use antivirals. Reassuringly, no HBVr cases were observed among the nine resolved HBV infection patients treated with ABA in the prospective trial by Barone and colleagues.

 </sup> Considering the high number of patients who have been treated with ABA since its approval, cases of HBVr in resolved HBV infection appear to be rare, especially in geographical areas with lower prevalence, such as Europe and the United States.
