<p>Abatacept (ABA) is a fusion protein composed of the Fc portion of the immunoglobulin IgG1 fused to the extracellular domain of CTLA-4; ABA acts by binding to the CD80/CD86 molecule, thus inhibiting the activation of T-cells by an antigen-presenting cell. The agent has been approved for RA and psoriatic arthritis, and there are ongoing trials for other rheumatic diseases (giant cell arteritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, myositis).</p>
