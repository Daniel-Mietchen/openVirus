<p>The observation that anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies can cause HBVr dates back to more than 20 years ago. So far, 183 RTX-associated HBVr cases were identified in a medical literature search between 1997 and 2009.

 </sup> This eventually led to the addition of a black box warning for HBVr risk to the RTX product label.

 </sup> Once again, the majority of studies of HBVr in HBsAg-positive patients derive from the hematology and oncology literature.

 </sup> In studies looking into the benefit of using antiviral prophylaxis in chronic HBV infection patients receiving RTX-containing regimens, the HBVr rate was as high as 53%, but was essentially nullified by the use of lamivudine or entecavir.
