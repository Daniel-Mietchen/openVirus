<p>Anti-CD20 agents (rituximab, ofatumumab, ocrelizumab) are monoclonal antibodies targeting CD20, a surface cell antigen of B lymphocytes. The immune complexes formed after their binding are recognized and destroyed by phagocytes, thus leading to B-cell depletion. RTX has been used for various rheumatic diseases including RA, AAV, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, and off-label for several connective tissue diseases including SLE, scleroderma, myositis, and Sjögren’s syndrome.</p>
