<p>In the setting of rheumatic diseases, the available HBVr data for HBsAg-positive patients receiving immunosuppression without antiviral prophylaxis is scarce, but the HBVr risk should be considered as high. Overall, it should be considered that there is robust data to support that RTX use in chronic HBV infection is associated with very high HBVr rates (30â€“60%)

 </sup> and antiviral prophylaxis is warranted. There is also evidence that, in the setting of rheumatic disease, the duration of immunosuppression should be taken into account when choosing the agent for antiviral prophylaxis, as there are case reports of virological escape with the use of drugs with low genetic barrier (e.g. lamivudine).

 </sup> Third-generation antiviral agents with high genetic barrier (entecavir, tenofovir) should be used.
