 </sup> The risk for HBVr with secukinumab was studied in a multicenter prospective cohort study of 49 Taiwanese patients with either chronic or resolved HBV infection. Among those with chronic HBV infection who did not receive antiviral prophylaxis, 27% (6/22) developed virological HBVr without a hepatitis flare, while the respective rate of virological HBVr in those with resolved HBV infection was 4% (1/24).
