 </sup> Two of the HBsAg positive patients were prophylactically treated with antivirals upon tofacitinib initiation and did not experience HBVr. Amongst the four HBsAg-positive patients not treated with antivirals, two had HBVr after 6 and 12 months of tofacitinib therapy, with one having only virological and the other virological and biochemical reactivation. Both were being cotreated with low-dose corticosteroids (5 and 10â€‰mg of prednisolone daily, respectively). Patients who were HBsAg negative/anti-HBc positive did not experience HBVr.
