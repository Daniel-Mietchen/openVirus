 </sup> Based on the literature data presented in this review and the worldwide accumulated experience with the use of RTX in large populations of rheumatic patients with resolved infection (ranging from 5% to 50% in the general population), we believe that the risk of RTX-induced HBVr is low and prophylactic antiviral therapy is not required.

 </sup> Nevertheless, baseline screening with HBV DNA and close monitoring with ALT, HBsAg, or HBV DNA (every 3–6 months) is advised for all patients treated with RTX (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1759720X20912646">Figure 2</xref>). Patients with detectable HBV DNA at baseline, or during monitoring, as well as those with seroreversion (HBsAg+) during monitoring, should be treated with oral antivirals as described above.
