<p>Taking into account the chronic nature of immunosuppression in most rheumatic patients, the unknown real risk conferred with these agents and the need for repeated laboratory monitoring (including HBV DNA measurement) in these patients, we believe that all such patients should receive long-term prophylactic antiviral therapy with the newer antivirals (as for patients with chronic hepatitis B). In individual patients (i.e. those scheduled for short term GCs: &lt;1â€‰month or treated with low risk nonbiologics such as AZA, SSZ, HCQ), close monitoring with frequent monitoring of ALT and HBV DNA levels may by chosen, after appropriate consultation with an HBV specialist.</p>
