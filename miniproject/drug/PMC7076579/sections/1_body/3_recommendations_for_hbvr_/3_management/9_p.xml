<p>The issue of antiviral prophylaxis in rheumatic patients with resolved HBV infection (HBsAg+, Anti-HBcâ€“) treated with immunosuppressives remains currently the most controversial. The discrepancies in the literature relate to the underlying disease indication (hemato-oncology 
 <italic>versus</italic> rheumatic) and to the geographical area studied (Asia 
 <italic>versus</italic> Europe). For example, a recent meta-analysis of HBVr in resolved HBV infection patients found that the pooled HBVr rates were much lower in non-hematological (3.6%) 
 <italic>versus</italic> hematological (10.9%) diseases.

 </sup> In the studies described above, one can easily detect differences in reported HBVr incidence between the Western Asia/Pacific and European regions, with the former showing significantly higher rates. This could be explained by several factors, including divergence in HBV prevalence, variance in host immune responses, different viral genotypes and inconsistent monitoring intervals.
