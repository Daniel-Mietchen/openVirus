<p>Patients who are at moderate or high risk of HBVr should be considered candidates for prophylactic antiviral treatment. Unlike in the oncology field, in the setting of rheumatic disease, immunosuppressive treatment is usually used for prolonged periods of time, even lifelong. Thus, there is need for enduring and potent control of viral replication with negligible drug resistance. Given lamivudine’s low genetic barrier and potential development of drug resistance (ranging from 24% in the first year up to 70% at 5 years),

 </sup> currently the newer nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) with high barrier to genetic resistance, such as entecavir (ETV), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) are the antiviral agents of choice (
