<p>For inactive HBV carriers (normal ALT, low or undetectable HBV DNA, minimal liver necroinflammation, and no fibrosis), the exact risk with the different immunosuppressive regimens has been difficult to discern due to the lack of prospectively collected, high-quality data. AASLD and EASL recommend antiviral therapy for all patients with at least detectable HBV DNA levels.
