<p>With the expected further increase in the use of biologics and new oral targeted synthetic agents [i.e. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors] in treating rheumatic diseases, rheumatologists should be aware of the potential risk, the screening recommendations, and management options for prophylaxis and monitoring for HBVr.

 </sup> The majority of the literature data around HBVr derives from the fields of hematology and oncology, where combinations of biologic and cytotoxic agents with higher immunosuppressive potential are routinely used, usually for a short period of time (months). These data need to be interpreted with caution when applied to rheumatic diseases, where the potency of immunosuppression is lower and the duration of therapy longer (years).
