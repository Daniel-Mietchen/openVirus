<p id="par0065">To investigate the antiviral effect of LH against SARS-CoV-2 virus, the Vero E6 cells were infected with 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of virus and incubated with LH at various concentrations for 72 h. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A, LH inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 411.2 μg/mL by CPE assay (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). Meanwhile, treatment with LH following infection also had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on plaque formation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C). We selected remdesivir as the positive control in our study and the results showed that remdesivir potently inhibited virus-induced CPE with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.651 μM and a total plaque formation inhibition at 5 μM (
