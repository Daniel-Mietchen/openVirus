<p id="par0040">The Vero E6 cell monolayers in 6-well plates were infected with 50 plaque-forming units (PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 for 2 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the cell monolayers were covered with agar overlay (final concentration: 0.6 % agar, 2% FBS, indicated concentrations of LH or remdesivir). The plates were then incubated for 48 h at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Subsequently, the agar overlays were removed, and the cell monolayer was fixed with 10 % formalin, stained with 1% crystal violet, and then the plaques were counted and photographed.
