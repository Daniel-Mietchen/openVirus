<p id="par0045">The Huh-7 cell monolayers in 12-well plate were rinsed with PBS and then exposed to coronavirus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 2 h at 37 °C. The inoculum was removed and replaced with the indicated concentrations of LH or mock-treated with DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS for subsequent 48 h incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The cells were then harvested for RNA isolation and qPCR as described previously [
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The primer and probe sequences used for analysis are listed in Supplementary Table 1. The relative mRNA expression was calculated using the 2
 <sup>−△△Ct</sup> method with GAPDH as an internal reference gene.
