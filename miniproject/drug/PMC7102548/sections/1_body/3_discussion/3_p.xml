<p id="par0085">Our previous study showed that LH exhibited in vitro anti-influenza activity with IC

 <sub>50</sub> value of 411.2 μg/mL (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been a potent tool to observe virus entry, virus particle assembly, viral ultrastructure, and budding from the plasma membrane [
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. To understand the antiviral details of LH, EM pictures were taken from each group. Abundant virus particles assembled at the surface of membrane, cytoplasm, and plasma vesicles in the SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, decreased in the treatment of LH at 600ug/mL. Notably, slight deformation of virus particles was seen in the LH treatment, which required us to make further studies.
