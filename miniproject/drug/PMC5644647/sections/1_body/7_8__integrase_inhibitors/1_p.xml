<p>The enzyme integrase catalyzes strand transfer (3â€²-end joining), which inserts both viral DNA ends into a host cell chromosome during proviral DNA integration [

 <xref rid="B88-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Once integrated, the provirus persists in the host cell genome and functions as a template for replication of the viral genome, leading to the formation of new viruses [
 <xref rid="B89-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. The high degree of conservation of integrase-active sites across many retroviruses suggests that FIV might also be sensitive to integrase inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B90-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Integrase inhibitors act through inhibition of integration of the proviral DNA that is produced by reverse transcription of the viral RNA genome [
