<p>In one 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study, experimentally FIV-infected cats were treated with a high-dose zidovudine/lamivudine combination, which protected some cats from infection when treatment was started before virus inoculation. However, zidovudine/lamivudine treatment showed no anti-FIV activity in chronically infected cats. Severe side effects, including fever, anorexia, and marked hematologic changes, were observed in some of the cats with this high-dose dual-drug treatment [
