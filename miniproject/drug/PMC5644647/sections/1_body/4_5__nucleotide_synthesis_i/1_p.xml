<p>Nucleotide synthesis inhibitors prevent synthesis of nucleotides through various mechanisms. They have a broad spectrum of activity but are associated with marked toxicity mainly because they are non-selective and therefore also interfere with normal cellular nucleotide synthesis. Some, for instance foscarnet, interfere with the exchange of pyrophosphate from deoxynucleoside triphosphate during viral replication by binding to RT or DNA polymerase, thereby preventing nucleotide synthesis [
