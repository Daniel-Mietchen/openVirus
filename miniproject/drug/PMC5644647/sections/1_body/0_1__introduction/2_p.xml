<p>Antiviral compounds interfere with certain steps in the viral replication cycle. Based upon steps targeted, the drugs can be assigned to different drug classes [

 <xref rid="B5-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This review covers the most common drugs used for treatment of FIV infection (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="vetsci-02-00456-t001">Table A1</xref>): reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs), which inhibit the retroviral enzyme reverse transcriptase (RTIs); drugs that inhibit other viral enzymes, such as DNA or RNA polymerases, thereby interfering with virus genome replication or with proteinases necessary for splitting precursor proteins during viral assembly (nucleotide synthesis inhibitors); drugs that target viral entry by binding to specific receptors that the virus uses for adsorption to the target cell, by acting as fusion inhibitors preventing conformational changes of the virus necessary for the fusion process, or by interfering with viral uncoating (receptor homologues/antagonists) [
 <xref rid="B4-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; drugs that inhibit integration by inhibiting the retroviral enzyme integrase (integrase inhibitors); drugs that inhibit viral replication by inhibiting the retroviral enzyme protease (protease inhibitors); and interferons.
