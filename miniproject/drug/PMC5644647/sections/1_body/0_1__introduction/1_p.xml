<p>FIV can induce immunosuppression, which predisposes cats to secondary infections, stomatitis, neuropathies, and tumors. FIV does not directly cause severe clinical disease in most infected cats. Thus, FIV-infected cats can live with a good quality of life for many years with preventive health measures, and overall survival time of infected cats is not necessarily shorter than in uninfected cats [

In cats with recurrent infections despite aggressive management, additional treatment with antiviral drugs (e.g., plerixafor and/or zidovudine) can be considered. Cats with no identifiable secondary diseases or with secondary disease that has been treated successfully might still suffer from problems likely associated with FIV, such as neurologic abnormalities or stomatitis; in these cases, antiviral treatment (e.g., with zidovudine) is also an option.
