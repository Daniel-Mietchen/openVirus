<p>The most commonly used antiretroviral drugs in human and veterinary medicine are RTIs. There are three categories of RTIs: nucleoside analogue RTIs (NARTIs,

A nucleoside consists of a nitrogenous base covalently attached to a sugar (ribose in RNA, 2-deoxyribose in DNA), and a nucleotide consists of a nitrogenous base, a sugar, and a phosphate group. Nucleic acid (RNA and DNA) contains a chain of nucleotides covalently linked to form a sugar-phosphate backbone with protruding nitrogenous bases. Prior to linkage of a new nucleotide (or monophosphate) to the nucleic acid, three phosphate groups must be bound to the nucleoside (triphosphate), two of which are removed, releasing energy during elongation of the nucleic acid chain [
