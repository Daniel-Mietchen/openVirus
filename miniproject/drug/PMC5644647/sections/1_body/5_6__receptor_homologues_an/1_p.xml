<p>Receptor homologues/antagonists bind to the virus or to the cellular receptor, leading to inhibition of viral cell-surface binding. Most of the receptor homologues/antagonists are highly selective for HIV and not useful in veterinary medicine. An exception is the class of antiviral compounds called bicyclams, which have been used in cats with FIV infection. Bicyclams act as potent and selective CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) antagonists [

Chemokine receptors belong to the group of seven transmembrane-proteins that enable signal transmission through rapid influx of calcium into the cell. They are essential co-receptors for HIV as well as for FIV during infection of CD4+ lymphocytes [
