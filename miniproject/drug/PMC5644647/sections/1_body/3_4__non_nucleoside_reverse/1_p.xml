<p>Most of the NNRTIs are highly specific for HIV-1 and are not active against other retroviruses, including HIV-2 and FIV [

 <xref rid="B42-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Unlike NARTIs and NtARTIs, which bind to the catalytic site of RT, non-nucleoside RT inhibitors interact with an allosteric site of the enzyme [
 <xref rid="B5-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and are not incorporated into the proviral DNA strand [
 <xref rid="B42-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. They are classified as non-competitive inhibitors of RT and do not require intracellular activation for inhibition of the enzyme [

 <xref rid="B42-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. NNRTIs are a group of structurally diverse compounds that all bind a single site of the RT [
 <xref rid="B55-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The interaction with the allosteric site which is located in close proximity to the catalytic site, leads to a number of conformational changes of the RT [

 <xref rid="B56-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Among other effects, these changes cause a reduction in the interaction between the DNA primer and the polymerase domain of the enzyme and thus, inhibit virus replication [
