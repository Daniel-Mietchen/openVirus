<p>Adefovir (2-(6-amino-9H-purin-9-yl)-ethoxy-methyl-phosphonic acid, PMEA) is active against herpesviruses, hepadnaviruses (hepatitis B), and retroviruses [
 <xref rid="B44-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Adefovir is not licensed as an HIV drug, but is currently available as an oral formulation (bis-POM PMEA) approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Adefovir belongs to the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates, in which the alkyl side chain of purines and pyrimidines is linked to a modified phosphate moiety and a C-P phosphonate linkage replaces the normal O5′-P phosphate linkage [

 <xref rid="B45-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This phosphonate bond is not hydrolysable, which makes it more difficult to cleave off these compounds once they have been incorporated at the 3′-terminal end of the elongating proviral DNA strand [
