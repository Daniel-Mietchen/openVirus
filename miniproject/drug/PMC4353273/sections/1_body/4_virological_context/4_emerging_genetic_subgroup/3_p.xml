<p>Viruses belonging to phylogenetic subgroups 3C.3, 3C.3a and 3C.2a variously contributed during the summer months (June to August), with lesser contribution of another subgroup that has not yet received separate ECDC designation (provisionally labelled here as 3C.3x). In September 2014, the WHO selected a virus within subgroup 3C.3a, represented by A/Switzerland/9715293/2013(H3N2), to be the vaccine component for the southern hemisphere’s upcoming 2015 season (
