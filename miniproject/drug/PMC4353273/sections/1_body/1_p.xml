<p>Influenza seasons dominated by A(H3N2) viruses are typically associated with greater morbidity and mortality than other types/subtypes of influenza, especially in the elderly (
 <xref rid="b1-idmm-26-e1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="b3-idmm-26-e1" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Significant genetic and antigenic differences have been identified so far in 2014–2015 among circulating A(H3N2) viruses compared with the 2014–2015 H3N2 vaccine component chosen by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the northern hemisphere (
 <xref rid="b4-idmm-26-e1" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="b5-idmm-26-e1" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). These differences between circulating viruses and the vaccine strain (called ‘antigenic drift’ or ‘vaccine mismatch’) are anticipated to have important implications for reduced vaccine protection this season. Consequently, adjunct protective measures, such as antiviral medications, may require greater emphasis and expanded use in responding to LTCF outbreaks this season.
