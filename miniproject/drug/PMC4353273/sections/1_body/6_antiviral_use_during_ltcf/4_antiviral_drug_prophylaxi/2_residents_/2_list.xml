  <p>Upon diagnosis of an influenza outbreak, all residents becoming ill should be treated (vide supra) while all non-ill residents regardless of whether they have received the current seasonal vaccine should be started on chemoprophylaxis with either oseltamivir or zanamivir.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>Generally, it is preferable to wait to initiate chemoprophylaxis until laboratory confirmation has been received.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>The prophylactic doses are oseltamivir 75 mg PO once daily or zanamivir two inhalations once daily for adults. The prophylactic dose for oral oseltamivir for infants three months to younger than one year of age is 3 mg/kg once daily. Prophylaxis is not recommended for infants younger than three months of age. The dosages for children one year of age and older vary by the weight of the child: 30 mg once a day for children who weigh 15 kg or less, 45 mg once a day for children who weigh more than 15 kg and up to 23 kg, 60 mg once a day for those who weigh more than 23 kg and up to 40 kg, and 75 mg once a day for those who weigh more than 40 kg. Zanamivir is approved for children seven years of age and older (two inhalations once daily).</p>
