  <p>Antiviral prophylaxis recommendations should be reinstituted whenever an outbreak is declared even for the same subtype and within the same setting and season. The maximum duration of continuous prophylaxis should be eight weeks, but outbreaks managed with antivirals should generally be terminated well within this period. In the unusual event that the outbreak is more prolonged, control measures should be reassessed in consultation with the local Medical Officer of Health and other experts.</p>
