<p id="p0130">In summary, we are facing a terrible virus with greater infectivity than the SARS-CoV pandemic of 2003. There is presently no vaccine or documented specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug regimen to treat critically ill patients. Most of the potential drugs for treatment of COVID-19 are being investigated for safety and efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir is the most promising agent. In addition, favipiravir and combination therapy with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin appear to be acceptable alternatives for treatment of COVID-19 patients. For patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, ACE inhibitor and ARB need to be prescribed with caution. Compared with NSAIDs, acetaminophen might be a safer agent for treating fever in COVID-19 patients. Finally, low-dose steroid (hydrocortisone) might be prescribed for treatment of refractory shock in patients with COVID-19.</p>
