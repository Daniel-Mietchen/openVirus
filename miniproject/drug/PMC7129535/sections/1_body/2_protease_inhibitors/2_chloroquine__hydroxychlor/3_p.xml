 </xref> Furthermore, azithromycin is thought to have good potential in preventing severe respiratory tract infections among pre-school children when it is administrated to patients suffering viral infection.

 </xref> According to one recent study, azithromycin (500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg per day on day 2–5) was shown to significantly reinforce the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (200 mg three times per day for 10 days) in the treatment of 20 patients with severe COVID-19. Mean serum hydroxychloroquine concentration was 0.46 ± 0.20 μg/mL. The good clinical outcome among these COVID-19 patients was thought to be due to the excellent efficiency of virus elimination after administration of this combination therapy.

 </xref> Consequently, the regimen of hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin might be a promising alternative to remdesivir in the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the future. Nevertheless, the possibility of complicated QTc prolongation should be concerned.
