<p id="p0050">Despite discouraging results, it is intriguing that a slightly lower number of deaths was observed in the group receiving LPV/RTV in the late stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the standard-care group. Moreover, Baden and Ruben (2020) and Sheahan et al. (2020) suggested that the LPV/RTV concentration necessary to inhibit pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 replication might be higher than the serum level.

 </xref> A randomized, controlled open-label trial was launched in China to evaluate the efficacy of LPV/RTV (200/50 mg twice a day) among hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections in 2020 (ChiCTR2000029308). The role of darunavir (Janssen Pharmaceutica, Beerse, Belgium), also a promising PI against SARS-CoV-2
