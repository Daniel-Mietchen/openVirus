<p id="p0010">In December 2019, Wuhan city (the capital city of Hubei province, China) experienced a major outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus. This outbreak was found to be caused by a novel virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Numerous clinical SARS-Co-2 cases have been reported and were distributed among more than half of the countries of the world during a less than 6-month period (data till March 28, 2020).

 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets at the early stage of this disease.

 </xref> Subsequently, patients suffered acute respiratory distress syndrome for about 7–10 days after the onset of COVID-19 due to rapid viral replication, a stormy increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as chemokine response, and inflammatory cell infiltrates.

 </xref> In order to contain SARS-CoV-2 spread among community residents, stringent infection control measures were implemented by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention of Taiwan since February, 2020. According to an investigation by To et al. (2020),
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>15</sup>
 </xref> patients with SARS-CoV infection had the highest viral load (measured from posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples) close to when they presented. To et al. concluded that since viral load had already peaked around the time of hospital admissions, early use of potent antiviral agents might be beneficial in controlling COVID-19 severity.

 </xref> However, standard treatment against COVID-19 is presently lacking. Herein, the roles of several drugs including antiviral agents, some antibiotics and anti-inflammatory agents have been reviewed to explore their efficacy in combating the SARS-CoV-2 (data until March 28, 2020).
