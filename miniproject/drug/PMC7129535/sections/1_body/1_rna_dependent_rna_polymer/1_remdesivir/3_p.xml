<p id="p0025">In a mouse model investigating the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV, prophylactic and early therapeutic post-exposure administration of remdesivir were shown to produce a significant reduction in pulmonary viral load (i.e., &gt;2 orders of magnitude on day 2–5 post-infection), mitigate disease progression and prominently improve respiration function.

 </xref> Furthermore, Brown et al. observed that remdesivir displayed half-maximum effective concentrations (EC
 <sub>50</sub>s) of 0.069 μM for SARS-CoV, and 0.074 μM for MERS-CoV in tissue culture models.

 </xref> In addition, tissue culture experiments also revealed that many highly divergent CoV including the endemic human CoVs (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E) and zoonotic CoV are effectively inhibited by remdesivir within the submicromolar EC
 <sub>50</sub>s.

 </xref> Of note, the similar efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir treatment (24 h prior to inoculation, and 12 h post-inoculation, respectively) was also seen in the context of a non-human primate (rhesus macaque) model of MERS-CoV infection.

 </xref> Although two amino acid substitutions (F476L, V553L) in the non-structural protein 12 polymerase were demonstrated to confer low-level resistance to remdesivir, this resistance also impaired the fitness of the tested CoVs and is actually difficult to select.
