<p>Our analysis has several limitations. Given the adverse effects associated with the drugs, enrollment in the study was terminated early. Since the expected sample size was not achieved, our study was underpowered to detect important differences in treatment efficacy. However, despite a smaller sample size, a statistically and clinically significant difference in DAA tolerability was evident, which was our primary outcome measure. Second, our study was also underpowered to detect any differences among important sub-populations, such as patients with cirrhosis or women. Additionally, the FDA approved two new DAAs, namely sofosbuvir and simprevir in the fall of 2013, both of which showed better efficacy and a more favorable side effect profile than the first generation DAAs. Given the availability of these newer DAAs and the impending approval of these drugs for use by the VHA formulary, we felt that it was unnecessary to continue treating patients with either telaprevir or boceprevir. Nevertheless, our trial underscores the need for pragmatic RCTs as they help us get a better, real-world understanding of the comparative efficacy and tolerability of drugs that have hitherto only been compared against placebo.</p>
