<p>Pragmatic RCTs are a methodologically rigorous way of studying comparative effectiveness in an unselected population.[
 <xref rid="pone.0163945.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Availability of such head-to-head RCT data become even more important when the side-effect profiles of the drugs in question are questionable. Although boceprevir compared to telaprevir appeared attractive from an acquisition cost perspective, implementing such guidance without comparative evidence for effectiveness and harms, especially given the high cost of late-stage complications, may not always lead to the desired and predicted cost savings. Initial drug selection for formulary inclusion based on drug acquisition cost can be a reasonable strategy; however, subsequent comparative effectiveness trials provide an ideal strategy to ensure long-term cost-effective prescribing, particularly when drug unit costs are high.
