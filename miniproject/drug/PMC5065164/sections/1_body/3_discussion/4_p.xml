<p>Most (~93%) veterans with chronic HCV in Veterans Affairs (VA) care are 50 years or older, and more than a third are older than 60 years. As a result, hepatitis C is an important disease of aging; especially since older patients typically have lower tolerability thresholds to antivirals. Therefore, we felt it was necessary to collect reliable, low risk-of-bias data about HCV therapies made available following regulatory approval in order to select the more tolerable and effective option to prevent the development of complications of untreated HCV infection.</p>
