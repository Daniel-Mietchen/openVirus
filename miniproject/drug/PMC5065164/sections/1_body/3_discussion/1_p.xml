<p>Compared to boceprevir, use of telaprevir in standard triple antiviral regimens within a Midwestern VA patient population was associated with a significantly higher rate of severe adverse events (treatment toxicity) leading to treatment discontinuations. Treatment efficacy rates were not significantly different between the two treatment groups, but both telaprevir and boceprevir showed substantially lower viral cure rates than observed in the registration trials. Cost of treatment per cure was substantially higher for telaprevir when compared to boceprevir.</p>
