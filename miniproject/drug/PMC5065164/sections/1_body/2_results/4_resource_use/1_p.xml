<p>Patients in the boceprevir group had on average 13 outpatient visits related to their HCV treatment vs. 9 outpatient visits for those in the telaprevir group (mostly due to the high percentage of early terminations associated with telaprevir). Mean cost of standard triple therapy per patient with boceprevir and Peg-IFN/RBV and routine care was $18,670 ($7,958 –$32,877) in comparison to $26,962 ($363 –$30,505) per patient in the telaprevir and Peg-IFN/RBV group.</p>
