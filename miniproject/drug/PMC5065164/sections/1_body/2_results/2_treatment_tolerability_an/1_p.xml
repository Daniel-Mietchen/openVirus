<p>Higher rates of treatment discontinuations and/or severe PI associated AEs were seen in 10 of 25 (40%) patients randomized to telaprevir compared to 2 of 25 (8%) patients randomized to boceprevir (RR: 5; 95% CI: 1.2, 20; p&lt;0.01). Eight patients discontinued telaprevir treatment early due to toxicity (mostly due to rashes); one patient required hospitalization due to progressive maculopapular rash, and another developed severe anemia (Hb â‰¤8 g/dL). Of the two patients on boceprevir who stopped treatment early, one experienced a severe rash and the other had severe dysgeusia.</p>
