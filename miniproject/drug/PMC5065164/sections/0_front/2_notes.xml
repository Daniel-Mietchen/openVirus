 <title>Data Availability</title>
 <p>Since the study involved veterans and was conducted in a federal treatment facility, there are legal restrictions prohibiting us from making the minimal data set publicly available. De-identified data may be made available from the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Institutional Data Access for researchers who meet the criteria for access to confidential data. Interested researchers may contact the corresponding author of the manuscript for further information on getting access to this dataset if needed.</p>
