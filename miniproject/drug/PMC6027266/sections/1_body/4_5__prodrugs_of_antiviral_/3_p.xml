<p>Recently, we proposed a new prodrug strategy of antiviral drugs demonstrating that the ester conjugation of zidovudine (AZT) with ursodeoxycholic acid, a bile acid which can permeate the CNS, results in a prodrug (UDCA–AZT) able to elude the AET transporters whose AZT is a substrate in cell monolayers showing epithelial barrier features [

These data suggest that the conjugation of antiviral drugs with bile acids may constitute a new strategy in order to elude, without inhibiting, the AET systems that normally preclude the entry of the antiretroviral drugs in HIV sanctuaries. In this regard, we have very recently confirmed that UDCA–AZT is able to permeate and remain in murine macrophages with an efficiency which is twenty times higher than that of AZT [

The aspects regarding brain targeting following nasal administration of antiviral drugs or their prodrugs will be discussed in the following sections.
