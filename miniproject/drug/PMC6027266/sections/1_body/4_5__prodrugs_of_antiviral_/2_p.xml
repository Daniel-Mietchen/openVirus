<p>Knowledge of the structure–activity relationships (SAR) of ABC efflux pumps should be necessary for a prodrug approach, but, in general, the AET systems are characterized by multiple binding sites and do not interact with their substrates in a lock-and-key manner, so their activity cannot be readily evaluated by classic Michaelis–Menten kinetics [

 <xref rid="B68-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. A first SAR approach in order to obtain antiviral prodrugs able to inhibit AET efflux activity was proposed by Namanja and co-workers [

Taking into account that P-gp shows a large and fluid binding cavity, the HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor abacavir was converted into a dimeric prodrug able to act as a potent P-gp inhibitor and revert to the monomeric form upon entry into cells overexpressing the efflux transporter. The tether length between the abacavir molecules in the prodrug dimers was able to modulate their inhibitory potency in two different cell lines, in particular, a human brain capillary endothelial cell line expressing endogenous levels of P-gp and a P-gp overexpressing CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-lymphocyte cell line [

The approach of dimeric prodrugs as AET inhibitors could be interesting, as selective targeting of the prodrugs may be obtained in the central nervous system where it seems reasonable to hypothesize they can easily reach therapeutic concentrations in the cells acting as HIV reservoirs.
