<p>Human Immunodeficiency Virus type-1 (HIV-1) belongs to the lentivirus family. It displays a long latency period and a slow progressive disease culminating in severe immune deficiencies together called acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) [

 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes, causing a severe drop in their immune effector functions. Moreover, HIV-1 shows long-term persistence in monocytes that can easily enter the CNS across the bloodâ€“brain barrier (BBB), where they differentiate in macrophages that are known to harbor and replicate the virus [

Indeed, despite the fact that antiretroviral therapies are widely used in the treatment of AIDS and that their administration dramatically reduces viral loads in HIV patients, the eradication of the virus from the HIV sanctuaries cannot be obtained since the drugs are unable to reach them with therapeutic concentrations [

Currently, the guidelines of the Department of Health and Human Services for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents living with HIV indicate several combination-based regimens using antiretroviral drugs belonging to mechanistic classes that include nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), a CCR5 antagonist, such as maraviroc, or integrase inhibitors (INs), such as dolutegravir [

 <xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It is important to remark that long-term exposure to high doses of anti-HIV drugs, in order to try to enhance their uptake in HIV sanctuaries, can cause severe side effects, such as lipodystrophy, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [
