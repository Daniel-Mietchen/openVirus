<p>The first AET inhibitors were discovered about 30 years ago when the enhancement of the cytotoxicity of some anticancer drugs induced by verapamil (a vasodilator) and cyclosporin A (an immunosuppressant) was revealed. These drugs were indeed able to reverse the overexpression effects of P-gp. However, an important obstacle related to this type of inhibitor was the very high concentration required to inhibit P-gp, since they were not specifically designed to be inhibitors of efflux transporters. The high concentrations of inhibitors induced severe unwanted effects when their distribution was ubiquitous in the body. As a consequence, this “first-generation” of inhibitors could not be used in clinical trials [

Analogs of first-generation inhibitors were obtained as a “second generation” of inhibitors (such as valspodar), which were characterized by higher inhibitory activity and the absence of therapeutic targets other than the targeted transporters. However, also in this case, patients suffered severe unwanted side effects following their administration, which were likely due to their pharmacokinetic interactions with the drugs [

Finally, a “third generation” of AET inhibitors (such astariquidar, zosuquidar, and laniquidar), which was characterized by very high potency and the absence of drug metabolic interactions, was not confirmed as being deprived of severe unwanted effects when administered to patients, probably as a result of their ubiquitous activity on the cells of the body [
