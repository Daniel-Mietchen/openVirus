<p>In addition to chitosan, papaverine (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor) has also been considered for its action on tight junctions of nasal mucosa. In particular, after intranasal administration to rats, papaverine appeared to be able to induce a rapid and transient decrease in the tight junction protein-phosphorylated occludin in the olfactory epithelium. This phenomenon was associated with an approximately four-fold increase in the amounts of gemcitabine (chosen as a model drug) reaching the brain, which was explained by transient dephosphorylation of occludin following disassembly of the tight junctions in the cytoplasm of mucosal cells [
