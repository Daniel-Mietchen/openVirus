<p>Chitosan is a cationic polysaccharide obtained from the deacetylation of chitin, a polymer abundant in cretaceous organisms. Chitosan is currently known for its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low toxicity, and is therefore used in several pharmaceutical applications [
 <xref rid="B100-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Chitosan appears to be promising for nasal delivery, as it is able to bind to the nasal mucosal membrane inducing an increase in the retention time of formulations which contain it. Indeed, the positively charged amino groups of chitosan effectively interact with the anionic groups of the mucous layers [
