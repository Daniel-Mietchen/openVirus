<p>According to the Center for Laboratory Control of Infectious Diseases in KCDC, the upper limit of Ct value for positive RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 is 35, and the negative criterion is Ct value 37 or higher. In this case report, it is difficult to determine that the test result is positive because the Ct value is 35.66 on day 10, the day of the antiviral treatment. If there was a virus, it would have remained a very low titer. Since LPV/r was administered during the virus titer reduction from 30.71 (day 9) to 35.66 (day 10), I think two consecutive negative results are more likely to be due to the natural history of the disease than to antiviral agents. Furthermore, the authors did not explain why Ct values are consistently detected near positive criteria from day 4 of treatment despite the continued use of antiviral agents.</p>
