<p>The authors say they do not know whether the decrease in virus titer is a natural course or antiviral effect, or both. However, the authors are making a leap of logic that LPV/r administration reduces viral load. Also, the authors explain that LPV/r administration has also improved clinical symptoms. However, The fever has already been falling from the day before, and the cough lasted for few more days. Since LPV/r was given to patients on day 10, it could not be regarded as being administered in the early stages of the disease. However, the authors argue that antivirals should be given early in the disease, based on this case. For the reasons described so far, it is difficult to say that LPV/r lowers the virus level or improves symptoms or is "recommended" for COVID-19 treatment based on this case report alone.</p>
