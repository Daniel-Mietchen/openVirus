   <bold>Effect of LiCl treatment on CVB3 attachment and entry</bold>.(A–B) Different concentrations of LiCl were mixed with CVB3 (MOI = 10), and then the mixture was treated into HeLa cells and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing with PBS, HeLa cells were cultured in the medium at 37 °C for 24 h. The relative RNA level of CVB3 was assessed by Q-PCR (A) and VP1 expression was detected by Western blot (B). (C–D) HeLa cells were co-treated with LiCl and CVB3 at 37 °C for 1 h and washed by PBS. Cells were cultured at 37 °C for 24 h. The level of CVB3 RNA was detected by Q-PCR (C) and cell lysates were collected and analyzed VP-1 expression by Western blot (D).
