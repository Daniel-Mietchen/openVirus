   <bold>Effect of LiCl treatment on CVB3 infection</bold>.(A–B) HeLa cells were infected with CVB3-eGFP(MOI = 10). After 1 h, cells were washed by PBS and then treated with different concentrations of LiCl for 24 h. (A) The GFP
   <sup>+</sup> cells were photomicrographs were captured under a fluorescence microscope. (B) TheGFP fluorescence and GFP
   <sup>+</sup> cell number were analyzed by flow cytometer. (C–D) HeLa cells were infectedwith CVB3 (MOI = 10) for 1 h. After washing with PBS, cells were treated with LiCl for 24 h. (C) TheRNA level of CVB3 was determined by Q-PCR. (D) Protein level of CVB3 VP1 was determined by Western blot.
