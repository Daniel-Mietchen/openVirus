<p id="p0065">About 6–8 weeks-old male BALB/c mice (16–18g) received an intraperitoneal injection of 1500 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> (1050 pfu) dose of CVB3. The body weight and survival of mice were measured at the end of the test. After 3 and 7 days following infection, heart tissues were obtained for the detection of histology analysis, virus RNA and cytokines. The details of histology tests are as described before [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Severity of myocarditis was evaluated from five sections per heart by using a 1 to 5 scoring system: grade 0, no inflammation; grade 1, less than 10% of the heart section is involved; grade 2, 10–30%; grade 3, 30–50%; grade 4, 50–90%; grade 3, more than 90%. To evaluate the effect of LiCl on viral myocarditis, each mouse was infected intraperitoneally with CVB3 after which they were divided into two groups (8–10 mice/group), PBS and LiCl treatments. Considering the effective dose of LiCl in cells (10–50 mM), the fraction of drug absorbance through i.p. approximately 60% and the bodyweight of the mice, LiCl (100 μL, 50 mM/per mouse) were daily applied to mice i.p. upon infection.
