<p id="p0080">As previously reported, 10–60 mM was applied as nontoxic concentration range of LiCl for antiviral effect in F81 cells [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. So we firstly detected the cytotoxicity of LiCl in CVB3-replicated HeLa or 293T cells. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A and B, cell viability was &gt;90% in LiCl at 10–50 mM doses for 72 h. It has reported that LiCl could affect cell apoptosis in several tumor cell-lines. So we next analyzed the LiCl's effect on the apoptosis of HeLa or 293T cells by staining Annexin V and 7-AAD. The result of the flow cytometry revealed that compared with control, LiCl at concentrates of 30 mM and 50 mM could not induce cell apoptosis in HeLa or 293T (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C). Therefore, we chose the concentration of 50 mM as the maximum concentration of LiCl for antiviral experiments.
