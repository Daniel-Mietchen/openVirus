<p id="p0095">CVB3 infection could induce cell apoptosis and LiCl is reported to be involved with several tumor cell apoptosis. So we intended to explore the impact of LiCl on virus-induced cell apoptosis. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A, LiCl treatment had no effect on the apoptosis in normal HeLa cells but CVB3 infection could significantly induce cell apoptosis (21.4% Annexin V
 <sup>+</sup>). Notably, LiCl treatment obviously decreased CVB3-induced cell apoptosis (8.85% Annexin V
 <sup>+</sup>). The result of absolute number of Annexin V positive cells was consistent with above (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B), suggesting LiCl could protect cells against virus-induced apoptosis.
