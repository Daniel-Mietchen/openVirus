<p id="p0085">To explore the antiviral effect of LiCl on CVB3 infection, CVB3-eGFP (MOI = 10) was used to infect HeLa cells followed by treatment with a series of doses of LiCl (30 and 50 mM). As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A, a large number of GFP + cells, which reflect virus replication, were observed upon CVB3-eGFP infection, while LiCl treatment could significantly reduce the number of GFP + cells. Flow cytometry analysis further confirmed it and revealed that LiCl treatment decreased the GFP fluorescence after CVB3 infection, implying LiCl could inhibit CVB3 replication (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). Next, we measured the caspid protein level of VP-1 by Western blot and viral RNA expression by Q-PCR. These results showed that both viral RNA and VP-1 protein levels were obviously decreased by LiCl treatment (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C and D), suggesting LiCl could potentially restrict CVB3 replication in HeLa cells.
