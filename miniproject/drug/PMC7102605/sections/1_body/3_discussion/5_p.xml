<p id="p0120">So far, the antiviral properties of LiCl in viral infected-animal model have not been fully explored. We deeply explore the role of LiCl on viral myocarditis in mouse and revealed that LiCl treatment could markedly restrict virus replication in heart tissues and alleviate the inflammation within the myocardium. Here, we report that LiCl restricts the replication of CVB3 through inhibiting virus-induced cell apoptosis, thus expanding the range of LiCl targets to CVB3. Moreover, we also confirm the antiviral potential of LiCl in hearts of VMC mice and demonstrated that LiCl potently protects mice against CVB3-induced myocarditis, indicating a therapeutic target of LiCl in virus-induced inflammatory diseases.</p>
