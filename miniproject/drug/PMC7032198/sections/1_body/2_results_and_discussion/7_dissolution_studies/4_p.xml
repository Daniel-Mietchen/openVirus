<p id="p0225">The amorphous blends with cellulose derivatives significantly increased the solubility of both RTV and EFV, and the supersaturated solutions remained stable with respect to drug re-precipitation over the course of the experiment. This suggests that the polymers not only stabilized the amorphous drugs in the solid state but also helped stabilize the dissolved drugs in solution.</p>
