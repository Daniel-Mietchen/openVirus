<p id="p0255">There was an increase in the release of drugs from both nanoparticles and microparticles. RTV was released (approximately 15% from CAP Adp 0.33 and 19 % from CAP Adp 0.85) from nanoparticles within 15 min after the particles were dispersed in buffer but no drug was released from the microparticles during that time; drug release from microparticles was only observed after half an hour (
 <xref rid="f0045" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 7</xref>). The much higher specific surface area of the nanoparticles resulted in an enhanced early dissolution rate of RTV compared to the microparticles. Approximately 19% and 30% of RTV was released from CAP Adp 0.33 and CAP Adp 0.85 after five hours.
