<p id="p0215">The results from the dissolution experiment showed good enhancement of drug solution concentrations from the nanoparticles. There was an almost 10–20-fold increase in the solubility of RTV (

 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>) from cellulose derivatives compared to the crystalline drug alone. Among the cellulose derivatives, the CAP Adp 0.33 showed a smaller increase in solubility compared to the others, with respect to the free drug. However, there was not much difference in the solubility concentration among the cellulose derivatives. CMCAB showed the best results among all the polymers.
