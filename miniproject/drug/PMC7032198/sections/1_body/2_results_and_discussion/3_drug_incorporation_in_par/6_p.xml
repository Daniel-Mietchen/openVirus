<p id="p0180">All samples showed good batch-to-batch reproducibility. There was some loss of free drug during certain processing steps, such as the dialysis. Nanoparticle drug loading efficiency was comparable (88â€“96 %) for all cellulosic polymers. The cellulose derivatives are hydrophobic and are therefore able to retain more hydrophobic drug after processing. There were no significant differences between the trends for RTV and EFV loading in the particles.</p>
