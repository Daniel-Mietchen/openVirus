<p id="p0190">The microparticles were too large and too aggregated to be measured by dynamic light scattering and were instead characterized by FESEM. The microparticles formed agglomerated subunits of nearly spherical particles from 1–3 µm for CAP Adp 0.33-RTV microparticles and 2–8 µm for CAP Adp 0.85-RTV microparticles
