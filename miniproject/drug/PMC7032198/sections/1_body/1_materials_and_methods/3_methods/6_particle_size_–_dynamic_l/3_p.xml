<p id="p0080">For DLS analysis of the complexes, typically 200 µl of the nanoparticle suspension obtained from the mixer were diluted with 2 ml of deionized water. The dialyzed suspensions (1 ml) were diluted with 3 ml of deionized water and the freeze-dried powders were diluted with deionized water to a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. Trehalose was added before freezing (as a cryoprotectant) in a ratio of nanoparticles: trehalose = 1:10 to control the stability of the particles. Trehalose forms hydrogen bonds with nanoparticles during freeze drying. It is less hygroscopic, with low chemical reactivity and a high glass transition temperature 
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Therefore, it was used as a suitable cryoprotectant in this work. The suspensions were sonicated in a bath sonicator (Johnson Plastosonic, 20KHz) for 10 min before measuring particle size by dynamic light scattering.
