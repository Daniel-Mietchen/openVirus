<p id="p0105">Typically, an equivalent amount of free drug and nanoparticles was dispersed in 100 ml of potassium phosphate buffer at pH 6.8 (the pH of the human small intestine) for 5 hours at 37 °C. The apparatus used in the release experiments consisted of a beaker that was continuously shaken at 60 rpm in a water bath shaker at 37 °C. The mixture was constantly stirred at 200 rpm with a magnetic stir bar. Aliquots (0.8 ml) were withdrawn from the suspensions every 0.5 h for the first 2 hours and then every hour for 5 h. Phosphate buffer (pH 6.8, 0.8 ml) was added to maintain a constant volume after each aliquot was withdrawn. Samples were ultracentrifuged at 13,000 rpm (equivalent of 16,060 g) in an accuSpin Micro centrifuge (Fisher Scientific) for 10 min. The supernatant was recovered, and the solution concentration was determined by HPLC. The solubility studies were performed approximately 2–3 weeks after the preparation of the particles. The particles were kept in glass vials covered tightly with screw caps and stored in the refrigerator.</p>
