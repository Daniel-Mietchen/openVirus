<p id="p0090">Crystallinity of nanoparticles was evaluated by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). PXRD patterns were obtained using a Rigaku Mini Flex-II fitted with a Cu K source. The X-ray tube consists of a target material made of copper, which emits Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 A°) using a power rating of 2200 watts and an accelerating potential of 60 kV. The divergence and scattering slits were set at 1.0° and the receiving slit was at 0.1 mm. The experiment was conducted with a scan range from 10° to 40° 2θ, while the scanning speed was 4°/min.</p>
