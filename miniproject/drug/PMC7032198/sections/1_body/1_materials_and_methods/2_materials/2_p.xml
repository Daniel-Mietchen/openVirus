<p id="p0050">Tetrahydrofuran (anhydrous, ACS reagent, ≥99.0% inhibitor free, MOLYCHEM, India) was used as received. Acetonitrile (HPLC grade, &gt;95 %, MOLYCHEM, India) was used for HPLC analysis without further purification. RTV and EFV (Sigma Aldrich, India) were used without further purification. The polysaccharides were samples from the Eastman Chemical Company and the derivatives were prepared using established methods 
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Millipore water (18.2 MΩ•cm at 25 °C ultrapure) was used for all experiments. Dialysis tubing (Spectropore, cellulose ester) used for solvent removal had a molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of 25K. D-(+)-Trehalose dehydrate (Sigma Aldrich, CAS 6138-23-4, molecular weight – 378.33 g/mole) was used as a cryoprotectant against aggregation during freeze-drying. The abbreviations used in this paper for novel polymers used in this work, along with some of their properties, are presented in
