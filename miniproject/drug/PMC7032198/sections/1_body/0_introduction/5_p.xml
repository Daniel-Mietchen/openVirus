<p id="p0025">As stated before, the amorphous form of the drug requires less energy for dissolution due to a lack of crystalline lattices and thus exhibits higher bioavailability than the crystalline form. This leads to the introduction of an amorphous solid dispersion (ASD). ASDs are formed when the drug is evenly and molecularly dispersed in an amorphous polymer matrix. The drug is in the amorphous form in the matrix. ASDs are particularly interesting for many poorly soluble drugs because they offer many advantages such as faster dissolution rates and higher drug concentrations in the gastrointestinal milieu
