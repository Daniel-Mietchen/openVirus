<p id="p0015">Several possible strategies could be employed to increase the bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs, such as ionized salts addition, solid dispersions, micronization and soft gel technology 
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, there are some inherent limitations associated with these techniques such as drug-loading capacity, toxicity, biodegradability, large dosages and environmental considerations. In the recent years, nanotechnology has emerged as a promising field to address these issues
