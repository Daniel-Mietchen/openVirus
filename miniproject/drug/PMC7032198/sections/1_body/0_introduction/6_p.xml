<p id="p0030">To form an amorphous matrix of drug and polymer, polymers must possess certain properties; they must be non-toxic, miscible with the (often hydrophobic) drug and must have a trigger mechanism for drug release, such as pH sensitivity. The polymer must possess a high glass transition temperature so that the formulation can be transferred and stored for months. A high glass transition temperature indicates greater stability. The polymer must not itself have a tendency to crystallize

 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. It is preferable that the crystallinity of the drug substance be suppressed by the polymer carrier, since it can act as a seed, resulting in additional crystal growth and ultimately a reduced shelf-life for the drug formulation 
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> . To date, polymers used in pharmaceutical formulations such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) and poly(vinylpyrollidinone) PVP have been used to enhance drug solubility. However, these polymers have certain limitations, such as high water solubility, a tendency to crystallize and an inability to stabilize some active ingredients in the solid phase
