<p>Selectivity was evaluated by comparing different batches (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) of blank rat plasma with those plasma samples spiked with IS and plasma samples after oral administration of ETV to investigate potential interference at the LC peak region for ETV and IS. The linearity of the calibration curve containing seven non-zero concentrations was determined by plotting the peak area ratios of ETV to IS (analyte/IS, 
 <italic>y</italic>) against the nominal concentrations of ETV using a least squares linear regression model with weighted (1/
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>). The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was defined as the lowest possible drug concentration that was reproducibly detected. The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio at this concentration was at least 10 times higher than that of blank plasma. Precision and accuracy were assessed by performing replicate analysis of QC samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) at three concentrations of the calibration standards (0.5, 05 and 50 μg/L). This procedure was repeated using the plasma matrix on three different days to determine inter-day precision values. The accuracy of the assay was expressed as recovery of QC samples at the three concentrations following the addition of different amounts of ETV into blank plasma and extraction by protein precipitation. Apparent concentrations were calculated using the calibration curves. Extraction recovery was evaluated at three QC levels (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) by comparing mean peak areas obtained from blank plasma samples spiked before extraction with those from blank plasma samples spiked after extraction. Matrix effects were measured via comparison of the peak responses of the ETV obtained from blank plasma samples spiked after extraction to those of pure standard solutions containing ETV at the same concentration. The stability of ETV in plasma was assessed by analyzing replicate samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) spiked with standards at low, mid and high QC concentrations stored under four sets of conditions: room temperature for 4 h, in the autosampler at 10 °C for 24 h, three freeze–thaw cycles from –20 °C to 25 °C, and –20 °C for 2 weeks. ETV was considered stable if assay values were within the acceptable limits of ±15% relative standard deviation (RSD). The stability of the IS (10 μg/L) was evaluated using the same method.
