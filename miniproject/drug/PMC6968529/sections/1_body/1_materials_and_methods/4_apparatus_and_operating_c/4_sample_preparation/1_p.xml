<p>Plasma samples (50 μL) were transferred to 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes and mixed with IS working solution (40 μg/L, 50 μL) before acetonitrile (100 μL) was added for protein precipitation. After vortexing for 1 min and centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was transferred to labelled vials and a volume of 5 μL of this solution was immediately injected into UHPLC–MS/MS system for analysis.</p>
