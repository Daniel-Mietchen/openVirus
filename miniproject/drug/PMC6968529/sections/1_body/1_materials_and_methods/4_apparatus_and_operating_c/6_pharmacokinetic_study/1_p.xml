<p>The validated method was applied to the pharmacokinetic study of ETV in normal and hepatic fibrotic rats after oral administration of ETV. Twenty-four normal rats were divided into four groups of six: ETV-N, EF-0, EF-1 and EF-2. The ETV-N group was administered ETV (0.9 mg/kg) by gastric perfusion; the EF-0 group was administered 0.9 mg/kg ETV and 0.55 g/kg FZHY simultaneously; the EF-1 group received 0.9 mg/kg ETV (p.o.) 1 h after the final FZHY (0.55 g/kg) administration; the EF-2 group received 0.9 mg/kg ETV (p.o.) 2 h after the final FZHY (0.55 g/kg) administration. Twelve model rats were divided into two groups of six: ETV-M and EF-2 (

All rats were housed individually under normal conditions. Animals were fasted overnight before the experiment and they had free access to water. Venous blood samples (approximately 0.2 mL) were collected from the periorbital sinus vein into heparinized tubes before administration (0 h) and at 0.033, 0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h after dosing. The blood samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The separated serum samples were frozen in polypropylene tubes at –20 °C until pharmacokinetic analysis of ETV.
