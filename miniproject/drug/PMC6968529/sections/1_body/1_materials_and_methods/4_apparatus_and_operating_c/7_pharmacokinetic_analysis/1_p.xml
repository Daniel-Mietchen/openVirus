<p>The main pharmacokinetic parameters (apparent volume of distribution (
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>d</sub>), clearance rate (CL), mean residence time (MRT), elimination rate (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>e</sub>) and elimination half-life (
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>1/2</sub>)) were analyzed using the non-compartmental pharmacokinetics data analysis software of PK solutions 2™ (Summit Research Services, Montrose, CO). Peak plasma concentrations (
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>max</sub>) and the time to reach peak plasma concentration (
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>max</sub>) were obtained directly from the observed concentration versus time data. The areas under the plasma concentration versus time curves from zero to time 
 <italic>t</italic> (AUC
 <sub>0–</sub>
 <italic>
  <sub>t</sub>
 </italic>) and from zero to infinity (AUC
 <sub>0</sub>
 <italic>
  <sub>–∞</sub>
 </italic>) were calculated using the trapezoidal rule and with extrapolation to infinity with 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>e</sub>.
