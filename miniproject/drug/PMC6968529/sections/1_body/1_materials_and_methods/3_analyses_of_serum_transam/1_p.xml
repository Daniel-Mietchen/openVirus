<p>Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) were determined with standard kits according to the manufacturer instructions. Liver tissues were fixed with 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin and cut into 4 μm sections for staining with haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). For quantitative assessment of fibrosis, sections were stained with Sirius Red for collagen deposition. Fibrosis was staged as: stage 0, no fibrosis; stage 1, expansion of the portal tracts without linkage; stage 2, portal expansion with portal-to-portal linkage; stage 3, extensive portal-to-portal and focal portal-to-central linkage; stage 4, cirrhosis (Scheuer
