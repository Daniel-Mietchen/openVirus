<p>In this study, a fast and sensitive UHPLC–MS/MS technique was successfully applied to the determination of ETV in the plasma of rats following administration alone or in combination with FZHY. Compared with the solid-phase extraction (SPE) pre-treatment method used by Zhao et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), we established a simple, sensitive, rapid and economical method based on protein-precipitation pre-treatment. This method could be used to remove most endogenous substances and obtain a high recovery rate. The matrix effect met the requirement of biological analyses.
