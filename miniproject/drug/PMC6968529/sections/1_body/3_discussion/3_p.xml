<p>Our data could have been the result of three main effects. First, the drug–time curve suggested that the effect of FZHY on the pharmacokinetics of ETV was like that seen for food (Matthews 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Under this circumstance, FZHY could inhibit ETV absorption like that seen for food. Second, the potential drug–drug interactions of ETV are mediated by transporters. ETV is the substrate of OAT1, OAT3 and OCTs (Mandíková et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The active compounds of FZHY are transported through the small intestine after mediation by OATs such as schisandrin A, angeloylgomisin M1, schisandrol B, tigloylgomisin H and schisantherin A (Pan et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Xu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). If FZHY and ETV are administered simultaneously, FZHY could occupy absorption sites, leading to inhibition of ETV absorption. Two-hour intervals avoided competitive absorption between the two drugs, but the mechanism of action merits further study. Finally, the effects of DMN on ETV pharmacokinetics are not known. Therefore, more factors may need be considered to explain the effects of FZHY on ETV pharmacokinetics in the DMN-induced model group.
