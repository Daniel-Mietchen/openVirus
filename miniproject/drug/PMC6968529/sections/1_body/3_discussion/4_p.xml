<p>Our study had two main limitations. First, we studied only the effects of FZHY on ETV pharmacokinetics, and did not clarify its mechanism of action. Second, the animal model is quite different from the fibrosis caused by CHB infection, which may not reflect exactly the clinical situation. Therefore, more research must be carried out to clarify the interaction between ETV and FZHY.</p>
