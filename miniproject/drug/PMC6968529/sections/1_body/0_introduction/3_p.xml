<p>We developed a rapid and sensitive ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS) method to determine the ETV concentration in rat plasma. The method was applied to study the effect of FZHY on ETV pharmacokinetics in normal rats and rats suffering from hepatic fibrosis after oral administration of ETV at different time intervals. We aimed to provide a meaningful basis for developing a clinical dose regimen for the treatment of hepatic fibrosis by combination of ETV with FZHY.</p>
