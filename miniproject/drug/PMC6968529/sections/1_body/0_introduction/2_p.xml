<p>Fuzheng Huayu recipe (FZHY) is an anti-fibrotic agent approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA), and has been used widely for treating liver fibrosis caused by CHB infection (Yang, Liu, Wang, et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Yang, Liu, Zheng, et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Pharmacological studies and clinical trials have demonstrated that FZHY has a significant effect against liver fibrosis because it can inhibit activation of hepatic stellate cells, protect hepatocytes and inhibit hepatic sinusoidal capillarization (Liu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Furthermore, it has been reported that ETV combined with FZHY has a good synergistic effect for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to HBV infection, and can reduce the prevalence of adverse reactions (Suqiu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Studies have shown that ETV is not an inhibitor or inducer of cytochrome P450 in humans (Palumbo 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), but an inhibitor of some transporters: organic anions (OATs), cations (OCTs) and concentrative nucleoside (CNTs) (Mandíková et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Furthermore,

 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Conversely, it has been reported that food affects the absorption of ETV, and leads to decreases in maximum concentration (

 <sub>max</sub>) and area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) (Zhang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Hence, it is recommended that ETV is administered on an empty stomach (≥2 h before or after meals) (Matthews 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Based on these studies, it can be inferred that the pharmacokinetics of ETV may be affected by FZHY when taken together.
