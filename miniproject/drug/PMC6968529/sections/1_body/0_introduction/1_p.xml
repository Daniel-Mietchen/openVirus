<p>Entecavir (ETV), which is a cyclopentanone acid guanosine analogue (

 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Papatheodoridis et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Currently, it has become the first-line treatment recommended for adults with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) (Pawlotsky

 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Therefore, finding a therapeutic regimen that can simultaneously control HBV replication and improve hepatic fibrosis is needed.
