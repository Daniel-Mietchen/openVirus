  <p>Typical multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) chromatograms of entecavir (
   <italic>m/z</italic> 277) and IS (
   <italic>m/z</italic> 229) separated on an ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.8 μm) maintained at 40 °C and eluted with a gradient system composed of 0.1% formic acid in water and acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. A gradient programme was used as follows (time, min/acetonitrile %): 0/5, 2/15, 2.5/30, 3.2/90, 4.5/98, 4.6/5 and 6/5. (A) Blank serum sample; (B) blank plasma spiked with entecavir (500 μg/L); (C) rat plasma 30 min after oral administration of entecavir.
