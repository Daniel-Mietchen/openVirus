<p>For example, the nonstructural protein nsp14-ExoN, together with its cofactor nsp10, of 
 <italic>coronaviridae</italic> has been found to repair nucleotide mismatches caused by nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin, thus potentially negating the antiviral effect of BSAAs [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As elegantly demonstrated by Ferron 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, the nsp14-ExoN of SARS-CoV forms part of a highly flexible complex with multienzymatic properties, likely facilitating compensated low fidelity of replication. What are viable strategies to circumvent this remarkable innate ability of 
 <italic>coronaviridae</italic> to proofread their RNA and maintain genomic integrity, while allowing some degree of evolutionary freedom to mutate? Again high-throughput screening can come to the rescue here. Possibilities include compounds with affinity toward the nsp14-ExoN catalytic subunit or those with allosteric effects at critical sites with conserved residues causing conformational change of the entire viral RNA repair complex. Therefore, the hunt should now be on to identify an inhibitor of this viral nuclease.
