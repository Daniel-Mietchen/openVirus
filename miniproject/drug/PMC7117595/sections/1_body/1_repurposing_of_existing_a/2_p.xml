<p>At the Phase III level, remdesivir, a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor, is under investigation for mild and moderate SARS-CoV-2 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04252664) [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Remdesivir has activity in preclinical studies against the species of 
 <italic>coronaviridae</italic> implicated in SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Notably, it has already been studied in a randomized, controlled trial for Ebola virus disease, demonstrating an antiviral effect [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Other Phase III agents being evaluated in combination therapy for viral pneumonia interestingly include the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine, based on promising 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> data (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04261517) [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Chloroquine, in addition to its immunomodulating properties, has been shown to have antiviral activity at entry and post-entry stages of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. It can enhance the antiviral activity of remdesivir and potentially serve as a synergizer of BSAAs [
