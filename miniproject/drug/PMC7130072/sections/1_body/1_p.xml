<p id="p0015">Medication shortages, anticipated to worsen with time, affect patients with COVID-19 directly, but also pose a threat to the health and safety of patients with other diseases who do not have COVID-19. Shortages include medications that have been touted as promising therapies against COVID-19, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.

 </xref> In fact, due to off-label prescriptions and hoarding, hydroxychloroquine is now difficult to obtain for patients without COVID-19 who need this drug to manage rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders. Even more worrisome is the shortage of sedatives such as midazolam and propofol which are needed for patients who are being intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

 </xref> This impacts patients seriously ill with COVID-19, as well as patients with respiratory failure due to other causes who need critical care, and those who need emergency surgeries under general anesthesia. The active pharmaceutical ingredients for many commonly used medications come from China, and many of our generics are manufactured and imported from other countries, including India. Since the pandemic has affected manufacturing and exports worldwide, the shortages exemplified by antimicrobials and sedatives will soon impact numerous medications unrelated to the treatment of COVID-19.
