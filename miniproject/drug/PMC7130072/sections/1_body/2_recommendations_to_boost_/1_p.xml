<p id="p0020">We are exceeding capacity in terms of our vital medication supply. The usual supply chains, mechanisms, and administrative processes are inadequate for this crisis. We must act now with urgency. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must revamp its regulatory procedures and dramatically accelerate its processes to ensure that important medications are available to the public. Many of the drug shortages are going to be generic drugs. Because of various barriers for some generic drugs, we have only one or two FDA-approved versions available for sale in the United States. In contrast, in some countries in Europe and in India, each brand-name drug may have multiple generic versions made by different manufacturers. The multiplicity of manufacturers acts as a protection against shortages in these countries, and lowers cost.
