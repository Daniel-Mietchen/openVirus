<p>Concerning emerging infections, in a recent work, researchers tried to identify candidate antibiotics that can block the function of DENV viral envelope proteins to prevent viral entry. Using an innovative visual screening approach coupling computational studies and biologic assays on ten nontoxic candidates, they suggested that DOX significantly inhibited plaque formation, demonstrating an inhibitory effect on DENV propagation [

This result was confirmed by Rothan and colleagues, who evaluated the replication rate of DENV in an in vitro model of infected cells. They reported that DOX inhibited DENV replication in vitro by reducing viral protease activity and entry into host cells [

The same research group determined the inhibitory effects of DOX against CHIKV as well as its possible effect on the virus life cycle in Vero cells when the virus and the drug were administered concurrently to the cells. Computational studies indicated that DOX might be a noncompetitive inhibitor of CHIKV protease. This hypothesis was confirmed by in vitro experiments demonstrating that the effect of DOX was directed more toward viral entry than toward viral replication [

 <xref rid="B170-microorganisms-08-00085" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. The results showed significant inhibition of the replication of VSV in a dose-dependent but not cell-type dependent manner, suggesting that DOX exerted its antiviral activity at the early-mid stage of VSV infection [
 <xref rid="B170-microorganisms-08-00085" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. These results indicated a different mode of action of DOX against VSV than that against DENV and CHIKV, suggesting that the antiviral activity of DOX could be dependent on the virus species. Finally, only an in vivo study was published on IAV. Treatment with DOX attenuated acute lung injury in mice infected with a virulent IAV H3N2 strain, with no effects on virus titers, suggesting that the antibiotic treatment was able to alleviate severe influenza pneumonia symptoms [
 <xref rid="B171-microorganisms-08-00085" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. It is, therefore, possible to conclude that despite the role of DOX as a potential antiviral agent in vitro, the mechanisms of viral replication inhibition and the targeted virus species have yet to be clarified. Clinical trials confirming in vitro observations are needed.
