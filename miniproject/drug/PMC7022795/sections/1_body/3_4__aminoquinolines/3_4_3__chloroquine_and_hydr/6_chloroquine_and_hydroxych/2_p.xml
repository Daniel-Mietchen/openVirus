<p>CQ had inhibitory effects on the entry and replication of enterovirus (EV)-A71 in cell-based systems [
 <xref rid="B160-microorganisms-08-00085" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. Yong and colleagues studied the efficacy of CQ against several EV serotypes and evaluated its therapeutic capacity in vitro in RD cells and in vivo in a murine model [
 <xref rid="B161-microorganisms-08-00085" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. They demonstrated the potential of CQ as an antiviral in the treatment of hand, foot, and mouth disease caused by EV infection. The positive results obtained in the murine model of infection were indicative of the fact that CQ may mitigate the disease severity in mammals [
