<p>The in vitro antiviral effect of CQ was first reported approximately 40 years ago [

 <xref rid="B137-microorganisms-08-00085" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>], and since that time, its use as an antiviral drug has been extensively discussed. In particular, CQ/hydroxyCQ have been used for the treatment of emerging chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection, recently causing numerous outbreaks in the world. Khan et al. showed that the treatment of infected Vero cells with different micromolar concentrations of CQ reduced virus yield and viral RNA copy number [

The efficacy of CQ was inversely related to the concentration of the viral inoculum used, an unfavorable observation, considering the high viremia measured at the acute stage of CHIKV infection (up to 10
 <sup>10</sup> virus copies/mL serum) [
