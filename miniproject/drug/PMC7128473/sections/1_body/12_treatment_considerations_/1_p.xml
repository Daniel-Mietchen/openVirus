 </xref> Chloroquine has shown antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> through interference with the ACE2-receptor mediated endocytosis and is widely used in the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 as monotherapy, but also in combination with azithromycin.

 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> The administration of any of these compounds to infected patients will remain an individual decision as efficacy and optimal timing remain to be clarified. However, with regards to patients with chronic liver disease, possible adverse events have to be kept in mind. This is particularly important with respect to drug-interactions in patients with certain immunosuppressive therapies where drug levels of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus or everolimus will have to be closely monitored. In addition, patients with impaired liver function are at high risk of drug toxicities, 
 <italic>i.e.</italic> in patients with Child-Pugh B/C cirrhosis. 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarises some considerations with regards to potential toxicities in these patients. It is also important to stress that all the drugs currently under investigation are not approved for SARS-CoV-2. However, given that early initiation of antiviral therapy is known to blunt the course of influenza, it is reasonable to assume that early treatment initiation might also be beneficial to prevent severe pneumonia in COVID-19. Thus, in patients with liver disease and risk factors for a severe course of the disease, we recommend inclusion into early antiviral treatment programmes or clinical trials that might be active at different centres.
