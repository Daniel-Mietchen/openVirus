<p id="p0040">Physical distancing has been suggested and/or officially implemented in multiple countries across the globe to prevent dissemination of SARS-CoV-2. This measure aims to prevent a rapid increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections in the general population with the overall goal of minimising the number of patients with a severe course of COVID-19 at any one time, enabling healthcare providers to maintain medical/intensive care of these patients. At the same time, vulnerable patient cohorts should be protected from individuals with potential SARS-CoV-2 exposure or infection. Thus, in these patients, the benefits of maintaining patient care have to be weighed against the risk of infection. These considerations require adaption of standard operating procedures for outpatient care, including remodelling of waiting areas to allow sufficient distance between patients, reduction of waiting times and encouraging patients to wait outside wherever possible and eventually be contacted by phone. In addition, exposure to medical staff should be minimised wherever possible.</p>
