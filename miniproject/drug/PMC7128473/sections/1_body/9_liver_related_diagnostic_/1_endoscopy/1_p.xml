 <italic>Patients without COVID-19:</italic> Depending on available resources, screening for varices by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) should be reserved for patients at risk of variceal bleeding, such as patients with a history of variceal bleeding or signs of significant portal hypertension (ascites, thrombocyte count &lt;100,000/Î¼l). Non-invasive risk assessment for the presence of varices should be applied for stratification (thrombocyte count or Baveno VI).
