 <italic>Patients with COVID-19:</italic> Endoscopic procedures are associated with an increased risk of disseminating SARS-CoV-2. During EGD or ERC, spreading of virus-containing droplets can occur. In addition, shedding of the virus in the faeces increases the risk of dissemination during colonoscopy. Thus, indications for endoscopic procedures in patients with COVID-19 should be limited to emergencies such as gastrointestinal bleeding, bacterial cholangitis or other life-threatening conditions.
