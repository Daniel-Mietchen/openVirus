<p id="p0275">The necessity to reduce travel and limit visits to specialised centres is a challenge for liver disease patients and local health care providers alike. In order to facilitate decentralised care forÂ these patients, close collaborations between specialised hepatologists and local health care providers is required. This pertains to several factors such as communication of immunosuppressive target levels in patients after liver transplantation, management of patients with severe ALT elevations of unknown aetiologies and others. Thus, we recommend that specialised centres provide easily accessible contact information for local health care providers to facilitate fast and uncomplicated collaboration for the benefit of patients with liver diseases.</p>
