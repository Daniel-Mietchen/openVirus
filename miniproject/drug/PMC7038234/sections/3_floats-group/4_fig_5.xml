   <sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Vero cells infected with JEV AT31 were treated with increasing concentrations of NaCl (A and C) and KCl (B and D) at 1 h preinfection. At 24 h postinfection, cell supernatants were collected for the plaque assay. Data are represented as the means ± SDs from at least three independent experiments. ****,
