<p>To address the urgent need for anti-JEV therapy, we presented a library of natural extracts to check for the ability to inhibit JEV infection. Our high-content screening assay design could identify compounds that inhibit JEV viral entry, translation, and RNA synthesis. In this study, eight hit compounds with SI indexes greater than 10 were found to exert inhibitory effects on JEV. Among these eight compounds, some were previously reported to possess a wide spectrum of pharmacological effects, including antiviral activity. Moreover, some compounds, such as lycorine, emodin, and procyanidin, have been proven to be effective in inhibiting flavivirus or HCV infections via different mechanisms (
