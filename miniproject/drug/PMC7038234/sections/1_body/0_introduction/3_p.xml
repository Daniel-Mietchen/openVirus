<p>To address the urgent need for anti-JEV therapy, a high-content screen (HCS) assay was performed with a library of 1,034 natural extracts, which contains untapped reservoirs of potent and novel inhibitors and activators of biological pathways, for discovering inhibitors against JEV infection. Two hit FDA-approved compounds, ouabain and digoxin, were identified to inhibit JEV infection both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. The results of this study are expected to contribute to our understanding of the biology of JEV infection and provide novel host targets for the development of anti-JEV drugs.
