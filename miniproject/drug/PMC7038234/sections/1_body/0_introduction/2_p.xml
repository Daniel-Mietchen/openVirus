<p>JEV has been a global health concern since it was first discovered in the late 19th century (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), with an estimated 68,000 clinical cases and 10,000 to 15,000 associated deaths per year (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). JEV infection-related clinical symptoms include fever, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, mental status changes, and signs of meningeal irritation (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>); the ratio of survival with psychiatric sequelae or permanent neurological is approximately 44% (
