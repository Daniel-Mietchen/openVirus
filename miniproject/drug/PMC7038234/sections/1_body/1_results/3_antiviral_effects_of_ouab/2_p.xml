<p>Under the same conditions of infection, ouabain and digoxin robustly inhibited AT31 and SA14 virus production in a plaque assay, with a reduction of approximately 4 to 6 log units at the highest concentration (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">E</xref>). A sharp decrease in JEV RNA levels was also detected with a quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. In particular, the attenuated RNA levels of the SA14 strain in the high-dose-, middle-dose-, and low-dose-treated groups were all above 40%, indicating a strong inhibition of viral replication (
