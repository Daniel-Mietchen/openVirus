<p>As ouabain exhibited a stronger inhibitory activity on JEV infections, we further examined the protective effect of ouabain on JEV-induced lethality by using the BALB/c mouse. As anticipated, mice in the JEV-infected, vehicle-treated group started to show symptoms including limb paralysis, restriction of movement, piloerection, body stiffening, and whole-body tremor at day 5 postinfection. Within 9â€‰days of infection, all mice in the JEV-infected group succumbed to the infection. Ouabain treatment following JEV infection increased the survival rate to nearly 60% (8 out of 14 animals survived) (
