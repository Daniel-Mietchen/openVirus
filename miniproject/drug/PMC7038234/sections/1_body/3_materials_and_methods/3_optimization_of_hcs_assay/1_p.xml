<p>The cell density, infective dose, and assay endpoint were optimized for the HCS assay. Different densities (2,000 to 10,000 cells per well) of Vero cells were infected at MOI values ranging from 0.2 to 1. Cell viability was detected at different times (24 to 72 h) after JEV inoculation. The appropriate cell density, infective dose, and assay endpoint for the HCS assay were selected by comparing the signal-to-basal ratio (S/B), the coefficient of variation (CV), and
