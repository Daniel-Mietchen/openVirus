<p>Vero cells seeded in 96-well plates were treated with DMSO or either compound diluted in a medium supplemented with NaCl (at a concentration of 0, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, or 100 mM) and KCl (at a concentration of 0, 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, or 25 mM) for 1 h, respectively. Then JEV AT31 with an MOI of 0.8 was added in each well. After 1 h, the cell supernatants were removed and treated with the indicated concentration of each compound in an ion-supplemented medium for an additional 23 h, and the virus titers were determined by plaque assay using BHK-21 cells. Inhibition rates are calculated as the percentage of infected cells normalized to DMSO-treated cells for at least triplicate repeat experiments.</p>
