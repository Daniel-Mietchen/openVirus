<p>Tissue samples and blood from JEV-infected mice were extracted with the RNAprep pure tissue kit (Tiangen; catalog no. DP431) and RNAprep pure blood kit (Tiangen; catalog no. DP433), respectively. JEV RNA levels were determined by one-step qRT-PCR on ABI Real-Time PCR systems using standard cycling conditions. The viral burden was calculated on a standard curve produced using serial 10-fold dilutions of plasmids carrying the infectious clone.</p>
