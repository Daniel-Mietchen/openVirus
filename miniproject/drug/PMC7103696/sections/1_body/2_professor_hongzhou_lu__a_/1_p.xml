<p>Considering the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, the possible effective medications are in dire need to improve the prognosis of the patients and to stem the spread of the virus. More than 200 clinical trials have been organized mainly for the study of anti-viral drugs including Kaletra, Remdesivir, Arbidol, Favipiravir, Chloroquine, HCQ, Darunavir, Lianhua Qingwen Granules and Shuanghuanglian Oral Liquid. While the clinicians are enthusiastic about exploring the efficacy of these drugs, these trials are subject to all kinds of practical limitations. The majority of the trials are small in scale and repetitive in nature. For instance, a dozen clinical trials on Chloroquine have been carried out. Furthermore, due to the difference in design methodology, contradictory results may arise. The World Health Organization (WHO) has shown deep concern over the quality of these clinical trials and has provided guidance. A multitude of domestic experts also contributed their wisdom in different ways.</p>
