<p id="p0035">After the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, patients need to be admitted to designated hospitals for centralized and standardized inpatient treatment. Currently, no specific drug has been confirmed to treat COVID-19, and drugs of pre-approval access are still in ongoing clinical trials. The safety and efficacy of these medications remains unclear, and some drugs (such as lopinavir-ritonavir and arbidol) may cause serious adverse reactions. Therefore, hospital pharmacists should actively participate in making evidence-based decisions for medications, and assist clinicians in formulating and adjusting drug regimens of COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, hospital pharmacists should provide close monitoring and evaluation of medication safety and efficacy, management of drug interactions, and monitoring and management of convalescent plasma therapy. Based on the characteristics of special populations and patients with underlying diseases, pharmacists should provide strengthened pharmaceutical care services. In addition, the emotional status of COVID-19 patients is also an important factor affecting the treatment and prognosis of the disease. It's necessary for hospital pharmacists to provide COVID-19 patients with emotional counselling and psychological support. Given the importance and urgency of COVID-19 vaccine development for the control of global pandemic, hospital pharmacists should also provide vaccine-related scientific information to patients. To this end, the pharmaceutical care framework of COVID-19 hospitalized patients for hospital pharmacists was researched and constructed (see
