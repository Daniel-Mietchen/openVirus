 </xref> The plasma of convalescent utilizes a certain titer of virus-specific antibodies, through which patients receive the plasma infusion to obtain passive immunity and remove pathogens in the blood circulation. CPT is an effective therapy choice, and has been successfully applied to the treatment of SARS and H1N1 influenza.

 </xref> Before conducting CPT, pharmacists should assist clinicians in assessing patients' indications of CPT, combining with allergy history, contraindications of plasma transfusion, and individual clinical conditions. Also, the infusion dose should be formulated based on patients’ weight and clinical condition, usually ranging from 200 ml to 500 mL (4–5 mL/kg). When performing CPT, pharmacists need to closely record and monitor adverse effects of plasma transfusion before, during, and after transfusion, and cooperate with clinicians to manage adverse effects. Common adverse transfusion reactions include transfusion-related circulation overload, acute lung injury, dyspnea, allergic, hypotension, non-hemolytic febrile, acute hemolytic transfusion reactions, and delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction, infectious transfusion reaction, etc.
