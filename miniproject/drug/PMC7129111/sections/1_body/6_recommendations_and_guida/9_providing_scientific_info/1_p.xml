<p id="p0120">Vaccination is one of the most effective methods to halt the spread of COVID-19 at the global level. Pharmacists should provide patients with scientific information about vaccine development. At present, recombinant adenovirus vector vaccines Ad5-nCoV (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, NO.ChiCTR2000030906) and nucleic acid vaccine mRNA-1273 (

Pharmacists should also collect data on vaccines effectiveness and safety during pharmaceutical care if it is under the premise of medical ethics and promote the clinical research of the COVID-19 vaccines.
