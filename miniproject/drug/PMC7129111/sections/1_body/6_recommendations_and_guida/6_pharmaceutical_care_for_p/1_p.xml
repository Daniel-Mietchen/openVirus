<p id="p0105">COVID-19 patients with combined underlying diseases (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), malignancy, bacterial or fungal infections and organ transplantation, etc.) are prone to disease progress. Medication regimens for those patients are more complicated in general.

 </xref> There are many interactions between antiviral drugs and other symptomatic drugs, and medication efficacy and safety may be affected. Pharmacists should strengthen pharmaceutical care for those patients with combined underlying diseases. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) should be strengthened, such as lopinavir-ritonavir and anti-infective drugs (voriconazole). Clinical indicators (INR, blood glucose and blood pressure) should be monitored closely and dosage should be adjusted if necessary, for example, ribavirin may reduce the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, lopinavir-ritonavir may worsen diabetes and enhance the anti-hypertensive effect of nifedipine.
