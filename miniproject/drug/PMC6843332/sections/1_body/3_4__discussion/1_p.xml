<p>Many dsDNA viruses utilize a motor to package their DNA into an empty capsid and, therefore, may be classified under type II DNA-packaging. However, the exact mechanism of the DNA packaging with detailed movements of the machinery are unknown. Most dsDNA viruses contain packaging proteins that are composed of two separate domains, an ATPase domain as well as a DNA-binding/nuclease domain. These two functions are linked together, which is necessary for proper DNA packaging to occur. Several hypotheses were formulated to try to answer this question. One popular theory involves the idea that proteins in the packaging motor push the DNA into the capsid in a linear manner. Considering the linear hypothesis, it is believed that the protein utilizes the hydrolysis of ATP to clamp onto the DNA and push it up into the empty capsid [

Once the DNA is bound, the DNA-binding domain moves the viral DNA closer to the ATPase domain of the same protein. A conformational change takes place in the ATPase domain, prepping the ATPase active site for hydrolysis. The subsequent hydrolysis of ATP causes another conformational change that moves the DNA-binding domain in such a way that it pushes the viral DNA into the capsid. When ADP and Pi are released, the DNA-binding domain releases the DNA and returns to its original conformation. When the DNA is released from the DNA-binding domain, it ends up being bound to the DNA-binding domain of an adjacent subunit [
