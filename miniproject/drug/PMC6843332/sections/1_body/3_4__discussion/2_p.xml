<p>A second hypothesis, the rotation theory, states that the DNA is packaged into the capsid with a screw-like motion as the packaging proteins rotate to facilitate this motion. More specifically, it refers to the possibility of a connecter protein in the packaging motor rotating around the viral DNA and, therefore, using this movement to screw the DNA into the capsid. However, more recent studies suggest that dsDNA viruses are unlikely to utilize the rotational mechanism. It was reported that rotational motors have relatively small channels that are typically smaller than the width of dsDNA, so when the DNA goes through that channel, it would require the dsDNA to split into ssDNA [

This means that rather than the proteins rotating to push the DNA through, the proteins are relatively stationary and the DNA revolves around the channel due to the backbone interactions with the walls of the channel. Revolution motors have been found to have diameters larger than the width of dsDNA, allowing the DNA to go through the revolving mechanism [
