<p>Proteins directly involved in the propagation of the concatemeric viral DNA into the capsid have a significant potential as drug targets due to their essential role in the formation of new virus particles. Out of all of the packaging proteins, terminase proteins maintain the crucial functions of utilizing ATP hydrolysis to push the DNA into the capsid and cleave it once packaging is complete. This makes them promising drug targets because there are multiple functions that may be disturbed to prevent the completion of virus particles. Using this information, the hinge region of pUL15, connecting the DNA and ATP binding domains, is an attractive allosteric target. While targeting DNA- and ATP- binding sites may inhibit the function of this protein, these binding pockets are not unique to the virus. Therefore, we hypothesize that the hinge region can provide an allosteric target to alter the conformational change in pUL15, preventing the movement of the dsDNA into the capsid. It is a favorable site for drug design as multiple HHVs share the same feature in their packaging motor, yet it is specific to the virus and absent in host proteins.</p>
