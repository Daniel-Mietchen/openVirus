<p>Through evolutionary analysis, we determined that focusing on HHV-1 would be the most effective for targeted drug development, not just because it is the most abundant form of HHV, but also because it is closely related to the other HHVs. Our findings suggest that the most ideal target would be the packaging motor due to its crucial role in the lifecycle of the virus and a high conservation throughout all herpesviridae. The rate of change analysis revealed that the large terminase pUL15 is the most conserved, not just in the packaging motor, but in all of the viral proteins. Since only a partial experimental structure of this protein is available currently, we constructed a full-length model to analyze its molecular functions. Using this model, we were able to confidently identify putative ATP and DNA binding sites. Additionally, we used the Gaussian network model to predict the correlation between residue fluctuations, which not only supported the presence of two distinct domains in the protein, but also revealed a hinge region between the ATP- and DNA-binding domains. Further, the anisotropic network model was used to observe the probable movements of the protein and indicated that the HHV-1 packaging motor likely utilizes a revolutionary mechanism to package DNA., It will be a promising target for antiviral drugs against HHVs if the predicted hinge region can be confirmed in subsequent studies.</p>
