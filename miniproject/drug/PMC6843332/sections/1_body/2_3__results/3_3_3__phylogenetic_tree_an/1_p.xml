<p>The highly conserved nature of pUL15 suggests that it should have similarities to its counterparts in other human herpes viruses. The phylogenetic analysis shows the level of similarity amongst HHV-1 UL15 and its human herpes virus homologs within the context of the phylogenetic tree visualized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00603-f003">Figure 3</xref>. As expected, HHV-1 UL15 is related most closely to the HHV-2 UL15 homolog. It is noteworthy that HHV-1 and HHV-2 together infect nearly 80% of the world population [

 <xref rid="B86-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Our research is focused on HHV-1 as it is the more common of the two viruses affecting 48% of the United States population [
 <xref rid="B87-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. HHV-1 and HHV-2, however, are closely related, with an over 80% sequence similarity of their protein-coding regions. HHV-1 also is closely related to the other human herpes viruses, as well as those herpes viruses affecting high-value domesticated animals in the agriculture industry. The close relationship between UL15 homologs of HHV-1 and the other human herpes virus protein sequences is evident by the fact that all of these viruses form a monophyletic clade in the tree. However, the short branch lengths of the tree indicate that, overall, there is a high level of similarity between all of the sequences. The relationship between UL15 in HHV-1 and its homologs suggest that UL15 is indeed a good candidate for creating a structure model, which also can be applied to other closely related proteins.
