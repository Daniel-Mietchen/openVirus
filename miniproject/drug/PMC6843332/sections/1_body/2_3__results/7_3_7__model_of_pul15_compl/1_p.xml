<p>The 
 <italic>e</italic>FindSite prediction strongly indicates that the putative binding site accommodates ATP. To further investigate this finding, a pUL15-ATP complex was modeled with 
 <italic>e</italic>SimDock. Encouragingly, 
 <italic>e</italic>SimDock reported a fitness score of 0.51, a binding probability of 0.84, and an estimated p
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> of 6.11. These scores corroborate the 
 <italic>e</italic>FindSite prediction that ATP is the likely ligand of the predicted binding site. The ATP molecule that was docked contained a few minor clashes between the ligand and the protein, which may account for the somewhat low fitness score. To remove the clashes, binding residues within 4.5 Å from any ATP atom were remodeled in the presence of ATP. The analysis of the ATP binding pose in the refined pUL15-ATP complex reveals a hydrogen bond between a phosphate moiety and K283, and numerous hydrophobic contacts with residues D243, A244, F256, F279, G281, I282, and I284 (

 <xref rid="B90-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] between the binding pockets of g17 and pUL15 is only 0.27 indicating a limited binding residue conservation. To determine how the binding energy of the modeled pUL15-ATP complex compares to other protein-ATP complexes, DFIRE scores were calculated for the modeled complex and a dataset of 1553 other protein-ATP complexes. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00603-f008">Figure 8</xref> shows that the mean DFIRE score for experimental protein-ATP complexes is −311.35, whereas values at the first, second, and third quartiles are −363.31, −309.00, and −256.62, respectively. The DFIRE score for the modeled pUL15-ATP complex is −255.13, which corresponds to the upper range of the third quartile of the distribution of DFIRE scores across protein-ATP complexes. This shows that the interaction energy between the ATP molecule and pUL15 is comparable to that in many experimental complex structures involving ATP.
