<p>To create a full-length model of pUL15, a partial crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of pUL15 was used, whereas the N-terminal domain was modeled based on the DNA packaging protein gp17 from enterobacteria phage T4. Gp17 was chosen due to its high homology to the N-terminal domain of pUL15. To construct an accurate model, the two templates were oriented properly by superimposing the templates onto another structure of T4 gp17 (3cpe), shown as gray ribbons in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00603-f004">Figure 4</xref>A) onto 3cpe yielded a Cα-RMSD of 1.34 Å and a 100% sequence identity over the aligned region. The superimposition of 4iox (purple ribbons in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00603-f004">Figure 4</xref>A) onto 3cpe yielded a Cα-RMSD of 3.21 Å and a 10% sequence identity over the aligned region. Similarity scores obtained for 2o0j superposition onto 3cpe indicate a more successful alignment because 2o0j is actually a partial structure of 3cpe. The differences that are evident in the superimposition most likely can be attributed to the conformation that 2o0j takes when it is bound to ATP, as opposed to the conformation in the unbound form. While the scores obtained for 4iox do not show a high similarity to 3cpe, the purpose of this superimposition was simply to orient the templates with respect to each other. The generated model covers residues 127–735 due to the lack of suitable templates to model the first 126 amino acids of pUL15. The model of pUL15 subsequently was subjected to a series of analyses to gain insights into its dynamics and function.
