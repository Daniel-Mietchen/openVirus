<p>To grasp the amount of research focused on HHV compared to HIV and influenza, we assessed trends in the number of papers indexed by PubMed concerning these viruses. We also looked at how many of these studies utilized computational methods in their research. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00603-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows that the number of papers reporting computational research consistently remains fewer than the number of studies employing in vivo or in vitro methods for all three viruses. This is expected, as in vitro and in vivo techniques are traditionally the primary methods for approaching virology research. Even so, the rapid development of technology in genomics and computational science has resulted in more reliable and useful tools that can be used for making relatively accurate predictions to facilitate in vitro and in vivo studies. Essential information for better understanding viruses, including viral structures, interactions, and evolution, which can be used to help develop strategies to combat viruses [
