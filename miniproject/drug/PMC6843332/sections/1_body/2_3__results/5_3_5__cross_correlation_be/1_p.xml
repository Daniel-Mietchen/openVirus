<p>To further investigate the distinct domains of pUL15 with respect to their motions, a cross-correlation heat map was generated based on the elastic network model using the DynOmics online server [
 <xref rid="B79-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00603-f005">Figure 5</xref> clearly shows that there are two distinct areas where residue movements are correlated (red color). The first region corresponds to the ATP binding domain (residues 127–466), and the second region corresponds to the DNA binding region (residues 488–735). Moreover, the two domains show anti-correlated movement (blue color), which can generate the force necessary to push or screw the DNA. The heat map also reveals a hinge region that connects the two domains at residues 467–487. We predict that the functions of both domains may rely on the movement of the hinge region (colored in green in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00603-f004">Figure 4</xref>B), therefore, we expect this hinge region to be a potential allosteric site for drug development.
