<p>A putative binding site in the pUL15 model was predicted by 
 <italic>e</italic>FindSite with a 97.9% confidence. This site is comprised of residues A244, A245, V246, T254, V255, L257, R260, F279, R280, G281, I282, K283, I284, G285, and G319, which are highlighted in cyan in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00603-f006">Figure 6</xref>. All these residues lie on the N-terminal domain of the protein. Additionally, both of the template proteins were bound to ligands, 2o0j was bound to ADP while 2o0h was bound to ATP. Furthermore, fingerprint-based virtual screening conducted with 
 <italic>e</italic>FindSite suggests that this binding pocket is likely an ATP-binding site. Interestingly, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00603-f006">Figure 6</xref>, the predicted binding site also was found next to two ATP binding motifs known as Walker A (magenta) and Walker B (brick red). The Walker A motif has been suggested to play a critical role in the hydrolysis and binding of ATP. It works in conjunction with the Walker B motif which is responsible for coordinating the magnesium ion of the Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>—ATP complex. These two motifs work together to properly orient the phosphates of ATP for hydrolysis. The binding pocket for ATP have been found upstream from the Walker A motif of gp17 of the T4 bacteriophage, which was used as a template for the protein model. Walker A and Walker B boxes are found at residues 249−272 and 345−362, respectively [

 <xref rid="B89-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. The predicted ATP binding site is consistent with several residues found upstream of, and overlapping with, the Walker A box, further indicating that the binding site was predicted properly in the pUL15 model.
