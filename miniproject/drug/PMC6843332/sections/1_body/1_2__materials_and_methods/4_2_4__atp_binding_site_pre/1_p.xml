 <xref rid="B72-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], which determined that ATP is most likely to bind to that particular binding site and yielded a complex structure with the ATP docked into the protein. To resolve any possible clashes, the ligand-protein complex was input into LigPlot+ [
