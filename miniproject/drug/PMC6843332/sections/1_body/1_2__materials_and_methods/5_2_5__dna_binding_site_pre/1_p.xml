<p>DNA-protein interactions were predicted with DISPLAR [

 <xref rid="B77-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] against the sequence of pUL15 as the input. Additionally, a review of the currently available literature discussing potential DNA binding residues in pUL15 was carried out. Subsequently, those residues common between the literature and the sequence-based prediction, as well as residues in the literature that seem to have a particular importance, were identified. A small segment of HHV-1 DNA was created by putting the nucleotide sequence (GenBank ID: JQ673480.1) into 3D-DART, a DNA structure modelling server [
 <xref rid="B78-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. This DNA structure, along with the protein model, were input into HADDOCK [
 <xref rid="B16-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] to generate a three-dimensional model of the DNA-pUL15 complex. Using HADDOCK, pUL15 residues 517, 695, 700, 701, and 620â€“633 were labeled as active, whereas the first and the last base pairs of the DNA model were selected as non-active.
