<p>Raltegravir, an HIV integrase inhibitor, exhibits efficiency against herpes viruses. The effect of raltegravir on herpes viruses is attributed to an inhibition of the large subunit of the viral terminase because it has the same RNase H-like fold as the HIV integrase [

 <xref rid="B41-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Due to the fact that pUL42 is not a part of the terminase, it was determined that raltegravir likely inhibits DNA replication through the polymerase accessory factor rather than DNA cleavage and packaging through the terminase [

Letermovir is believed to inhibit the viral terminase complex by targeting pUL56 because L241P, R369S, and C325Y mutations in pUL56 correlate with resistance to letermovir [

 <xref rid="B43-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The inhibitory effect of letermovir is believed to be distinct due to the lack of cross-resistance of letermovir-resistant CMV strains to benzimidazoles [

 <xref rid="B32-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. While letermovir has no target-related toxicity, and has a good safety profile, it is specific for human CMV and is ineffective against other viruses, including the remaining herpesviruses [
