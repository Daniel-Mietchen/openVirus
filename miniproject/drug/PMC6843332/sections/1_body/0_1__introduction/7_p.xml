<p>Although numerous antivirals have been developed against HHV, many of these compounds are prone to resistance, have poor bioavailability and high toxicities, and are too specific to be utilized against other HHVs [

 <xref rid="B46-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We focus on the most conserved protein in HHVs. We propose DNA packaging terminase pUL15 as a drug target that also could be utilized in other herpesviridae and, possibly, a larger set of viruses utilizing a DNA packaging motor. We also suggest that the hinged region between the two domains of pUL15 is a promising drug target to inhibit its overall function.
