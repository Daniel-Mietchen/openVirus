<p>Due to the resistance, toxicities, and other adverse side effects of nucleoside analogs, new targets to treat herpes viruses are being perused. The viral DNA packaging motor, namely its large terminase subunit, has become a promising target for potential herpes antivirals [
 <xref rid="B29-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The HHV-1 terminase is composed of three subunits which play several important roles in the packaging process, including identifying the viral concatemeric DNA, as well as endonuclease and ATPase activity. This provides several critical mechanisms that could be interrupted, provided a feasible drug binding site. Inhibiting the viral terminase or other components of the viral DNA packaging motor is expected to be more effective and has less target-related toxicity than nucleoside analogs. This is due to the fact that the molecular functions of the DNA packaging motor, capsid formation, DNA cleavage, and packaging of DNA into capsids, are virus-specific and not found in mammalian cells [
