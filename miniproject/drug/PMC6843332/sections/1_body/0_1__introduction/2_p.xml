<p>Widely used as a model to study herpesvirus replication, gene expression, and pathogenesis, the prototype virus of the family herpesviridae, HHV-1, has a linear double-stranded DNA genome of approximately 152 kbp. Several HHV-1 genomes have been sequenced to date, including strain 17 [
 <xref rid="B16-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], strain KOS [
 <xref rid="B17-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and strain McKrae [
 <xref rid="B18-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Similar to other members of the herpesvirus family, the HHV-1 genome consists of two unique regions, unique long (UL) and unique short (US), flanked by terminal inverted repeats [
 <xref rid="B19-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The UL sequence contains 107,943 residues and has a base composition of 66.9% GC [
 <xref rid="B16-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Among 56 genes identified in the UL region, accounting for most of the DNA sequence, the UL1, UL43, US7, UL23 and UL49 genes accumulated the majority of non-synonymous mutations across the genome [
 <xref rid="B20-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The UL23 gene, for instance, has one of the highest genetic variabilities at 35.2%, confirming its role in the development of drug resistance [
 <xref rid="B21-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The assembly of accurate, full-length HHV-1 genomes is critical to identify the genetic determinants of drug resistance, virulence, and pathogenesis.
