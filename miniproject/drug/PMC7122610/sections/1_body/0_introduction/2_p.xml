<p>After TRIPS was signed, member countries of the WTO, especially the developing countries, were faced with increasing public health crises and have been persistently seeking a new balance between patent protection and the public health interest of providing essential medicine to their citizens. It is clear that the old WTO regulation and TRIPS agreement actually prevent developing countries from getting essential medicines and also hinder their capability to handle the frequent attacks of emerging infectious diseases. Further development and policy advancement of the WTO regulations are needed to establish a new balance between the protection of intellectual property of medicines and the interests of public health.</p>
