<p>In the globalized world of the twenty-first century, diseases have spread faster than ever before, aided by high-speed air travel and the trade in goods and services between countries and continents [

Collaboration between, especially, developed and developing countries, to ensure the availability of technical and other resources is a crucial factor in building and strengthening public health capacity, networks, and systems that strengthen global public health security. Such collaboration could prevent the rapid spread of disease. It is estimated that 2.1 billion airline passengers traveled in 2006; a disease outbreak or epidemic in any part of the world is only a few hours away from becoming an imminent threat somewhere else [

Developing countries, which collectively shelter over three quarters of the world’s population, face severe public health crises from both widespread infectious diseases, such as HIV epidemics, rampant TB, malaria, and viral hepatitis as well as staggering chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and malignant tumors. Approximately 15 million people die each year due to infectious diseases—predominately in developing countries [

The rapid progress of science and technology in the twentieth century uncovered many new forms of medicine, which greatly improved people’s health in developed countries. However, patent protection for medical drugs and patent monopoly, as stipulated by the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), guarantee monopolizing profits. Essentially, this guarantee causes the price of patent drugs to skyrocket, which severely hinders the accessibility of drugs that are essential to public health in developing countries.
