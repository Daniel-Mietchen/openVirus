<p>According to the WHO data in 2010 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], there were 8.8 million TB cases, 1.1 million TB deaths in HIV-negative populations, and an additional 0.35 million deaths in HIV-positive populations. In 2010, there were 5.7 million notifications of new and recurrent cases of TB, equivalent to 65% of the estimated number of incident cases. India and China accounted for 40% of the worldâ€™s reported TB cases, Africa for another 24%, and the 22 countries with the highest TB rates accounted for 82%. Fewer than 5% of new and previously treated TB patients were tested for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in most countries. The reported number of patients enrolled in MDR-TB treatment has increased, reaching 46,000. However, this was equivalent to only 16% of the 290,000 cases of MDR-TB estimated to exist among reported TB patients in 2010.
