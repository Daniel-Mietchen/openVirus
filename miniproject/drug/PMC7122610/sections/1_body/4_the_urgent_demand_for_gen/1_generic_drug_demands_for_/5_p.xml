<p>The 2009 WHO World Malaria Report [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] indicated that 3.3 billion people globally are threatened by malaria, exceeding half of the world’s population. Each year, there are about 250 million cases of malaria, 85% of which are in Africa with the majority being children. The most severely hit populations are in sub-Saharan Africa with an average of 3,000 children under the age of 5 dying from malaria each day. There is limited access to antimalaria treatment, especially the artemisinin-based combination cocktail medicine, in Africa. In 2007–2008, 11 of the 13 African countries with available data showed that less than 15% of population under the age of 5 with a fever received the combination cocktail medicine. In 2008, the public health facilities in some African countries could only meet half of the demand for antimalaria medicines.
