Reddy, an Indian pharmaceutical company, started by producing API for Ibuprofen and exporting API of Methyldopa to Germany in 1986. Its API production passed SFDA (should be FDA?) certification in 1987–1990. Reddy set up distribution centers in America and France in 1992 and 1993. By 2005, 56 products passed the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) certification with a sales revenue reaching US$175 million. After 4 years of effort, Reddy’s production facility for Ranitidine (a nonpatent drug) passed the FDA certification in 1998, and the gateway for medical drugs to developed countries was opened. Currently, 35 of Reddy’s nonpatent drugs have passed the FDA certification. The company also owns many distribution sites in America (with headquarters in New Jersey) and Europe (with headquarters in England). Other Indian companies, such as Ranbaxy and Cipla, have gone through similar development paths [
