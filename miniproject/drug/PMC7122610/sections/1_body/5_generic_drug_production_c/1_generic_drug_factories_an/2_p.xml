<p>The four largest API manufacturers for ARV drugs in China could supply almost all of the current ARV drugs worldwide. Their annual production capacity is 7,690 tons, with 60–70% exported and with India as the largest purchaser, followed by western pharmaceutical companies. In response to the low demand of the Chinese for antiviral drugs, the four companies recently developed limited manufacturing capabilities of four to five off-patent ARV drugs. The annual production capacity of these four companies is 96 billion pills. Due to the small domestic market, the sale capacity was less than 1% of production capacity [

Many of them also have dual operations with majority API exported and medical drugs mainly sold in the domestic market. Chinese companies have developed many generic drugs including the popular three-ARV drug combination pill. Due to the patent issues, China’s State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) does not accept generic drug applications for these drugs under patent protection. The small domestic market and the patent obstacles of the international market have severely restricted the ability of the Chinese pharmaceutical companies to satisfy the huge demands for essential medicines both at home and in other developing countries.
