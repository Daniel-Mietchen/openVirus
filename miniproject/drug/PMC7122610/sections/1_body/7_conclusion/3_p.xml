<p>As for developing countries, drug cost takes up a much larger percentage (20â€“50%) of their limited health expenditure. If strong measures are not taken, the government will be unable to provide enough drugs to its citizens, especially to the vulnerable groups. A tragic example of this occurred in the first 10 years of ARV treatment for HIV/AIDS. While the treatment was widely available in developed countries, AIDS patients in developing countries, which make up more than 90% of the AIDS patients worldwide, were still dying in large numbers. Some developing countries such as Thailand, Brazil, Malaysia, and South Africa took a bold move to provide generic drugs to their AIDS patients through the compulsory licensing. Such acts not only saved many lives, but also eased the burden of high drug costs and prevented the collapse of their national economies. Canada, a developed country and member of the G7, has initiated a compulsory license to provide ARV drugs to the HIV/AIDS patients in Africa.</p>
