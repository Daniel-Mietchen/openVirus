<p>WTO treaties, including the Doha Declaration, the General Council Decision, and the Protocol Amending the TRIPS Agreement, stipulate that member countries have the right to grant compulsory licenses and provide necessary legal foundations for member countries to implement compulsory licenses. The treaties specify to what extent a compulsory license may be applied and exactly what constitutes a national emergency. Some developing countries, including Thailand, Brazil, South Africa, and a few others, have already made full use of compulsory licenses to deal with the public health crises posed by infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS.
