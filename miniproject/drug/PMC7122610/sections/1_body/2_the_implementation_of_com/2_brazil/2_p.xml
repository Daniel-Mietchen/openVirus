<p>The Brazilian government has consistently sought lower prices for antiretroviral (ARV) drugs in order to support the cost of its national AIDS treatment program, which provides free access to ARV drugs for up to 180,000 Brazilians. It is estimated that 75,000 of those receiving ARV treatment in Brazil will be using efavirenz by the end of 2007. Efavirenz (in tablets of 600 mg) was sold in Brazil at $580 per patient per year, which was 136% higher than the price offered by Thailand [
