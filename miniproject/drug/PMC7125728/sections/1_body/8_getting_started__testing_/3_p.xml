Thin sections are cut and placed onto microscope slides, which are then immersed in a solution of labeled

 <sup>3</sup>H-labeled drug, rinsed to remove unbound tracer and placed against film or phosphor imaging plates for autoradiography (

Once a sufficient exposure time has elapsed, the films are examined to determine if radiolabeled drug has preferentially been retained at sites of viral infection. To check for specificity, various amounts of unlabeled (“cold”) drug can be added to the solution of labeled compound, to determine if it will compete for binding to sites of infection, reducing the detected signal. Additional thin sections would be used for immunohistologic studies, to confirm the presence of virus-infected cells.
