As in the case of deoxyglucose, which failed in trials as a cancer drug, but is now the most widely used tracer for PET imaging, this might include candidate antivirals that are nephro- or hepatotoxic at therapeutic doses. Rather than discarding such drugs, researchers should consider evaluating them for use as virus-specific imaging probes.
