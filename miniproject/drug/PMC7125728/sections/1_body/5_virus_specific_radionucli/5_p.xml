<p id="par0200">Until recently, efforts to image HSV infections have focused on detecting and monitoring viral encephalitis in laboratory animals. Beginning in the early 1980s, investigators succeeded in showing that, even though the blood–brain barrier normally restricts the entry of deoxythymidine analogues into the central nervous system, the increased permeability associated with viral infection permitted the entry of a sufficient amount of probe to label infected cells. In a series of studies, rats were infected intraocularly with HSV-1, and after an appropriate interval were injected intravenously with a small dose of 
 <sup>14</sup>C-labeled 2′-fluoro-5-methyl-1-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-arabinosyluracil (FMAU) or with 
 <sup>131</sup>I- or 
 <sup>125</sup>I-labeled E-5-(2-iodovinyl)-2′-deoxyuridine (IVDU) (

Foci of encephalitis were identified either by killing animals and performing autoradiography on brain slices, or by imaging live animals using a gamma camera. However, only weak signals were obtained. Similar studies have been performed more recently using
