<p id="par0210">The beta herpesvirus cytomegalovirus (CMV) does not encode a TK, but employs its UL97 protein kinase to phosphorylate nucleosides. Because UL97 recognizes acyclovir to only a limited extent, the drug cannot be used to treat CMV infections. In 1990, however, a new compound with greater anti-CMV activity, ganciclovir, was introduced into medical practice. An 
 <sup>18</sup>F-labeled analogue of ganciclovir, 9-[(3-fluoro-1-hydroxy-2-propoxy)-methyl]guanine (FHPG), has been evaluated as a probe to image CMV infections (

 <sup>18</sup>F-FHPG was shown to correctly identify CMV encephalitis in rats, as confirmed by autoradiography, but the utility of the approach was once again limited by the restricted entry of the probe across the bloodâ€“brain barrier (
