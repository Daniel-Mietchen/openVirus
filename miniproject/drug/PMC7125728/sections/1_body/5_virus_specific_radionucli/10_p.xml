<p id="par0225">As noted above, poxviruses also encode their own TK. Because it is a type II enzyme, however, with a substrate specificity similar to that of human cells, poxviruses are not susceptible to acyclovir. Treatment has instead relied on nucleotide analogues such as cidofovir, which enter cells by macropinocytosis, and are then converted to their bi- and triphosphates by cellular kinases. Such drugs therefore inhibit both herpesviruses and poxviruses. Because their initial phosphorylation is performed by a host enzyme, they accumulate in normal cells, making them unsuitable for use as virus-specific imaging agents. Interestingly, recent research has identified some thymidine analogues that inhibit the replication of wild-type vaccinia virus significantly better than a virus lacking a TK gene, suggesting that their mechanism of action resembles that of acyclovir (
