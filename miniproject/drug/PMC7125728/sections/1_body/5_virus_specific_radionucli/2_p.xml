<p id="par0185">The possibility of using a naturally occurring virus-encoded molecule as an imaging reporter was first explored in the early 1980s, when acyclovir was approved as an antiviral drug for the treatment of HSV infections. The ability of this and other nucleoside analogues to selectively inhibit HSV replication is based on their ability to undergo phosphorylation by the viral thymidine kinase (TK), but not by corresponding host enzymes. TK supports DNA synthesis in dividing cells or during pathogen replication by phosphorylating the 5â€² hydroxyl group of deoxythymidine (dT) to produce dTMP, which is then converted to the triphosphate form by other cellular kinases (
