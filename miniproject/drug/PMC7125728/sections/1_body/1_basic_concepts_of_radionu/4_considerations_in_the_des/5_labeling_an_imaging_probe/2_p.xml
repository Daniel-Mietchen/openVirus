<p id="par0120">The methods by which a radionuclide can be incorporated into an imaging probe fall into two broad categories: those in which the tracer molecule's original chemical structure remains unchanged, and those in which the structure is modified to permit addition of the radioactive moiety. The first approach includes the introduction of the radionuclide into the primary synthetic reaction and its direct exchange for its stable counterpart. The second includes three different techniques: chemical modification of the original molecule to permit the addition of a radiolabel; addition to the original molecule of a structure that already contains the radiolabel; and addition to the original molecule of a chemical structure that can noncovalently bind (chelate) the isotope.</p>
