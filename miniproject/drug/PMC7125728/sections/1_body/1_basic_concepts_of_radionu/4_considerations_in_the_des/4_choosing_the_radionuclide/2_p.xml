<p id="par0075">The radioisotopes with which virologists and medicinal chemists are most familiar, 
 <sup>3</sup>H and 
 <sup>14</sup>C, are weak beta-emitters with half-lives measured in years. Because hydrogen and carbon are constituent elements of most, if not all-antiviral medications, these isotopes can be introduced into a drug during its synthesis, and the product will not differ in structure or biological properties from the unlabeled compound. The long half-lives also mean that 
 <sup>3</sup>H- and 
 <sup>14</sup>C-labeled drugs can be stored and used for years without loss of activity. When employed for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> pharmacokinetic studies, the compound can be detected in blood, urine or tissue samples by scintillation counting, in which beta decay triggers the emission of a photon of light.
