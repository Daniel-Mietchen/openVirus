<p id="par0110">The latter point includes questions such as the chemical stability of the resulting molecule and the retention of its biological activity. The half-life of the selected radionuclide should also be consistent with the expected clearance time of the tracer, to ensure that sufficient radioactivity will be detected in the region of interest to provide a useful image.</p>
