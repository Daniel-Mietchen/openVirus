<p id="par0080">There are some key differences between such isotopes and the short-lived radionuclides used for PET and SPECT imaging. PET is based on positron-electron annihalations that yield pairs of 511 kEV photons, which because of their high energy are minimally attenuated or scattered during their passage through soft tissues. SPECT isotopes, on the other hand, emit photons in the lower energy range of 60–400 kEV, which are more likely to be scattered or absorbed. In addition, degradation of image quality is worsened, the further the target is from the detector. An advantage of SPECT, however, is that because the various tracers emit photons with a range of energy peaks, it is possible to image more than one target in the same session, by setting the instrument's computer algorithms to separate signals of different energies. PET isotopes, in contrast, all produce photons of the same energy, making it necessary to perform separate imaging sessions if two different probes are used to study the same subject.</p>
