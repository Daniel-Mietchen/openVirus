<p id="par0115">The need for chemical stability and a short half-life can both potentially be met by performing PET imaging with a 
 <sup>11</sup>C-labeled probe, because the replacement of one carbon atom by another during synthesis leaves the molecule's physiologic activity unchanged, while the 20-min half-life makes it possible to image the same subject repeatedly, at intervals of a few hours. However, the isotope's short half-life means that its use is only practical if one possesses an on-site cyclotron and adequate radiochemistry support. Those lacking such resources would be better off using a 
 <sup>18</sup>F-labeled probe, because its 108-min half-life makes it possible for synthesis to take place off-site, but still allows a subject to be imaged twice daily. The limitation of this approach is that the introduction of a fluorine atom into the probe may require a difficult chemical synthesis, and it may also alter the molecule's biochemical characteristics (in this case, its antiviral efficacy). It will therefore be essential to test the activity of the probe
