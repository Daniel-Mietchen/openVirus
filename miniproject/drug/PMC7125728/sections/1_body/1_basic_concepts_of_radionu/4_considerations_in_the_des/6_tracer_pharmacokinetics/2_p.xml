 <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging depends upon the proper systemic distribution, cellular uptake and elimination of a tracer following its administration. To ensure rapid and uniform delivery throughout the body, most imaging probes are administered by intravenous injection. As noted above, the pharmacokinetics of a virus-specific imaging probe should resemble those of an ideal antiviral drug, in terms of its uptake into infected cells, but should differ from a therapeutic agent in being cleared quickly from uninfected tissues. (Such a pharmacokinetic pattern would provide optimal contrast between sites of viral replication and normal tissues.) Because clearance takes time, the radioisotope must have a long enough half-life to ensure that adequate activity remains in the region of interest once the background signal has reached a low level, so as to maximize the target-to-background ratio. In contrast to antiviral therapy, in which the desired drug concentration in tissues tends to be in the micromolar range, radiotracer concentrations are typically in the pico- to nanomolar range.
