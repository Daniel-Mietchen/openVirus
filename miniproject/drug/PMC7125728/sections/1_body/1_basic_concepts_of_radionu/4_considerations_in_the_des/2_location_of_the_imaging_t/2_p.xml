<p id="par0040">The first question to consider in designing an imaging probe is the location of its intended target: on the cell surface, where it can be accessed directly from the bloodstream, or within the cell, where it can be reached only by a tracer capable of traversing a lipid bilayer. Cell-surface targets can be imaged using antibodies, antibody fragments and peptides, because these large, charged molecules can reach such targets from the plasma. For example, radiolabeled anti-CD4 antibodies are being used to detect and quantitate CD4+ T cells in lymphoid tissues of retrovirus-infected macaques (
