<p id="par0060">In contrast, the target of a non-saturable probe is generally an enzyme that alters the chemical structure of the probe, in a manner that favors its retention at the target site. For antiviral therapy, the classic non-saturable target is the HSV TK, which phosphorylates acyclovir, causing it to accumulate within HSV-infected cells. As described below, this property of the HSV TK has also permitted the extensive use of the recombinant enzyme as an imaging reporter for SPECT and PET. The principal application of a non-saturable target in radionuclide imaging makes use of 2-deoxyglucose (DG), a glucose molecule lacking a 2-hydroxyl group that is readily phosphorylated by the host cell hexokinase, but cannot be further metabolized, and remains trapped within the cell (

 <sup>18</sup>F-DG (FDG), without changing its metabolic activity. Because malignant cells tend to have a high rate of glucose metabolism, DG was originally tested as an anti-cancer drug, but it proved too toxic for clinical use (

 <xref rid="bib0420" ref-type="bibr">Pauwels et al., 2000</xref>). At low dose, however, FDG is not toxic, and it can be used as a probe to label cells with high glycolytic activity. FDG is now widely used to identify foci of increased glucose metabolism, such as tumors or sites of inflammation, by PET imaging (
