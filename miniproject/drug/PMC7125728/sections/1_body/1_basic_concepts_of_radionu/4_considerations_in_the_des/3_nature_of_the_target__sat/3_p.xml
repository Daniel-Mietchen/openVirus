<p id="par0055">Several factors determine whether a radiolabeled probe that binds to a saturable target will generate a useful image. First, the probe must have the needed pharmacokinetic properties to reach the target (see below). Second, it should have a high affinity for its binding site, as measured by the

 <sub>d</sub> (the concentration at which 50% of binding sites are occupied at equilibrium). Third, there must be a sufficient number of targets within the region of interest so that the accumulation of the bound tracer will result in a detectable signal. In practice, this means that it is possible to image low-density targets, as long as the

 <sub>d</sub> of the tracerâ€“target interaction is in the nanomolar range (or less) and the fraction of labeled probe molecules (the specific activity) is high. When these conditions are met, a minute quantity of tracer, much too small to cause any pharmacologic effect, can produce an image (
