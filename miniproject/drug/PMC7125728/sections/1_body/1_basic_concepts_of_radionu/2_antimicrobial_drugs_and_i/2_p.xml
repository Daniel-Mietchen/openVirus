<p id="par0020">Antiviral therapy and nuclear medicine share a common origin in the efforts of Paul Ehrlich to develop antimicrobial medications in the early 1900s. His concept of the “magic bullet” was based on the observation that certain dyes stained microbes, but not surrounding cells, in tissue sections, suggesting that the selective binding of other small molecules to pathogens could be exploited for therapeutic purposes. To find a substance that specifically inhibited

Two decades later, Georges de Hevesy followed the same line of reasoning when he used radioactive compounds as “tracers” to explore mechanisms of drug action. At that time, bismuth was a component of a number of compounds employed for the treatment of syphilis. To determine their distribution within the body, de Hevesy introduced radioactive bismuth into the medications, inoculated them into the bloodstream of rabbits and followed their distribution and clearance from blood and tissues (

The concept of using a low-dose radioactive tracer to study a biochemical process in which it directly participates is still followed today in developing probes that target cell surface and intracellular receptors, enzymes and other molecules (
