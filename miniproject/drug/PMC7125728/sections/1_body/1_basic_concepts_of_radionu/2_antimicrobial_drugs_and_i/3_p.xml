<p id="par0025">In some respects, the basic mechanisms that underlie radionuclide imaging are similar to those of antiviral therapy, in which a drug produces a beneficial effect within a region of interest (a locus of viral infection), while having a minimal impact on other tissues. The optimal pharmacokinetic properties of an antiviral agent differ, however, from those of an ideal imaging probe: continuous high drug levels in the blood and tissues are beneficial for therapy, but for SPECT or PET imaging, such persistence of the tracer would result in a high background signal and poor image contrast. As discussed below, an ideal imaging probe differs from a drug, in that it should be retained at sites of interest, but cleared rapidly from non-target tissues.</p>
