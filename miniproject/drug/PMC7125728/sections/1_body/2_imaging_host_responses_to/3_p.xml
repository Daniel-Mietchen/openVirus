<p id="par0140">FDG-PET imaging is increasingly used to study host responses to infection, especially in research settings. As described above, the technique relies on the preferential retention of phosphorylated 
 <sup>18</sup>F-FDG in cells with high levels of glucose metabolism, which occur in infectious and inflammatory processes (

 <sup>18</sup>F-FDG retention (

FDG-PET was used recently to characterize a patient with severe swine-origin H1N1 influenza, showing that an intense inflammatory response was present both in areas of dense pulmonary consolidation as seen by CT scan and in regions of aerated lung (

 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Bellani et al., 2009</xref>). The value of such studies would obviously be enhanced if the same patient could also be imaged with an influenza-virus-specific probe, to determine the relative chronology and physical distribution of viral replication and host inflammatory responses.
