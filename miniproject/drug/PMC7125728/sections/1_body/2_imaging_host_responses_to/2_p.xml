<p id="par0135">Radionuclide imaging has been used to study viral diseases for more than three decades, by employing indirect methods to identify sites of infection. Beginning in the 1970s, it was found that cytomegalovirus pneumonitis and other infections in immunodeficient patients could be detected by administering a small intravenous dose of 
 <sup>67</sup>Ga citrate and imaging them with a gamma camera (

 <sup>111</sup>In-labeled polyclonal human immunoglobulin or a patient's own 
 <sup>111</sup>In-tagged leukocytes (
