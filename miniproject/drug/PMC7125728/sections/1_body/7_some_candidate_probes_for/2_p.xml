<p id="par0275">Could drugs other than anti-HSV medications be used to visualize viral infections by SPECT or PET? Most licensed antivirals are nucleoside or nucleotide analogues that undergo initial phosphorylation by cellular kinases, and therefore could not serve as pathogen-specific probes. However, as noted above, the replication cycles of various DNA and RNA viruses offer a variety of targets for drugs and probes that interact specifically with virus-encoded molecules. The following sections identify examples of candidate tracers for nine different virus families.</p>
