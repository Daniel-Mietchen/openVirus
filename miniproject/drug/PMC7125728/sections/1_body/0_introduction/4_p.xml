<p id="par0015">We begin by providing an overview of the principles of radionuclide imaging, noting the similarities and differences between the mechanisms of action of antiviral drugs and imaging probes. We then describe how SPECT and PET have been used to detect host responses to viral infection and examine how PET has been employed to track the distribution of radiolabeled antiviral drugs in uninfected subjects. Next, we show how the recent development of recombinant oncolytic viruses encoding host reporter molecules provides a proof of concept for virus-specific imaging. We then examine how researchers have taken advantage of the selective phosphorylation of thymidine analogues by the HSV TK to image HSV infections, and how the TK has also been used as a recombinant marker to image tumors, gene therapy and other conditions. Next, we identify a number of processes unique to viral replication that might serve as targets for radiolabeled pathogen-specific tracers. We then review nine different DNA and RNA virus families, identifying approved and experimental antiviral drugs that target virus-encoded molecules, and might have potential as radiolabeled probes. We conclude by explaining how researchers can determine the potential of an antiviral drug or antibody as a radiolabeled imaging probe by using the
