<p id="par0010">This article examines the question of whether viruses other than HSV could be imaged by SPECT or PET, using radiolabeled antiviral drugs or antibodies as probes. In the case of hepatitis C, for example, such tracers might include molecules that block viral replication by binding to specific virus-encoded molecules, such as the NS3 protease (
