<p id="par0260">Translation of viral mRNA by the host cell protein-synthetic machinery is often followed by cleavage of the protein products to their mature forms. In the case of the positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses, for example, the entire genome is first translated into one large polyprotein, which is then cleaved into individual components by cellular enzymes and its own endogenous protease (

Because they differ from those of the host cell, the active sites of a number of viral proteases have proven to be rewarding targets for antiviral drugs. A number of compounds have been identified that bind irreversibly and with high specificity to the active sites of the proteases, and could potentially be used as radiolabeled probes.
