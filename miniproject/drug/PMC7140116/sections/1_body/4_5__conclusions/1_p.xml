<p>Our results confirm and expand the number of drugs whose efficacy might be affected by SAMHD1 function, demonstrating the importance of SAMHD1 for targeted health therapies including nucleoside analogues such as treatments for cancer and viral infections. Moreover, we show that pharmacological modulation of SAMHD1 can significantly enhance current antimetabolite-based anticancer therapies. Nucleobase and nucleoside analogues are an important class of anti-cancer and antiviral drugs. Thus, understanding the clinical and molecular determinants of drug efficacy is paramount to improve the efficacy of anticancer treatment. Based on our findings, the development of robust SAMHD1 inhibitors and activators that can potentiate antimetabolite therapeutic regimens should become a priority.</p>
