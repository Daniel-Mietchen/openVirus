<p>Here, we evaluated how SAMHD1 function modifies the efficacy of a wide range of nucleoside and non-nucleoside antimetabolites currently used to treat cancer. We show that SAMHD1 can either enhance or limit the efficacy of a number of chemotherapeutic drugs, allowing us to discern between those acting as enzyme substrates or competitors. Importantly, we identify anti-folate drugs as being affected by SAMHD1 expression and function. Moreover, pharmacological activation of SAMHD1 by highly selective CDK4/6 inhibitors significantly enhanced the efficacy of drugs acting as competitors. Thus, pharmacological modulation of SAMHD1 activity has the potential to improve antiviral and anti-cancer therapies and paves the way to the identification of malignancies that may be treated with new drug combinations.</p>
