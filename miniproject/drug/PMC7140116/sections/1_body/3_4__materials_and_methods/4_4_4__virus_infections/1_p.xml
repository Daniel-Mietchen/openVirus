<p>MDMs were pretreated with VLP-Vpx for 4h before infection or left with fresh media as a control. Cells were then infected with VSV-pseudotyped NL4-3-GFP and drugs were added at the time of infection. Viral replication was measured two days later by flow cytometry, as well as measurement of the viability of cells by gating live vs. dead cells. The anti-HIV activity of the different compounds was determined by infection of cells in the presence of different concentrations of the drug and 50% effective concentrations (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) were calculated, as previously described [
