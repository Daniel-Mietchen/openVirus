<p>Envelope-deficient HIV-1 NL4-3 clone encoding IRES-GFP (NL4-3-GFP) was pseudotyped with VSV-G by cotransfection of HEK293T cells using polyethylenimine (Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA) as previously described [
 <xref rid="B44-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. For the production of viral-like particles carrying Vpx (VLP-Vpx), HEK293T cells were cotransfected with pSIV3+ and a VSV-G expressing plasmid. Three days after transfection, supernatants were harvested, filtered and stored at −80 °C. Viral stocks were concentrated using Lenti-X concentrator (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). Viruses were titrated by infection of TZM cells followed by GFP quantification by flow cytometry.
