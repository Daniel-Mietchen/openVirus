<p>Drug combinations were evaluated using the combination index (CI)-isobologram equation, a method widely used in pharmacology to study drug interactions. Relative values of drug activity were used to calculate CI as implemented in the Compusyn software (Combosyn Inc., Paramus, NJ, USA) [

 <sub>50</sub>, were considered for quantification of drug combination effect. Drug combinations with CI &lt; 1 were considered synergic [
