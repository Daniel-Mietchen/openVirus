<p>Tissue sections from lung and pancreas tumor tissues (T2235188-1 and T2235152, respectively, Amsbio UK), were used to evaluate SAMHD1 expression in tumor tissues ex vivo. All immunohistochemical analyses were performed in the Histopatology core facility at Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute. A polyclonal rabbit anti-SAMHD1 antibody (cat. no. 12586-1-AP, Proteintech, Rosemont, IL, USA) and an automated detection system were utilized. The specificity of the polyclonal antibody was previously tested by Western blot analysis in cell lines and by immunohistochemistry using paraffin-embedded normal tissue. Images were obtained in a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope using ZEN blue 2011 software.</p>
