<p>Cytotoxicity measurements in cell lines were based on the viability of cells that had been treated or not with various concentrations of the different anticancer compounds. Cells were treated at the indicated doses of the test compounds for 3 days and the number of viable cells was quantified by a tetrazolium-based colorimetric method (MTT method) as described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B23-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The MTT assay measured the metabolic activity of cells, resulting in a very sensitive procedure to evaluate cell viability and cell proliferation, including the effect of cytostatic agents that slow or stop cell growth.
