<p>The human cell lines HEK293-T, TZM-bl (AIDS Reagent Program, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) MDA-MB-468 (ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> HTB132™) and T47D (ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> HTB-133™) (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Gibco, Madrid, Spain) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FCS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 ug/mL streptomycin. SAMHD1 knock-out TZM cells were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technique as described elsewhere (22).
