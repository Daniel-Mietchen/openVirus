<p>Antimetabolites were the first class of cytotoxic drugs systematically tested in clinical trials that elicited complete clinical responses as monotherapies, albeit with inevitable relapse [

Thus, our results might represent the first step of a novel treatment strategy directed to the activation of SAMHD1 function. In this sense, the choice of highly selective CDK4/6 inhibitors as the first clinically effective CDK4/6 inhibitors developed [

 <xref rid="B39-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] is of special relevance. Currently, inhibition of CDK4/6 in combination with endocrine therapies is the treatment option in hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. CDK4/6 inhibitors offer an effective and tolerable treatment that can be combined with other therapies and thus harbors therapeutic potential for multiple cancers [

 <xref rid="B41-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Based on our data, CDK4/6 inhibitors could boost antimetabolite-based anticancer therapies, especially for drugs whose activity is enhanced by SAMHD1, which highlights the need for a priori testing drug efficacy depending on SAMHD1 function.
