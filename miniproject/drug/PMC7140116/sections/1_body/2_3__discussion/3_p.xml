<p>As previously reported, our data indicate that SAMHD1 decreases activity of drugs used against AML (AraC and clofarabine) and other types of hematological cancers like nelarabine for T-lymphoblastic lymphoma, cladribine used in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. On the contrary, SAMHD1 enhances the activity of drugs used to treat solid tumors, such as floxuridine, most often used in the treatment of colorectal cancer, fluorouracil, used for colon cancer, esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and cervical cancer, and anti-folate drugs, such as methotrexate, used against a number of cancers but also to treat autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohnâ€™s disease, or pemetrexed, used to treat non-small cell lung cancer [

Thus, the data presented here expand the number of anticancer drugs known to be affected by SAMHD1 function and the number of diseases that could benefit from the development of pharmacological inhibitors or activators of SAMHD1 function.
