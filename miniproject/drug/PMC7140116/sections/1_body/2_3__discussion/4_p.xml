<p>It is known that SAMHD1 function is tightly linked to cell cycle control as its activity is regulated by CDK-dependent phosphorylation (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B9-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). We and others have identified drugs that activate SAMHD1 function by impeding its phosphorylation [
 <xref rid="B16-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Such drugs may be suitable for combination therapies including antimetabolites, especially when combined with anti-folate drugs, as synergistic effects were seen across all cell models tested. Detection of the phosphorylated form of SAMHD1 and expression of related cell cycle proteins allowed us to suggest a mode of action where anti-folate drugs would diminish the dNTP pool by affecting the synthesis of nucleotide precursors, whereas CDK inhibitors deplete dNTPs by activating SAMHD1 triphosphohydrolase activity [

Although our data provide strong evidence of the key role of SAMHD1 in determining efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors, further work will have to determine the relative contribution of SAMHD1 in each type of tumor, by, for example, performing additional evaluations in SAMHD1 in vitro and/or in vivo knock-out models. From our data, we cannot rule out the possibility that synergy observed in breast cancer cell lines might be not entirely dependent on SAMHD1, but due to a combination of different factors that deserve further investigation.
