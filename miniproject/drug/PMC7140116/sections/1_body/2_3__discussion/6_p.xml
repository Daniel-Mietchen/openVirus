<p>We have applied here a screening approach based in anti-HIV-1 activity in primary macrophages that either express SAMHD1 or do not. Our system has turned out to be a reliable and sensitive measure of SAMHD1 drug dependency for several reasons: (i) SAMHD1 expression is easily modulated, (ii) HIV-1 reverse transcription is a process highly sensitive to SAMHD1-mediated dNTP pool sizes changes and can be easily monitored, (iii) cell cycle initiation and progression is not deregulated and (iv) considers inter-individual differences by using primary cells from different donors. Indeed, cytotoxicity data obtained in different cell lines confirmed the results from the antiviral-based screening, except when expression of pRb was deregulated. RB is one of the key factors in cell cycle control that is phosphorylated by activation of CDK4 and CDK6 following cell cycle entry from GO to G1 [
