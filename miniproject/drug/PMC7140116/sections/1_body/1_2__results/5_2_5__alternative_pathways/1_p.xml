<p>To further explore the mechanism underlying the synergistic effect observed when combining antimetabolites with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, protein expression in primary macrophages treated with pemetrexed, fluorouracil and palbociclib, alone or in combination was evaluated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-12-00713-f006">Figure 6</xref>A). As expected, palbociclib alone inhibited phosphorylation of pRb and SAMHD1, therefore activating its dNTP triphosphohydrolase function and subsequently reducing the intracellular dNTP pool. Interestingly, pemetrexed and fluorouracil treatment resulted in different effects, i.e., while fluorouracil acts similarly to palbociclib, pemetrexed did not decrease the phosphorylation of pRb and SAMHD1. Although pemetrexed activity is dependent on SAMHD1, its mechanisms of action do not directly affect SAMHD1 phosphorylation, providing evidence for the stronger synergy observed in the pemetrexed–palbociclib drug combination compared to fluorouracil–palbociblib.
