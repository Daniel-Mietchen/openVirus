<p>Next, we tested the antiviral activity of a panel of antimetabolites currently used in cancer treatments in wild type or SAMHD1 depleted macrophages. All evaluated drugs inhibited HIV-1 replication, although with different potency (
 <xref rid="cancers-12-00713-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). SAMHD1 expression effectively modified the antiviral activity of all antimetabolites tested. However, and in contrast with previous reports, SAMHD1 degradation either enhanced (cladribine, clofarabine, and nelarabine) or decreased (capecitabine, floxuridine and fluorouracil) the potency of the nucleoside analogues tested (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-12-00713-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). Of note, SAMHD1 degradation dramatically impaired the efficacy of anti-folate inhibitors such as pemetrexed and methotrexate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-12-00713-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). Calculation of 50% effective concentrations (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) of antimetabolites in macrophages expressing SAMHD1 or not showed over 30-fold and 100-fold increases in drugs showing enhanced or diminished potency in SAMHD1-depleted cells, respectively (

The enhanced or decreased efficacy of the compounds tested was not dependent on the nature of the specific nucleotide targeted, i.e., purine or pyrimidine, and was not limited to nucleos(t)ide analogues, as SAMHD1 also affected the efficacy of anti-folate drugs such as pemetrexed and methotrexate (
