<p>Pemetrexed inhibited HIV-1 replication in a dose-dependent manner, although with limited potency (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.1 µM, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-12-00713-f004">Figure 4</xref>A, black line). Combination of pemetrexed with increasing concentrations of palbociclib (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.12 µM) enhanced the antiviral potency of the antimetabolite (

 <sub>50</sub> = 0.62 µM) also showed a highly synergistic effect when SAMHD1 was expressed (
