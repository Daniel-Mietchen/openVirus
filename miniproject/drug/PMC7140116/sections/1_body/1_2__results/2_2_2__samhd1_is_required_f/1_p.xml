<p>SAMHD1 is inactivated in proliferating cells by a mechanism that requires its phosphorylation [

 <xref rid="B15-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. SAMHD1 phosphorylation may be directly regulated by CDK1 or CDK2, whose activity is upstream controlled by CDK6 [
 <xref rid="B14-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The antiviral activity of the highly selective CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib is dependent on SAMHD1 expression [

Thus, the efficacy of two other specific CDK4/6 inhibitors, ribociclib and abemaciclib, was also evaluated in the presence or absence of SAMHD1. The three agents were tested at the concentration where palbociclib showed the highest efficacy in cell culture (1 Î¼M, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-12-00713-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). As expected, the activity of all three CDK4/6 inhibitors was lost in the absence of SAMHD1, indicating that the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors depends on SAMHD1 expression (
