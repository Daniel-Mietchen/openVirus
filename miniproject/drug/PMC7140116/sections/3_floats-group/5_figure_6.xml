  <p>Regulation of dNTP pool is responsible for drug synergy. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Protein expression in MDMs treated with palbociclib (PD) at 1 µM, pemetrexed (PTX) and fluorouracil (FU), both at 5µM and the corresponding drug combinations PD+PTX and PD+FU. Hsp90 was used as a loading control. A representative blot is shown. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Proposed model of drug interactions. Antimetabolites affecting dNTP synthesis such as pemetrexed inhibit dNTP pool by a mechanism not directly affecting SAMHD1 activation and thus synergy with anticancer drugs affecting SAMHD1 phosphorylation as palbociclib is higher compared to compounds also targeting SAMHD1 function (i.e., fluorouracil) or exclusively affecting SAMHD1 (i.e., midostaurin). As a consequence, the antiviral and cytotoxic efficacy of antimetabolites is significantly enhanced when used in combination in vitro.
