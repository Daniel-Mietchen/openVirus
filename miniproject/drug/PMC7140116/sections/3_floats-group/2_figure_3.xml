  <p>Antiviral efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors depends on SAMHD1 expression. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Dose response of the CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib, in wild-type (■) or SAMHD1-depleted (Δ) MDM. Inhibition of HIV infection was measured as the percentage of GFP+ cells relative to the no drug condition. Mean ±SD of at least ten independent donors performed in duplicate is shown. (
   <bold>B</bold>) CDK4/6 inhibitors lose antiviral activity in SAMHD1-depleted macrophages. As in (
   <bold>A</bold>), dose response of two other CDK4/6 inhibitors, ribociclib (left panel) and abemaciclib (right panel), in wild-type (■) or SAMHD1-depleted (Δ) MDMs. Mean ±SD of two independent donors performed in duplicate is shown. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Palbociclib blocks SAMHD1 inactivation by phosphorylation. Western blot analysis of lysates of untreated MDMs (no drug, ND) or macrophages treated with palbociclib at the indicated doses. Membranes were blotted with an anti phospho-SAMHD1 antibody, total SAMHD1, anti phosho-pRB and total pRB. Hsp90 antibody was used as control. A representative donor is shown. *
