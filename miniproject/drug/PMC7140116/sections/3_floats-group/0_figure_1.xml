   <bold>A</bold>) Degradation of sterile alpha motif and histidine-aspartic acid domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) by HIV-2 Vpx enhances HIV-1 replication in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). MDMs previously treated or not with HIV-2 Vpx were infected with a VSV-pseudotyped HIV-1 GFP virus and replication assessed 2 days later by measuring GFP expression. A 5-fold change in HIV-1 replication was observed after Vpx-mediated SAMHD1 degradation. Mean ±SD of ten independent donors performed in duplicate is shown. A representative western blot showing degradation of SAMHD1 expression in MDMs after Vpx treatment is also shown. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Decreased sensitivity of AZT after Vpx-mediated SAMHD1 degradation in MDMs. Dose response of the NRTI AZT and NNRTIs NVP, in wild-type (■) or SAMHD1-depleted (Δ) MDMs. Inhibition of HIV infection was measured as the percentage of GFP+ cells relative to the no drug condition. Mean ±SD of at least ten independent donors performed in duplicate is shown. (
   <bold>C</bold>) SAMHD1 modifies antiviral activity of AraC. Dose response of the AraC in wild-type (■) or SAMHD1-depleted (Δ) MDM. Inhibition of HIV infection was measured as the percentage of GFP+ cells relative to the no drug condition. Mean ±SD of at least three independent donors performed in duplicate is shown. Mean ±SD of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate is shown. *
