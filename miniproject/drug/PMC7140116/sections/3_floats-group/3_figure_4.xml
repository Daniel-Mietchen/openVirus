  <p>Pharmacological activation of SAMHD1 enhances antiviral activity of antimetabolites. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Relative effect of the combination of palbociclib-pemetrexed measured as antiviral activity. Inhibition of HIV infection with increasing doses of palbociclib and pemetrexed was measured. Percentage of GFP+ cells relative to the no drug condition is shown in presence (left panel) or absence (right panel) of SAMHD1. Mean ±SD of at least three independent donors performed in duplicate is shown. (
   <bold>B</bold>) As in (
   <bold>A</bold>), relative effect of pemetrexed alone (white bars) or in combination with a fixed dose of palbociclib 0.04 µM (black bars), in the presence (left panel) or absence (right panel) of SAMHD1. Mean ±SD of at least three independent donors performed in duplicate is shown. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Relative effect of the combination of midostaurin-pemetrexed measured as antiviral activity. Inhibition of HIV infection with increasing doses of midostaurin and pemetrexed was measured. Percentage of GFP+ cells relative to the no drug condition is shown in presence (left panel) or absence (right panel) of SAMHD1. Mean ±SD of at least three independent donors performed in duplicate is shown. (
   <bold>D</bold>) As in (
   <bold>C</bold>), relative effect of pemetrexed (PTX) alone (white bars) or in combination with a fixed dose of midostaurin 0.2 µM (black bars), in the presence (left panel) or absence (right panel) of SAMHD1. Mean ±SD of at least three independent donors performed in duplicate is shown. PD, palbociclib; PTX, pemetrexed; MID, midostaurin. *
