<p>We further investigated whether these compounds inhibited lytic reactivation by detecting RFP expression (which represents early lytic reactivation) in iSLK.219 cells using the HCS System. Our results indicated that 7 of the 15 antiviral compounds mentioned above showed significant inhibitory effects on KSHV early lytic reactivation (
