<p>To identify new antiviral agents against KSHV lytic replication, the human iSLK.219 cell line was used as a screening model. iSLK.219 carries a recombinant rKSHV.219 virus encoding a constitutive GFP reporter and an RTA-inducible RFP reporter in the viral genome, thereby facilitating the monitoring of viral maintenance and lytic reactivation. Previous reports demonstrated that iSLK.219 cells are suitable for anti-KSHV drug screening [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. To optimize conditions for the induction of lytic replication, iSLK.219 cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of doxycycline (Dox) (up to 4 μg/mL) and/or sodium butyrate (NaB) (up to 4.8 mM), then RFP expression was detected at 24 h and 48 h post-induction using the Operetta High-Content Screening (HCS) System. We found that at 24 h post-induction, both Dox and NaB induced RFP expression, but the RFP signal induced by NaB alone was weaker than Dox alone. NaB addition synergistically promoted RFP expression by Dox in a dose-dependent manner (

 </bold>), indicating that the effects of induction plateau at this time point. Based on these data, 1 μg/mL Dox in combination with 1.2 mM NaB was chosen as the optimal lytic-induction condition for subsequent antiviral screening. This treatment also promoted the production of mature virions as detected using an infectivity assay in which increasing doses of supernatants from induced iSLK.219 cells were used to infect HEK293T cells. As shown in

 </bold>, the GFP signal in HEK293T cells demonstrates successful production of infectious virions.
