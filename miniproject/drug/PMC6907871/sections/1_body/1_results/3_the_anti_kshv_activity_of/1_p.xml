 </bold>). Based on these results, we hypothesized that blocking histamine receptors inhibits KSHV lytic replication. To test this, we examined the antiviral activities of classic antagonists targeting different histamine receptors (H1R-H4R) on induced iSLK.219 cells. As shown in

 </bold>, each of the tested antagonists of H1R, H3R and H4R effectively inhibited KSHV virion production from induced iSLK.219 cells (SI &gt;6). It is noteworthy that all four antagonists of H3R tested (Clobenpropit, Conessine, Thioperamide, Tiprolisant) displayed potent anti-KSHV activity with SI &gt;20. In contrast, only one of the H2R antagonists (Burimamide oxalate–which is actually a mixed H2R/H3R antagonists), displayed anti-KSHV ability with SI &gt;6, while other H2R antagonists tested exhibited an SI &lt;3 against KSHV, implying that blocking H2R may have less effect on KSHV lytic reactivation from iSLK.219 cells. To exclude the possibility that antiviral activities of these antagonists are due to decreasing viral entry or a virucidal effect, we evaluated viral lytic gene expression from induced iSLK.219 cells treated with representative antagonists under non-cytotoxic concentrations. Our results indicated that all representative antagonists, Pyrilamine maleate salt (PMS, H1R antagonist), Burimamide oxalate (H2R/H3R antagonist), Thioperamide (H3R antagonist) and JNJ-7777120 (H4R antagonist), significantly blocked ORF26 and vIL-6 expression under the concentrations of their IC
 <sub>50</sub> and 2×IC
 <sub>50</sub>, respectively (

 </bold>). Next, we used rKSHV.219 virions to infect HEK293T cells in the presence of four representative antagonists of histamine receptors (H1R-H4R) using a spinoculation protocol. Our results showed that, regardless of histamine receptor subtype specificity, all of the antagonists at their IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentrations displayed almost no inhibitory effects on relative GFP levels. PMS, Thioperamide, and JNJ-7777120 showed a minimal inhibitory effect (&lt;20%) at the highest concentrations (&gt;10×IC
 <sub>50</sub>) tested (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008156.g004">Fig 4B</xref>
 </bold>), which may reflect the cytotoxicity. These data demonstrate that the antiviral activities of these antagonists we observed at non-cytotoxic concentrations are not the result of virucidal effects or inhibiting virus entry. Our additional data showed that selective histamine receptor antagonists, such as PMS (H1R antagonist) and Conessine (H3R antagonist), both effectively inhibited viral lytic gene expression from induced BCBL-1 cells (
