<p>In the current study, we focus on the roles of histamine, its receptors and downstream signaling in KSHV lytic replication. One previous report found that histamine addition into KS-1 cells (a KSHV+ PEL cell line) induced KSHV lytic gene expression through activating PKA signaling pathway [

In the current study, we found that KSHV lytic reactivation was inhibited by targeting histamine receptors by both antagonists and RNAi, while viral replication was enhanced by histamine receptor agonists, demonstrating that histamine receptors indeed affect viral lytic replication. Interestingly, the antagonists and agonists of H2R displayed less effects on viral reactivation and replication when compared to those of other histamine receptors in iSLK.219 cells. However, we speculate that histamine receptor subtypes will exhibit differential expression on the various cells targeted by KSHV for infection, and they are probably differential among endothelial cells, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and B cells, when compared to iSLK.219 cells. Future studies will identify which histamine receptor subtypes mediate histamine promotion of KSHV lytic reactivation in different host cells.
