<p>In conclusion, the lacking of effective treatment for KSHV-associated malignancies, especially in immunocompromised patients, requires the discovery and development of novel and safe therapeutic strategies. In this study, we have identified 15 FDA-approved drugs with excellent anti-KSHV activities, which may offer clues that foster the development of new antiviral treatments. Moreover, we have for the first time determined the roles of histamine, histamine receptors and downstream signaling pathways in the regulation of KSHV lytic reactivation and replication (summarized in
