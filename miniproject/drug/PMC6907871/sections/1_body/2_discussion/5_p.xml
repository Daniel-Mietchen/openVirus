<p>We demonstrate here histamine levels are elevated in plasma and saliva samples from a cohort of HIV+/KSHV+ patients when compared to HIV+/KSHV- ones, which implicates histamine in the clinical progression of KSHV pathogenesis and virus-associated diseases. However, we note that plasma and saliva histamine levels (especially the latter) were lower than those we used in cell culture assays. In fact, we think the patientsâ€™ histamine levels are greatly underestimated in our test, because 1) although histamine rises much more rapidly than does serum tryptase, the short half-life of histamine, on the order of minutes, and the difficulties in handling patient samples usually preclude accurate measurements [

Therefore, future work will use fresh samples, including whole saliva directly collected without mouthwash or test stable metabolites of histamine such as N-methylhistamine [
