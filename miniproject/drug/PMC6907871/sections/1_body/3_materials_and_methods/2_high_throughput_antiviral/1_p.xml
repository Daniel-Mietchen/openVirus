<p>A compound library consisted of 1280 FDA-approved drugs were purchased from MicroSource Discovery Systems, Inc. (Gaylordsville, CT, USA) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The source plates containing compounds were used to deliver 10 μM (final concentration) of each drug to 384-well screening plates using an acoustic dispensing Echo 550 instrument (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and at once the iSLK.219 cells treated by inducers or not were added to these screening plates. The viral supernatants were collected at 48 h post-induction to infect naïve HEK293T cells seeded in 384-well plates by spinoculation as reported previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The supernatants were then removed and replaced with fresh medium. At 48 h, fluorescence expression per well was detected using the Operetta High-Content Screening (HCS) System (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Nine image fields per well were recorded by the automated microscope-based HCS and the associated fluorescence intensity per well was calculated using the Harmony 3.5 software (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Data were normalized as the fold change compared to the DMSO control. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) for each compound was calculated from these dose-response curves using Graphpad5.0 Prism.
