<p>Histamine receptors (H1R-H4R) are a class of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) that bind histamine as their primary endogenous ligand [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Interestingly, histamine receptor expression is also detected in many tumor cells, making them sensitive to histamine stimulation, and histamine has been found to be a bivalent regulator for tumor development [

More importantly, MCs were recently reported to be one of the major pro-inflammatory cells within KS lesions, and the elevated circulating levels of MC granule contents, such as tryptase and histamine metabolites, were found in plasma samples from KS patients [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In the same study, the authors reported that one patient with clinical signs of extensive MC activation was treated with antagonists of MC pro-inflammatory mediators, which resulted in a rapid and durable regression of AIDS-KS lesions. These data suggest that MC secreted products are important components of KS tumor microenvironment, although the roles of histamine-related signaling in regulation of KSHV infection and replication are still unclear.
