  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) The iSLK.219 cells were induced by doxycycline (Dox) or sodium butyrate (NaB) alone or the combination, then RFP expression (representing viral lytic reactivation) was detected by the Operetta High-Content Screening (HCS) System at 24 h post-induction. (
   <bold>B-C</bold>) RFP expression at 24 h (B) and 48 h (C) post-induction was quantified using Harmony3.5 software. Error bars represent S.D. for 3 independent experiments. (
   <bold>D</bold>) The viral supernatants from iSLK.219 cells treated by 1 μg/mL Dox in combination with 1.2 mM NaB were collected to infected naïve HEK293T cells, then GFP expression was detected using the HCS system at 48 h post-infection.
