 <p>As a major oncogenic human herpesviruses, KSHV infection causes several cancers mostly seen in immunocompromised patients. Currently, effective antiviral treatments are still lacking. The “old drugs, new tricks” approach may serve as a feasible strategy for high-throughput screening of novel agents against lytic replication of KSHV. Here we screened an FDA-approved drug library and identified 15 new anti-KSHV agents. Interestingly, several of these candidates target histamine receptors, implying the involvement of histamine-related signaling in lytic replication and reactivation of KSHV. This involvement was directly demonstrated using antagonists and agonists specific for individual histamine receptors as well as RNAi. The downstream signaling pathways required for histamine-mediated promotion of KSHV lytic replication was also identified. Clinical data from a cohort of HIV+ patients confirm the relevance and elevation of histamine in the microenvironment of HIV+/KSHV+ patients. Thus, our findings provide new clues for developing anti-KSHV treatments, and identify novel mechanisms through which histamine and related signaling pathways function as important host factors facilitating KSHV lytic reactivation and pathogenesis.</p>
