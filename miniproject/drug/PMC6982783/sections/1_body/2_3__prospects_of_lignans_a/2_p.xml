<p>Virus-related diseases are becoming a more challenging public health concern with increased global travel and emergence of viral resistance to the clinical antiviral drugs. There is an urgent need to develop novel antiviral drugs targeting different viral and host proteins. Lignans, as discussed in this review, have large structural diversity and pharmacological activities, including antivirals. Two types of antiviral lignans—podophyllotoxin and bicyclol, which show high potency in the treatment of venereal warts and chronic hepatitis B, respectively—serve as good examples of developing lignans for antivirals. However, we believe that the potential of lignans in antivirals needs further exploration in the research and development. As noted above, although many of the classical lignans have been showed to display wide-range antiviral activities, little is known regarding the neolignans, which have more varied structures than classical lignans, with regards to their antiviral activities. These neolignans should be carefully evaluated to assess their activities against different viruses, and it is highly likely that many new antiviral activities will be discovered. Furthermore, action of mechanism studies should be investigated for facilitating the development of lead lignans in antiviral drug discovery.</p>
