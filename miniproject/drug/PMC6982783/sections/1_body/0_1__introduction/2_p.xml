<p>Lignans are widely distributed in the plant kingdom, and they exist in plant roots, rhizomes, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, xylem, and resins. Plants, such as the 
 <italic>Lauraceae</italic> family, especially the genera of 
 <italic>Machilus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ocotea</italic>, and 
 <italic>Nectandra</italic> are rich sources of lignans. Additionally, 
 <italic>Annonaceae</italic>, 
 <italic>Orchidaceae</italic>, 
 <italic>Berberidaceae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Schisandraceae</italic> family contain a large number of constituents of lignans and neolignans [

 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Up to date, lignans are found in over 70 families in plant kingdom, and more than 200 classical lignans and 100 neolignans have been characterized [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. They are usually present as dimers, but some of them are trimers or tetramers. Most of the lignans in plants are in a free state, while some of them can combine with glycon and form glycosides and other derivatives.
