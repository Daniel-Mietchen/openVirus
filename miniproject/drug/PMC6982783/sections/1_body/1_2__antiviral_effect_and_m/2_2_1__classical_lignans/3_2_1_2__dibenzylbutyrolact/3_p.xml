<p>Yatein was isolated from 
 <italic>Chamaecyparis obtuse</italic> (Cupressaceae). It could significantly suppress HSV-1 replication in HeLa cells without apparent cytotoxicity [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. MOA showed that yatein can inhibit HSV-1 alpha gene expression, including the expression of the 
 <italic>ICP0</italic> and 
 <italic>ICP4</italic> genes, by arresting HSV-1 DNA synthesis and structural protein expression in HeLa cells [
