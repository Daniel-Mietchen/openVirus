<p>The classical lignans contain dimeric structures that are formed by a β-β′-linkage between two phenyl propane units, some of them with a different degree of oxidation in the side-chain and a different substitution pattern in the aromatic moieties. They can be classified into six major subtypes—dibenzylbutanes, dibenzylbutyrolactones, arylnaphthalenes/aryltetralins, substituted tetrahydro-furans, 2,6-diarylfurofurans, and dibenzocyclooctadienes [
