 <italic>Schisandra Chinensis</italic> (Turcz.) Baill. is the most famous plant in 
 <italic>Schisandraceae</italic> family, and the fruits (called 
 <italic>Fructus Schizandrae</italic>) were widely used as a traditional Chinese medicine for treating hepatitis, myocardial disorders, and hyperlipidemia and neurodegenerative diseases in the countries of East Asia and others [

A derivative of schizandrin C, Bicyclol, has been approved as a hepatoprotectant by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) for the treatment of liver injury in 2004 [
