<p>The structure of this subclass of lignans has not only biphenyl structure, but also an eight-membered ring structure synthesized by biphenyl and side chainring. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-00183-f008">Figure 8</xref> shows the structures of dibenzocyclooctadiene and the corresponding compounds. So far, more than 150 lignans have been isolated and identified from more than 60 species of 
 <italic>Schisandraceae</italic> family [
