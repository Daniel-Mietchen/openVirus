<p>DGP, which is also known as patentiflorin A, was first isolated from plant of 
 <italic>Justicia gendarussa</italic> (Acanthaceae) [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. As the glycosylated diphyllin, it exhibited anti-ZIKV activity both in vitro and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, and it displayed broad-spectrum antiviral activity against other flaviviruses. MOA showed that DGP inhibits ZIKV fusion with cellular membranes and infection by preventing the acidification of endosomal/lysosomal compartments in the target cells [

 <sub>50</sub> values in the range of 15â€“21 nM [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]; MOA showed that it acts as a potential inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcription [
