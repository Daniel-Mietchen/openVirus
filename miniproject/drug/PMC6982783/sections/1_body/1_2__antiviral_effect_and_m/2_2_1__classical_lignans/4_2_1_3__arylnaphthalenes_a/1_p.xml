<p>The relationship between the arylnaphthalene and aryltetralin subclasses is of interest due to their deceptive structural similarities. Both of these compounds are based on dibenzylbutanes and formed by cyclization of six sites in one C6-C3 unit and seven sites in another C6-C3 unit. Their subtle structural difference lies in whether the B ring consists of a benzene ring or a six-membered ring. Arylnaphthalenes are also named benzene tetrahydronaphthalene, which means that the B-ring structure consists of six-membered rings. Aryltetralins are named benzene naphthalene, because the B-ring structure consists of benzene. The representative compounds of arylnaphthalene are diphyllin and 6-deoxyglucose-diphyllin (DGP), and podophyllotoxin represents aryltetralin (
