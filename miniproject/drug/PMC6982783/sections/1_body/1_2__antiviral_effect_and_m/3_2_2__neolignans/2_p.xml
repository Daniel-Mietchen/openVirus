<p>1,4-Benzodioxane lignans. This subtype of neolignans has received significant attention through the years due to their good biological activities. One representative is Silymarin flavonolignans, which were isolated from the seeds of 
 <italic>Silybum marianum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B84-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] and they are the most commonly consumed herbal products among the HCV-infected patients in western countries [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Besides, they were showed to possess antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and hepatoprotective activities [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Recent studies have also documented the antiviral activities of silymarin and its derivatives against HCV and other viruses [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Its derivative intravenous silibinin, which was named Legalon
 <sup>Â®</sup> SIL, and has been shown to block HCV production and increase anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative gene expressions without affecting serum albumin levels in the clinical phase [
 <xref rid="B88-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. In addition, it was showed that silymarin inhibited the replication of IAV [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. MOA showed that silymarin inhibited the late mRNA synthesis during IAV replication. It was also reported that silymarin inhibited other viruses, such as DENV, Chikungunya virus, Mayaro virus, HIV, and HBV [
