  <p>Bicyclol as an anti-HBV drug [
   <xref rid="B76-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Schizandrin C was isolated from 
   <italic>F. Schizandrae</italic> and verified as the most active compound in protection against liver injury in mice. DDB (Dimethyl dicarboxylate biphenyl) as an analog of schizandrin C has been widely used for the improvement of the abnormal liver function of CHB hepatitis in China. Bicyclol as a novel substitute for DDB was found to be more effective in protection against liver injury and was also showed to inhibit hepatitis virus replication in vitro and in vivo.
