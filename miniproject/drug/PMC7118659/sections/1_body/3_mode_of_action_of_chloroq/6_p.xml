<p id="para0011">Beside affecting the virus maturation process, pH modulation by chloroquine can impair the proper maturation of viral protein 
 <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and the recognition of viral antigen by dendritic cells, which occurs through a Toll-like receptor-dependent pathway that requires endosomal acidification 
 <xref rid="bib0069" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. On the contrary, other proposed effects of chloroquine on the immune system include increasing the export of soluble antigens into the cytosol of dendritic cells and the enhancement of human cytotoxic CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell responses against viral antigens 
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. In the influenza virus model, it was reported that chloroquine improve the cross-presentation of non-replicating virus antigen by dendritic cells to CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells recruited to lymph nodes draining the site of infection, eliciting a broadly protective immune response
