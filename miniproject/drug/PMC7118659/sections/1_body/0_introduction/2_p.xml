<p id="para0001">Chloroquine is an amine acidotropic form of quinine that was synthesised in Germany by Bayer in 1934 and emerged approximately 70 years ago as an effective substitute for natural quinine 
 <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2]</xref>. Quinine is a compound found in the bark of 
 <italic>Cinchona</italic> trees native to Peru and was the previous drug of choice against malaria 
 <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. For decades, chloroquine was a front-line drug for the treatment and prophylaxis of malaria and is one of the most prescribed drugs worldwide 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Chloroquine and the 4-aminoquinoline drug hydroxychloroquine belong to the same molecular family. Hydroxychloroquine differs from chloroquine by the presence of a hydroxyl group at the end of the side chain: the 
 <italic>N</italic>-ethyl substituent is Î²-hydroxylated. This molecule is available for oral administration in the form of hydroxychloroquine sulfate. Hydroxychloroquine has pharmacokinetics similar to that of chloroquine, with rapid gastrointestinal absorption and renal elimination. However, the clinical indications and toxic doses of these drugs slightly differ. In malaria, the indication for chloroquine was a high dose for a short period of time (due to its toxicity at high doses) or a low dose for a long period of time. Hydroxychloroquine was reported to be as active as chloroquine against 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria and less toxic, but it is much less active than chloroquine against chloroquine-resistant 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> owing to its physicochemical properties. What is advantageous with hydroxychloroquine is that it can be used in high doses for long periods with very good tolerance. Unfortunately, the efficacy of chloroquine gradually declined due to the continuous emergence of chloroquine-resistant 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains 
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Chloroquine is also utilised in the treatment of autoimmune diseases 
 <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Yet the activity of the molecule is not limited to malaria and the control of inflammatory processes, as illustrated by its broad-spectrum activity against a range of bacterial, fungal and viral infections 
 <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Indeed, in the mid-1990s, due to its tolerability, rare toxicity reports, inexpensive cost and immunomodulatory properties 
 <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, chloroquine repurposing was explored against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other viruses associated with inflammation and was found to be efficient in inhibiting their replication cycle
