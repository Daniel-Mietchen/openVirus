 <p>Ca
  <sup>2+</sup> is essential for virus entry, viral gene replication, virion maturation, and release. The alteration of host cells Ca
  <sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is one of the strategies that viruses use to modulate host cells signal transduction mechanisms in their favor. Host calcium-permeable channels and pumps (including voltage-gated calcium channels, store-operated channels, receptor-operated channels, transient receptor potential ion channels, and Ca
  <sup>2+</sup>-ATPase) mediate Ca
  <sup>2+</sup> across the plasma membrane or subcellular organelles, modulating intracellular free Ca
  <sup>2+</sup>. Therefore, these Ca
  <sup>2+</sup> channels or pumps present important aspects of viral pathogenesis and virus–host interaction. It has been reported that viruses hijack host calcium channels or pumps, disturbing the cellular homeostatic balance of Ca
  <sup>2+</sup>. Such a disturbance benefits virus lifecycles while inducing host cells’ morbidity. Evidence has emerged that pharmacologically targeting the calcium channel or calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can obstruct virus lifecycles. Impeding virus-induced abnormal intracellular Ca
  <sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is becoming a useful strategy in the development of potent antiviral drugs. In this present review, the recent identified cellular calcium channels and pumps as targets for virus attack are emphasized.
