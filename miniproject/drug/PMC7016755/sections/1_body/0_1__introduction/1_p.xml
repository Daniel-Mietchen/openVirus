<p>Viruses exploit the environment of host cells to replicate, thereby inducing host cells’ dysfunction. Virus–host interaction is the foundation of pathogenesis and closely associated with disease severity and incidence. The prevention and therapy of virus infections are often confounded by the high mutation rates that facilitate the viral evasion of antiviral strategies that target virally encoded proteins. Modulations of the intracellular environment have become an important strategy in antiviral drug discovery and development. In mammalian cells, Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>, as an important second messenger, mediates the sensor input and responses output for almost all known cellular progress, such as stress responses, synaptic plasticity, immunodefenses, protein transport, and endosome formation [

 <sup>2+</sup> concentration [

 <sup>2+</sup> system to achieve successful replication via multiple routes; for instance, viral proteins directly bind to Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> or disturb the membrane permeability for Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> by manipulating Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> apparatus.
