<p>The host cell plasma membrane is the first barrier against the invasion of viruses. Various Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channels and pumps are distributed on the cell plasma membrane. Therefore, these membrane proteins become the direct target of virus infection. Interaction between viruses and these membrane proteins is the foremost approach of viruses perturbing the host cell calcium signal system. This interaction may inhibit or stimulate calcium influx and modulate free cytosolic Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> concentrations. After entry into the host cell, viruses stimulate or inhibit the calcium release from internal stores via an effect on calcium-permeable channels, transporters, and exchangers on organellar membranes. Then, the change in cytosolic calcium concentration may trigger further distortion of the host cell system, which benefits virus survival and replication.
