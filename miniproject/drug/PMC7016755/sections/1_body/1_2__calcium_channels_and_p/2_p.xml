<p>These channels and pumps are activated in a flexible and precise manner to generate specific Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> signaling, satisfying various spatiotemporal requirements. During the viral infections, host cells modulate these calcium-signaling components in response to the infection. On the other hand, viruses utilize these components to create a cellular environment that benefits their own lifecycles [
 <xref rid="B4-cells-09-00094" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Viruses induce elevated cytosolic calcium concentration to activate Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> dependent/sensitive enzymes and transcriptional factors to promote virus replication. Mitochondria could take the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> to generate more energy to support continuous virus replication. Moreover, regulating the calcium concentration in ER or Golgi may inhibit host proteins trafficking and promote virus protein maturation. The inhibition of host proteins frustrates host antiviral immune responses, while the promotion of virus protein maturation benefits virus propagation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00094-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The journey begins when a virus encounters the host cell and attaches to the cell surface. The virus particle penetrates the cytoplasm via direct membrane fusion or receptor-mediated endocytosis followed by exposing its genome to cellular machinery for replication. When the viral proteins and viral genomes are accumulated, they are assembled to form a progeny virion particle and then released [
