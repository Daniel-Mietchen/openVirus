<p>Cellular Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> is from two major sources: the internal Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> store (mainly endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)) and the extracellular medium. Calcium channels on cell plasma membrane mediate the entry of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> from the extracellular medium. These channels are activated by specific stimuli, such as voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), which are stimulated by membrane depolarization, specific receptor-operated channels (ROC), which are stimulated by external agonists, or intracellular messengers and store-operated calcium channel (SOC), which are stimulated by the depletion of internal Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> stores. The IP
 <sub>3</sub> receptor (IP
 <sub>3</sub>R) and the ryanodine receptors (RyR) are the main players in mediating the release of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> from the internal stores. Inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP
 <sub>3</sub>) activates IP
 <sub>3</sub>R, triggers Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> release from stores, and further increases IP
 <sub>3</sub>Râ€™s sensitivity to Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>. Calcium pumps (the plasma membrane Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (PMCA), sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA)) and the Na
 <sup>+</sup>/Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCX) are responsible for transporting Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol to external medium or into cellular calcium stores (

 <sup>2+</sup> homeostasis.
