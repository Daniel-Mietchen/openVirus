<p>Ebola virus (EBOV) used to be considered a VGCC blocker-sensitive virus, and several research groups independently reported that compounds blocking L-type channels (such as verapamil, nimodipine, and diltiazem) inhibited EBOV infection in vivo [

 <xref rid="B23-cells-09-00094" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, gabapentin, representing a fifth distinct class of L-type channel inhibitor, had no effect even at high concentrations. It has been shown that verapamil, nimodipine, and diltiazem also inhibit the activity of two-pore channels (TPCs) [

 <xref rid="B26-cells-09-00094" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking TPC1 or TPC2 expression (Tpcn1
 <sup>−/−</sup>, Tpcn2
 <sup>−/−</sup>) resisted EBOV infection [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00094-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). The calcium channels inhibitors prevented virus–endosome membrane fusion and virus capsid releasing into the cell cytoplasm, which is a late entry step. EBOV acts on TPCs, which control the movement of endosomes containing virus particles, and thereby facilitate its intracellular trafficking [

 <xref rid="B28-cells-09-00094" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The channel inhibitor, tetrandrine, significantly enhanced the survival of mice challenged with mouse-adapted EBOV without any detectable side effects. This indicates that tetrandrine is highly effective against EBOV disease in mice.
