<p>The effect on VGCCs is not only restricted to virus entry. A high-throughput screening of an FDA-approved drug library for inhibitors of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) identified five hit drugs, three of which are VGCCs blockers (manidipine, cilnidipine, and benidipine hydrochloride) [

Recombinant viral particles (RVPs) with the luciferase-reporting replicon were used to quantify the efficiency of JEV replication, which confirmed that these drugs inhibited JEV infection at the stage of replication. These drugs were subsequently validated for their antiviral activities against other flavivirus, such as Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV), and West Nile virus (WNV). Similarly, another research group screened the FDA-approved drug library and found that nifedipine and benidipine hydrochloride inhibited severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) replication in vitro [

These studies indicate that the VGCCs blockers are excellent candidates for broad-spectrum anti-virus treatment. Most of these FDA-approved VGCC blockers are clinically used to treat cardiovascular diseases. Similar to a double-edged sword, the cardiovascular effect of VGCC blockers may limit their antiviral application. Therefore, repurposing these drugs requires more analysis before clinical trials.
