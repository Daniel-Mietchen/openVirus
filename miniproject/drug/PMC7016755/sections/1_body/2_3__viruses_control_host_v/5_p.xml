<p>Taking together, the infections of viruses could increase the hostâ€™s intracellular calcium to facilitate viral entry and replication by manipulating host VGCCs. In addition, herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 could downregulate the VGCCs on infected neuronal cells to escape detection by host cells. T-type Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channels were reported as the targets of HSV-1 in sensory-like ND7-23 cells [

 <xref rid="B20-cells-09-00094" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. HSV-1 infection of differentiated ND7-23 cells causes a significant loss of T-type Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channels from the membrane, which depends on viral replication and protein synthesis. This downregulation of T-type Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channel expression may alter the ability of sensory neurons to transmit pain information. Thus, the lower expression of VGCCs may diminish the detection for viral infection by the host, which benefits virus survival and further infection.
