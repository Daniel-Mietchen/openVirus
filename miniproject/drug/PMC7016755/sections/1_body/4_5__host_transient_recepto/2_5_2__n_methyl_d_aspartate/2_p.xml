<p>The Zika virus infection is a “neurodegenerative” disease. Costa and colleagues showed that blockage of the NMDAr channel activity with FDA-approved memantine or other antagonists prevents neuronal cell death and microgliosis induced by Zika in vitro and in vivo, without affecting the ability of Zika to replicate in the host [

 <xref rid="B59-cells-09-00094" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It seems that NMDAr mainly contributes to Zika, triggering the neuronal cell death progress. Anyway, the blockade of NMDAr may be a viable treatment for patients at risk for Zika infection-induced neurodegeneration [
