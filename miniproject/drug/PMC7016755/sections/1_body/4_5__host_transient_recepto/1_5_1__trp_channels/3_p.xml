<p>The TRPV1, TRPA1, and TRPM8 channels are directly activated by chemical, thermal, and mechanical stimuli. They are potentially associated with respiratory virus-induced airway hypersensitivity [
 <xref rid="B55-cells-09-00094" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The infection of respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), measles virus (MV), and human rhinovirus (HRV), was reported to increase the expression of these channels in sensory neurons and human bronchial epithelium cells [

 <xref rid="B57-cells-09-00094" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The increase in TRPA1 and TRPV1 levels can be mediated by soluble factors induced by infection, whereas TRPM8 requires virus replication [

 <xref rid="B57-cells-09-00094" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. These reports may explain the possible mechanism by which respiratory viruses induce cough. Alternatively, the up-regulated TRP channels may be utilized by the respiratory viruses to create a favorable calcium environment. Further investigation is required to determine the possible pathway by which this happens.
