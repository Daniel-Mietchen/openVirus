<p>TRPV4 mediates intracellular Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> signals in response to several stimuli, including hypotonic cell swelling, mechanical forces, moderating heat, and UVB radiation [
 <xref rid="B51-cells-09-00094" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. When cells are exposed to the Zika virus or the purified viral envelope protein, TRPV4 mediates Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> influx and drives the nuclear translocation of DEAD-box RNA helicase (DDX3X) [
 <xref rid="B52-cells-09-00094" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. DDX3X is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase from the DEAD-box helicase family and is involved in multiple stages of the RNA metabolism, from transcription to translation [

 <xref rid="B54-cells-09-00094" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Moreover, diverse RNA viruses hijack DDX3X to multiply efficiently. Targeting TRPV4 reduces the infectivity of dengue, hepatitis C, and Zika viruses [
