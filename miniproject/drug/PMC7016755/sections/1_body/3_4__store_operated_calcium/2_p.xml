<p>Most enveloped viruses are released extracellularly via exocytosis, also called budding, as an analogy of buds in plants [

 <xref rid="B32-cells-09-00094" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The budding process of the enveloped viruses is triggered by a peptide motif (termed late (L) domains), which was discovered in the Gag polyproteins of retroviruses and M (matrix) proteins of rhabdoviruses [
 <xref rid="B33-cells-09-00094" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These L domains interact with cellular proteins to promote the formation of virus vesicles that bud away from the cytoplasm [
