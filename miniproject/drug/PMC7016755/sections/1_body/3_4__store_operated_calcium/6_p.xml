<p>Calcium influx through the SOC channel also contributes to the elevated cytosolic calcium concentration induced by rotavirus (RV) infection. It has been well established that the dramatically increased cellular Ca

Thus, in rotavirus-infected cells, STIM1 is constitutively active and colocalizes with the ORAI1 channel. The knockdown of STIM1 or the pharmacological inhibition of SOC channels significantly reduced rotavirus yield, indicating that the SOC channel plays a critical role in the RV lifecycle [
