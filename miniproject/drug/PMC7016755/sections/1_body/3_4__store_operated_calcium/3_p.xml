<p>The research work done on four distinct hemorrhagic fever viruses (Ebolavirus (EBOV), Marburgvirus (MARV), Lassa Virus (LASV), and Jun√≠n Virus (JUNV)) demonstrated that EBOV, MARV VP40, and JUNV Z proteins trigger host cell Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> signals by activating the ER Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> sensing protein STIM1 and the plasma membrane ORAI1 channel. The STIM1/Orai1-mediated Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> signal is critical for EBOV and related viruses budding from host cells [

Similarly to hemorrhagic fever viruses, the HIV-1 matrix protein Gag, directing HIV-1 budding, and mediating VLP (Virus-like Particle) formation also exhibit dependence on Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> regulation [
