<p>The calcium pumps (Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> ATPase) and the Na
 <sup>+</sup>â€“Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> exchanger are the main regulators of intracellular Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> concentrations [
 <xref rid="B67-cells-09-00094" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Three Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> ATPase types (pumps) have been described in animal cells located in the membranes of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA pump), in those of the Golgi network (Secretory Pathway Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> ATPase, SPCA pump), and in the plasma membrane (PMCA pump) [
 <xref rid="B68-cells-09-00094" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. At the end of a stimulus, these pumps participate in returning the cell to its resting state by the decrease in the cytosolic Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration. For example, SERCA transports Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> from the cytoplasm into the lumen of the ER. PMCA pumps function to remove Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> from the cell. They serve as the main regulators of intracellular and extracellular Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> concentrations. All three calcium pumps are reported to be involved in different viral lifecycles.
