<p>The journey of viral infections is also a procedure during which a virus grabs the host intracellular calcium signaling system and homeostasis to benefit its own lifecycle. The disturbance of the host Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> system by virus may suppress T-cell responsiveness, antiapoptotic, and other protentional functions. In this review, we summarized the calcium permeable channels and calcium pumps located on host cell membranes that may be potential therapeutic targets for viral infections (
 <xref rid="cells-09-00094-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, the calcium channel family is continuously being refreshed with the discovery of new members, and the effect of viruses on the host intracellular calcium environment is not often achieved through a single pathway; it is more complicated. Both upstream messengers and downstream Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> binding proteins are targets for pharmacological intervention. Thus, explicating the entire picture of all aspects of the calciumâ€“virus interplay at the molecular level will be a challenge in the future.
