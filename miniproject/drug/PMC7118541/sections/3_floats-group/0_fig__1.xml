  <p>Comparison of MT-DTI and AutoDock Vina results. 60 known FDA-approved antiviral drugs (left) and 3410 FDA-approved drugs (right) were evaluated by means of the MT-DTI deep learning-based affinity score (higher is better), and AutoDock Vina docking score (lower is better). Remdesivir, which is not an FDA-approved drug, but regarded as a promising antiviral drug for SARS-CoV-2, was included in this analysis.</p>
