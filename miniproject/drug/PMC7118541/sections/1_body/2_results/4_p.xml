 </italic> 11.91 nM), 3′-to-5′ exonuclease (
 <italic>K
  <sub>d</sub>
 </italic> 56.29 nM), and RNA helicase (

 </italic> 108.21 nM). Lopinavir and ritonavir, active materials of AbbVie’s Kaletra, both were predicted to have a potential affinity to COVID-19 helicase (
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) and are suggested as potential MERS therapeutics 
 <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Recently, approximately $2 million worth of Kaletra doses were donated to China 
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, and a previous clinical study of SARS by Chu et al. 
 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> may support this decision 
 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Another anti-HIV drug, Prezcobix of Johnson &amp; Johnson, which consists of darunavir and cobicistat, was to be sent to China 
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, and darunavir is also predicted to have a

 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). However, there was no current supporting literature found for darunavir to be used as a CoV therapeutic. Although remdesivir is not a FDA approved drug, its predicted potency to COVID-19 resulted as follows: against RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (
