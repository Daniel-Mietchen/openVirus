<p id="p0065">To identify potent FDA-approved drugs that may inhibit the functions of SARS-CoV-2′s core proteins, we used the MT-DTI deep learning-based model, which can accurately predict binding affinities based on chemical sequences (SMILES) and amino acid sequences (FASTA) of a target protein, without their structural information 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This deep learning-based approach is particularly useful, since it does not require protein structural information, which can be a bottleneck for identifying drugs targeted for uncharacterized proteins with traditional three-dimensional (3D) structure-based docking approaches 
 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Neverthless, MT-DTI showed the best performance 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> when compared to a deep learning-based (DeepDTA) approach 
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and two traditional machine learning-based algorithms SimBoost 
 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and KronRLS 
 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, with the KIBA 
 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and DAVIS 
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> data sets. Taking advantage of this sequence-based drug-target affinity prediction approach, binding affinities of 3,410 FDA-approved drugs against 3C-like proteinase, RdRp, helicase, 3′-to-5′ exonuclease, endoRNAse, and 2′-O-ribose methyltransferase of SARS-CoV-2 were predicted. To confirm the performance of MT-DTI at least 
 <italic>in silico</italic>, we compared the binding affinities of 3,410 FDA-approved drugs predicted by MT-DTI to those estimated by AutoDock Vina (a widely used 3D structure-based docking algorithm). It was possible since the 3D structure of the 3C-like proteinase protein was recently unveiled by the X-ray crystallography (PDBID 6LU7) 
 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Significant negative correlations, meaning that the results of both algorithms showed moderate similarities (higher is better for MT-DTI, whereas lower is better for AutoDock Vina) were observed in both the antiviral drug dataset (R = −0.34, and 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.0071) and the FDA-approved drug dataset (R = −0.32, and 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 2.2e−16) (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). While it is not possible to determine which algorithm is more reliable without various experimental evaluations, a previous study showed that the MT-DTI model is one of the best deep learning-based models that can predict the binding affinity between a given protein and compound 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Therefore, we further applied the MT-DTI model to repurpose those FDA-approved drugs that have the potential to inhibit key proteins of SARS-CoV-2.
