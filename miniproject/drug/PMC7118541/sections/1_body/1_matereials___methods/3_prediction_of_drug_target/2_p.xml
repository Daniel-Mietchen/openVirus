<p id="p0045">Molecule transformer-drug target interaction (MT-DTI) was used to predict binding affinity values between commercially available antiviral drugs and target proteins. MT-DTI is based on the self-attention mechanism that showed remarkable success in natural language process (NLP) literature. MT-DTI is inspired by the idea that for a chemist, understanding a molecule sequence is analogous to understanding a language. To apply the NLP model to drug-target interaction (DTI) tasks, MT-DTI is pre-trained with ‘chemical language’ (represented as SMILES) of approximately 1,000,000,000 compounds. Similar to the NLP model, which successfully extracts complex patterns from word sequences, MT-DTI successfully finds useful information in DTI tasks. Therefore, it shows the best performance and most robust results in diverse DTI datasets according to a previous study
