<p id="p0050">To train the model, the Drug Target Common (DTC) database 
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and BindingDB 
 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> database were manually curated and combined. Three types of efficacy value, 
 <italic>K
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic>, 
 <italic>K
  <sub>d</sub>
 </italic>, and IC
 <sub>50</sub> were integrated by a consistence-score-based averaging algorithm 
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> to make the Pearson correlation score over 0.9 in terms of 
 <italic>K
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic>, 
 <italic>K
  <sub>d</sub>
 </italic>, and IC
 <sub>50</sub>. Since the BindingDB database includes a wide variety of species and target proteins, the MT-DTI model has the potential power to predict interactions between antiviral drugs and SARS-CoV-2 proteins.
