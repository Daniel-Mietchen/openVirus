<p id="p0060">AutoDock Vina (version 1.1.2), which is a molecular docking and virtual screening application 
 <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, was used to predict binding affinities (kcal/mol) between 3C-like proteinase of SARS-CoV-2 and 3,410 FDA-approved drugs. SMILES of 3,410 FDA-approved drugs were converted to the PDBQT format using Open Babel (version 2.3.2) 
 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> with the following options: --gen3d and -p 7.4. The hydrogens were added to the 3C-like proteinase model using MGLTools (version 1.5.6) 
 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Then, binding affinities between the protein and FDA-approved drugs were calculated using AutoDock Vina. The exhaustiveness parameter was set to 10.
