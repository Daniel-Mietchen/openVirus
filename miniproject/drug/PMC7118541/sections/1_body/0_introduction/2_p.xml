 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Two infamous infectious coronaviruses in the genus

 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 
 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, which have infected more than 10,000 people around the world in the past two decades. Unfortunately, the incidence was accompanied by high mortality rates (9.6% for SARS-CoV and 34.4% for MERS-CoV), indicating that there is an urgent need for effective treatment at the beginning of the outbreak to prevent the spread

 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, this cannot be achieved with current drug development or an application system, taking several years for newly developed drugs to come to the market. Unexpectedly, the world is facing the same situation as the previous outbreak due to a recent epidemic of atypical pneumonia (designated as coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China
