<p id="p0090">Our results showed the following intriguing findings that need to be tested experimentally and clinically in the near future. First, MT-DTI generally showed similar results overall compared to the conventional 3D structure-based prediction model, AutoDock Vina, but some differences were observed. For example, atazanavir, remdesivir, and efavirenz were the top three predicted drugs that may bind to the 3C-like proteinase of SARS-CoV-2. This is while saquinavir, nelfinavir, and grazoprevir were the top three drugs identified by AutoDock Vina (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Secondly, when the search space was expanded to all FDA-approved drugs, some immunosuppressant drugs (rapamycin and everolimus) and a drug (tiotropium bromide) for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were identified as promising candidates by MT-DTI. In contrast, AutoDock Vina predicted purmorphanime, lumacaftor, and verrucarin A were the top three drugs that could bind to the 3C-like proteinase of SARS-CoV-2. However, there is currently no supporting evidence that these drugs may be effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. Lastly, atazanavir appears to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19 by showing overall high binding affinities among tested antivirals for six proteins of SARS-CoV-2 including 3C-like proteinase and the replication complex components (
