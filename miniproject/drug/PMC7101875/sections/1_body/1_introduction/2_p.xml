<p id="Par8">When responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, medical services are under great pressure. An effective coordinated pharmacy support system and event-driven pharmaceutical care activities are needed. Mobile cabin hospitals, the “Square Cabin Hospitals” have been built in Wuhan, China (the epidemic epicenter in China) to treat patients with mild symptoms of the virus. Pharmacists are actively engaging in the public health operation in China since the outbreak, either at their home hospitals and community pharmacies or at the square cabin hospitals in Wuhan.
