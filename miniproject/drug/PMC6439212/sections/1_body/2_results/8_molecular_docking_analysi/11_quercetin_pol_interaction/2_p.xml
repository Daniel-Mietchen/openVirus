<p id="p0155">Quercetin (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>I) binds at the active site of HBV Pol by forming nine hydrogen bonds with Lys32, Asn36, Arg41, Ala86, Ala87, Phe88, Asp83 and Val84 (
 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>I). It also forms two Pi-cation (with Lys32 and Arg41) and one Pi-anion electrostatic interactions (with Asp83). Further, it forms two hydrophobic interactions (Pi-alkyl) with Arg41 and Met171. Other residues that surrounded quercetin were Ser40, Leu42, Val84, Ser85, Tyr89, His160 and Asp205 of YMDD motif. The Gibb's free energy of quercetin-Pol interaction was predicted to be −7.4 kcal/molwhich corresponded to a binding constant of 2.7 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>/mol (
