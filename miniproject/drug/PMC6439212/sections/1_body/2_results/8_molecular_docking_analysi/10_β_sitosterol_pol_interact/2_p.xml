<p id="p0150">β-Sitosterol (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>H) interacted with HBV Pol by forming one Pi-sigma hydrophobic interaction with Trp3, five alkyl hydrophobic interactions with Pro4, Arg41, Leu42 and Met171, and ten Pi-alkyl hydrophobic interactions with Trp3, Phe88, Tyr89 and His160 (
 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>H). Other residues that surrounded β-sitosterol were Thr38, Glu39, Ser40, Ala86 and Ala87. The Gibb's free energy of β-sitosterol-Pol interaction was found to be −8.3 kcal/mol that corresponded to a binding constant of 1.2 × 10
