<p id="p0110">To gain an insight into the binding mechanism of selected natural compounds to HBV Pol, we performed molecular docking using Autodock Vina in PyRx virtual screening tool. The amino acid residues and the type of interactions responsible for forming a stable HBV Pol-inhibitor complex are presented in
