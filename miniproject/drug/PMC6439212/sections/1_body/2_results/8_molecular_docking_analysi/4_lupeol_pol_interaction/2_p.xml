<p id="p0120">Lupeol (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B) interacted with HBV Pol by forming four alkyl hydrophobic interactions with Pro5, Leu42 and Arg120, and six Pi-alkyl hydrophobic interactions with Trp3, His156 and Tyr158 (
 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B). Other residues that surrounded lupeol were Glu1, Asp2, Ser40, Ser117, Asn118, Ser119 and Leu157. The Gibb's free energy of lupeol-Pol interaction was predicted to be −8.1 kcal/mol which corresponded to a binding constant of 8.7 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>/mol (
