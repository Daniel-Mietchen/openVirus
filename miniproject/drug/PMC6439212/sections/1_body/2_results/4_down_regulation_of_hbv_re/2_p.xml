<p id="p0090">The HBV secretory protein ‘e’ antigen (HBeAg) is a processed product of the ‘
 <italic>pre-Core</italic>’ gene that is co-translated with ‘
 <italic>Core</italic>’ by a bicistronic subgenomic-RNA. Therefore, in natural infection, seropositivity of HBeAg is a hallmark of active viral DNA replication (

 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Beck and Nassal, 2007</xref>). Notably, this is analogous to HIV ‘p24′ antigen where ELISA is a valid tool to monitor retroviral RNA replication (
 <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Cunningham et al., 1993</xref>). We therefore, further evaluated the antiviral compounds on their inhibitory effect on HBeAg production for five days (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Notably, prolonged treatment beyond day 5 did not show any significant effect and further continuation resulted in cell overgrowth and death (data not shown). The estimated antiviral activities of the compounds on day 5 post-treatment were: quercetin (73%) &gt; baccatin III (71%) &gt; psoralen (67%) &gt; embelin (65.5%) &gt; menisdaurin (64%) &gt; azadirachtin (62%) &gt; lupeol (52.5%) &gt; rutin (47.5%) &gt; β-sitosterol (43%) &gt; hesperidin (41%). Of these, while six compounds (quercitin, psoralen, baccatin III, menisdaurin, embelin and azadirachtin) showed promising efficacies, four (lupeol, rutin, β-sitosterol and hesperidin) had moderate anti-HBV activities.
