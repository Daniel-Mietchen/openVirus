Unfortunately, despite their high efficacies, majority of approved anti-HBV drugs have some therapeutic limitations. While long-term treatment with HBV Pol inhibitors, the nucleot(s)ide analogs (e.g., lamivudine, adepovir, entecavir etc.) leads to the emergence of drug-resistance in the Pol ‘Tyr-Met-Asp-Asp (YMDD)’ motif, the interferon (pegIFN-α) chemotherapy causes adverse side-effects in some patients (
