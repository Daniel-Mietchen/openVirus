<p id="p0190">Menisdaurin, a plant cyanoglycoside has very limited information on its antiviral activities. The two reports on anti-HBV activity of menisdaurin isolated from 
 <italic>Saniculiphyllum guangxiense</italic> (
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Geng et al., 2012</xref>) and mangrove 
 <italic>Bruguiera gymnorrhiza</italic> (
 <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">Yi et al., 2015</xref>) are recently published. In line with this, our data endorsed its 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-HBV potential. Contrarily however, in our study menisdaurin’s activity was lesser as compared to its reported higher activity to lamivudine (
 <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">Yi et al., 2015</xref>). In the docking analysis, menisdaurin-HBV Pol interaction was through Lys241, Asn248, Met250 and Gln267 that predicted the free energy of −6.5 kcal/mol. Notably therein, one of the Pol ‘YMDD’ residues, Asp206 was among the menisdaurin surrounding amino acids.
