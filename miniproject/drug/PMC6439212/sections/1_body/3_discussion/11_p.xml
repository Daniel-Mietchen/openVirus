<p id="p0215">Plant β-sitosterol has been shown to exhibit 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-HIV activity (Bouic, 1997). Recently, antiviral effect of β-sitosterol isolated from cottonseed oil against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is also reported (
 <xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). This is the first report showing the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-HBV activity of β-sitosterol. This was further supported by our 
 <italic>in silico</italic> analysis where β-sitosterol interacted with HBV Pol through Trp3, Pro4, Arg41, Leu42, Phe88, Tyr89, His160 and Met171 where the free energy of β-sitosterol-Pol complex was −8.3 kcal/mol.
