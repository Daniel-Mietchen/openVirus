<p id="p0210">Rutin, a well-known therapeutic flavonol has been reported for

 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Alam et al., 2017</xref>). Though moderate, the anti-HBV activity of rutin in the present study strongly supported our previous finding. When subjected to docking, rutin interacted with HBV Pol by forming bonds with Asn33, Asn36, Arg41, Ser81, Asp83 and Asn248 residues where the rutin-pol complex showed a free energy of −9.2 kcal/mol. Notably therein, Asp 205 and Asp206, the ‘YMDD’ residues were among the rutin surrounding amino acids.
