<p id="p0180">Psoralen is a natural caumarin that has been recently reported to inhibit Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) replication (
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2013</xref>). To add further, our data presented the novel antiviral potential of psoralen against HBV replication. Molecular docking showed the interaction of psoralen with HBV Pol through Lys32, Arg41 and His160 where the stable psoralen-Pol complex had a free energy of −6.4 kcal/mol.
