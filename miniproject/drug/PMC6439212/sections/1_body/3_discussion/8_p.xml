<p id="p0200">Azadirachtin is the secondary metabolite of Indian neem (
 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic>). In a single report, while the neem leaves extract showed inhibition of dengue virus (DNV) replication, the pure azadirachtin did not reveal any inhibitory effect 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (
 <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Parida et al., 2002</xref>). In this report we demonstrated the novel anti-HBV activity of azadirachtin. Our docking study showed interaction of azadiractin with HBV Pol through Glu1, Pro5, His156, Ser117, Arg120 and Arg153, resulting in a stable azadiractin-Pol complex with a free energy of −8.1 kcal/mol.
