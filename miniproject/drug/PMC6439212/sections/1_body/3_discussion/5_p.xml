<p id="p0185">Baccatin III is isolated from the needles of the Pacific yew tree, and synthetically available as 10-deacetylbaccatin III. Baccatin III is widely assumed to be an inactive derivative of taxol, isolated from 
 <italic>Taxus brevifolia</italic> bark. Though in a single 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study, Baccarin III has shown anti-HSV activity at non-cytotoxic dose (
 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Krawczyk et al., 2005</xref>); its mechanism of action is not known. In conformity, our results, for the first time, showed a high anti-HBV activity of baccatin III. Docking of baccatin III with HBV pol showed the interaction through Asn33, Asn36, Asp83, Lys241, Asn248 and Met250 residues that formed the baccatin-Pol complex with a free energy of −7.0 kcal/mol. Notably, Asp205 and Asp206 of the ‘YMDD’ motif was among the baccatin III surrounding amino acids.
