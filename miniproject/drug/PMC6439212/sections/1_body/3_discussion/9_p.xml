<p id="p0205">Though the triterpenoid lupeol has shown weak antiviral activities in several studies, lupeol isolated from 
 <italic>Strobilanthes cusia</italic> root has demonstrated a robust anti-HSV activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Flekhter et al., 2004</xref>). It has therefore, served as a lead drug for the generation of more effective compounds against HSV and Influenza A (Zheng et al., 2009). In line with its antiviral activities, we showed the moderate anti-HBV potential of lupeol 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. In our 
 <italic>in silico</italic> analysis, lupeol interacted with HBV Pol through Trp3, Pro5, Leu42 and Arg120, His156 and Tyr158, and stabilized the lupeol-Pol complex with a free energy −8.1 kcal/mol.
