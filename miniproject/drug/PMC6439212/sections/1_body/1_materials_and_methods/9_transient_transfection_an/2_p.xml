<p id="p0060">To rule out the inhibitory effect of the tested antiviral compounds on host-synthesized proteins, luciferase assay was performed as described previously (
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Al-Dosari and Parvez, 2018</xref>). Briefly, HepG2.2.15 cells were transfected with Renilla-luciferase plasmid (pRL-TK; Promega, USA) using FuGENE6 (Promega, USA) in a 48-well culture plate, following treatment (10 μg/ml; in triplicate) with all compounds, including DMSO (0.1%) as untreated control. After 2 days of incubation (i.e., day 3 post-transfection), cell lysates were prepared and luciferase expression was measured (Luciferase Reporter Assay System; Promega, USA), and data were presented in relation to the negative control.
