 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Daga et al., 2010</xref>) was used as query to search protein database for the identification of a suitable template with known X-ray crystal structure. The X-ray crystal structure of genetically-close HIV-RT (PDB Id: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:1RTD" id="ir020" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">1RTD</ext-link>) was selected as template to model the HBV Pol structure as reported previously (
 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 1998</xref>). Swiss model server was used for the prediction of three-dimensional structure of HBV Pol (
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Arnold et al., 2006</xref>). The quality of the predicted structure was validated by Ramachandran plot using RAMPAGE server (
