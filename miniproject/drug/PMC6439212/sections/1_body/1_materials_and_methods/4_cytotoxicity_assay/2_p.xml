<p id="p0035">All compounds were first tested for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cytotoxic effects, if any, on cultured HepG2.2.15 cells. Cells were seeded (0.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> well, in triplicate) in a 96-well flat-bottom culture plate (Becton-Dickinson Labware) and grown over night. Compounds were first dissolved in 50 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) following final preparation in culture media (1 mg/ml). Five doses (2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 50 μg/ml) of each compound were further prepared by diluting in culture media
 <bold>.</bold> The final concentration of DMSO used never exceeded &gt;0.1%, and therefore, had no cytotoxicity. RPMI with 0.1% DMSO served as untreated or negative control. The cultures were replenished with media containing a dose of the drug, and incubated for 48 h followed by MTT assay (TACS MTT Cell Proliferation Assay Kit, Trevigen) as per the manufacturer’s manual. The 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) for all compounds were determined using regression curve in Excel software. The experiment was repeated to confirm the reproducibility.
