<p id="par0030">Here, we detail the steps of BSAA repurposing, from discovery of novel antiviral activities in cell culture to post-market studies. Moreover, we summarized currently available information on BSAAs in freely available database, focusing on those antivirals, which have been already tested in human as antivirals, antibacterials, antiprotozoals, anthelmintics, etc. Finally, we discuss future perspectives of using safe-in-man BSAAs for treatment of emerging and re-emerging viral infections as well as viral and bacterial co-infections.</p>
