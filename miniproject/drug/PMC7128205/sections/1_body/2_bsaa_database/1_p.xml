<p id="par0115">We have developed a database for safe-in-man BSAAs, which is available at 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://drugvirus.info/" id="intr0025" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://drugvirus.info/</ext-link> (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> ). The drug annotations were obtained from PubChem, DrugBank, DrugCentral, PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov databases (Table S1) (
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2019</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0485" ref-type="bibr">Ursu et al., 2019</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0510" ref-type="bibr">Wishart et al., 2018</xref>). The information on virus families was exported from Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (Table S2) (
 <xref rid="bib0360" ref-type="bibr">Pickett et al., 2012</xref>). The database summarizes activities and developmental status of BSAAs. We decided to set no limits for EC50, SI and statistical significance because the studies were not harmonized (different cell lines, assays, end-point measurements, time of compound addition, etc.). The database allows interactive exploration of virus-BSAA interactions. It also includes information on BSA targets. A feedback form is available on the website. The database will be updated upon request or as soon as a new safe-in-man BSAA emerges or novel activity for an existing BSAA is reported.
