<p id="par0120">Altogether, the database contains 120 approved, investigational and experimental safe-in-man BSAAs, which inhibit 86 human viruses, belonging to 25 viral families. The BSAAs inhibit viral or host factors and block viral replication, reduce the viral burden to a level at which host immune responses can deal with it or facilitate apoptosis of infected cells (Table S1). Analysis of BSAA targets and structures (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> ) revealed that the most abundant are nucleotide and nucleoside analogues which inhibit viral RNA and DNA polymerases. Imatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, and dasatinib, which inhibit tyrosine kinases, are the most abundant host-directed BSAAs. Most of the host targets (except Bcl-xL protein) are essential for viral replication but redundant for the cell, which is critical for reducing putative toxicities associated with blocking cellular pathways. The limited diversity of the targets and scaffolds could slow down the development of BSAA concept.
