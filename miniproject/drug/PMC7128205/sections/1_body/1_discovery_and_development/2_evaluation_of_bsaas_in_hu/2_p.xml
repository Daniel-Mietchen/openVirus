<p id="par0060">Primary cells are cells isolated directly from tissues or blood using enzymatic or mechanical methods. The cells are characterized by their high degrees of specialization, are often fully differentiated and thus require defined culture conditions (serum-free media) in order to preserve their original phenotype. Peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC), placental, amniotic and fetal primary cultures as well as vaginal/cervical epithelial and male germ cells have been used intensively to validate BSAA activity (

Although primary cell cultures are relevant systems for validation of BSAAs, there are technical difficulties limiting their use, such as ethical issues, purity of population of primary cells, and limited shelf life of the cells. In addition, age, race, sex and other genetic and epigenetic factors of donor cells should be considered to determine common biological effect across a significant number of donors thereby avoiding minor variants (
