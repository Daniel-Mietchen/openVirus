<p id="par0065">The obstacles associated with use of human primary cell cultures can be bypassed using human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). ESCs are isolated from surplus human embryos, whereas iPSCs are obtained by reprogramming somatic cells. These cells proliferate extensively and retain multi-lineage activity, which allows them to generate virtually any cell type of the body. The ESCs- and iPSC-derived cells have been used successfully to investigate the efficacy of several BSAAs against HBV, ZIKV, CHIKV and HSV-1 infections (Table S1) (
