<p id="par0070">iPSCs, ESCs and primary tissue cells can be used to generate complex cultures termed organoids. Organoids are miniature and simplified version of organs. Establishing human airway, gut, skin, cerebral, liver, kidney, breast, retina and brain organoids allowed researchers to study toxicity and efficacy of several safe-in-man BSAAs against coronaviruses, influenza, enteroviruses, rotaviruses and flaviviruses (

However, iPSCs, ESCs and iPSCs/ESCs-derived organoids have the same disadvantages as human primary cells (genetic differences, line-to-line and organoid batch-to-batch variability). On the other hand, these models allow researchers to predict the behavior of viruses in vivo and, therefore, to reduce animal use and in cases where animal models are unavailable to initiate clinical trials.
