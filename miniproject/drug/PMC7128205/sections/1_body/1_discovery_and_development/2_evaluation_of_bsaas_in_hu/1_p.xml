<p id="par0055">Immortalized cell cultures/co-cultures and reporter viral strains represent excellent model systems for the discovery of novel activities of safe-in-man BSAAs. However, these genetically modified systems have certain limitations (attenuated or incomplete virus replication cycle, accumulation of mutations during repeated cell and virus passaging, defective innate immune responses and viral counter-responses, etc.) (
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Carter and Shieh, 2015</xref>). Thereby, novel antiviral activities of BSAAs should be further validated in primary human cells using different viral strains (including wild-type viruses), different viral loads, different times of compound addition, different endpoint measurements and compound concentration range. Primary cell cultures give more accurate images of drug responses (
