<p id="par0090">Clinical trials are the most critical and time-consuming step of a drug candidatesâ€™ journey to being approved (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). However, safe-in-man BSAAs make this journey relatively short, because they have been already at phase 0, I and, sometime, at IIa of clinical trials as antibacterial, antiprotozoal, anticancer, etc. agent; i.e. they have been administered at sub-therapeutic doses to healthy volunteers to ensure the drugs are not harmful to the participants. Thus, safe-in-man BSAAs enter phase II and III, which assess the efficacy, effectiveness, safety and side effects of the drugs in clinic. It is important, however, to differentiate acute and chronic viral infections when repurposing BSAAs, given that drug concentrations and duration of the treatment could be different, and therefore, drug safety issues should be considered.
