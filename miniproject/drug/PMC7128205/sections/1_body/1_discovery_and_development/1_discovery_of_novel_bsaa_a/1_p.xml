<p id="par0035">The discovery of novel activities of BSAAs starts with exposing cells to the candidate antiviral agent at different concentrations and infecting the cells with a virus or mock. Immortalized cancerous cell cultures and co-cultures, which express appropriate viral receptors, are most commonly used in this first step. The half-maximal cytotoxic concentrations (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) for a compound are calculated based on their dose-response curves obtained on mock-infected cells. The half-maximal effective concentrations (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) are calculated based on the analysis of curves obtained on infected cells. Statistical analyses can help to determine if the differences between CC
 <sub>50</sub> and EC
 <sub>50</sub> are significant, given the inherent variability of the experiment (

 <sub>50</sub>/EC
 <sub>50</sub>).
