<p id="par0080">In vitro and ex vivo models do not fully reflect the complexity and physiology of living organisms. Therefore, several in vivo models have been developed to test novel antiviral activities of BSAAs. These include immunocompetent and genetically or chemically immunocompromised mice, guinea pigs, hamsters, ferrets, pigs, macaques and other animals (

Studying the efficacy of BSAAs is generally done by treating the animal with the drug or vehicle and infecting it with a virus of interest. Endpoints are usually body weight/ mortality (depending on the virus), histopathology, virus titers in organs, presence of clinical signs and development of immunity (

Although animal models can give the initial characterization of BSAA, it is important to keep in mind that they differ significantly from humans, with respect to symptoms, disease manifestation, susceptibility, immune responses, pathogenesis, and pharmacokinetics (
