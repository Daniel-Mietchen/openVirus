 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> ). For example, teicoplanin, oritavancin, dalbavancin, monensin and emetine could be repurposed for treatment of COVID-19. Teicoplanin, ritavancin, dalbavancin and monensin are approved antibiotics, whereas emetine is an anti-protozoal drug. These drugs have been shown to inhibit several corona- as well as some other viral infections . Moreover, chloroquine and remdesivir were shown to effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. In addition, clinical investigations into the effectiveness of lopinavir, ritonavir, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and arbidol against COVID-19 have started recently (NCT04252664; NCT0425487; NCT04255017; NCT04261517, NCT04260594).
