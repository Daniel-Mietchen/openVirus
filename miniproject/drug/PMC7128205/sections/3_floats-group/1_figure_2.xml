  <p>ABC of BSAA development process. (A) Testing BSAA toxicity (left panel) and efficacy (right panel) in immortalized cell cultures and co-cultures. (B) Testing BSAA toxicity (left panel) and efficacy (right panel) in animal models. If BSAA is repositioned from another disease (i.e. its PK/PD and toxicity profiles are available for the animal model) it could bypass the safety studies. (C) Clinical trials of BSAAs. (Left panel) Pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety studies. (Right panel) Efficacy studies. If the drug is repositioned from another disease (i.e. its safety profile in man is available) it could bypass the PK and safety studies in man.</p>
