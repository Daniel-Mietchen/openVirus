<p>The development of vaccines against SFTSV infection has been attempted (Dong et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Kwak et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The development of specific treatment for SFTS is crucial because SFTSV infection is relatively rare and the affected patients are mainly elderly. Some proposed treatments for SFTS include steroid pulse therapy (Nakamura et al., 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), plasma exchange (Oh et al., 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Yoo et al., 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), and antiviral drugs (Saijo, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>); however, their effectiveness remains unclear.
