<p>Sufficient animal models are required to evaluate the efficacy of antiviral drugs in the treatment of SFTSV infections. However, adult mice and hamsters are not susceptible to SFTSV infection (Jin et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and non-human primate models show only mild symptoms similar to those of SFTS in humans (Jin et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Only several immunodeficient or immature animal models are available (Gowen and Hickerson, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Mice deficient in α/β interferon receptor (IFNAR
 <sup>−/−</sup>) (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Tani et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and mice and Syrian hamsters deficient for the gene encoding signal transducer and the activator of transcription 2 (STAT2
 <sup>−/−</sup>) (Gowen et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Yoshikawa et al., 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) were found to be susceptible to SFTSV infection following subcutaneous inoculation, and newborn mice and rats were susceptible to SFTSV infection when inoculated intracerebrally (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Zivcec et al., 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Ning et al., 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).
