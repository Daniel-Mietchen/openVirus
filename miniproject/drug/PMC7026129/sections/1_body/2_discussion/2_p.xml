<p>Favipiravir exhibited higher effectiveness than ribavirin in

 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Meanwhile, favipiravir remained effective when it was used following SFTSV infection in animal models (Tani et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Gowen et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) indicating its potential as an effective drug for treating SFTS patient. Currently, clinical trials are underway to evaluate the efficacy of favipiravir for treating patients with SFTS in Japan (Cyranoski, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Spengler et al., 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Besides, it would be desirable to use intravenous administration because SFTS patients with severe symptoms could have difficulty in taking drugs orally.
