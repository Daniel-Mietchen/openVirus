<p>Since then, a considerable number of studies regarding its epidemiological and virological characteristics have been conducted. Ribavirin, one of a broad-spectrum antiviral drug (Beaucourt and Vignuzzi, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), is recommended for patients with SFTS in China, and it has been used to treat a considerable number of patients (Ministry of Health People's Republic of China, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies on ribavirin (Shimojima et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Tani et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Gowen et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) showed the considerable effect. The results of the clinical study conducted by Liu et al. (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), which showed that ribavirin did not reduce the fatality rate of patients with SFTS, discouraged us from considering ribavirin treatment for treating patients with SFTS. However, Li et al. (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) reported that ribavirin is effective for early-stage patients with a low viral titer or for the pretreatment of exposed individuals. Nevertheless, in cases of ribavirin administration, patients should be intensely monitored because of the possible adverse events induced by ribavirin such as anemia and hyperamylasemia (Lu et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).
