<p>CCBs, which are used to control cardiovascular diseases, have demonstrated significant effects against SFTSV replication both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Notably, retrospectively conducted clinical study suggested that nifedipine remarkably reduced the case fatality rate in SFTS patients (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Although nifedipine is administrated consistently for patients with cardiac disease, these findings are valuable for developing potential CCB-based therapeutics for SFTS. It is considered that the efficacy of nifedipine in treating patients with SFTS should be evaluated in a prospective manner. For clinical use, careful consideration of the risk-to-benefit value to the patient would be required because an overdose of CCBs has a high-risk of side effects, such as edema, liver damage, and death. The dose used for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse study (100 mg/kg/day) was extremely higher than the dose generally used for humans (~0.2â€“1.5 mg/kg/day). Still, these findings indicated the potential therapeutic effect of CCB treatment in patients with SFTS.
