<p>CA shows inhibitory effects against SFTSV 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Little is known about the mechanism of the action, but it was considered that CA interacts with the viral particles, showing inhibitory effects (Ogawa et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Because there are limited reports regarding antiviral effects of CA or chlorogenic acid

 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Ding et al.,
