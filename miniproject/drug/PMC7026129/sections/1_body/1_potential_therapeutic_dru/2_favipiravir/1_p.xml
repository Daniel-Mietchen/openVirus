<p>Favipiravir (T-705), which was discovered and synthesized by Toyama Chemical Co., Ltd., exerts a broad spectrum of activity against various RNA viruses, including the influenza virus, arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, and foot-and-mouth disease virus (Furuta et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Favipiravir is converted to its active form, ribofuranosyl-5-triphosphate, by host enzymes and inhibits viral RNA polymerase in the host cells. Only a few reports have indicated resistance to favipiravir

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Goldhill et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref> favipiravir significantly inhibits SFTSV replication 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (Tani et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Baba et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (Tani et al.,

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Smee et al., 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Furthermore, the IC
 <sub>90</sub> of favipiravir (22 μM) in Vero cells (Tani et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) was lower than that of ribavirin (263 μM) (Shimojima et al.,
