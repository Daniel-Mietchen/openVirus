<p>Shimojima et al. (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) first reported the efficacy of ribavirin 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> using three cell lines: monkey kidney-derived Vero, human hepatoma-derived Huh7, and human osteosarcoma-derived U2OS cells. When treated with ribavirin before and during infection with SFTSV, the 99% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>99</sub>) of ribavirin was 263, 83, and 78 μM in Vero, Huh7, and U2OS cells, respectively (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, when Vero cells were treated with ribavirin 3 days after the inoculation, the inhibitory effect was dramatically decreased, suggesting that ribavirin could be used as post-exposure prophylaxis for the prevention of SFTS and also mentioned that ribavirin could be effective as part of a combination therapy to treat SFTS patients (Shimojima et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The efficacy of ribavirin against SFTSV replication was also observed in another study, where Vero cells infected with a Korean SFTSV strain were treated at 24 and 48 h post inoculation, and the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) range was 3.69–8.72 μg/mL (Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Despite several differences in viral strains and treatment procedure, ribavirin suppressed SFTS replication, suggesting that it was effective against various SFTSVs for at least 48 h after SFTSV inoculation.
