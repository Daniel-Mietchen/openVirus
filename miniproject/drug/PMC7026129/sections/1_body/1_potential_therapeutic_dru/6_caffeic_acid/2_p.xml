<p>Ogawa et al. (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) showed that CA dose-dependently inhibited SFTSV replication in an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assay using Huh7.5.1-8 cells, a highly permissive derivative of human hepatoma Huh7 cells. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> of CA against SFTSV was 48 Î¼M, and its CC
 <sub>50</sub> was 7.6 mM (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, pretreatment of SFTSV with CA prior to inoculation effectively reduced the virus copy number in the supernatant of infected cells at 72 h post infection, and the inhibitory effect was significantly reduced when the cells were treated with CA after SFTSV inoculation. Thus, the authors speculated that CA mainly acted on the viral particles or influenced the early stages of SFTSV infection, although it could act on the host cells to inhibit viral genome replication.
