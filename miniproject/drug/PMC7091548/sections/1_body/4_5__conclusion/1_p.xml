Of great importance to public health is the control strategy that will help eradicate the diseases. Given that availability of resources is always a factor to consider when implementing control strategies, it is paramount to have a strategy with maximum benefit. From the results of this study, with the implementation of prevention measures only, which include and not limited to social distancing, vaccination, curbing mutation and reassortment, and curbing interspecies movement of the influenza virus, influenza pneumonia coinfection can be eradicated from a given population. Compared to the other control strategies investigated and discussed in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4.1">Section 4.1</xref>, these preventive control strategies are more effective in curbing the spread of influenza pneumonia coinfection; hence, the public health sector and other stake holders could apply them to eradicate the coinfection within a given population.
