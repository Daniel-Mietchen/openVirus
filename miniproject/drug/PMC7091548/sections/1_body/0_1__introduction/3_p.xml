<p>Emergence of drug resistance, which has become a global concern, complicates influenza pneumonia coinfection even more. Drug resistance refers to the ability of disease-causing agents to resist the effects of drugs, thereby making the conventional treatment procedure ineffective. This leads to persistence of infections in the body, hence increasing the risk of spread to other individuals [

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The evolution of drug resistance is accelerated by overuse and misuse of antimicrobials, inappropriate use of antimicrobials, subtherapeutic dosing, and patient noncompliance with the recommended course of treatment [

There are two classes of antiviral drugs that are approved to treat influenza infections; these are M2 ion-channel inhibitors and neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors. However, due to antiviral drug resistance in influenza virus, neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors are the only class of antiinfluenza drugs currently in use as most of the circulating influenza viruses have acquired resistance to M2 ion-channel inhibitors [

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, many circulating influenza viruses have also acquired resistance to neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors [

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] raising an alarm in the health sector. Drug resistance continues to threaten effective prevention and treatment of influenza pneumonia coinfection. In addition, the cost of health care for patients with resistant infections is much higher than care for patients with nonresistant infections especially due to longer duration of illness.
