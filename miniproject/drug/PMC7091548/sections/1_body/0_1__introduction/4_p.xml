<p>Strategies such as vaccination, isolation, and treatment among others are necessary in order to curb the spread of various infectious diseases. However, if they are not administered at the right time and in the right amount, curtailing the spread of the infectious diseases remains a difficult task. The application of optimal control is therefore very vital since it is a necessary tool in making decisions of the viable control strategies to be employed in eradicating diseases. Optimal control theory has been applied in the study of influenza, for instance, in [

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and in the study of pneumonia, for instance, in [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Given that influenza pneumonia coinfection is more disastrous than either of the single infections alone, this paper seeks to investigate optimal control strategies for the influenza pneumonia coinfection and in the emergence of antiviral resistance.
