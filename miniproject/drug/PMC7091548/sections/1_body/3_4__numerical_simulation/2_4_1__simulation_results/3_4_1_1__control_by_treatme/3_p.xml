<p>Without any controls, it can be observed from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> that the number of individuals coinfected with resistant influenza and pneumonia increases initially and then decreases slowly but not to zero. With the treatment control strategies in place, the number of the infected individuals is lower but not significant and does not decrease to zero by day 30. This shows that use of treatment alone as a control strategy is not effective in curbing the spread of influenza pneumonia coinfection. As explained in details in [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], treatment is often rendered ineffective because it is not always possible to administer the drugs at the right time and the diagnosis of the coinfection can be challenging because of timing of sample collection and false negative results when viruses replicate in the lower respiratory tract. In addition, treatment often aggravates development of resistance.
