<p id="Par7">Famciclovir (the diacetyl ester of 6-deoxy-penciclovir) is the oral prodrug of acyclovir with the improved bioavailability which, following oral administration, gets rapidly converted to its active metabolite penciclovir by di-deacetylation and oxidation. However, the pharmacokinetics of penciclovir and famciclovir in cats appears to be nonlinear (saturable) and absorption variable compared to other species. This is supported by the observation that administration of the same doses of famciclovir to cats and other species resulted in much lower plasma concentrations and longer time required to reach peak plasma concentrations in cats (Thomasy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2007</xref>). Thus, limited famciclovir metabolism stems from deficiency of hepatic aldehyde oxidase enzyme in cats, which converts famciclovir to its active form (Dick et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>). Even though famciclovir has to be administered in high oral doses to develop adequate plasma concentrations in cats, it seems to be well tolerated and successful in the treatment of FHV-1-associated conjunctivitis (Thomasy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2007</xref>; Malik et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2009</xref>; Thomasy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2012</xref>). Due to saturable metabolism, oral administration of both 40 and 90 mg famciclovir/kg to cats resulted in equivalent serum and tear penciclovir concentrations, implying that 40Â mg/kg is equally effective against FHV-1 as the higher dose (Thomasy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2012</xref>). In rats and dogs, famciclovir absorption and metabolism appear to be similar to those previously reported in people, despite the observed slower conversion of famciclovir to penciclovir in both species (Filer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1994</xref>).
