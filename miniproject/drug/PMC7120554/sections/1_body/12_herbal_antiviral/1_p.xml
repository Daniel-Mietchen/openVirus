 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic> has been in use for over 20Â years in Japan for treatment of hepatitis. Its dried and processed root 
 <italic>licorice</italic> has a unique odour and sweet taste. Various studies have investigated the pharmacological activity of licorice against viral hepatitis. A randomized controlled trial conducted on 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic> derived compound glycyrrhizin and its derivatives demonstrated diminished hepatocellular damage in chronic hepatitis B and C (Fiore et al.

 <italic>Caesalpinia pulcherrima</italic> Swartz (Leguminosae) is a common medicinal plant in Taiwan. Its flower contains a number of metabolites like lupeol, lupeol acetate, myricetin, quercetin and rutin. Quercetin has been reported to have activity against bacteria, fungi and viruses [human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), poliovirus, herpes simplex virus (HSV)], indicating that it can be a potential antibiotic. Furthermore, rutin has also been stated to inhibit replication of parasites, bacteria, fungi and viruses (rotavirus and HSV) (Chiang et al.

 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> is widely used traditionally against a number of infections. A number of compounds have been reportedly found from 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> including monoterpenoids (carvone, cineole, fenchone, geraniol, linalool, myrcene and thujone), sesquiterpenoids (caryophyllene and farnesol), triterpenoid (ursolic acid) and flavonoid (apigenin). In particular, ursolic acid was shown to have inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as well as tumour growth (Chiang et al.
