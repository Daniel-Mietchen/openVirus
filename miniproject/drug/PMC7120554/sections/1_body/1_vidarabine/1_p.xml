<p id="Par4">Vidarabine (9-d-arabinofuranosyl adenine) was the first antiviral agent licensed for systemic treatment of herpes viral infections in humans (Fenner et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2014</xref>). It is an adenosine analogue that is converted by cellular enzymes to its active intracellular derivate, vidarabine triphosphate. Obtained triphosphate form further acts as competitive inhibitor of both viral and host DNA polymerase, where viral enzymes are much more susceptible to the drug than that of the host cell (Sykes 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2013</xref>; Schaechter 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2010</xref>). However, independence on viral thymidine kinase-mediated phosphorylation results in greater host cell toxicity (Sykes 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2013</xref>). It is used as a topical treatment for feline herpes keratitis, albeit in vitro studies have shown it to be less potent against feline herpesviruses than trifluridine and idoxuridine (Nasisse 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">1990</xref>). In vitro activity has also been demonstrated against feline end equine rhinopneumonitis (Ayisi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1980</xref>). Five to six times daily administration as a 3% ophthalmic ointment was reported to be well tolerated by cats and effective in the treatment of feline keratoconjunctivitis sicca. It has also been reported to be effective against idoxuridine-resistant strains (Sykes
