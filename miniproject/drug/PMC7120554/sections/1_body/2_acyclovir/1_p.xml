<p id="Par5">Acyclovir (acycloguanosine) is an acyclic analogue of the purine nucleoside deoxyguanosine that has been widely used to treat herpesvirus family infections (Sykes and Papich 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2013</xref>; Perazella and Shirali 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2014</xref>). The activation involves phosphorylation of the drug firstly by virus-encoded thymidine kinase enzymes into monophosphate form, followed by further phosphorylation to triphosphates by host cell enzymes (Sykes and Papich 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2013</xref>). Acyclovir triphosphate is a better substrate to viral than host DNA polymerase, resulting in its concentration in infected cells. Due to the lack of 3′-hydroxyl group, the drug inhibits viral DNA polymerase enzyme, as upon its incorporation further DNA chain elongation is disabled (Sykes and Papich 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2013</xref>; Salvaggio and Gnann 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2017</xref>). Hence, as a therapeutic, it is mostly used to treat DNA virus infections, in particular herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 and varicella-zoster virus (Salvaggio and Gnann 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2017</xref>). In animal medicine, it has been primarily used against feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) infections, but not as efficiently as against the same human virus in vitro, which is related to its low oral bioavailability in cats (Maggs and Clarke 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2004</xref>; Gaskell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2007</xref>; Nasisse et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">1989</xref>). The acyclovir prodrug valacyclovir shows better pharmacokinetic properties in terms of its enhanced bioavailability, resulting in faster absorption after oral administration upon which it gets rapidly metabolized to acyclovir. Acyclovir and entecavir had the ability to block nucleic acid synthesis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">22.1</xref>). However, administration of valacyclovir as well as subsequent increased plasma acyclovir concentrations has been associated with adverse effects, such as nephrotoxicity, myelosuppression and renal and hepatic necrosis, and yet was not effective against FHV-1 infection (Nasisse et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">1989</xref>). These findings suggest systemic administration of neither acyclovir nor valacyclovir is recommended for treatment of herpesvirus infections in cats. Ganciclovir, another purine nucleoside analogue that resembles acyclovir and is widely used to treat cytomegalovirus infections in human medicine, has been shown to be more effective against FHV-1 in vitro, but unfortunately there is lack of data on its efficacy and safety in animals (Sykes 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2013</xref>). On the other hand, topical acyclovir treatment was shown to be effective against FHV-1 conjunctivitis and keratitis when applied at least 5 times a day and did not produce toxic effects (Williams et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2005</xref>). Apart from cats, the existing studies provide data on acyclovir treatment in horses, where intravenous administration resulted in 9,6-hour half-life, contrary to very low oral absorption (&lt; 3%) (Williams et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2005</xref>; Riviere and Papich 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2013</xref>). It has therefore been suggested that IV treatment could be administered twice daily for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) (Riviere and Papich 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2013</xref>). In birds, oral treatment with 120 mg/kg of acyclovir every 12 h has been shown as the minimum dose necessary to maintain concentrations that exhibit antiviral effect in pheasants (Rush et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2001</xref>). Studies in dogs report oral absorption of acyclovir of 80–90%, but it becomes saturated at high doses (de Miranda et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1981</xref>).
