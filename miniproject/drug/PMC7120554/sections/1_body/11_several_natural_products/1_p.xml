<p id="Par14">The world has benefited from the phenomenal discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1928 and its development in the 1940s by Chain, Florey, Heatley and Abraham at Oxford. Similarly, the 1940s invention of important streptomycete products by Waksman, Woodruff, Schatz and Lechevalier at Rutgers University has resulted in the selective action of antibiotics against pathogenic bacteria and fungi. Ever since the invention of penicillin, microbes have played a very significant role in the discovery of newer natural product-based drugs. Currently, over 23,000 active compounds of microbial origin including antimicrobials, antivirals and cytotoxic and immunosuppressive compounds, of which 42% are made by fungi and 32% by filamentous bacteria, the actinomycetes, are available (Demain

Nevertheless, its immunosuppressive and calcineurin-related side effects have made it impossible for use as an antiviral agent. Therefore, continued search for structurally related cyclosporin analogues with minimal immunosuppressive activity and strong cyclophilin inhibitory action resulted in its derivative NIM 811 73. On the contrary, NIM 811 73 had 1700 times less immunosuppressive activities than cyclosporin 72 with a lesser toxicity profile and has demonstrated to possess anti-HIV and HCV activity. NIM 811 73 has passed evaluation in Phase I trial for the treatment of HCV (Butler

Even though majority of natural products have been produced from terrestrial environments, marine organisms have also contributed quite a large number of bioactive compounds. Between 2000 and 2003, about 129 bioactive compounds have been isolated from marine microbes only. Various compounds with anticancer, antibacterial, antiviral, immunomodulatory and protease-inhibition activities have been isolated from marine cyanobacteria. Marketed marine products include cytarabine (Cytosar) for non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma, the antiviral vidarabine (Vira-A), ziconotide (Prialt) and trabectedin (Yondelis) (Demain
