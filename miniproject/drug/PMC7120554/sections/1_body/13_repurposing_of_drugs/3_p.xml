<p id="Par18">Antiviral drugs have been tested for various viral diseases of animals. Antiviral therapy has been developed against a number of RNA viral infections in livestock. First among them, against foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), involves vaccine that contains an inactivated whole-virus antigen. However, since vaccinated animals cannot be differentiated from the infected ones, the vaccine is not useful in eliminating FMD outbreaks from previously disease-free countries. Hence, interferons (IFNs) have emerged as another treatment agent, including IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-γ, which are used both individually and synergistically. IFN-γ has been described to have several targets that possess antiviral properties, such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and inducible nitric oxide synthase (Moraes et al.

An aminothiophenecarboxylic acid derivative named compound 003 (C003) and its derivative compound 052 (C052) have been identified as virostatic molecules against BTV. They exert their effect by inhibiting BTV-induced apoptosis via inhibition of caspase-3/caspase-7 activation and inhibition of host autophagy activation (Gu et al.

Furthermore, feline herpes virus type 1 (FHV-1) is a common cause of various diseases in cats, such as ocular surface disease, respiratory disease, dermatitis and potentially intraocular disease. A number of antiviral agents have been described against the virus, but the most effective antiviral therapies are the ones that target viral proteins involved in DNA synthesis, many of which have been used against closely related human herpes simplex virus type 1. For example, nucleoside and nucleotide analogues have been reported for topical administration, such as vidarabine that affects DNA polymerase and subsequently disrupts DNA synthesis, trifluridine which acts as a fluorinated nucleoside analogue of thymidine and cidofovir which is a cytosine analogue acting on two host-mediated phosphorylation steps (Thomasy and Maggs

Purine analogues and their oral prodrugs have also been described as well as other antiviral drugs, such as foscarnet that inhibits pyrophosphate binding site on viral DNA polymerases, while numerous novel compounds have been investigated against FHV-1 including siRNAs which target the FHV-1 glycoprotein D (gD) alone or jointly with DNA polymerase genes (Wilkes and Kania

To conclude with, equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) infection causes outbreak of respiratory and various neurological diseases in horses, against which acyclovir and valacyclovir are the most common drugs, but also IFN targeting IFNGR complex as a key mediator of virus-specific cellular immunity (Poelaert et al.
